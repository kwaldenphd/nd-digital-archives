Reader Applauds Ernie Pook 
Dear Editor, 
As an avid fan of Lynda Barry's "Ernie Pook's Comeek", I have to reply to Bradley P. Luetkenhaus' s criticism ofit, and defend its place in Scholastic. Barry's strip reflects her poignant insight into human na­ture. She presents sophisticated, humorous slices of life of her young characters, invok­ing nostalgia through her use of universal childhood themes. Through these portrayals of everyday events, she reveals rare percep­tion and talent. Barry's Com eek is different, but this is what makes it so endearing.

Week in Distortion/ Mike Keegan 
Loo 

No Further 
No inspiration from the corner bar, but distortion is found within...the mind, that is 
I n a tired, old bar in Michigan on a cold Sunday night I sat in front of a pitcher of golden creativity, amidst the tension of a ordinary shuffleboard match and next to an off-duty bartender who turned to me and said, "Are you on yo1_1r way to Australia? I have friends in Sydney." There was nothing special about the night, except maybe the nomad from Rhode Island who was searching for the meaning of life in the bottom of an empty glass. He told me that one time long ago in a bar he thought that he found life's mean­ing in a plastic cup. But, upon further inspection, it was only a fly who had died trying itself to find the meaning of its exis­tence. The nomad joked, "At least he died happy." I was there fora reason, unlike the other souls who were there because there were addicted to the atmosphere. I needed a story. Actually, I needed something bigger than a story, I needed a "Week in Distor­tion." I thought to myself, as the evening faded toward dawn, that in this dark, lonely bar in Michigan I had found the perfect, distorted place for the distorted story. So I waited, and waited, and waited, and lost a game of shuffleboard, and waited, and waited, and waited some more, until, at the point ofdespair, a dark-haired, shaggy­bearded musician named Thaddeus Zonker walked into the bar. As he slowly ap­proached the bar, I poured myself a glass of liquid courage and prepared. He leaned over my shoulder and ordered a shot of whiskey, his twenty second of the evening, and said, "You know, the more people I meet, the more I like my dog." With that, he slammed the whiskey, turned and walked back into the darkness from whence he had come, leaving me to contemplate the rami­fications of such a statement. 
After a millisecond of thought, I pro­ceeded to ask others what Zonker had meant. A balding, toothless man gummed, "THSPPST WHST SIN ST." I said I didn't really agree with him and walked away. I asked the off-duty bartender and he stut­tered, "Only in America, Roberta, only in America." I could see his point and thanked him for the insight. As I thought for another millisecond about what Zonker had said, I realized finally what he must have meant. 
So I packed up my pad and pen, threw down that last shot of beer, and proceeded to leave. The American dream no longer consisted of a wife, a house with a white­picket fence and 1.8 children. Today's America was one of violence, drinking and horror films. I knew then that I was looking in the wrong place for a "Week in Distor­tion," for distorted views are not found in solitary bars on the edge of sleeping towns amid nomads who'd rather drink than con­verse. No, the small town story died when Charles Kuralt ran out ofgas somewhere in the Florida Everglades while searching for the boy who never had a hangn~I. 
To find something distorted, I had to leave this facade of reality, this bar of the imaginary, and find the wizard of today's true intelligentsia. 
When I got back home, I turned on the television and there he was, Geraldo Domer saying, "On the next show, Bill the Cat and Dan Quayle will debate whetheror not Salman Rushdie is truly Satan and whether or not we should send him to hell." My interest peaked, I turned the channel and found a pair of lips with smiling white teeth. Then, Morton Domer, Geralda's long lost brother, with a cigarette as his lance, said, "And that concludes our show. I'd like to thank our guests, Fonner Grand Wizard, David Duke, and Gene Hackman who discussed whether or not $5.2 million is enough incentive or should Khomeini double the bounty?" 
I turned off the television, my mind was exhausted from the mental work-out. I thought back to what Zonker had said ear­lier that evening, "The more people I meet, the more I like my dog." I finally realized that this quote had absolutely nothing to do with anything, and that was what he was trying to get me to see. If you are looking for a moral in this story, don't strain your­self, I'll tell you what it is. Everything that is distorted in life is based on empty false­hood. So just remember, my week wasn't distorted, yours was!!!!!! II 


On Other Campuses 
Tenure Talks 

Professors abandon their students for the real purpose of teaching: prestige. 

EDITED BY MARK FLAHARTY
Professors are lazy bums. That's the word according to Charles Sykes' new book "Profscam" on what is wrong with colleges nowadays. An article in the College Press 
Service reports that Sykes states that one ofthe main problems with our upper level educational institutions is that "professors have been made fat and complacent by tenure which frees them to abandon their students in favor of chasing money and prestige through office politicking, useless research and big grants." 
Alum donates money to party hearty. Under usual circumstances alumni make large contributions to their alma mater to endow professorships, help build buildings, recruit minorities or maybe even reward football coaches (legally, of course). At Roosevelt University near Chicago, however, an alumnus gave a large cash gift aimed at helping students have a good time. The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that Marvin Moss' estate donated $2.75 million to the school, as his last will and testament wished, with the stipulation that it must be used to help the students "party hearty." The university will use the money to build a gymnasium and fitness center, renovate student lounges and create a student activities fund, said Rooselvelt president, Theodore Gross. 
Prank(ster) kills rooster in Sex-Ed class. With obviously nothing better to do, a prankster disrupted a human sexuality class at the University of Washington last month by throwing a live rooster from the classroom balcony and yelling suggestive sexual remarks at the professor. The professor, Lois McDermott, said that similar incidents have occured each time she has taught the class. The Breeze (James Madison University's daily newspaper) reported that McDermott was visibly upset and stated that she ·should have known that the prank was drawing near. Just before the day's class a student approached her and handed her a plate with a banana and two oranges arranged in a conspicuous manner announcing "I just wanted you to have this" before leaving the room. And as for the 

rooster, it was killed when it hit the floor. 
The ever shrinking welcome mat. Whatever happened to spring break in Ft. Lauderdale with 400,000 other screaming, party­hungry, wild students? Well, it is almost nonexistent nowadays. Spring break hasn't been what it used to be during the last three years. There have been terrible riots in Palm Springs and South Padre Island, a string of deaths in Daytona Beach and a rigid crackdown on public drinking in Ft. Lauderdale. As a result, the usual "hot spots" for fun and sun are laying down the law and cutting back on the size of the welcome mat_ they offer. The College Press Service reported these crackdowns in Ft. Lauderdale arid Pa/m Springs have helped to drive students elsewhere. Only about 20,000 students are expected in Lauderdale this year and only about 10,000­15,000 are expected in Palm Springs. Neither city is making any special efforts to attract the students either. Daytona Beach is gladly trying to fill the void and attract the often unruly students. South Padre Island and even Mexico are becoming increasingly popular. 

A truly trashy class. In an effort to help "clean-up America" a la "Woodsy the Owl," a faculty member at the College ofWilliam and Mary has come up with a very novel idea. In order to attend Professor Jon Kemer's Social Problems class, students are required to bring in, and dispose of, a piece of garbage, the National On­Campus Report revealed. And it is working. The students' recep­tiveness to the idea has made ita success. Many say it's changed the way they think about refuse. Kerner notes that making students think, not cleaning up, is the whole idea. 
And did you know that horses prefer light over dark? Do you care? Well two Cornell University physiologists do. They tested the preferences (towards light) of mares kept in a windowless barn. The two scientists, who reported their results in the Journal of Animal Science, say that through their experiment they discovered that the horses preferred an environment with light and the company of other horses.

Buy it or bury it, but don't decide before reading Tadrowski's picks 
Well, it's time for another article, and to be honest, I'm tired of having to find a theme such as Milwaukee underground club scene or Irish funkarama for each article. Did Shakespeare have a theme when he wrote The Merchant ofVenice? Did Beckett have a theme when he wrote Waiting for Godot? Of course not So this is my themeless re­view and true to the spirit of my gods Gene Siske! and Roger Ebert, I'm going to give each album I review a star rating. For those of you holding your breath, the scale is ­*****(Masterpiece), ****(Excellent), ***(Good), *:!<(Fair), and *(Manure): American Music Club -Ca[Jornia (**** 1/2) A terrific new album by this San Francisco band that even improves upon their last album, Engine. It's an ambitious chronicle of despair and emptiness that makes doom-mongers The Cure resemble Disney tunes. Leader Mark Eitzel wraps his stories of lonely people lost in cocktail lounges and parking lots in pillows ofacous­tic guitars and drained vocals. But at any moment, his songs beautifully explode with feedback and pain. ' .Julian Cope -My Nation Underground (*) Bury this. Quick. The Wolfgang Press-Bird Wood Cage (***) ProducedbythehipFlood, this record is a huge improvement over past Press rec­ords which have always sounded better in theory. Their brand of gothic-funk (Bauhaus meets Prince) truly flowers here with some great grooves and instrumenta­tion. Although monotonous for a complete album, dance tracks such as "King ofSoul", "Kansas" and "Shut That Door" are well 
worth the price. Plus, the lyrics are pleas­
antly bizarre. 

Throwing Muses-Hunkpapa (*****) 
The Muses are by far the best American 
band today and they can turn out awesome 
albums like this one in their sleep. With a 
suprising new almost-commercial sound, 
they still haven'tlostanyoftheiredge. Old­
Muse style thrashers like "Mania" and 
"Bea" are still present but songs like 
"Dizzy" and "Devil's Roof' could be 
MTV-faves with their catchy choruses. 
The lyrics even make sense for once! Buy 
the CD -it contains two extra tracks ("Santa 
Claus" and "Say Goodbye") which deserve 
to be on the album. 
Figures on a Beach -Figures on a 
Beach (***) Harmless dance music for 
harmless people. An updated dance ver­
sion of 70s hit "You Ain't Seen Nothing 
Yet" is an obvious ploy for commercial 
success that will probably succeed, but the 
Figures are capable of much more. "Ac­
cidently 4th Street (Gloria)" and "Don't 
Make Me Nervous" are good INXS-style 
rockers, but some tracks seem to be fillers 
dressed up in the latest production tricks. 
Elvis Costello -Spike(*** 1/2) Similar in style to Elvis' last two albums, Costello fans will love this album while others yawn. Luckily, I'm a Costello fan. With help from -Paul McCartney and Chrissie Hynde, Elvis pulls off his usual collage of extended word-play and striking chord changes with obnoxious flair. His arrangements have grown increasingly strange and at times you would think you were hearing the new Tom Waits if it weren't for Costello's dis­tinctive throaty voice and lyrics. Piano 
jazz, Beatles pop, Irish, folk, psychedelic nursery rhymes, horn instrumentals and straight rock all make their appearances. 
Ultra Vivid Scene -Ultra Vivid Scene 
(**) A new 4AD record with "college 
radio" written all over it, this record is the 
work of New Yorker Kurt Ralske who 
wrote, produced, engineered, and played 
everything on the album. With that in mind, 
you have to give him credit. Though some 
tracks ("The Whore ofGod", "Crash", "She 
Screamed") are striking, some are highly 
derivative since we've heard them done 
before on Jesus and the Mary Chain records. 
A major problem is that it sounds interesting 
on firstJistening, but grows stale much too 
fast. 
Jane's Addiction -Nothing' s Shocking (**** 1/2) When I bought this album, I wasn't quite prepared for how great this California band is. Sure, Village Voice liked them. Sure, they've gotten a mountain heap of hype from Rolling Stone and Spin, but I wasn't expecting this mind-numbing mix of Led Zeppelin and Velvet Under­ground. Almost every track rocks -and with fury and passion seldom this sincere in today's scene. "Ted, Just Admit It..." is an exploration of media-violence (the Ted in the song title is mass murderer Ted Bundy whose voice is used in the funky opening); "Had a Dad" explains singer Perry Farrel's desertion by his father; and "Ocean Size" has such cool riffs, I don't care what it's -about. Even the two mellow songs, the psychedelic "Summertime Rolls" and folky "Jane Says" are just as good. Also, worth it for the cover. Ill

Dan Fahey, ajunior from Carroll Hall, has chosen the unique position ofrunning for student body king. He has chosen several ministers to fill the role ofstudent body vice-president. Chris Fillio, a junior from Carroll, will serve as minster ofjustice. Dave Brockway, another junior from Carroll, will serve as minister oftruth. Marty DeBenedictis, ajuniorfrom Carroll, will hold office as the ministerofimagination. John Setzer, a junior from Stanford, will act as the minister ofpeace. All ofthese men have been involved heavily in social concerns. 
What is the main goal you would like to achieve as student body king and ministers? 
FAHEY: People on campus don't really know what's going on with the student government. We don't want to come out with any concrete things that we want to talk about because I've talked to people who have told me that a lot ofthe things that candidates come up with year after year are unrealistic, thatthis university won 'tgo for them. We're thinking more on the local level. We want to do things students really want. We'd like to organize road trips to other colleges. A lot of people would like to road trip out of here. 
We'd also like peace on campus -a kinder, gentler Notre Dame. Also, look at the ministers: truth, peace, imagination, justice and the administer of love. We'd like to get the student body more involved in social concerns especially since this is a Catholic university. 
There are those who take things very seriously. It's wrong to take things too seriously. I'll listen to what the senate has to say. We live in Carroll hall so most ofus are cut off from the general goings-on of the cam pus. I don't want to say what everyone else says about getting in contact with the student body, but to some extent that's true. I just feel -what does the student body expect student government to do? We're not quite sure what the limit of our powers is because we are subject to the university. 
DeBENEDICTIS: There are people who are just gung-ho who just live and breathe student government. That's a little too serious. It's serious in that they are serious goals, butjust have to berelaxed. There are those who look at the sheets and think about them. Those people are like us. We rise from that pool. What is this student government thing? What do they do? Well, we're going to find out about it and we're going to do it. And we're going to find out for the doubters because we come from that crowd. And we will have a full report at the end of the year whether student government is a worthwhile venture. 
What particular strengths would you bring to office? 
FAHEY: Imagination, justice, peace, love, truth. We're all pretty nice guys. We've gone to all the same meetings, we're doing this interview. We're obviously dedicated and we're true about it, too. I think a lot of students here find the university oppressive. We want to break the stereotype ofthe president. We're doing it for the interest ofit, not for selfish reasons. Talking from a Hobbesian point of view, I could have no weaknesses because I'm sovereign. DeBENEDICTIS: Everybody submits their will to the king. He has pretty much no weaknesses. SETZER: Although you can't put down you were Student Body King.

How do you perceive'your role in dealing with the board of trustees? 
FAHEY: What are they like? I think the trustees would be pretty resistant to change also. We would have to work with them to show them that we need time to move forward, to bring ourselves in line with the other Catholic schools in this country. I would like to look at the reports and see what they deal with and then decide. 
What do you see as the biggest problem with on-campus living and how would you alleviate it? FAHEY: I think the alcohol policy is wrong, but I don't think we're going to be able to change that. Social tensions are strong. I sense the university is going for a much more o en atmos here with eo le

very much. I think it is necessary for easing the tensions. They tell you they are preparing you for life after Notre Dame, but I know guys who comeoutwith trouble relating to girls. A lot ofpeople I've talked to from other colleges have said they liked it. We're well-travelled to other schools and we w~nt to preserve the Catholic nature of the university. Villanova, a Catholic school, just announced that next year they are starting an experiment on going co-ed. We should really be setting precedent ifwe are indeed the number-one Catholic school in the country. 
Are you in favor of implementing a 24-hour lounge and, ifso, how do you propose to do it? FAHEY: I'vebeen told by sources inside the student government that getting one in Lafortune is impossible. We need someplace where people who want to study late at night can go. I have to look into the issues relatively more about the money and stuff. But if it's finan­cially unfeasible we may just have to let it go. DeBENEDICTIS: If we are ever going to get a 24-hour lounge under anyone, it's going to have to be through good communication with the university. You have to show to them that the students want it and need it. · SETZER: I spent many days in the Oak Room when it was open, but it wasn't well supported. The student body said they didn't want it. It's being used now as a political ploy which shows how people are looking for a reaction. They're trying to make an issue out ofthe 24­hour lounge when the student body already said no. 
What are your feelings about the honor code? 
FAHEY: I think it's good. We stand for virtue. I don't know necessarily about turning in a fellow classmate. I don't see that as 
know and I don't like, butI won't tum in my friends." You don't want to be biased. 
Do you have any specific proposals for reducing off-campus crime? 
SETZER: There have been a few steps in the past as far as making Notre Dame part of the community. There have been certain social events that we have participated in that involved working with the community and letting them know that here there are students that actually care. FAHEY: We have to get students who live off campus to show they care for relations with the community. With crime, I think the students should be protected more. With all the assaults, it's just ridiculous what's going on down there. But, I was just at Ohio State last weekend and there are a lot ofracial tensions down there. People get jumped all the time. I think we need to work through it peacefully with the police department. II 




Bob McTamaney, a junior government major from Westfield, New Jersey, and Pat Russell, a government major from Eugene, Oregon, are running/or student body president and student body vice-president, respectively. They have been active in the Hall President's Council as the co-presidents ofFlanner Hall. McTamaney has, in addition, been the service commissioner ofthe Student Union Board. 

What is the main goal you would like to achieve as student body president and student body vice-president? McTAMANEY: We're basing our campaign on basically three themes: communication, coordination, and direction or definition. We want to do a computerized bulletin board in LaFortune. There's so much this and that about publicity on campus -obviously student government itself isn't a programming body -but with SUB and all the other various clubs and organizations on campus, we think that this bulletin board would serve a purpose for reaching the student body and communicating to the student body and also coordinating the various campus groups and SUB and ihe classes. Doing that would serve two of our main functions. RUSSELL: Primarily we're looking at coordination. Especially HPC, the senate, SUB and student government to increase commu­nication among the bodies and to make them more efficient. 
What particular strengths would you bring to office? McTAMANEY: We work well together. In Flanner, as co-presi­dents, we got the job done and we did itwithout too much wasted time. We do work quite well together and we know each other very well, and we know when someone's babbling and not quite making sense and it's a bad idea and we're not afraid to tell each other. 
How· do you perceive your role of dealing with the board of trustees? 
McTAMANEY: As far as through student body president and vice­president, through the trustee reports and whatnot, we have to be the word of the students to the trustees. RUSSELL: Through HPC we have worked on reports for the board of trustees and questionnaires. The feedback we've gotten is that the board of trustees is an important rapport and we definitely have a working relationship with them. 
What do you see as the biggest problem with on-campus living 
and how would you alleviate it? 
McTA MANEY: I'veworked with SUB as the services commissioner for the year and it's really tough to find things that the students want to do. They love the hypnotist and whatnot but as far as social alternatives it's really difficult to get things planned that the students want to do. There is so much wasted effort into things that so few students do want to do so I think the student body would most likely be most concerned about social alternatives without alcohol. RUSSELL: We've proposed a coffee house with an open mike for bands and such. We're trying to find a space around this [the LaFor­tune] area -maybe the band building -not a big building but just a place where you could fit, just very simple. There's a bit of stagna­

tion, at least I think, or I've seen from the student with the so­cial life on campus. ! We have An Tosta!, but we need some­thing else, other than An Tosta!. All any­body can seem to

year." It's just trying I to duplicate the same ideas. I'm not trying to be negative about the ideas because they've come off very weII but we could use new, fresh ideas. 
What do you think about co-residential housing? 
McTAMANEY: I'm definitely for it Ob­viously with the op­tion to incoming freshmen and stu­dents already on cam­pus. An editorial in the Observer said that co-residential hous­ing would strengthen male-female relation­ships and I couldn't agree with that more. Just to give us a chance to show you 

that we are mature. We're 18-to 22-year-old people and I'm defi­nitely for it as an option for students and I think that as many students that want it should be able to do it RUSSELL: However, at present, I don't think the student govern­ment that we have is a strong enough body to bring about the pressure on the university to bring about co-residential housing. It seems that we're in a stage where all we can do is distribute surveys. We've got to be more important. 
Are you in favor ofimplementing a 24-hour lounge and, ifso, how 
do you propose to do it? RUSSELL: I'm not sure that there's a need for a 24-hour lounge,, We definitely need something that's late night; but, if the Oak Room is the 
only place·where we can get it, then that's just not going to work. I don't know if from four to six in the morning we need a place to go. If you really need to study, usually you can find a classroom and stay there late or maybe we could have greater ,'i access to classrooms. I 
i 
! 
Do you have any specific proposals for reducing off­campus crime? McTAMANEY: I read an article in the Scholastic toward the end of last semester 
and it said that the South Bend Police Department, if you gave them your key, would come and check your house. Nobody knew about that. I couldn't be­lieve it. I think through greater com­munication with the student body, actu­ally, a personalized letter to every off­campus student, in a case like that, it would greatly alleviate the ·problem. We're not 

going to stamp out crime. We can't, but I talked to people off campus and I said, "Hey, why don't you give your keys to the police depart­ment and have them come over and protect the house while you're away?" Even if they don't prevent the crime, at least they'll know to contact the student and what can be done can be done quickly. RUSSELL: We have to let them know their options and, other than that, all we can do is work with community relations. ¦ 



Tom Rask, a junior business management major with a concentration in the Hesburgh program ofpublic service from Portland, Oregon, is runningfor student body president. Melissa Smith, a sophomorefromDallas, Texas, is an English major with a concentration in the Hesburgh program ofpublic service and is running for student body vice-president. Raskhas been involved as a student senator and has been a member ofthe student body budget commillee and the student body undergraduate/graduate committee. Smith is the student government executive coordinator for special projects and is the chairperson ofthe Howard Hall judicial council. 
What is the main goal you would like to achieve as student body 
president and student body vke-president? 
RASK: Our theme is unity with diversity and we want to exemplify this in that Melissa and I are very unified and we want to unify the campus.But everyone has diverse concerns so our major emphasis is on, I hate to say "everything", but there are a lot of important things to tackle. I don't think we can say that there is one specific thing that we want to deal with. That's segregating the market People have different concerns and diversity is part of our theme. Being diverse means looking at minority ~oncerns, looking at off-campus students, looking at faculty interaction. It's not just the students that live on campus. It's everyone. We want to tackle all of the problems that are associated with Notre Dame. Wedon't want to leave anything out and we're not going to stop until we try to at least explore each of them. SMITH: The entire theme -"Let's do it, unity with diversity" ties in with having the whole campus really feeling compelled that this is our university and we should all make an effort to change things. It's not just our place as student government representatives or SUB repre­sentatives or HPC. The students need to interact and voice their concerns. That's where we'd like to see the students join with us and that's part ofour"Let's do it" as a collective group and our unity with diversity. We're all unified but we have diverse concerns on this campus. Ifwe combine our efforts and then unify, then we can tackle some of these problems that we're all concerned about. 
What particular strengths would you bring to office? RASK: Patience -I really think everyone deserves a chance to have their say. I am open-minded. So~etimes I come across as someone who is willing to talk a lot and not listen but I think that listening is important. To tackle diverse issues, you have to listen to what the students do. I think communication is important; and I think that's one of my better qualities. I like to let you know what I'm doing and be as straight-forward as possible. 
Finally, I think one ofmy better strengths is organization. Melissa and I feel that organized, you can accomplish anything. Ifyou tackle a problem head on and you 're organized about it, then you'll give it a good fight. SMITH: I think one thing that I would bring to the ticket is persona­bility. The sense that everyone is a part of this campus. As student body president and vice-president, you have to really have afoel for everyone on campus -not just necessarily be voicing your own concerns -but make sure that, with that personability, you can get people to tell you what their real thoughts are and bring them into your representation. I think also I'd have to stress experience. There is a lot to learn, just little ins-and-outs and innuendos that an outsider coming in you have to learn all over again. We wouldn't have to start from scratch. We already have a base to start from and all we have to do is build on it. 
How do you perceive your role of dealing with the board of trustees? RASK: Student input in the form ofareportisgreat. It should not only be presented by students but possibly we should look for student representation on the board of trustees, a student liaison that is permanently assigned a job that will communicate our student issues to the board of trustees. SMITH: To reinforce the recommendations that are made in the board of trustees reports and to make sure that those recommenda-tions that the students worked so hard for in coming up with that report aren't shuffled asidy. To make sure that there's that constant thought that "we have these issues that the students want and they've taken the time Lo make these reports and make these recommendations so we make sure that we consider all of their thoughts." RASK: Part ofreorganization ofthe senate would be to create a board of trustees committee who will follow up the reports and not let them blow away. 

What do you see as the biggest problem with on-campus living and how would you alleviate it? 
RASK: I think it's the lack of coordination and communication. I think that's a major flaw everyone has. I don't know guys in Fisher and why shouldn't I know them? I think each dorm can have its own individual taste but we're all Notre Dame. SMITH: There's a sense ofsecurity and yet when you live on campus thatsecurityalso follows through in that there's the problem that there are a lot of rules that go along with living on campus. The problem with on-campus living is that there are a lot of restri~tions. 

What do you think about co-residential housing? SMITH: I think that it should be an option. Granted, all ofthe students on campus would not live in one themselves but the majority do agree that it should be an option. If Notre Dame is to be a nationally acclaimed university in all aspects of life, we have to represent ourselves as adults and a responsible student body. It seems that there's no reason why the University of Notre Dame should not include that as an option. RASK: Co-residential housing is a prime example of how we think Notre Dame should treat us like adults. We're mature adults and they should treat us like that andco-residentiality is a step in that direction. 
Are you in favor ofimplementinga 24-hour lounge and, ifso, how do you propose to do it? RASK: A new 24-hour computer lounge will be in LaFortune which means two-thirds of the floor has to be 24 hours. Melissa and I have 
put together a bid of under $2000 to secure the other one-third. Let's unify the campus through this issue. SMITH: There was an attempt to have the Oak Room as 24 hours and there were a lot of problems with that. The students don't neces­sarily want a place to eat 24 hours a day. They want a place where they can sit and talk or sit and study. LaFortune is centralized. I think the Oak Room was maybe a little too far from a lot of students who would have otherwise used it as a source for having a 24-hour lounge. 
Do you have any specific proposals for re­ducing off-campus crime? RASK: It is a central problem that on campus students have to deal with also. The plan that we have devised will, I feel, unify the students and at least get at the base of the problem. We need to create a network association made up just of students in the Northeast Neighbor­hood, and unite to fight crime. 
I've got a bid for $400 a month to have a patrol off duty that the association would hire to patrol from 11 to 4 on Friday and Saturday nights. It works out to nine dollars a house for an officer that will be ~ound every minute and a half. Are they going to bust parties? No; they are paid by us to do what we ask them. SMITH: It also protects the general student that is walking. RASK: In student government I would pro­pose to finance the first two months. This year in student government, we spent$7000 on fur­niture. I think we could redistribute that money. Ill

Chris Fri 
on 


Chris Frigon, a sophomore economics and computer applications major from Alumni Hall, is running for district one student senator. He is from Glenview, KY. 
How would you analyze the job that this year's student senate has done? 
FRIGON: The visibility is very low in the student senate. People are asking me what I'm campaigning for, and I have ~o explain what I'm doing. Ifthe senate could raise its visibility and keep in touch with the students, it would do better. There have been advisory councils in the past, but I would take it a step further. I would like to be present at the hall meetings and have a prepared statement to say so that the hall councils and I could get to know one another. I would know about the things that they want me to do right away and get working on it. 
I think one of the best things they did last year was the grade change, because it showed it still was an active organization and had power with the administration. It's obviously still active, but it could be doing a better job. 
What are the main goals you would like to achieve as student senator? 
FRIGON: Establishment of study days would help greatly. I know in my own experience that other schools have a week off or a couple of days. Supposedly we have designated study days of Saturday and Sunday, but that's not enough. 
I would like to re-institute the SYRs in their traditional form. It's 
really hurt the halls and the social life. Sure, it had its bad effects, but 
in the long run I think that it was definitely an asset to the hall, and 
added character to the campus. Taking that away from hall life was 
a big loss. 

The honor code is something that needs to be re-evaluated. Certain questions need to be asked, including whether or not it's practical and whether the honor code is just there to make us look better or help us out 
And the24-hour lounge is a big issue. It's tough to guagestudent response on the issue, but the senate should be able to tell. I think it would be an asset to the school and improve student life. If you have a 24-hour computing center, why not a 24-hour lounge? It'd be a place to hang around, or a place to go after parietals on weekends. 
How well do you know the senate job? 

FRIGON: I've been talking to ( district one senator) Pat Kiernan over the past few weeks, and I really got to know a lot. He's given me his basic view of it, and I feel comfortable with what the job will be like. I don't want to go in there with a preconceived notion ofwhat it's 
all about. I think an asset would be going in there without any type ofidea of basic procedure or any obstacles that I might run into. I want to go in there with a fresh attitude and a fresh mind and not have anything hold me back. Ifthere's something new that I find I can do, or some new way to implement policy, then I want to do it. 
What do you see as specific needs of the district? FRIGON: It's kind ofa weird setup with this district I think, with the addition of the two new dorms, that we should look at the districts and see if they could be realigned. Specifically, the SYR will effect everybody, study days will effect everybody, and the 24-hour lounge will as well. 
Frankly, you have to narrow your agenda and see what's practical and put your time in on those. IfI can get the things through that I've already mentioned, I'd do a lot of good for a greater amount ofpeople rather than just doing something specific for one dorm. But if there is some issue that needs to be looked at, obviously I'd take time to do it. 
How do you plan to generate more input from your constituency and use it in student government? 
FRIGON: I think the advisory council is a good idea, and I'd continue that ifl were elected. But I'd interact more with hall councils and use that more as a forum for ideas and complaints so that any student could come and voice their complaints. A monthy newsletter would be a good thing. 
What do you see as the biggest problem with on-campus living? 
FRIGON: The study days would improve student life a great deal, but I don't see it as an immediate problem. Housing right now is a problem, and the situation has been created where people don't know what their future is going to be in their halls. That's obviously important. 
Do you have any thoughts about combatting crime? 
FRIGON: Safety is definitely a concern off campus,in the St. Louis/ Notre Dame Ave. area, especially coming back late at night. Some­thing needs to be addressed. With the alcohol policy as it is, it seems to be throwing everybody off campus and if everybody's going that ':'ay, it's got to be addressed and the senate has to get goin~n It. Ill 

District 1 

Scott .Murray 
Scott Murray, a junior Holy Cross Hall resident from Norwalk, OH, is running for district one student senator. He is a government and economics major. 
What are some of the main goals you want to achieve as student senator? 
MURRAY: The biggest issue for me is academics. Some things have to be changed. A lot of teachers don't use teacher course evaluations (TCEs) properlyorthey don 'teven use them a tall. I think the students should have some feedback on how they feel about their professors. The other thing is class size. With larger classes, you don't really get as much out ofa class as you should. Another thing is the honor code. I think if we're going to have an honor code, we should make it a genuine honor code and not just a toy for the administration to hold out and say, "look, we have an honor code." But the administration is running it. I still don't see the students having control of it. 
Also, there are a lot of discrepancies with the code. You sign a pledge at the beginning saying that you 're not going to cheat, and then before each test you have to sign another form. I think that's redundant. The other thing is that professors aren't supposed to proctor the tests, but they stay in there and proctor them anyhow. I could see if the professor needed to stay in and answer questions, but if he has TAs, I'm sure that they .could take care of that. 
I would like to see the students and faculty integrate more, because it seems that students go to class and that's the only time they see their professors. They don't really interact as much as they should. One ofmy ideas is a faculty speaker series sponsored by the collegefolfow program where faculty members lecture on specific issues in their areas of specialization. I know that the faculty is tied for time, but I'm sure we could work something out. 
What strengths do you bring into the campaign? 
MURRAY: I'm working on (district one senator) Pat Kiernan's advisory council, and I was business manager for the campus enter­tainment division of the student union board. I've also worked on the Holy Cross Hall council. 
What changes would you like to see in your district? 
MURRAY: There are some physical projects that I would like to see. The walk around St. Mary's Lake, for instance, is terrible. A lot of students in the district have complained about specific problems within the dorms, like the plumbing and the heating and things like that. I'd like to see what I can do about that. I don't know exactly what channels there are, but I'd like to see what I could do. 


MURRAY: I have ideas about communication. i'd like to send out a monthly newsletter keeping the students up to date on what is going on in student government. As I go around campaigning, a lot of people ask me whatthestudentsenatedoes. They have no idea. I think if we kept in touch, they would understand more fully what we want todo. 
Another thing I'd like to do is get radio time to interact with students. They could call up the show and ask questions, and we could tell them what's going on. I also plan to send out surveys. I know that the senate does a full-blown survey of the entire student body, but I'd also like to do surveys on specific issues; for instance, academic issues, teacher course evaluations, etc. 
What do you see as the biggest problem with on-campus living? MURRAY: I think there's a lot of concern about housing and whether students will be allowed to stay on campus. I think that's the biggest issue right now. I'm not really sure what options are open to us, but I don't think they've been explored fully. 
Are you in favor of a 24-hour lounge? MURRAY: In talking to students, they've expressed a lot of interest in a 24-hour lounge. The biggest suggestion has been the basement of LaFortune. If you have a computer lounge there, why not leave the whole floor open? 
What is your stance on all-hall semi-formal dances (SYRs)? 
MURRAY: I think that the 70 percent attendance rule is too high. I also think that the hall should be allowed to determine how many SYRs they want to have per semester. Some halls are capable of more than oneSYR, others aren't. Butl don't think it's the administration's job to tell us how many we're allowed to have. I think that should be left up to the rector, resident assistants and the hall councils. I would do away with the 70 percent rule altogether, and leave that in control of the halls as well. 
Do you want to bring up anything else? 
MURRAY: One more thing that I'd like to bring up is the idea of the student/faculty advisory council. I would like to see a council set up so that specific problems students have with academics-for instance, like the honor code -can be addressed. I think dealing with the fac'&!Y is the best way because they have concerns, too. ¦

District 1 

Jim Neli 
Jim Nelis, a sophomore government major from Elk Grove, IL, is running for district one s/lldent senator. He lives in Keenan Hall. 
How would you analyze the job the student senate has done? NELIS: I feel the most lacking part of it is that the senators did not keep in touch with their constituencies, and that's a big part of their job. They each should know what the students want done. I haven't seen much of a difference between this year and last year. They organized well before the Bush speech to put out those resolutions, but that was about it. 
What are the main goals you would like to achieve as student senator? 
NELIS: My basic platform is student voice in administration policies. Recently there's been an outburst in student opinion about theway the administration is being "parents" to us. They haven'treally consulted the students in terms ofhow they feel about some ofthe policies they make. A perfect exampleofthat was the new housing policy. It seems to me that things like that shouldn't go on. 
I want to form a student opinion committee, one that will deal directly with responses from the students to the administration on policy that the administration makes. That way we'll have student opinion in on the ground floor. 
I haven't really given an extensive list ofpromises, because most ofthe things that I'veseen have always been brought before the board oftrustees. I'velisted three things that I guarantee I will do once I get in. One is to form a studentopinion committee. Another is to find out exactly what's going on with the recommendations made last semes­ter to the board of trustees. We haven't heard anything yet, so that's what I'm wondering about. My third goal is to stay informed ofwhat students think, and to keep them informed of what we're doing through student representatives in the dorms who would report directly to me twice a month. I'd also plan on getting out a newsletter twice a month -at least once a month -to the students in my district. 
I'm going to be visiting all the dorms this week and I'm going to find out exactly what needs to be fixed. I can promise all the things in the world, but once I get in, I need to know what the students want, because that's what's most important anyway. 
What do you see as some potential needs of the district? NELIS: The social life is definitely one of the most important aspects 


of student life that needs to be concentrated on. The idea of them limitingthenumberofSYRsiscompletelyoutrageous. It'soneofthe few real social ideas that students have. The same policy in terms of alcohol would be fine, butthe numbershould be increased.·A.24-hour lounge in LaFortune would be very feasible, and there; s extra student activities money that could be used for security. We definitely need more school-wide social events. I don't have any real ideas now, but once my committee -which will basically be a brainstorming group -gets together we could come up with some. 
What do you see as the biggest problem with on-campus living? NELIS: I think we're lacking in terms ofco-ed housing, which, ifwe had it, would be a very big asset. The study that the student senate did showed that out of the 26 schools that they interviewed, ranging from the University ofPortland to Princeton, all ofthe schools had co­ed housing for at least the past five years. All of them said that it's been one of the best things they've done. It's improved the relation­ships between women and men, and that's one of the things we're lacking. I think if we had that kind of housing it would give e~ch group more respect for the other. 
Two senators stepped down this year, citing various reasons for leaving. Do you think you have a good idea of what the job entails? NELIS: At the rate I'm putting myselfat, I know I'm going to be very busy. I've never had a problem with keeping up with a responsibility that I've put myself to. Once I apply myself, I like to see things done. 
What are your feelings about the honor code? NELIS: I really don't think it's working. I've read all the articles and heard what students are saying, yet I haven't heard of many people being brought before the board for honor code violations. 
My idea would be to scrap it or at least to revise it to a new form -but I really can't think of a form that works. No matter what they do with an honor code, the cheating won't go away. If the students get caught, it's the same penalty whether there is a honor code or not. And I doubt students would tum each other in. Thatdestroys the idea of the Notre Dame family. 
District 2 



ike Gaffney 
Mike Gaffney isa soplwmore government majorfromZahmHall. His hometown is Belle Plaine, Minnesota. 
Please analyze the job the current senate has done. GAFFNEY: Speaking for our own district, I know Brian's done a pretty good job. He's fairly conscientious. He dropped off his promise to keep closer contact with his constituents. He's dropped out ofsenate for personal reasons. I think the senate has done a good job with the resources it has. I have heard some complaints about the current student body president and vice-president not talcing enough iniLiative which kind of hampered some of the things the senate could do with organizations like the Campus Life Council. 
What is the main goal you would like to achieve as a senator? GAFFNEY: My main goal sounds old and it is old. It is to achieve greater communication. Where I'm different from anyone in the past is that I'm going beyond the idea simply to publish newsletters about where their money is going or what the student body, student government or administration is doing. 
What I'd like to do is set up a senate committee with the purpose of taking mail from the students and conducting surveys to get student opinion as wen as provide students with information about what student government or student senate is doing. I think this wiII solve the problem that student input in the administration is not what it should be because students don't have time to form opinions; and this would give students the chance to just send in vague ideas which the committee will go over to format student opinion on the issues that the students write in. 
This would give the student body a chance to contact the admini­stration and get the opinions to the Campus Life Council or the appropriate administrative body. This could make an intermediary to get the channels of communication going. 
What particular strengths would you bring to office? GAFFNEY: I would be totally dedicated to the job. You owe it to your constituency to perform your duties as best you can. My proposed committee would take a great deal of time. I think the committee should be composed of the five senators and the student body vice-president The students themselves don't have the time or aren't volunteering the time. You are; and you have an obligation to the students to do that. 
What do you think would be your weaknesses? GAFFNEY: I don't have much time this year because ofmy academic schedule. I should have more time next year. 
What do you see as specific needs for your district? 
GAFFNEY: We most concisely represent North Quad. I want more of a parity between North and South Quad. The population of the university has shifted up to North Quad, but the activities the administration and SUB plans are still predominantly on South Quad. I know a lot ofpeople in my dorm would go to movie night on the quad except that it's too much of a pain to walk all the way down to the Rock. I think if we could get some of those events up on North Quad, it would be better for the whole campus because it would let all of us take part. 
How do you plan to relay reports ofyour work as a senator to the students of your district? · 
GAFFNEY: The committee will publish a campus newsletter with administrative policies and policy changes as wen as student govern­ment activities and what students ofNotre Dame are writing in about most. I feel I have to do the same and separate out what is happening on North Quad in an addendum to the newsletter. 
Are you in favor ofimplementing a 24-hour lounge and, if so, how 
do you propose to do it? 
GAFFNEY: I personally would be in favor of it. The problem with it is that there are a lot of students that say everybody wants it, but there are not a lot of students to take part in it I wouldn't make the Oak Room a 24-hour lounge because it wasn't what the students wanted and it was too expensive to operate. Ifthere was large enough student support, then we could possibly open up the basement of LaFortune areas that don't need food service. I wouldn't just act on what I think is right. 
What are your feelings about the honor code? GAFFNEY: I haven't had any problems with it I don't think it's a great problem on campus. I'm basically in favor of it It's a tough thing to implement. No one wants to be put in the position where if you don't tum someone in for cheating you get an "F" in the course. On the other hand, ifI study hard for a test, I don't think it's anyone's right to do better than I am by cheating. They justify the honor code by the competitive effort that's not present in any other aspect of Notre Dame life. I think it is important for its image to put in some system that tries to teach this moralistic goal because if it's not that, what separates this from a state school? ¦

Megan Hines is a junior inPasquerilla West. She isfromDavenport, Iowa, and is in the College ofArts and Letters. 
Please analyze the job that the current senate has done. 
HINES: l'm impressed by the parliametary nature, the respect and the attention at the senate meetings. Brian McCarthy did a fairly good job. He picked up well where the senator before him left off. But, I'd like to attend hall council meetings on a more regular basis so my face is known. 
What is the main goal you would like to achieve as s,enator? HINES: My main goal is greater communication between the senator and the individuals represented. For example, a fonner Zahm presi­dent lowered the price of an SYR to get higher participation. There are different ways of handling the 70 percent. I would like to have some kind of forum of the presidents of the dorms. 
What particular strengths do you bring to office? 
HINES: I think vitality would be my greatest strength. I like to attack a problem and break it up. I like to identify a problem and deal with it Also, the four issues on my platform. I chose them because I have heard them as complaints from students. 
What do you think would be your weaknesses? 
HINES: I think it would be that I am a perfectionist. What I want is not always possible. We have to have a compromise between the administration and the students. 
What do you see as the specific needs of your district? 
HINES: I picked the four hottest issues -the SYR issue, student housing, the 24-hour lounge and the24-hourcomputerlab. Once I am in position and these major goals are met, I will try to meet the other goals of the hall presidents and the students. My T.G .I.N.Q., Thank God It's North Quad, will help the cohesiveness of the quad. It will be on the first Friday of the month and guys and girls dorms will be matched up for some type ofcompetition. Afterwards, there will be some kind of social mixer. I would also like a calendar to go out in my newsletter with the events on North Quad. 
Howdo you plan to generate more input from the student body into student government? 


HINES: I will get input through my presence at hall council meetings. I want my face to be known around North Quad. I also will have a newsletter that lists my representatives in the donns. It's not something creative and new, but it has not been done on a regular basis. It's potential has not been realized. 
How do you plan to relay reports of you work as a senator to the students of your district? HINES: I want to get on the agenda of hall council meetings. I want to get to each of the donns' hall council meetings at least once a month. 
What do you see as the biggest problem with on-campus living and how would you alleviate it? HINES: Last fall Evelyn Reinebold reiterated the housing policy and it was discussed at HPC, but students didn't pay much attention to it I made an appointment with her to talk about the policy. Thestudents' reaction has gone from no reaction to panic. But, I don't think the administration will drop a bomb on us. I think interaction is the key to dealing with the administration. 
Are you in favor ofimplementing a 24-hour lounge and, ifso, how do you propose to do it? · HINES: Theproblem with the Oak Room is that it was on the extreme end ofSouth Quad. I would like to have itin a more neutral position. It would be a great cost at LaFortune, but the administration needs to realize the benefits. I would like to combine the 24-hour lounge with the computer lounge. That way we would only need security in one building. I think the administration will work with us and us with them. This is crucial to all concerned. 
What are your feelings about the honor code? HINES: I am in favor ofan honorcode,just not this one. I agree with the part about being honest yourself. The problem is that it is my moral obligation to tum you in. Maybe it should be changed to talking to your friend and telling him you think you saw him cheating. Or maybe talking to the teacher should be an option. They are putting responsibility on the wrong individual. ¦

a 
What would be your main goal as senator? LOY A: I think the biggest thing -it's been done, but shut down -is the 24-hour lounge. This is more ofa campus-wide thing. I think it can work if you only have it open on weekends, because that would be the time that most people would use it. I did go a couple of times during the week, and it was dead, but that's also when they served food andeverything. I'dlike to have it in a more centralized location, such as LaFortune. The way that could be done is they're going to have the computer lab in the basement open 24 hours. They're going to have to secure the whole floor. Now, to do that, you 'II have the area by Irish Gardens open. During the weekdays, you have the candy machines there. On the weekends, you could have the ice cream shop down there open. That, I think, would more than enough pay for itself, which is what I think the administration is looking for. So that would be the biggest goal. I do believe that a 24-hour lounge is something that's feasible and needed. 
What particular strengths would you bring to office? LOYA: I'm quite qualified to run. Presently, I'm president of the Hispanic club. Whereas in the past it has been a dormant club, this year we've done a lot of things to try to improve the whole campus' awareness ofa lot of our tradition. Being president of the Hispanic club has taught me that the campus as a whole does not really know too much about cultural diversity. The greatest asset I could bring to the senate is a minority perspective, because I know firsthand what minority concerns are, not only for Hispanics, but for Blacks, Native Americans and Asians. 
What do you see as the specific needs of your district? LOY A: I think mod quad is sort ofdivided. There is this huge rivalry between Flanner and Grace. One thing I like that Rask did is he had a couple ofactivities that everybody could join. I'd like to continue that. 
One ofthe things I'dlike to implement is that especially during the cold winter months is to get the O'Hare shuttle to come to the library circle -now it only comes to the main circle. Trudging from Carroll Hallorthemodquadcanbeapainespeciallywhenyou'reloadedwith luggage. I'd like to propose that the United Limo come to the library circle so it's not as much of a walk for the mod quad. 
Another thing is theb2situation. I know they 'reopening up a new parking lot and supposedly people in Siegfried and Knott are sup­posed to park there.· That'll alleviate the problem in D2 a little bit, but you still have the problem of potholes and lighting -it's still pretty dark out there. The pothole situation would be the first though, because obviously you don't want to take a toll on your car. Security has been improved; there are gatrols now. But there's still break-ins so something's still not being done right. 
How do you plan to generate more student input into student government? 
LOYA: One ofthe things I feel Tom Rask lacked was that he wasn't very approachable. A lot of people didn't even know who he was, who the senator was. Things would happen in student government and our only source ofknowing what was going on was through the Observer, and even then it's a pretty concise summary. What I'd like is to publish all the minutes ifpossible in each dorm. I don't believe it's necessary to have dorm reps, because I'm an approachable person. Although it is a big quad, it's not so big that people can't call me up for pretty much everything. 
How would you relay information to people in your district? LOYA: Through publication of the minutes in every floor of the dorm, rather than just downstairs in the lobby. Especially in the towers, when you're waiting for the elevator, all you do is read. Another thing is suggestion boxes. I know they've been tried before, but I think the thing with suggestion boxes is their location. 
What do you see is the biggest problem with on-campus living? · LOYA: Where would you start? People are always talking that there's not enough to do, and that it's justa lame social scene. Now it seems to me that there's a lot of things to do. It's just a matter of publicizing it in creative ways. Just try to get some outlandish advertising going on, and people will see that there's a lot going on. 
How do you propose to implement this 24-hour lounge? LOYA: The administration is hung up on this cost thing -and that if it doesn'tpay for itself, it isn't worth keeping open. Ifyou only open up a food service on the weekends, that in itself will pay for itself. Now during the week, the computer lab is going to be open also. 
What are your feelings about the honor code? 
LOYA: I think it was a good idea personally, except I don't believe the students were consulted to see what they thought about it. Possibly other universities have itbecause they need it. Most people don'tperceiveitasaproblematNotreDame. lfyoudogoaheadwith it, the students will feel better about it if they know they have something to do with it And that really can be applied to almlt everything the administration does.

Sean Scanlon isa sophomorefromF tanner Tower who plans to major in history: He has served on the Flanner Hall Council. 
Please analyze the job the current student senate has done. 
SCANLON: A lot of my knowledge about the senate has to do with our current senator Tom Rask. I have the impression that he has not done an adequate job for district 4, through his representation. He's been, if not dishonest, not as open with the students, with the hall councils -which I am on -as we should expect. And he hasn't played his role as a senator in the proper manner. I have no knowledge ofhis actual participation in the senate, as far as student government goes; but as far as relating to the halls in the district, it has not been a good relationship. 
What is the main goal you would like to achieve as a senator? 
SCANLON: The main goal would be to pursue the parking issue for the mod quad, due to the new ROTC building being built there and the difficulties with security and space generally in D2-that would be my number-one issue for the upcoming year. 
What particular strengths would you bring to office? 
SCANLON: My strength would not be in representation through intimidation or knowledge a tall, but would be through representation through communication and finding out what people wanted and not forcing my opinions on the district, more being just a mouthpiece. 
What do you think would be your weaknesses? 
SCANLON: My weaknesses would be numerous. Lackofbeginning knowledge in student government -and that's another reason I'm rather interested in it. It turns from a weakness into a strength because I'm really wanting to know how things run and how it could be improved because it doesn't seem from my point ofview as a student that we have had much communication from the senator into student government. 
What do you see as the specific needs of your district? SCANLON: As a general goal of senator is to be sure that there is some unity involved in the mod quad. It is generally known as a tight quad amorig the four dorms and there's a large concentrated popula­tion there. I'd like the unity to be used to make it one of the stronger quads on campus, and not have the interhall rivalry between Grace and Flanner. 
How do you plan to generate more student input into student government? 
SCANLON: One thing that struck me about Tom Rask as a student senator is that we only received one mailing from the student senator to his district. One thing that struck me as very positive towards the sophomore class officers is that they put out a mailing every month, keeping in touch with the people, soliciting opinion. It seems that that would have to be necessary in order to get any opinion. 
What do you see is the biggest problem with on-campus living? 
SCANLON: There's a few problems that come up. The SYR issues, the issue ofpossible co-ed housing. The problem of 70% at SYRs is that it seems like that rule was a little harsh on dorms with the size of Flanner and Grace, where 70% is over 300 people. And you can't reasonably expect that an SYR which doesn't generate nearly the interest of the Christmas formals -which get 85-90% attendance -to get 70% attendance. 
The coed housing idea: I don't know the feeling of most people. in the quad, whether its a valid idea. My own opinion is that I would start off against that idea but open to listen to opinion. 
Are you in favor ofimplementing a 24-hour lounge and, ifso, how 
do you propose to do it? 
SCANLON: Yes, I would be in favor of a 24-hour lounge in general. I think that a more centered place on campus-it seems thatLaFortune would be the place, but there comes the problem ofsecurity. It might come down to O'Shaughnessy or some building like that, but I do think it's a valid thing that's needed at least during mid-terms and , finals week. 
What are your feelings about the honor code? 
SCANLON: Ineffective. And I don't mean to voice mistrust in general, but I've seen violation of the honor code. I think the honor code is set up on a good basis. I think the professors should be the final word on the honor code, since they are teaching the course, I don't think 100 percent of the responsibility should be on the studentsll

Please analyze the job the current senate has done. HOAG: The current senate has done a very good job. I'd like to see more interaction with the students with a newsletter to all the students. 
What is the main goal you would like to achieve as a senator? 
HOAG: There are probably a few of them. I would like to have more student interaction on administration committees. I would like to have the housing policy secured so you wouldn't have to worry about your fourth-year residency. I would like to have the library hours extended. I would also like the SYR policy looked over again in light of this year and what's happened. I would like to have D6 expanded so more students could park behind the Rock. 
What particular strengths do you think you would bring to the 
office? HOAG: As a student, I am aware of what the problems are, especially during finals week. I think 11 :30 or 11 :45 is too early for the library hours. A university as large as we are should have library hours at least till 1:00 a.m. 
What do you think your weaknesses would be? 
HOAG: Probably, I get impatient at times. 
What do you see as the specific needs of your district? 
HOAG: As a case in point, the parking lot. D6 right now is reserved only for the ROTC building and for Carroll. Ifthey expand it-which they have room to do, I believe, it would allow a lot of students with 1 cars in Cl and D1 who live in Morrissey, Lyons, Howard, Fisher and l Pangborn to have their cars transferred over to D6 lot. It would make j ita lot more convenient for students themselves. Also, we have never 
received monthly newsletters from the senators or student body and I would like to change that to keep the students informed. 
How do you plan to generate more input from the student body into student government? 
HOAG: By the newsletters. By keeping them informed, I hope to have them at least have an interest in what's going on and by having forms sent with the monthly newsletters I can judge their reactions to certain questions and decisions we have made. Ill

What is the main goal you would like to achieve as a senator? 
KR01ZER: Representing the off-campus student is something that I think is not done very well. As I've read the number of off-campus students is growing dramatically in part, I think, because of the alcohol policy and other things on campus that are drawing people to move off campus away from the rules, just for an added sense of freedom. I don't think they are effectively represented in the senate. 
Some things that I'd like to work on are off-campus crime which is definitely on the rise over the past year. I have many friends in the off-campus community that have been robbed. I'd like to represent those that live in the houses and hopefully be a voice for them and put concerns to the university on things such as off-campus crime. 
We've had one off-campus newsletter this year. An off-campus student is pretty much a non-university member when he's not here during the day. The school cares about him from nine to five and after that I think he's on his own. 
What particular strengths would you bring to office? 
KR01ZER: I think experience, front and foremost,although I did just transfer here this year. The college I came from is a community college in upstate New York where I was vice-president my sopho­more year. I was a student senator my freshman year there plus I have a great deal of offices held in high school. Here at the university I've been on a board of trustees committee, and I've been active with many other things. I'm very familiar with the meeting setting. This job is far from a rP-sume builder for me. This job is something that I want to do. 
What do you see as the specific needs of your district? 
KR01ZER: Communication. I think that the off-campus student is not communicated to enough. I got an off-campus newsletter three or four weeks ago and it was the first one of the year. The off-campus student just does not know what is really going on. Ifthe student is not on a meal plan and doesn't happen to be walking to the South Dining Hall or coming to LaFortune or have a class in O' Shaughnessy then he might not be getting an Observer. Some kind of communi­cation has got to be set between the university community and the off-campus student in the form of a newsletter. II ·

Now Premiering. Simon!!! 
ND introduces its first totally student-written and directed 





musical 
· 
BY JIM GRECO 

L et this be encouragement for all the big dreamers out there. For the first time at Notre Dame, a musical 
totally written, directed, performed and cho­reographed by students will be presented at Washington Hall. It is the work of four stu­dents (three from Notre Dame) who have put their ideas and talents together to come up with Simon: a contemporary, romantic com-edy about a shy piano player who becomes a more dynamic person because he falls in love. 

Rob Meffe, a senior pre-med student, Brant Beckett, a senior communication and theatre major, Shawn Stumick, a student at Seton Hill College in Pennsylvania and Mark Costanzi, a senior communication and the­atre major are mainly responsible for creat­ing the musical. They brought together many 
separate ideas begin­ning as late as three years ago and finally finished putting them all to­gether last December to create Si­mon. 
As for the musical itself, Simon's title character is a piano player in 
Shirley's 
Bar and Grill whose onecharacter flaw is that he has trouble expressing his feelings. This problem is especially acute in his dealings with women which becomes the main theme of the musical. 
Enter Emily, a young lady who walks into the bar and steals Simon's heart. Since Simon can't confidently express himself in words, he expresses his feelings for her in his music. Without revealing too much, the rest of the musical centers on the interaction be­tween Emily and Simon and his attempts to communicate with her. 
Although the plot centers on Simon and Emily's love story, other characters add humor to the play. For example, there is Shirley, the owner of the Bar and Grill and a husky alto/blues type character, and Jeffery, the tap dancing bartender. Jeffery, according to director Beckett, "is beautiful and he knows it." With the addition of these two characters, the romance of the play is bal­anced by some humorous scenes. 
The history of the development of Simon could probably be a play in itself. The entire idea of the musical started three years ago with a single song about a character who later would be named Simon. "Itall started in high school when I wrote a song called 'I am just the Piano Player'," Meffe said. "It dealt with a character who didn't know how to express 


22 


his feelings." At the time Meffe never in­tended the song to bethe basis for a musical, but he liked the character and wrote more songs about him. 
Once at Notre Dame, Meffe met Beckett, who began to write lyrics for Meffe's songs about Simon. (The two were a perfect match. One couldn't write music and the other couldn't write lyrics.) The songs began to form a story about the piano-playing charac­ter, and after a while, both Meffe and Beckett realized that they had the makings ofamusi­cal. The two enlisted the help of Stumick, Meffe's friend from home, to write addi­tional lyrics, and the idea began to take shape. 
Last year, Meffe approached then-SUB Cultural Arts Commissioner Nick Rossi about the musical. Rossi was looking to re­activate student players' productions on campus; he liked their plan for Simon and preparations began. The book, which Beck­ett describes as "the fleshing out of the musi­cal plot," was written by Costanzi, the lyrics were split between Beckett and Stumick, and Meffe wrote the majority of the music. 
The score for Simon is described as "jazzy and contemporary" by Meffe. Meffe feels his music for Simon was strongly influenced by professional writers Stephen Schwartz (Godspe/[) and Stephen Sondheim (A Little Night Music, Into the Woods). "Stephen Sondheim is really my idol. He is the most brilliant musical writer I know of," said Meffe. The next stage was to apply the lyrics to the music. "The idea behind the lyrics was (not only) to show Simon's inability to ex­press himself normally, but also to show his extraordinary ability to do so through mu­sic," Beckett said. After Costanzi finished the book, Simon was finally ready for the stage. 
Last December, about45-50 people audi­tioned for eight parts. Beckett said that ittook about 20 to· 25 hours with 6 hours of call­backs to find a cast, but the results were worth it. Rehearsals have been taking place since January; the show opened last night. In addition, Meffe feels that Notre Dame won't be the end of Simon's career. He has been tentatively approached about performing it as weekend dinner theatre at the South Bend Holiday Inn, and also hopes to copyright it and produce it in Pennsylvania. 
Although the writing ofSimon was a new experience for all three Notre Dame students, they all have had past experience in music and ·theatre. Both Beckett and Meffe have been members ofthe glee club and Meffe has also done summer work at an opera house in Pittsburgh. 
Surprisingly, Meffe said that although the development of Simon was a lot of fun, he still remains uneasy about how the show will go over, especially. after it continues past Notre Dame. He admits the musical produc­tion field is tough, but for a pre-med student who writes and performs musicals in his spare time, he, Beckett and Company have plenty of reason to be proud. From a song in high school to the footlights of Washington Hall and beyond -let's hear it for dreamers.

Now Von Luhrte is racing on the track at 

the much more manageable, ifless relaxing, 
distances of 3,000 and 5,000 meters. "It 
feels good to push yourself in the workouts 
and it's fun," she said. 
Theresa Rice might be the team's blue 

chipper, if such a position exists in a club 
sport. A power on the cross country team, 
Rice has always been suited for the track and 
would rather it be her varsity sport than the 
fall racing. "I'm a track runner," she said. "I 
started running cross country because it 
helps my track. I know it's screwy because 
cross country is varsity." 
No matter how screwy, Rice won't apologize for her preference. A 4:50 mile she posted early in the 1988 indoor season . was only five seconds away from qualifying 
for the collegiate national championships. 
Maybe it's better that she never made the 

cut. NCAA regulations prohibit any non­
varsity athlete from competing in champi­
onship meets, no matter how fast they run, 
how high they jump, or how far they throw. 
This segregation came as nothing new to 

Rice. At Trinity High School in South Bend, 
both she and her sister Cathleen, a sopho­
more on theclub,ranfastenough to make the 
sectional meet. But because Trinity is not a 
member school of the Indiana High School 
Athletic Association, they could only watch 
from the bleachers and wonder. Times 
haven't changed much. 
Whether the star senior, upstart fresh­

man Lucy Nusrala, or any one else runs the 
times, she won't go anywhere. Teammates 
are certain that N usrala will run fast enough, 
it's just a matter ·of time. "Lucy is a phe­
nomenal runner," said Rice. "But until they 
make(theteam) varsity,no matter how good 
she is, she can't go to nationals." 
This, of course, is an isolated symptom 

of a club's general frustration. Cross coun­
try runners and strictly track athletes alike 
want to be more than a club. 
In college track and field, a team with non-varsity status faces second-class citi­zenship. Two years ago, the Indiana Inter­collegiate Track Meet wanted to bar Notre Dame's women from competing. As a favor to men's Coach Piane, a special case was made for a few women runners. Of the four who went, three placed in their events. 

In another case, the team was allowed to compete in January's MCC indoor meet 
Assistant athletic director Missy Conboy explained that last year, the other three sports were the most feasible choices. "I think softball, soccer, and golf going varsity served a lot of interest and we could do it relatively inexpensively," she said. ''.It's a natural consequence that someone is going to be disappointed." 
Conboy added that the athletic depart­
pened to take place at Loftus. A strong performance, in­cluding the meet's third highest point total, two first places for Rice, one first for Nusrala, and a second for the two-mile relay, went largely unrec­ognized. "We were allowed to partici­pate, but when they scored the meet, they ignored the performances of our athletes," said Murray. "Our run­ners didn't get medals."

women's clubs would be raised to the varsity level -golf, softball and soccer made the cut, but not track and field. "I have nothing against the other sports going varsity, but there was some injustice," said Rice, who felt her club's involvement, ability, and history should have placed it higher on the list. 
The club met with the department to express discontent. "They said that women's track was not considered an MCC sport (the conference of many of Notre Dame's varsities, including men's track), that interest was greater in the new varsity sports, and that the only people on campus interested in a track program were the women on the cross country team," said Murray. 
ment petitioned the NCAA to allow mem­bers of the track club to compete in the championship meet if they qualified. The NCAA refused. 
This year the MCC has added women's track, club membership is up, and while half the runners also run cross country, the other half have only track, Murray said. 
Fornow, though, it's business as usual in the club: practicing like a varsity team, racing NCAA Division I teams, raising funds selling football programs, organizing trips, and paying for transportation and race fees. 
"We were told that the next women's varsity sport is track. That's up to them," said Murray. "We definetely have the inter­est, we have the talent." Until then, it's a waiting game.

OPINION 


It' out Time 


Women athletes call for full implementation ofTitle IX 
The opinions expressed in the following ar­ticle are solely those of its authors. They do not necessarily reflect the opinions ofScho­lastic. 
"Be it resolved that no person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance." 
Title IX of the 1972 

Education Amendments 
On July 25, 1975, this statement became federal law. It states that women are entitled to a fair and equitable share of whatever opportunities a federally assisted educational institution offers, including admissions, employment, scholarships, and A THLET­ICS. According to this ruling, any school with an athletic team form en must provide an equal opportunity for women to participate in that sport. 
It is now February 1989. Notre Dame has been a coeducational institution for 16 years. Title IX has been law for 14 years. During this time, the limits of its regulatory powers have been defined by numerous lawsuits, but its basic ideas have been strengthened by this legal testing. However, while Notre Dame has reiterated its support for equal opportu­nity for women on campus, the university's actions belie its rhetoric, especially in imple~ menting Title IX in our athletic programs. 
Notre Dame fields thirteen varsity teams for men: football, basketball, baseball, soc­cer, cross-country, hockey, golf, wrestling, track, swimming, fencing, lacrosse, and tennis. Until recently, there were only six women's sports: volleyball, cross-country, basketball, fencing, swimming, and tennis. Last year, the women's golf, soccer, and soft­ball clubs gained varsity status. As members of the women's track club, we applauded when the university elevated these sports and expanded its roster of women's varsity sports. Yet we were incensed by the athletic department's obvious neglect of one of the university's oldest and most popular women's club sports -women's track. 
We are still mad. Women's track has shown interest in becoming a varsity sport and has supported this case by maintaining a competitive schedule against NCAA Divi­sion I varsity track programs with scholar­ships. We pride ourselves on our strong and successful performances against such com­petition. Obviously, we have proven our abilities. Our roster reflects the depth and strength of interest in women's track at this University. In addition, Notre Dame has the facilities to support a women's varsity track program -and the money. 
But our program has been slapped down by a discriminatory policy within the athletic department, which restricts funding, coach­ing, competition, and recruitment because we remain a club sport. The track club re­ceives limited funding from NVA, which bars us from competing at a national level. Track club members do not travel with a coach, and do not have access to an athletic trainer. Track club members are not re­cruited, receive no financial assistance from the athletic department. Futhermore, we re­ceive no official support from the athletic department. In their eyes, the women's track club does not exist. 
Though the university has not acknowl­edged the women's track club, they must answer to the federal law. Title IX explicitly states that where there is "proven interest and need" (Paragraph 86.41, Subpart C), the edu­cational institution must provide equal op­portunity for both sexes to participate fully in its intercollegiate athletic programs. Notre Dame has a clear obligation to comply with this regulation. As long as there is a varsity men's track program, women's varsity track is not a privilege -it is our legal right. 
In the past, club members have felt power­less to challenge the university's position. We refuse to remain passive any longer. Our club status reflects blatant discrimination against women athletes at Notre Dame. Title IX clearly supports our stance on this issue. We intend to fight for our right to varsity track. 

Under Title IX,the university must grant varsity status to women's track. Ifthey fail to do so, we have the right, under current fed­eral law, to compete as members of the men's varsity track. program, with equal opportunity to train, travel, and race as full members of Notre Dame's team. Ifwe are barred from this opportunity, we have a clear case of discrimination that will stand in · court 
Notre Dame has three clear options -ele­vate the women's club to varsity status, al­low women to participate fully as members of~e men's varsity team, or drop the men's track program to club status. Notre Dame has had 14 years to comply with these federal regulations. It is time for the university to back up its rhetoric with actions.

Led by a trio ofexceptional seniors, Irish wrestling has hit it big 
Courtesy Notre Dame Sports Information 

Jerry Durso (top) is the all-time winningest wrestler in Irish history. 

BY KEVIN GUILFOILE

Take yourselfba~k, for a second, to 1952. Everythmg on the Notre Dame campus was just as it should have been. On the third floor of the admini­stration building, Father Ted Hes burgh was just settling in as the new president. Over on Cartier Field, Frank Leahy was running yet another grueling practice with an Irish foot­ball team that was only a year or so away from another national championship and a Reisman Trophy winner in Johnny Lattner. Over in the fieldhouse, a sophomore for­ward on the basketball team named Dick Rosenthal was practicing the free throws that would help make him an All~American in a few years. Oh, and on the other side of campus, upstairs in the Rockne Gym, Phys. Ed. teacher Tom Fallon wasrollingoutsomeold gymnastics mats and walking the members of the wre~tling club through a few of the basic moves. Look around today, and no tall that much has changed. Up in the administration building, Father Malloy has replaced Hesburgh as president, but you get the feel­ing that Father Ted is still milling about, looking over shoulders under the dome. Lou Holtz is savoring Notre Dame's eighth na­tional championship and nervously trying to decide which one ofhis young stars deserves the Reisman next. The fieldhouse is gone, but Dick Rosenthal can still be found over at the Joyce Center sitting in the athletic director's chair. And, of course, the thir­teenth-ranked wrestling team is down in the arena, going match for match against seven­time national champion Oklahoma. 
How's that again? 
Well, maybe some things have changed, but you don't have to go back four decades to see how far Irish wrestling has come. You only have to look back a few years. 
In 1984, the Notre Dame athletic depart­ment decided that after 32 years of medioc­rity it was finally time to enter the exclusive arena of big-time collegiate wrestling. Re-. building a program, however, can be just as difficult as creating one -you have to start from scratch. From the very beginning, the high sheriffs of Notre Dame knew they would need three of the basics: top-ranked wrestlers, a competitive schedule and an excellent coach. They also knew that if they could get the coach first, they could let him worry about the other two things. 
Head Coach Fran McCann caught the eye oflrish officials after leading Indiana State to five top-20 seasons; and after eight years at the helm ofthe fighting Sycamores, McCann packed up his things and made the drive from Terre Haute to South Bend. They gave him an office and some scholarships and said "Get yourself a schedule." Man, did he ever. 
Gone, suddenly, were opponents like the McMurry Indians and the Big Blue of Mil­likan. In their place came the Nebraska Cornhuskers and the Buckeyes ofOhio State. Yet a tough schedule does not a team make, and McCann knew that if he was going to replace Stetson with Clemson, he had better have the personnel to compete. 
Out on the east coast, there was a kid named Jerry Durso, the Greco-Roman junior

Chris Geneser (top) is one of several Irish wrestlers who look to compete in the NCAA Championships. 
national champion who was being recruited by every wrestling school in the east. McCann called him up and told him that Notre Dame wanted to start a top notch wres­tling program in South Bend and he was just the guy who could set things in motion. Durso wasn't buying, at least in the begin­ning. 
"I got some letters, and I talked to Coach McCann," Durso remembers. "But coaches tell you a lot of things, and I really wasn't thinking that much about Notre Dame at first." 
So McCann began working on Chris Geneser, a 167-pounder from Woodward, IA with a prep record to match Durso's, giving him the same pitch he gave the kid from Jersey -but with slightly more promis­ing results. 
"Coach talked to me a lot about how the university was behind him, and that they were serious about building a program here," Geneser says. "I knew that if they had made the effort to hire a new coach and start things over the way they had, Notre Dame must be ready to make a big move." 

Still, Geneser was a much-desired pros­pect among the giant wrestling schools ofthe heartland, and things weren't ready to come together just yet. The one piece of the puzzle that would make all the others fall into place was a senior up in Mt Pleasant, MI by the name of Pat Boyd. 
Boyd was something of legend in high school wrestling. With an absolutely as­tounding high school record of 168-1, and a streak of wins that spanned three years and 143 victories, Boyd was perhaps the most sought-after recruit in the country. Although he could have written his own ticket to just about any top ten wrestling school in the nation, something inside him had always 

drawn him towards the Irish. 
"Since I was eight years old I had always 

wanted to go to Notre Dame," Boyd recalls. 
"l never thought I would end up here, though, 
because they didn't have much ofa wrestling 
program." 
McCann set out to change all that. "We 

knew that Pat wanted to come here," he says, 
"and we had to make him aware of the new 
commitment that the university was prepared 
lo make toward collegiate wrestling." 
Once he had raised Boyd's "awareness," 

it became academic. 
"When I found out in my senior year that 

they were trying to build a squad -that they . were upgrading the schedule and going after guys like Jerry and Chris, it didn't take much for me to make up my mind," says Boyd. "It 
was really just perfect timing." 
Timing turned out to be everything in 

McCann's recruiting strategy, for once he 
was able to land Boyd, everything suddenly 
became a whole lot easier; Geneser followed 
suit, and soon even Durso realized that 
Mccann was indeed very serious about wres­
lling and Notre Dame. 
"I was the last one to commit that year," 

Durso says. "Coach McCann really im­
pressed me with what he was trying to do and 
with what he had accomplished in a short 
time. They had signed some top-notch re­
cruits, and I knew that if Notre Dame was 
going to set out to do something, that it would 
be done first class. Plus, I knew that I would 
be able to get in there right away and have an 
immediate impact." 
Impact is right. In the three and a half years since Boyd, Geneser and Durso first stepped on the Notre Dame campus, the Irish wrestling team has made giant strides. Durso has since become the all-time winningest wrestler in Irish history. Geneser will, in all likelihood, be in second place when this season is over and Boyd, although plagued with injuries, has always found the courage to bounce right back and remain among the top five 142-pounders in the country. 
To complement them, McCann has brought ·in two-time NCAA champion Rick Stewart from Oklahoma State to assist him, and together they have gathered some of the finest wrestling talent from all over the na­tion. Thanks to Stewart's help, McCann fi­nally has a competitive team from top to bottom. Ranked in some polls as high as thir­teenth in the nation, the 9-3 Irish have had several opportunities to break into the top ten,just narrowly missing in matches against eighth-ranked Oklahoma (16-18), 12th­ranked Nebraska (15-24) and 19th-ranked Indiana (16-18). Impressive wins such as a 21-18 victory over 15th-rated Ohio State,

however, have kept them in the running. 
Still, Notre Dame is a young team not 
onlybecauseit's the new kid on the collegiate 
block, but beause six of its ten starters are 
only freshmen or sophomores. Because 
they've come so far so fast, they sometimes 
surprise even themselves. 
"We could have won every single meet this year," Durso says. "Unfortunately the team didn't realize that until after the matches were over. We were probably a little surprised that we beat Ohio State, and I think that maybe some ofus didn't really think that we could beat Oklahoma or Nebraska until we went back to the locker room and said 'Wow, that was really close. We should have won that.' 

"We haven't wrestled with alotofconsis­tency this year. Wehaven'thadameetwhere everything clicked. Half of us may wrestle really well in a meet while the other half struggles, and then in_the next week it could be just the reverse, but we've done some good things as well as bad." 
Geneser agrees. "It's a long season, par­ticularly for freshmen," he says. "They're used to wrestling for three months or so in high school and now all of the sudden they 're starting in October and going straight to the middle of March. It really takes a lot of preparation and conditioning."

"Bum out can be a factor to­ward theendoftheseason," Boyd adds. "It's a tough adjustment, but coach McCann and coach Stewart are doing a good job of priming us and preparing us emo­tionally at the right times." 
Yet despite the ups and downs, co-captains Geneser and Durso, who are roommates as well as teammates, claim that this squad has much better chemistry the Irish teams of the last few years. 
"When we first got here, the team was almost divided between sort ofan 'old school' and a 'new school'," Durso remembers. "There were guys who had come before coach McCann, and guys who had come after. Now, we all have the same level of commit­ment and the same desire to win, and that's very important." 
Notre Dame will have one 
more chance to prove itself in dual meet competition this year when they play host to Marquette University on Saturday, Febru­ary 25. After that, however, it's "Tournament Time." On March · 2 and 3, the Irish will travel to Des Moines, IA to compete with ten other schools in the West Re­

21 wrestlers will ad­vance to the National Championships in Oklahoma City on March 16-18. 
"Now that we're coming up on the end of the season it will be­come more of an indi­vidual effort for each of us, and that may help to keep us focused," Durso says. "Some of the younger guys wrestle better in tourna­ments than they do in dual meets, and I think it will just be a question of us peaking at the right time." 
McCann, who returns five NCAA qualifiers from last year's squad, thinks that the re­gional could be more difficult this year, but that doesn't dis­courage him. 
"The competition will be bet­ter, and they have changed the qualifying procedure," says McCann, "but we're a better team as well, and the changes in the rules could work in our favor. It's going to be interesting. We could qualify four or five guys, or we could qualify seven or eight. It's up to our wrestlers." 
As far as the seniors are cons cemed, they feel ready. 
"I feel really good right now," Boyd says. "I have al­ready faced five of the top ten guys in the country at my weight, so I know what I'll be up against." 
Geneser is looking for that one level of success that has, in past years, eluded him. "In my sophomore and junior years, I wrestled pretty well in the fall," he says. "Then when spring came around, I had a lot of trouble. This year, I've tried to relax a little more and keep focused to­wards the end of the season." 
Durso, perhaps, is looking forward to the nationals as much as anybody. "The one thing I haven't yet done is be successful at the NCAA tournament," he says. "You can have all the wins you want during the season, but none ofthat matters if you don't win your last seven or eight." . 
At long last -37 years after Tom Fallon rolled out his gymnastics mats, 33 years after Notre Dame made wrestling a varsity sport and five years after Fran McCann dashed off a letter to Jerry Durso -the Irish wrestlers seem poised to capture something big. 
"We've turned the comer," McCann says with a smile. "We have finally proven that Notre Dame can compete with the best wres­tling programs in the country." . It's 1989, and everything is just as it should be.

After a highly successful 1987-88 campaign, the Notre Dame hockey team has endured a 
Ian Johanson 

Schafer's squad, which won 27 games last 


rough season against tougher competition 
season, has lost nearly as many in '88-89. 
BY BRIAN McMAHON 

The Notre Dame hockey team has been a record breaker for the past two seasons. Their latest "feat", though, is one they would rather do without. Last season, the University of Notre Drune hockey team established a school rec­ord for wins with 27. This season, prior to their last game versus Western Michigan, they lost 25, another record. An uninformed observer might declare the season a failure. Doing so is inaccurate, however, for there are mitigating circum­stances regarding the team's lack of success . in the win-loss column. First and foremost, this year's schedule was much more competitive than last year's edition. Notre Dame dropped from its schedule pushovers like Dayton and Villa­nova, whom they outscored 53-9 in four games last year, and added college hockey powers Boston College, Michigan, Provi­dence and R.P.I. They also added Meri­mack, the nation's top independent team and Notre Dame's primary competition for the only independent berth in the NCAA tourna­ment. The dramatic upgrading of the schedule in just one year, along with the use of less than four scholarships, proved to be overzeal­ous. After last year, the hockey team was awarded ten scholarships covering a four­year span. 
"The program here had gone full circle," said Irish head coach Ric Schafer, comment­ing on a program that was a club sport as recently as five years ago. "We were excited about bringing big-time college hockey back to Notre Dame. The opportunity to play these teams was there and we jumped at it." 
Secondly, the loss ofcenter Mike McNeill to graduation created a void that could not be filled. Fifth on the all-time career points list at Notre Dame, McNeill led the team last year with 72 points. This year, freshman center David Bankoske leads the team with 45 points with one game to go. 
Perhaps no one can better attest to McNeill's loss than junior winger Bruce Guay. Last year, flanking McNeill on the number one line, Guay scored 23 goals in 24 games. This year, his total dropped to six in 32 games. 
"It was a frustrating, disappointing year," said Guay. "My production wasn't half of what it was last year. I didn't get any bounces early or get my timing down. I began to push. I worked just as hard this year but I didn't enjoy many fruits of my labor." 
"Bruce is a goal scorer," said Schafer. 
"Unfortunately we were unable to find the right mix in which he could use that talent He's still in the right spots at the right times but he isn't getting the puck as often." 
The loss of McNeill and the tougher schedule made equalling or even approach­ing last year's success highly improbable. 
"We went into the season with guarded optimism and a hope ofcarrying some of last seasons success over," said Schafer. "We had hoped to pull the odd upset against teams with a full complement of scholarships." 
When the upsets never came, the team became discouraged and lost confidence. This affected their play against teams like R.I.T., Air Force, Lake Forest and Army. These are all good teams, but Schafer surely wanted more than the 4-7-1 record his team achieved against them. 
In addition to a lack of confidence, the poor record against these teams can b.e attrib­uted to taking them too lightly. It's hard to get excited about playing_ a mediocre Lake For­est team right after playing a national power like Boston College .. 
"We played better against the better teams," said Bankoske. "Going from a B.C. to a Lake Forest hurt us. We never got up for the Lake Forests." 

After seeing his ·team's performance against top programs this year, Schafer real-izes that he moved too quickly and dras­tically when form­ing this year's schedule. 
"No question," responded Schafer when asked. "We made up the sched­ule last year in the midst ofour success. We were caught up in the euphoria of having done so well." 
Next year, Notre Dame will play a lighter schedule. They will face the likes of Air Force, Army, Connecticut, R.1.T., Holy Cross and Mankato, as 

Bankoske led the team in scoring and entering the final game was threatening to break the Notre Dame record for as­sists by a freshman, set in 1970 by John Noble. Schaferwould like to see him score more goals. Bankoske shares that sentiment. 
"Next year I need to shoot more and have more confidence around the net," said Bankoske. "I tend to overpass sometimes." 
Bankoske wasn't the only freshman to

well as rivals Michigan-Dearborn and Lake Forest. Their only exposure to national powers will bein a tournament in Milwaukee with Boston College, Wisconsin, and Min­nesota-Duluth. 
"At this point, playing really strong teams on a consistent basis is difficult," said Schafer. "Every once in a while is okay, but we were so outmanned so often this year that it hurt us. We suffered a complete loss of confidence thatcarried over to games against teams we should have beaten." 

By toning down the schedule for next season, Schafer has, in effect, permitted his schedule to improve at the same pace as his program. The players, although disap­pointed at no longer playing such top compe­tition, nonetheless realize that they could not realistically play the same caliber schedule next year. Junior goalie Lance Madson, a standout all year whosereturn fornext season is "comforting" to Schafer, felt that "we expected too much too soon. Next year's schedule is a good one. It will be challenging enough." 
Besides Madson and Guay, Schafer can count on juniors Tim Kuehl and Kevin Markovitz for help next season. Kuehl, a winger, was second on the team this year with 33 points and one game remaining. Markovitz was the highest scoring defense­man for the second time in his three years here. 
In addition, Notre Dame's freshmen will be a year older. This first wave ofscholarship recruits attained moderate success and showed promise for the future. 
"They took their lumps in becoming ac­climated to the rugged traffic of college hockey," said Schafer, "but they've made significant improvement." 
Arendt finished the 
season strong, as did winger Lou Zadra. All season long, Mike Curry showed that he has the speed and the shot to be a dominant figure in the years to come. On defense, Kevin Patrick showed poise and headiness at a position where lack of composure cannot be disguised. The experience the freshmen acquired this year will make them more mature and ready to take on an even larger role next year. 
Despite their progress, Schafer knows he

needs more talent ifNotrc Dame is to become a power. "We need a top-notch player badly,"hesaid. In search ofsuch a player, the Irish have gone to Canada, Minnesota and Alaska to recruit, as well as to eastern high schools. "In Canada, most of the players have a played a year or two ofjunior hockey," Schafer indicated. "This makes them more seasoned and more capable of making an impact right away." 
Recruiting, however, is difficult in two ways. First of all, highly-recruited players will decide on the school with the best tradi­tion or strongest chance of winning a cham­pionship -the Notre Dame football program can attest to that. The Irish lost two Olympic­caliber recruits to Vermont and Denverof the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference and Western Collegiate Hockey Association, respectively. Being in stronger conferences makes these programs more appealing. 
But, until Notre Dame is better prepared, it is not possible to join a conference of that caliber. The Central Collegiate Hockey Association is the probable home for the Irish when they are ready. Even then they may not join, as Schafer enjoys the freedom of play­ing an independent schedule. The CCHA schedule is demanding, leaving little room for non-conference games. This would pro­hibit Notre Dame from playing Ivy League schools, teams Schafer feels his team should play. 
"We can play CCHA teams independ­ently," said Schafer. "We're in a position where we can play a strong independent schedule." 
Notre Dame Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal offered another reason. "Notre Dame is independent in much of what we do -we enjoy that," he said. "It provides us a way in which to communicate with our con­stituency around thecountry." Since being in a conference would limit the team to a con­centrated section of the country, many Notre Dame fans across the nation would miss out on their team. "For the immediate future," Rosenthal stated, "Notre Dame will remain independent." 
The "immediate future" Rosenthal speaks ofis at least another three years away, after which the program will be re-evaluated. This was year one of the ten-scholarships-in­four-years plan. At the end of the four years, Schafer will try to convince the athletic de­partment that the hockey program deserves more money. No changes will be made until then. 
This leads to the second reason why re­cruiting is difficult right now: scholarship money. Right now, with a limited supply of funds, it is imprudent to award full scholar­ships to recruits. Instead, they award partial scholarships and hope the player can handle the rest. This further reduces the pool of talent from which the Irish can draw. 
"We need to find players with good grades who want to come here for everything Notre Dame can do for you other than hockey," Schafer intimated. "That in addi­tion to having the resources available to pay some of the tuition costs." 
Schafer realizes, though, that he is not alone in looking for more money. "A lot of sports want more money," he said. "It is unrealistic for us to expect more right now." 
Rosenthal indicated that the amount of money a team will receive is correlated with its ability to finance itself through ticket revenue. Schafer believes that hockey can do this if fan support grows with the improve­ment of his team. 
As part of his rebuilding plan, Schafer would like for next year's squad to continue to improve, have a winning record, and be one or two steps closer to the independent berth in the NCAA tournament. 
"We wanted this year to serve notice that Notre Dame hockey is back," he reflected. "We're still moving up, but at a slower, more realistic pace." 
Realistically speaking, the program is headed in the right direction. It will stumble here and there along the way, but the growing pains won't be as acute if Schafer's ;an proves successful.

ID 

Can't afford the beach for spring break? Increase your decadence in your own family room with these flicks 
S 
pring-Break is wafting in an alleyway around the comer, and there are a few concepts with which the student body should reacquaint itself: decadence, hedonism, and downright defilement. These ideas sure! y serve as the motto ofany heal thy road trip to the beach, but not everyone is lucky enough to go somewhere warm to sin. Some must go home, and it is to those poor souls that I offer words of salvation. 
As a crafty film major, I have a sneaky plart that will allow sin for all, through the ecstasies of debauchery. Yes, the depraved have a god, and this god rules in the Age of Video. Three-year olds critique the lighting of their cribs and cry out for their 8mm camcorders (Super-VHS is still too heavy!). Film may be dying according to some, but the VCR-as-altar is alive and ... hell, now in the comfort of the family room chair (sofa), one can experience the voyeuristic thrills of vile video designed to implode the senses. If you have the channeler, a quality video store can supply thespirits-and,oh, the spirits that exist! 
Obviously it's more fun to make your own discoveries, but here are a few sugges­tions to lead you down the path of decay: 
Videodrome (Directed by David Cronen­berg) 
May as well start with the concept ofman and video united in one flesh. This classic Cronenberg shocks, revolts, and enraptures the viewer with the story of the owner of a soft porn TV station who falls victim to new form ofmind control hidden in video signals. Better than any hallucinogen on the market, the videodrome signal metabolizes star James Woods into a paragon of the "new flesh" : an organic VCR. I keep watching this film in hopes of being affected in the same way. 
Includes an arousing perfomance by Debbie Harry. 
Mondo New York (Directed by Harvey Keith) 
This is for intense debasement because it's "95% Real." The advertisements for this film proclaim: "Somewhere between uptown and downtown, heaven and hell, dusk and dawn lies ... Mondo New York." This film explores the sleazy underbelly of the Big Apple and contains real characters and acts. Scenes include naked paraplegic performance artist, Frank Moore, six-foot­tall bald drag queen Dean Johnson and his band The Weanies singing"F-,-You!", and Paddles, a hot spot nightclub for the sado­massochistically inclined. 
Threaten your video store with arson until it orders this. film, which has been available on MPI Home Video since Octo­ber 1988. Also, one final piece of advice: I saw this film with my girlfriend when it came to the theater. Don't make the same mistake. 
Andy Warhol's Bad (Directed by Jed Johnson) 
More mainstream than most of the War­hol films, the story centers around a ma­dame and herladies-for-hire. These females are hired to commit wanton acts ofviolence and murder by people who want certain problems solved. A scene involving an infant is undoubtedly the most repulsive I have ever encountered. The film is a joy in its lighthearted and subtle approach to evil humor. 
Andy Warhol's Trash (Directed by Paul Morrissey) A quaint film about a heroin addict who is constantly pressured into having sex but 
can't rise to the occasion due to his drug problem. All the characters are nude for most of the film, which is slow-moving at first but becomes hysterical. 
I also suggest you experience other War­hol films such asFlesh.,Dracula, andFrank­enstein. 
Liquid Sky (Directed by Slava Tuskennan) 
This incredibly visual experience also deals with drugs. Miniature aliens in search of heroin camp out on an apartment rooftop of an androgenous, bisexual model and her lesbian performance artist lover. While the model is raped in her apartment, the aliens learn that a chemical released during orgasm is similar to heroin. When the n'rodel's part­ners start dropping dead during climax -due to the aliens' addiction -she realizes that something is amiss. A bizarre film -tie down the the faint hearted and make them watch! 
Female Trouble (Directed by John Waters) 
The lighter of Waters' "exercises in filth," the story unfolds with Divine(a 300 pound transvestite) runµing away from home, engaging in sex with him/herself (probably a screen first) and delivering her own child. She soon enters the care of two beauty salon owners who want to use Divine as proofoftheir theory that Crime is Beauty. That's right, an acid scared face, injections of eyeliner, and multiple murders merely enhance Divine's radiance. What could be left but the Academy Award of crime: the electric chair. 
The film also includes.an outstandingly horrendous performance by Edith Massey, 
a.k.a. The Egg Lady (from Pink Flamingos fame). 
Again, I suggest other Waters films, such as Pink Flamingos, Desperated Living, and Polyester. ¦

Editorial 

Vote Breslin and Kinkopf
A !though the number of candidates for student body president, or king as the case may be, has decreased dramatically since last year's election, the quantity of qualified candidates has increased. Three tickets boast much leadership experience in the form ofeither student government or hall gov­ernment, while the fourth, Dan Fahey and his ministers, sheds some humorous light on an otherwise serious matter. All joking aside, the ticket of Matt Breslin and Dave Kinkopf stands above the rest of the field. Scholastic endorses this particular combination not necessarily because of their ideas, but because ofa strong confidence in their ability to assure the platform they have presented is carried out to its fullest potential. Breslin, the current junior class president has demonstrated an effective ability to serve the social needs of the students. Kinkopf, who served as the sophomore class president and president of the freshman advisory council, holds a very clear grasp ofthe intellectual life on campus. He has served as the chairman with regard to intellectual life while working on a board of trustees report. It is this combina­tion ofdiverse interests that propel this particular ticket to the forefront ofstudent government. Many of the ideas presented by the separate tickets appear to overlap. Breslin and Kinkopf, however, have exibited themselves most capable of manifesting their thought into realities. The ticket ofTom Rask and Melissa Smith certainly warrant attention with their enthusiastic outlook toward student government, an organization to which they are by no means newcomers. With respect to McTamaney and Russell the old adage "actions speak louder than words" appears to be applicable. When their names were mentionned to fellow HPC members, the response always entailled the phrase "quiet but effective." Perhaps the most intriguing ticket was thatofDan Fahey which should, in no way, be construed as a joke. He and his ministers are serious about bringing a light-hearted atmosphere to the campaign. As far as the senate races are concerned, John Krotzer and Dan Hoag will be running unopposed in their respective districts. A clearly superior candidate has not emerged in either district one or in district two. With regard to district four, the Scholastic endorses Sigi Loya. Despite the serious challenge of these candidates, the Breslin/ Kinkopf ticket will deliver. They deserve your vote.
