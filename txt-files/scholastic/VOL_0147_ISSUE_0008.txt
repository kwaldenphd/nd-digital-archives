There's more at stake than what can play at a fi Im festiva I 
0 ne week into the spring 2006 semester, the Rev. John I. . Jenkins, C.S.C., delivered his address, "Academic Freedom and Catholic Character: An Invitation to Reflection and Response," the content of which since has become an increasingly debated topic among those affiliated with the University of Notre Dame. The speech, in a most succinct and uncontroversial retelling, outlines Jenkins' desire to uphold Notre Dame's distinct mission as a university founded upon Catholicism while at the same time maintaining the university's status as a premier educational institu­tion. However, as evidenced by the scores of passionately composed "Viewpoint" letters that have been appearing in The Observer since the delivery of the speech on Jan. 24, 2006, by those both in favor ofand in opposition to Jenkins and the ideas set forth in his address, ... ther~ appears to be far more at stake with regards to the future of the 
upiversity th.an merely ensuring Notre _Dame's continued presencein .. the national rankings as a top 20 U:11iversity or fostering a Catholic, faith-based atmosphere on campus. 
As many have noted, Notre Dame has reached a turning point in its history, a place from which, ifit acts appropriately, it can evolve _into an even greater, more elite institution. But while the debatesJhat-have ·been 
·raging over Jenkins' speech seem to be focused largely on whether or not 
•the university should ban performances ofthe "Vagina Monologues" and 
· the Queer Film Festival, seemingly suggesting that the continuation or cessation of such events will decide the fate of the university, Scholastic wonders if the very premise behind Jenkins' speech won't be more detri­mental to the integrity of the university than a controversial play or the showing of a few films ever could be. 
Indeed, the distrustful attitude thatJenkins seems to have taken toward the student body is disconcerting to say the least, and the presumption that a student's Catholic faith will be compromised ifhe or she is exposed to a viewpoint that runs contrary to Catholicism is, well, rather insulting. And although Notre Dame's own Department ofTheology functions under the rubric of "faith seeking understanding" -a primer that is taught in every intro-level theology cours(;! -it appears as thoughJenkins doesn't trust that Notre Dame stu~ents will be able to discern what's right from what's wrong. 
The question then remains: What kind of Catholics does Notre Dame strive to produce? Is it complicit in educating unquestioning, obedient Catholics who adhere to their faith for no other reason than it's what they've been told to do? Or should Notre Dame attempt to yield Catholics who are strong in their faith, not because they've been indoctrinated to . do so, but rather because their faith has withstood the test ofsecularism? Regina Coll, professional specialist in the Department ofTheology, once wrote, "Believing or doing what we are told is not in itself virtuous: I tis not in itself Christian. Obedience is often a lack ofcourage and responsibility under the guise ofvirtue." Ifthis is to be taken as true, perhaps the only way for Notre Dame to truly balance its pursuit of academic excellence and Catholic integrity is for it to have the courage to trust that through the process of intellectual questioning and self-examination its students 
will arrive at a version of Catholicism that is consistent with the values that the university strives to uphold. @

Cyberspace 
Two Notre Dame professors create an online journal to further sci~ntific debates 
• Daric Snyder and cai:hy si:einmeb 
aily stories on controversial scientific topics such as stem cell 

cf). 
. : research, assisted suicide and human cloning grip countless 
headlines in the media. These highly debated issues involve complex ethical and scientific concepts that can be difficult for members ofthe general population to comprehend. Anew online journal at Notre Dame hopes to bring needed clarity to these issues. 
Within the next two weeks, the Reilly Center for Science, Technology and Values will launch the "Reilly Center Reports." The online journal will publish writings on a variety ofethically controversial science topics. For the issues addressed, the Web journal will provide multiple articles that offer various perspectives on each debate and will explore both moral and scientific aspects ofthe debates. 
Two Notre Dame faculty members, theology professor Gerald McK.­enny and philosophy professor Don Howard, organized the journal. McKenny, often contacted by the media as an authority on biomedi­cal ethics, conceived the idea of the journal. Through his interactions with reporters in the media, McKenny discovered that there are no helpful resources available for those who need to accurately report on these issues, yet lack background knowledge of technology and ethics. McKenny approached Howard with the notion ofa comprehensive Web journal. Working through the Reilly Center, they turned the idea into a working resource that will be accessible to all those interested in issues
._, relating to scientific ethics. "We want it to be responsible and useful," 
McKenny says. · 
The first issue ofthe "Reilly Center Reports" will focus on the conten­tious intellectual quarrel over evolution and intelligent design. Featuring the perspectives of four Catholic and three non-Catholic contributors, the issue intends to cover the full scope ofthought on the debate. McK­enny would like the journal "to be somewhere between an op-ed and an academic piece," providing clearly argued positions on each topic, as well as concise explanations ofthe underlying science and technology. 
Ultimately, McK.enny hopes to.make the "Reilly Center Reports" a preeminent source ofcredible academic thought on controversial scien­tific and ethical issues.

As freshmen, Black and Martinez have no experience in Notre Dame student government; both, however, held leadership posi­tions during high school. Although their credentials at Notre Dame are lacking, both candidates are involved in Circle K ser­vice activities, and Martinez is a member ofthe Pre-Law Society and Spanish Club. Black attended multiple forums sponsored by currentstudent government and feels that improvements can be made. "My friends and I would sit down and discuss the issues ofNotre Dame and figure out what could we do to make it bet­ter," Black says. "We decided there were things that needed to be addressed." 

Black-Martinez puts forward a four-plank platform on their Web site, consisting of community relations, gender relations, dining hall reform and bowl tickets. The pair addressed only their first two planks in their interview with Scholastic, stating that both community and gender relations have not been adequately addressed bythe Baron-Shappell administration. Black says the recently created student government committee on community relations "is a good start" and "would be a foundation" for the Black-Martinez administration. They propose a loosely outlined athlete-mentor program in which local children are invited to come to campus to experience the Notre Dame spirit, which would, according to Martinez, "create a better image for the university," especially in light ofthe noise ordinance. The Black-Martinez ticket wants to approach the issues ofgender relations and diversity by taking action and "chal­lenging the student body to meet us halfway." The pair also proposes a once-a-year, after-parietals lock-in program reminiscent ofthe Freshman Orientation Domer Fest. . With games and food from 2 a.m. until 8 a.m., Martinez-Black feels that the proposed lock-in is another way to integrate the genders. Martinez addressed dining hall reform in passing, proposing the transfer ofdining hall meals to flex points. Martinez-Black did not address its plan for bowl tickets but did state that its "opponents are really 
just beating around the bush with forums; we want to take action."

For Laws, the decision to run for student body president did not come easily. After serving as class president his freshman and sophomore years, participating in the Council ofRepresentatives 
· and being involved with the Teacher and Course Evaluation Ad Hoc Committee his junior year, Laws was frustrated with student government. "I was going to opt out and jusi:focus on my senior year," Laws says, "but I thought and prayed about this over break and decided to run." Laws found a running mate in Costa, an active member of the Student Union Board (SUB). Costa works for the student government communications department and is the director of SUB's AcoustiCafe. "I've learned a lot this year from working with other student leaders," Costa says. Costa also ran for student body vice president as a freshman. 
A more accessible, attentive student government stands as the central issue in the Laws-Costa platform. "We saw that Notre Dameis producing great leaders a:nd we want to tap into that more," Laws says. The candidates intend to bring student government business beyond its office in LaFortune Student Center, holding open meetings around campus and overhauling the student government Web site into a useful resource for information and participation. Laws and Costa also plan to encourage students to speak their minds and "Stick it to Jenkins" by providing a life-sized poster of the university president on which students will be able to place sticky notes with their concerns.Ad­ditionally, Laws-Costa intends to focus on minority issues at Notre Dame, seeking to form a black student union as a prototype for similar organizations that could serve various minority groups on campus. 
Laws-Costa promises other ~irect improvements to student life'. In the dining halls, Laws-Costa wants to keep North Dining Hall open until 9 p.m. during the week, add more Grab 'n' Go options, and provide bigger to-go cups. They intend to coordinate with .the law sch6oland i:he university to provide legal counseling for students in a variety ·of situations. Laws-Costa also wishes to create student-only pep rallies on Thursdays before football games.

Laws and Costa believe that their loyalty to ·the voice of the student body distinguishes their ticket. "Our plat­form isn't just our personal ideas," Laws says, "it's a platform that's inclusive and built from a collective standpoint." For Laws-Costa, strident government works as a bridge between the students and the 
· administration, collecting the opinions of the strident body. On the current debate over academic freedom, the candidates !.assert that student govern.ment · should ­·· be _fully involved.

They're experienced, they've demonstrated their ability and they have a plan. With six combined years on student govern­ment, current Student Body Vice President Lizzi Shappell and current Junior Class President Bill Andrichik have experienced both the policy and programming sides of student government and say that the student body can expect "tangible results" from them. Shappell, a political science and peace studies major, met 
. Andrichik, a political science and English major, in a compara­tive politics class, and the two juniors have had a strong working relationship ever since. As a result, the pair has a good chem­istry and seems capable of acting as a·cohesive unit. According to Shappell, what sets her and Andrichik apart from the rest is their "established working relationships with the administration." Because of their extensive time on student government, they have seen first-hand which ideas work and which will be swiftly snubbed by the administration. 
The Shappell-Andrichik platform is detailed, well researched and extremely ambitious. Dividing their ideas into seven categories, the platform, according to Shappell, "adds to the continuity ofthis year's administration with some innovation." The pair understands that some aspects of Shappell's equally ambitious platform with current Student Body President Dave Baron have yet to be realized, and both Shappell and Andrichik hope to accomplish such pending goals as providing students free newspapers through the College Readership Program next year. The candidates are adamant about improving community relations and want to establish a "Dialogue Summit," provide legal con­sultation for students living off campus and create a student government committee on community relations. Andrichik and particularly Shappell, who served as gender issues committee chair her sophomore year, also feel strongly about improving gender relations on campus and hope to erase the impression that "gender issues" implies "women's is­sues." Their most researched and realistic idea is for improved Grab 'n' Go items which would be chosen based on the results of a student survey. Their most ambitious idea calls for a Carry Forward Fund that could provide an additional $20,000 annually to either a variety of student organizations or to one large campus event.

Shappell and Andrichik see the decision made by the Rev.John I.Jenkins; C.S.C., regarding the state of academic freedom at Notre Dame as a potential "turning point for the university." Both cangidates support the performance of the "Vagina Monologues," but would rather focus on the larger issue ofacademic freedom than dwell on the oft-debated role ofthe contro­versial play at Notre Dame. They plan on using their student government experience and established "working relationships" with the university administration to ad­dress the issue of academic freedom and accomplish their other platform goals.

Though Wells has never been a member of Notre Dame's student government, she has extensive service experience. Wells has worked with the Gender Relations Center (GRC) as a FIRE Starter, or peer educator. She worked on a program called "Zahm's Gay?" which addressed homosexuality issues on campus. Wells is also amember of her dorm council, serving as the brother-sister dorm events commissioner, and she has been on the executive board for Habitat for Humanity. Chamberlain works for Circle K on a program called "There Are Children Here" (TACH). He also serves on the senate oversight committee and as a SafeWalker for Notre Dame Security/Police.

Wells' and Chamberlain's platform aims to increase student government unity and open discussion with the student body. They extend this open discussion in developing programming to meet student needs. For instance, Wells-Chamberlain has found that promotion ofevents pertaining to multicultural issues and gender relations would have the greatest impact on student attendance, not altering programming as previously was believed. Therefore, they hope to increase publicity for future events and create a buzz for such organizations as the Asian-American Association and the GRC. Wells and Chamberlain also envision improved relations between rectors and residents, say­ing better communication and less fear ofpunishment will improve the quality oflife in residence halls. They also are eyeing fiscal policies that would enable allocation of Student Activities funds towards more campus-wide events and better bands for "The Show." But Wells' and Chamberlain's lasting legacy would be to put more power in the hands of students. Whether it be through town hall-style forums or going into dorms to find out what the student voice is, Wells and Chamberlain are committed to making student government the voice of the student body. "With a student body as small as Notre Dame's," Chamberlain says, "I see no reason we cannot be a true democracy and less of a republic."

Wells and Chamberlain are forthright about their goals for student-administra­tion relations. "[On contentious issues], I thinkwe need to sit down and talk with the administration about their motives," Wells says. "If they make "sense, I don't think that we should question them, but rather try to come to a compromise." Wells and Chamberlain also clearly state that they want to hear what the students are saying. Theywill take the ideas that are presented to them in proposed forums with the stu­dent body directly to the administration 
· and push for the students' rights. All in all, Wells and, Chamberlain have simpli­fied their campaign to one general goal: improving Notre Dame. With a unified student government and a willingness to listen to the student body, they believe that they can make this goal a reality.

dent are not merely the ones with the best ideas; they are the ones with the knowledge, connections and determination to put their ideas into practice. Current Student Body President Dave Baron has served a successful term by taking feasible proposals and working tirelessly with an extensive network of associates to improve student life at Notre Dame. The student body would benefit from leaders dedicated to continuing the work that Baron has started. For this reason, Scholastic endorses junior Lizzi Shapp_ell and junior Bill Aridrichik for 2006-2007 student body president and vice president. 
As current student body vice president, Shappell is familiar with how student government functions, and she has established relationships with the stu­dents, administrators and trustees who can effect change at tp,e university. Her platform is detailed and well researched, ifheavy on policy rather than more tan­gible promises. But in the long run, her goals ofimproving community relations

His past involvement in events programming complements Shapell's policy-making experience well.

They also have the charisma to earn the respect of students and ad­ministrators alike. But their platform is not as comprehensive as that of Shap­pell-Andrichik. And while many oftheir more clearly articulated proposals -like campus-wide stall notes and student-only pep rallies -would be nice, they hardly address pressing student needs. Ryan Black and Catherine Martinez 
say they would bring a breath offresh air to student government, but as freshmen they have not been at the university long enough to fully understand student needs and what can be accomplished through student government. Sophomore Erica Wells and freshman George Chamberlain say their personalities and their emph~sis on communication will make them ef­fective leaders, but they have little in the way of a platform, which suggests that they are unprepared for the office that they seek. 
Student government will gain influence at Notre Dame only if it is led by effec­tive leaders who implement changes and gain the respect of administrators, even if they do not share their views. With this in mind, students should serve their own interests by voting for the candidates they feel are the most legitimate leaders, not just the ones that make the most promises or have the best personalities. Student government often is maligned at Notre Dame, but it is capable of doing good for students when under the proper leadership.

. is pretty ridiculous," he says. "First ofall, 'queer' is the proper 
academic term. The title made sense because it's called queer 
film in academia. To shift the title makes it less academically 
justified. Also, festivals are what film events are called. It's 
not a celebratory thing; it's a commonplace thing." 
Dean Mark Roche of the College of Arts and Letters, 
who participated in discussions about the event, recognizes 
the usage of the word "queer" in academia, but says that the 
term has connotations that are not consistent with Catholic 
teaching. "While 'queer studies' is the technical term for 
the academic study of homosexuality at most universities," 
Roche wrote in an e-mail, "it is not simply the disinterested 
study of homosexuality, but includes an affirmation of ho­
mosexuality as legitimate practice in a way that is contrary, 
to the position of the Catholic Church. In that sense it is a 
value-laden term." 
Roche wrote that while "festival" is the "technical term" 
for events like this one, "The net effect of the previous title 
was that attention was diverted from the study of films that 
deserve our attention to a focus on the event as advocacy, 
whether real or perceived [ ...] In the end the decision ofthe 
organizers was not to focus on the moralityofhomosexuality 
but instead to focus on the films themselves." 
FITProfessor Pamela Wocjik, who is the faculty advisor 
for the event, agrees with Roche that it is important for the 
event to focus on the films and not morality. "This is·not an 
event thatis about promoting or denigrating homosexuality," 
Wocjik says. "It is about showing and discussing films that 
emerge from or represent homosexuality. And to me that is 
a big difference. The panels involve people who are discuss­
ing films, not morality. It's about films and filmmakers and 
film studies."

, I 
ou know that nauseating feeling 
you get when Notre Dame loses 
to Boston Coliege in football? 
p y that by two (maybe three) and you'll get the sickening sensation that comes from watching the performance of the men's basketball team, which re­cently has had an unfortunate knack for losing in style. The Irish have lost eight Big East Conference games (including five straight) by an average of 3.25 points per game and 26 points total. Three of those losses have come in overtime and two ofthose in double overtime. Big East coaches and college basketball fans alike are starting to take notice ofthe plight of the Irish. "There's a part ofme that abso­lutely feels sick inside for Notre Dame," Louisville Head Coach Rick Pitino said after defeating the Irish 89-86 in overtime last Saturday. Why is this team so close, but yet so far? 
Consider the various ways Notre Dame has floundered its conference games: A fall-away jumper by Marquette with 1.1 seconds left; an uncontested tip-in by Vil­lanova with 1.7 seconds left; a three-point shot at the buzzer by Louisville. It's like a cruel, heartless soap opera. But it's not· like this Irish team isn't any good. In fact, they are fourth in points per game in the Big East with 75.8. However, their of­fensive prowess has not been able to compensate for the defensive meltdowns that haye cost the Irish time and time again. 
It's mind-boggling how a once­auspicious program that made a Sweet-16 appearance in the 2003 NCAA tournament has spiraled downward so quickly. Once shoot­ing for a perennial NCAA tourna­ment bid, the Irish might not even make their own conference tournament! Only 12 of 16 teams in the revamped Big East get an invite to New York City. "We're trying to claw our way back to New York," Notre Dame Head Coach Mike Brey said after the Villanova game on Jan. 28, 2006. "It's going to be a dogfight." And if the Irish don't make it to the Big East Tournament? Some heads might face the guillotine. The Irish are on pace to have their first losing conference record since 1999. Some assistant coaches might be shown the door -or, do I dare say -perhaps Brey himself? That might be a stretch, considering he's under contract until 2010, but we all know that contracts no longer guarantee job security at Notre Dame. Thinkformer Head Coach Tyrone Willingham. 
The Irish continue to say the things a team in dire straits should say after a series of heartbreaking losses. "We're going to keep our heads up," Brey offered after the Villanova game. "All we can do is keep giving ourselves chances." But there comes a point where talk like this be­comes redundant, and it seems as though "trying hard" is becoming a questionable virtue for Notre Dame. It has taken them nowhere but the cellar; they're No. 15 out of 16 teams in the Big East. 
We all hope that Notre Dame and Brey get it together. The Irish will need to win at least five more games to even have a chance at securing a spot at Madison Square Garden for the Big East Tourna­ment. You can't help but commend their effort to continue to fight with what they've been through. But in the end, they won't be defined by their fighting spirit but rather -as shallow and objective as it is -by their record. And from that viewpoint, they stink. ,~

OUR CALLS 
SPORT: WOMEN'S BASKETBALL OPPONENT: DEPAUL WHERE: DEPAUL ATHLETIC CENTER WHEN: SUNDAY, FEB. 12, 4:00 P.M. CST 
Michael Kim ........~P.~~~~ ~1i.~c_>~ .................................................... ; Although women's basketball holds 14-8 · overall record, it is struggling to a 5-6 record in the new Big East Conference. The Irish are coming off a tough 68-65 overtime loss to Villanova at the Joyce Center last Tuesday, a loss in which the Irish erased a 21-point deficit. Notre Dame faces a stiff challenge against a desperate DePaul team looking for critical conference wins as well. The last time the Irish played the Blue Demons, they were pushed to the limit and barely squeezed a 78-75 victory at home. Senior guard Megan Duffy, with her team­leading 15.7 points per game, will have to rally her troops with her leadership and experience. She has been struggling with confidence issues beyond the arc, and she'll have to sure up her stroke down the stretch, which includes a game against conference leader Connecticut. As for this game, I see the Irish squeezing out another tough one against DePaul, 65-62.

•Michael Kim
The statement "Notre Dame is just a football school" echoes throughout campus. While this stereotype is easy to believe considering the amount of media attention and rev­enue the gridiron sport generates for the university, itis simply untrue. Believe it or not, football wasn't even the most popu­lar sport on campus in the mid-1800s as baseball held that distinction. Football's legendary status didn't evolve until the 1920s with the arrival of a relatively un­known Norwegian named Knute Rockne, who was more concerned with building a track and field program than a national championship football team. It is undeniable that football is the crown jewel at Notre Dame, but the other 25 varsity sports are beginning to pull themselves out of the sizeable shadow that football casts and are developing their own identities. This is something Notre Dame Athletic.Director Kevin White has sought since his appointment to the position on Mar. 13, 2000. White was urged by former university President Rev. Edward Malloy, C.S.C., to make the non-football sports competitive in order to make a serious run every year at the NA CDA Directors' Cup, given to the best all-around ath­letics program in the 
country. Notre Dame 
has placed 11th 
_·'-' "  , ,  . •~­.... ·  '.:)­_ ·:.-.  three times (1993-94,  
·.  1995-96,  
000-01),  
thehigh­ 
ranking  
they have  
ever achieved.  
White has honored  
Malloy's request, making  
significant changes in the  

athletic program. When he took the helm, only 11 ofthe 26 var­sity sports had scholarships 
available, making' it very difficult to compete with perennial all-around ath­letic powers like Stanford and UCLA. In his six years as athletic director, White 
has raised the funds to provide the maxi­mum amount ofscholarships allotted by the NCAA-to virtually every sport at Notre Dame. He has also made it a goal to gradually improve the facilities, as evidenced by the construction of the new Guglielmina Athletics Complex, which opened in the summer of 2005. More importantly, White has maintained the academic integrity of Notre Dame in athletics, contributing to its status as one of the top-performing institutions in terms ofgraduation rates. In the most recent Graduate Success Rate compiled by the NCAA, Notre Dame was ranked first, with 16 ofthe 20 athletic programs evaluated having graduation rates of 100 percent and none below 90 percent. 
It wasn't always this way. "When I first came here, basketball and football was the athletic program. Every other sport was like the stepchild," says Joe Piane, head coach of track and field and men's cross country for 31 years atNotreDame. "But now, there's an expectation ofexcellence." Piane and his teams have embraced the lofty expectations setby White. With the help ofimproved facilities and increased scholarships, men's cross country has been a perennial contender in the Big East Championship and finished third last November in the NCAA Cross Country · Championships, while the women fin­ished seventh. Their stellar performances have racked up 154points ofthe 412 total for Notre Dame in the race for the 2005­2006 Directors' -Cup, which currently puts the Irish first in the standings ahead of Penn State (308.S}agd Stanford (282). The same sports that were once neglected are now making significant contributions to Notre Dame's ultimate athletic goal of winning the Director's Cup. 
Cross Country isn't the only sport showing signs of potential to become a consistent' contender on the national stage. The Olympic sports -as they are appropriately called -are also helping the Notre Dame athletic program build its versatility. Women's soccer has won two NCAA national championships, most recently in 2004. The Irish are the only teamother than North Carolinato have multiple soccer championships. Add the d0minating fencing proghm.which has won seven NCAA Team Championships (1977, '78, '86, '87, '94, '03, '05), and you have multiple national powerhouse teams at Notre Dame. 
Women's volleyball is pushing to be a national power as -well, ·finishing with its highest-ever final ranking last year. at• No. 12 in the CSTV/AVCA Division I Coaches' Top 25 poll. During the 2005 season, women's volleyball peaked as high as No: 5 in the rankings and knocked off six ranked teams including perennial contenders No. 3 Florida and No. 19

Flashes ofbrilliance are to be found al­most everywhere in the athletic program. Men's baseball continues to defy the cold midwestern weather and make serious runs at the College World Series annually. Men's tennis claimed its 1,000th victory lastJanuary over No. 18 North Carolina to become only the sixth Division I school to accomplish the feat in men's tennis. Women's tennis boasts the No. 1 doubles team in the nation with twin sisters Ca­trina and Christia,n Thompson. Men's soccer also made news this year when they knocked off heavily favored and two-time NCAA defending champion Indiana 2-0 in the second round ofthe NCAA Cham­pionship on Nov. 22, 2005. 
Ofthe 26 sports atNotre Dame, 13 are currently ranked national­ly. It is remarkable

progress considering that none of these sports just a few years ago had sufficient resources to compete consistently on a national level. Notre Dame has come a long way in building parity ~mong its athletic program by remaining firm on its ambitious mission of being the best all­around athletic program. However, they still have a ways to go. "You can't expect to go from 15th to first," Pianesays. "You just have to keep creeping up." Although there is much room to improve, the Irish are closer than they have ever been.

intertwined with the history of the uni­versity, but the other 25 sports are starting to chip away at the notion and slowly but surely are gaining national recognition. "I thinkyou have to earn that over time," saysJohn Heisler, senior associate Athlet­ics Director at Notre Dame. "One or two years will make an impression on people, butputtingyourselfinposition year after year and establishing yourself is the way to do it." With the upward trend ofthese Irish teams and a gradual improvement on athletic facilities, Notre Dame just might find itself one day defeating all odds to claim the title of being the best athletic institution in the country. 0

me tell you a story-a fairy• 
le, ifyou will. Imagine a teen­
er, battling a harsh upbringing, who meets a life-changing mentor. This 
tutor takes the boy under his wing and 
cultivates him into a man -a man who 
rises to the most revered stage in his trade. 
But on his way to greatness, the young 
man stumbles· and again seeks guidance 
from his old teacher. After receiving his 
mentor's counsel, the man returns to the 
stage and achieves the greatest honor 
in his craft in the very place from 
which he rose up. And 
he lives happily ever 
after. ·

the opposing defensive line or the streets 
of Detroit-on which he was raised. 
Bettis' ability to find opportunities and 

capitalize on them -so evident when he is on the football field -extends to his life off the field, as well. As a teenager at Mackenzie High School, Bettis took up football so he could get a schol­arship to pay for his college education; little did he know that it would become his future call­ing. Bettis was recruited as a senior by Lou Holtz, then the head· coach of the University of Notre Dame. Although Bettis did not fit the mold for a traditional 
running back, Holtz saw some­thing in the short, stocky kid from Michigan, which .. was heart. Under Holtz,. fBettis learned to muscle his, · way into the end zone and ·then into the National Foot­.·ball League. He was drafted by . :the Los Angeles Rams (later the ,. St. Louis Rams) after only his

'[/COUNTERPOINT 
s your vote matter? 
! think that student government definitely gets things done. It's crazy to think that when candidates run for election here, the promises they make may actually come true. Part of me is still stuck in the high school student government mentality where the "platform" was essentially saying "vote for me and. there will be free ice cream ... everyday ... the whole year." I was actually student council president in eighth grade at my grammar school and I did ... nothing. Really. Tragically, at my high school student government didn't do much more. Basically, there never were any platforms, and duties included reading announcements over the PA system and decorating before prom -always with balloons. Notre Dame is my first real experi­ence with a student government that accomplishes things and doesn't just serve as a resume filler. When candidates say they will strive to achieve certain goals, they are serious. The current president and vice president have truly set their platforms in motion. They actively took steps to improve university relations with the rest of the South Bend community, meeting with the city council and working with the mayor. In addition, to-go cups at the dining hall? The thought had never crossed my mind, but they were promised, and there they are. Members of the student government at Notre Dame stand behind their platforms and work to the best of their abilities to fulfill their promises. No one is promising free ice cream forever, but promis­ing real things that, when set into practice, will improve our college experience ... and not cause a stomachache. _, 0 

Jknow nothing about Notre Dame student gov­ernment: Therefore, it's probably not my place to give an· opinion about its ineffectiveness. However, I believe that my ignorance on the issue shows student government has no real leverage on the university. If the student government actually accomplished something meaningful, I thinkI would hear about it, considering I'm a student. As long as the university is run by a president and alumni, the wants and needs of the student government aren't going to be taken seriously. The university presently operates with policies and rules that work and have worked in the past. Students simply don't have the power to . change much, and this is why I think student government is good opportunity to discuss issues but not to actually change them. I do, however, respect the candidates who stated they will fight for larger to-go cups. The current . . cups resemble all the other small containers of quick consumption that are ubiquitous on campus, rather than an · actual beverage cup. · So voting in the election is not high on my list of priorities. Why vote for candidates who aren't going to be · able to accomplish anything? And if I 
· decided to vote, would it really affect the election? Not to burst anyone's bubble, but your vote doesn't matter. One out of 8,000 is _a very small percentage, 9r, .in other words, insignificant. One person's vote doesn't matter and never will. Ifvoting did matter, more than 64 percent of the nation would vote in · order to decide our president, the man who willde­cidethefoture ofthis country. I'mbetting the Notre Danie turnout will be even lower than that. Student government possesses an extremely limited amount ofpower; it is as irrelevant as my vote. Someone does have to win, though, so here's to the candidates who will give me a bigger cup. ' @
