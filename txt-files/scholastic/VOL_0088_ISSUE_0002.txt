This week the IRISH meet the Illini in their initial tilt, and will start a series of football thrills that should open Jablonski’s eyes to the fact that there are no miracles being staged this year. Each Notre Dame victory will be a step closer to a vanquished Army.
SACK HOUNDS ON THE MARCH:
Musicians are generally known to be an untiring lot when entertaining the public. Last Monday afternoon, however, when H. Lee Hope was surveying the first turnout in the band room, he was deeply touched by the tired, weary, worn-out expressions that appeared on the upturned faces of his faithful followers. Always on the alert, Mr. Hope thought deeply for a moment and then said in a serious voice, “Cheer up boys. If all goes according to plan, we’ll be the first University band to play an entire program from the prone position.”

When last heard from, G. A. number one and two were very happy. Mort Synn, who spent last week in the confines of his locker, was driven out by a fire caused from an overturned lantern he

A Representative Student Body
According to Head Coach Frank Leahy, Notre Dame will have “another representative team this fall.” Of this we can be sure for we have the material plus a fine coaching staff, and the rich heritage and traditions of great Irish teams of the past spurring us on to even greater heights. However, the question at hand now is not one of a representative team but of a representative student body!
For those of us who are making the trip to Champaign tomorrow to see the Fighting Irish battle the Fighting Illini now is the time for a little sober thought and reflection, for remember we will be as much on parade as the team, if not more so.
As Notre Dame men we have a tremendous responsibility in our manners, behavior, and way of life. Wherever we go we are under close scrutiny by those who are anxious to catch Notre Dame off guard. Particularly when we are in a crowd we are the pacemakers, and by our actions so the school is judged.
Our teams have covered our school with glory in the past, and they will continue to do so in the future, but the battles they win on the gridiron are not nearly as important as the victories we score in the stands.
Meet Don Birren — The Man Responsible For This Year's 'Scholastic' Cartoons
A cartoonist who scorns cartooning . .. that’s Don Birren, the Scholastic’s new cartoonist this semester. Don, a second semester senior, Chicagoan, Sorinite, and Fine Arts major disclaims serious ambition in the field of cartooning because there are too many cartoonists already; original ideas are too few and far between to bring home any regular bacon. Originality is the keynote; as Don says, “If you’re not original, you’re not a success.”
Don joined the E.R.C. back in 1942, went to the wars when the E.R.C. program came out from behind its sheep’s clothing. This is his first semester back at ND. While in the Army, he worked as an artist with the Army Visual Aid program before going overseas, where he languished in an Army Engineering Utility outfit in New Caledonia.
Although he’s an art major, Don says he’s really more interested in poetry, and has a new book of poetry awaiting a publisher. His verse is in the style of
Victory or defeat on the field may soon be forgotten. Victory or defeat in the stands will leave an indelible mark on our characters, and a lasting impression on the thousands of people who witness it.
The student body this year is much more mature than those we had here at Notre Dame four or five years ago. For this reason, we should be the best representative student body we every had. We know the meaning of self-discipline and of the place it has in our well ordered lives. Tomorrow is the time to practice that self-discipline more than ever before, for there is a tendency to let down when away from the school, and we can’t afford to let down. Too much depends on us.
We should enjoy the game sure, and cheer our heads off, but remember we are Notre Dame men, and have an obligation to our parents, ourselves, our school and—our God! As if this were not enough incentive, remember that the Army trip depends on the pattern of our behavior tomorrow.
Being a Notre Dame man, a part of that great representative student body, is not easy. It calls for stamina and plenty of good sportsmanship.
—James A. Clemens, Jr.
Whitman and Sandburg, whom he admires greatly. Asked about which professional cartoonists he preferred, Don said he liked George Price and James Thurber, who are good because of their simplicity.
Still single, Don isn’t planning marriage soon. He has done some amateur boxing, plays handball frequently, tries generally to keep in shape. Working on cartoons “at the instigation of the Scholastic,” he says that although it’s only a hobby, he likes to get a laugh out of his own jokes.

1,000 Irish To Match Cadet Cheers Nov. 9
By ED SNYDER
EFFORTS TO FIND STUDENT ROOMS FELL TO ND's 'OPERATION HOUSING'
By JACK TINKLE
Approximately 1,000 Notre Dame men will be among the throng of 80,000 spectators who will pack Yankee Stadium on Nov. 9 to see Army’s football caisson collide with Notre Dame’s post-war-Leahy Fighting Irish in what is touted to be THE grid classic of 1946.
Tentative plans for the trip were approved by University officials in the spring and it was named the official student trip for the year at that time. Final details will be worked out by the Student Council in the coming weeks.
Tentative plans call for two New York Central trains to leave the campus siding on Friday afternoon, Nov. 8, arriving in New York at 7:30 a.m. on the day of the game. Since this is an official trip, all Saturady classes will be cancelled.
Considerable difficulties have arisen, however, in obtaining hotel rooms in New York City. All possible efforts have been made to obtain sufficient rooms, but (Continued on Page 32)
Hall Elections Fill Council Berths, Select Officers Monday Evening
The semester’s activities were officially opened this week with the election of 21 Student Council members. Of this number three men compose the stay council, five are appointed by the Deans of the Colleges within the University, one member is elected by the Villagers Club, and the remaining twelve members are representatives from the resident halls on campus.
This year’s elections were characterized by a spirit of lively interest all over the campus which was due to the fact that many familiar faces have returned to “The Home of the Irish” after a few years absence. Pre-requisites foi' eligibility remained the same this year as in past years. A student, other than a first semester freshman, must have maintained an 80 average in all his studies and at no time must he have been
“Operation Housing,” the University of Notre Dame’s own project of atomic bomb proportions, was conducted this summer in an intensified effort to provide housing for all its married and single students. Now that things are settled down to a degree where a perspective can be gained, it appears that a vote of thanks is due to all those individuals and groups who aided in the campaign.
Room sharing may be one of the most . common characteristics for on-campus students, but even living indoors is a blessing for many married and single veterans who are crowded into rooms or apartments in South Bend or its environs. When the University decided to boost its maximum enrollment almost a thousand students in order to provide ex-servicemen full opportunity to complete their former education as quickly as possible, one of the most difficult problems facing officials was housing for this increased number. The problem was made doubly difficult by the fact that
suspended from the University.
F. Gerard Feeney of the College of Law, Joseph Cheney a Senior from Schuyler, N. Y., and Fred N. Hoover, also of the Law College, are the members of this year’s stay council. They are all members of last semester’s council and were elected at the close of the semester to supervise these elections and serve as supervisory members.
From the Villagers Club Art Clark was elected to represent all those off-campus students who live in South Bend and surrounding communities.
Appointed to represent the Colleges of the University were Leonard D. Bodkin, a senior from Warsaw, Ind., the College of Law; Thomas Leo McMahon of Corning, N. Y., the Commerce School; and Jack J. Myers of Delphos, Ohio, (Continued on Page 32)
many returning veterans were now two (or three, depending on circumstances), and more than a single room had to be found for “the family man.”
Last semester the University secured 117 housing units which at present are being rushed to completion as fast as critically-short materials can be obtained. Even then officials realized insufficient space was available, plus the fact that by midsummer it was known definitely that the temporary dwelling units would not be finished and ready fox- occupancy when the semester rolled around. Each of the 39 units will house three couples.
When the University fully realized the situation an appeal was made to home owners in and around South Bend to rent their vacant rooms to former veterans to enable them to .continue their education.
When the response to this appeal failed to reap sufficient fruits, a planned campaign was put into practice. This campaign made use of every available means and before it was over top ranking Notre Dame officers, several nonscholastic departments, and patriotic South Bend organizations had thrown their combined weight behind the project.	.
The campaign was started by the Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, president of Notre Dame, who made an appeal to the citizens of South Bend over station WSBT, the Tribime’s radio outlet. In his short talk, Father Cavanaugh pointed to past friendly relations of the body politic of the University with the citizens of South Bend and asked that the two again join resources to help lick this new problem. A second radio talk, over station WHOT, was given by the Rev. John J. Lane, C.S.C., director of veterans’ affairs at Notre Dame, whose office was most directly concerned with the problem.
Tied in with these talks was a well organized newspaper campaign. Daily ads were run in the South Bend Tri&-

Dr. Caparo, E.E. Prof.s Retires From Faculty
By ED SNYDER
When Dr. Jose Angel Caparo joined the faculty of Notre Dame in 1913, the University was an unknown little school in the middle west. Knute Rockne and Gus Dorais were “small time” names in football, experimenting with the forward pass, and World Wars were something unheard of.
Now some 33 years and two World Wars later, Dr. Caparo retires with the
Dr. Jose A. Caparo
title of Professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineering at one of the famed universities in the world.
A native of Cuzco, Peru, Dr. Caparo received his C.E. degree from Notre Dame in 1908. He remained at the University as a graduate instructor and was awarded his E.E. and M.C.E. degrees in 1909. Already possessor of three degrees, the doctor returned to his native South America where he picked up a fourth degree of Sc.D. from ths Univer-sidad de San Antonio in 1910.
From 1913 to 1917, he was Professor of Physics at Notre Dame. While Rockne and Dorais were making a name for the University on the gridiron and World War I was raging in Europe, the young professor added three more degrees to his repertoire—his M.S. in 1912, his M.E. and Ph.D. in 1913. When America entered the war, he went to Carnegie Tech as an instructor in radio mechanics and assistant in electrical engineering.
World War I ended in 1918 and Dr. Caparo returned to Notre Dame, where
10
he has served continuously for the past 28 years. In 1919, he attained his eighth college degree, an M.A. from the University of Chicago.
As Dr. Caparo looks back on his 33 years at Notre Dame, he can recall the University’s rapid growth in size and fame. He can recall Notre Dame’s meteoric rise to glory in football. He can recall the development of synthetic rubber by Father Nieuwland and other noted developments in other fields that have been accomplished here.
As Notre Dame looks back on Dr. Caparo, once head of its electrical engineering department and an esteemed professor in that field, she is deeply appreciative of his long, devoted and distinguished services. Through its president, Father John Cavanaugh, C.S.C., the University tells retiring Dr. Caparo, “Many generations of Notre Dame men will ever hold your name in veneration.”
Langford New Head of Language Dept.
By SHAUN McDERMOTT
Walter M. Langford, a member of the faculty since 1931 has been appointed head of the Department of Modern Languages to succeed Earl F. Langwell, who resigned last August to enter the insurance business, according to the Office of' the Director of Studies. Mr. Langford, who was graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1930 and received his M.M.L. degree at the Uni-versidad de Mexico in 1937, has been professor of Spanish and Portuguese and is considered an authority on Latin-American history and culture. Mr. Langwell was a member of the faculty since 1930 and headed the department since 1940.
Other faculty changes in the Arts and Letters school are: John Frederick Nims, associate professor of English, has returned after a leave of absence since July 1945 as visiting professor at St. Michael’s college of the University of Toronto; Thomas Bowyer Campbell, professor of History, has returned after a leave of absence since July 1945; Rev. Edward S. Shea, C.S.C., has been transferred to Kings College, Wilkes-Barre, Pa.; Francis J. Hanley, assistant professor of Art, has been granted a leave of absence and is appearing on the New York stage. It is believed that he is cast in State of the Union, the Pulitzer prize winning play.
Radio Club Meets Under New Advisor
By JACK HUMMEL
Last week, the Notre Dame Radio Club called its first meeting, planned to hit the air waves again. It was a turkey (show business jargon for a failure). Don Kiene, appointed club president, gathered the names of only 32 members. The reason: most members had afternoon classes, meeting announcements failed to state place.
They tried again on Thursday. The announcements of the second meeting assigned a place. Sixty-three members, among whom were old timers Bob Uhl, Bob Hartman, Hap Cordesan, and George LaBuda, attended it in Club’s Washington Hall Studios, heard Father Burke (Club’s faculty advisor for 11 years) give a half-hour farewell talk, praise Club’s productions of last year, emphasize the necessity for work, announce that Father Archibald M. McDowell was the new faculty advisor. He was retiring.
Father McDowell announced little known, perhaps new purpose of Club: to develop students’ talents in radio fields of production, direction, writing, acting, and announcing, said he wanted those students who planned to enter Radio as a life work or were merely interested in it as a hobby to join the club, .take part in its activities. He encouraged" the University faculty to prepare broadcast material of public and cultural interest, hoped Notre Dame would become recognized in America for its student radio programs much as Th^ Catholic University of America is for its theatre productions, asked students to make suggestions at any time. He believed the Club’s programs would be better written, acted, and directed since it had secured the latest model of a wire recorder, allegedly the first new equipment since the war.
Club ofiicials expressed a desire for even more members because of positions to be filled in production, direction, and especially script-writing departments. Some members were rather dubious in their outlook for the success of the Club’s production this year, even with the addition of a wire recorder. Time would tell.
It started to, this Wednesday, when two student writers and members of the Scholastic submitted a serial script to Father McDowell entitled: “Blue and Gold Escapades.” If accepted, it will perhaps be the first college serial on the American radio.
DINNER AT MORALE MANSION—Mr. and Mrs. Barnett feed Navy men who were aboard ship at Notre Dame during the war and spent their off-duty hours in the Barnett family circle. The reunion took place on Labor Day.
1
MORALE MANSION
By HERMAN HAMILTON. JR.
It all started with an invitation to dinner. After my first visit to a South Bend church since coming to Notre Dame I was approached by a very motherly-looking lady who extended me an invitation to join her family group for Sunday dinner. Gratefully I accepted her generous offer.
As soon as we reached her home the story began to break—the story of Mr. and Mrs. J. A. Barnett, dear to the hearts of many former Notre Dame boys.
During the war years while the Midshipmen’s school was at Notre Dame, each Sunday a few boys made their way to the First Baptist Church in South Bend. Each of these boys was extended the same invitation that I had received; in all some 30 had accepted before I had the opportunity. It seemed, however, that this invitation was more than an invitation to dinner—it was an invitation to become one of the Barnett family. The house was open- to the boys at all times. Everybody helped cook the meals and wash the dishes. Sunday after Sun
day ths house was filled with boys who played the piano, raised the cats, ate the grapes, or even slept in the guest room. Without reservation this was the boys’ home away from home. Mr. anu Mrs. Barnett became “Mom” and “Dad”; Lois and Paul were sister and brother.
Here an ambitious pianist, Ken Traxler, continued his studies under Mi's. Barnett, who in addition to her role as a “mother” of thirty is a music teacher. Harlan Shaw exhibited h’s skill as an artist. Lew Norton helped Paul keep his bicycle in trim. In his spare time from teaching school Mr. Barnett filled his hours in victory gardening, so many of .the former farm boys found great pleasure in assisting him. Numerous song sessions and gab-fests rounded out the curriculum of home activities while church attendance and Sunday School socials afforded the boys outside contacts.
As each group graduated and passed on to active duty there were always others to take their places. Letters from
all parts of the world returned to the Barnetts, sometimes as many as forty per week. Their letters were answered and in addition the family prepared a dope sheet for the boys in which the addresses of everyone were given. Due to this directory chance meetings of “Barnett boys” occurred in strange ports.
•Always there was talk of a post-war reunion in order that all of the Barnett boys might meet each other, so on Labor Day week-end reunion convened in the Barnett home. Barnett boys and some of their wives came from everywhere — Charles Gibbons from Meridian, Miss., Harlan and Marjorit Shaw from Abilene, Texas, Kenneth Traxler from Alachua, Fla., Lew Norton from Chino, Calif., James Sims from Woodville, Texas, Chester McCann from Henderson, Texas, Owen Downey from Hope, Ind., and Robert Knight with his bride from Redlands, Calif. The long weekend was a whirl of activities beginning with informal parties Friday and Satur
’11
day, including a group worship service at the First Baptist Church Sunday, extending through a beach party on Lake Michigan on Monday, and climaxed by the grand reunion, dinner on Wednesday night. The whole affair was one big party resounding with music and laughter.
But the reunion did not write finish to the story; the memories of it will add to the hope that it can be repeated in subsequent years when all can be present. All returned from the wars and are now scattered in many directions following their chosen vocations as private citizens. One, Roy E. Bacon, a graduate of the second Midshipmen’s school, returned to N. D. just two weeks before the 11th and last school graduated. He took a position as laboratory assistant in the Chemistry Department. This year he has a teaching fellowship at the University of Houston. Another, Ken Trax
ler, plans to study music at the Peabody Institute in Boston. Harlan Shaw aspires to the stage. The course of each is eagerly plotted by “Mother” Barnett.
From the small but hospitable beginning of an invitation to dinner this story gained such tremendous proportions that it has brought much joy to the home of the Barnett’s while bestirring a warm glow of thankfulness for the blessings

of home in the two score typical American boys.
So, this is how the two-story yellow house at 1116 Blaine Avenue in South Bend became known to many as “Morale Mansion.”
Maritain Article In Oct. "Review"
The October issue of the Review of Politics, which is published here on the campus, will contain an article of great importance for American Catholic philosophers. The article is called “The Person and the Common Good” and has been prepared by Jacques Maintain, noted philosopher and French Ambassador to the Holy See. The article, sent to Dr. Waldemar Gurian, was translated from the French by Prof. John J. Fitzgerald.
Maritain’s ideas on the relationship between personality and the common good have been the subject of a rather spirited debate among American Catholic philosophers. In his refutation of totalitarianism in government, Maintain has insisted on the importance of the human personality. In his distinction between the individual and the person, he finds an answer to those who maintain that the welfare of the people must be sacrificed for the common good as found in the modern totalitarian state.
Most of the criticism of Mr. Maintain has been about his definition of personality. In this article the French philosopher attempts to answer his critics and, at the same time, adds a perfecting note to his other famous philosophical writings. Among these writings are The Degrees of Knowledge, The Three Reformers, and Scholasticism.

Cinema Escapades
By JACK HUMMEL Radio and Theatre Editor
One of Paramount’s alleged ex-pulp magazine scribes, Richard Maibaum who also produced “O.S.S1.” with direction by Irving Pichal, probably saw the letters on the Office of Strategic Services’ door, decided to write a top-notch scenario about its wartime activities, instead wrote another pulp story in which all the main characters but hero John Martin (underplayed by glamor-tough Alan Ladd) are bumped off by Germans.
If Hollywood is wise, since “O.S.S.” is for the masses and not the muses, it will be one of the last productions based on a wartime theme of patriotic service. It is merely a Hollywood production of a piece of propaganda perhaps handed out by an Army Public Relations officer, and ends with arty, hilltop scene of occupation forces marching in France. Music background: The Field Artillery Song.
This week, for one hour, 47 minutes, at the Colfax, Ladd and 14 others, who should return to summer stock, act out a Strategic Services operation in the settings of Washington, San Francisco, London, and France.
Ladd heads a Service team of four-known as “Applejack,” leads them through series of adventure in which all but he are killed by gunfire, explosions, or German Gestapo agents. The policy of Strategic Services is expressed by the only woman on the team, played by Geraldine Fitzgerald, who, of course, appeals to Ladd: “I’m not a woman. You’re not a man. We’re only tools.” It is perhaps the best dialogue. Best characteristic of picture is that it has elements of realism more overshadowed than not by escapism. Photography and direction: stilted.
For those who want to see a vaguely humorous farce in which a newspaper editor (Keenan Wynn) pulls his publisher out of an asinine libel suit connected with a shocking item about a financial tycoon’s daughter (Esther Williams), and finally marries his own girl (Lucille Ball), “Easy To Wed” plays at the Colfax now. Editor’s reporter (Van Johnson) loves, swims, duck hunts, sings, finally gets libel suit dismissed, wins the daughter.
The only thing half-decent about the picture: the clowning and joking of Ball and Wynn. The vulgar part: laughs at marriage and divorce. Direction and Photography: technicolored. Acting: sophisticated and naive. Half and half.
CO-HOP DANCE
The Co-Hops will stage their first dance of the new school year Saturday night at the Indiana Club, 320 W. Jefferson Blvd., with Bud Simpson and his orchestra furnishing the music.
Co-Hop was organized in 1943 at Notre Dame and is composed of South Bend girls. Admission charges for the first dance will be 75c. Other Co-Hop hops are scheduled for Oct. 19, Oct. 26, and Nov. 2.
4-Year Scholarship Set Up By Mr. Reilly
A “sustained scholarship” to the University of Notre Dame, to be known as The Reilly-LaSalle Scholarship, has been established by Peter C. Reilly, Indianapolis industrialist and a member of the Associate Board of Lay Trustees at Notre Dame, according to an announcement by the University Committee on Scholarships.
The scholarship, of four-year tenure, is to be awarded annually to a member of the graduating class of LaSalle Academy, Providence, Rhode Island. The student, in orded to be eligible for the scholarship, is to be of good character, proficient in mathematics, and is to be within the first five of his class, if there is not too wide a difference between the first and fifth highest general scholastic average. If the difference is too wide, the selection should be made from the student whose general average is first, second, or third in the class. Choice of the scholar rests with officials of the LaSalle Academy.
Students who are recipients of the scholarship -will receive academic and residential expenses for the four year college course. If the scholar vacates the scholarship for military service and resumes it upon his discharge, the scholarship is to continue through a period equivalent to eight semesters.
Mr. Reilly, who established the scholarship, is president of the Reilly Tar and Chemical Corporation in Indianapolis. He has been a member of the Associate Board of Lay Trustees at Notre Dame for the past eleven years, and recently made a benefaction to Notre Dame of §1,000,000 for use in the field of chemistry and chemical engineering at the University. As a youth, Mr. Reilly attended the LaSalle Academy in Providence.
Mission Attendance Record Set at ND
By DANIEL O'NEILL
The annual mission which opens ths school year at the Univeristy was attended the past two weeks by the largest number of students that were ever present for this religious function. The church was well filled for both the morning and evening services.
The students of Breen-Phillips, Zahm, Cavanaugh, St. Edward’s, Sorin and Walsh halls attended the first week of the mission while the residents of Alumni, Dillon, Badin, Howard, Morrissey and Lyons halls plus off-campus men filled the church the second week.
The mission was delivered by. Rev. Michael Foran, C.S.C., of Syracuse, N. Y. graduated from Notre Dame in 1933, and Rev. Charles Callahan, C.S.C., of Paterson, N. J., a member of the graduating class of Notre Dame in 1937.
The missionaries spoke on the salvation of the soul, the danger of being in the state of mortal sin for which there is no excuse at the University of Notre Dame. They also discussed the meaning of a happy death, the final judgment and the vast amount of splendid work we can do by good example. ;-
During the two week period there were opportunities for consultation with either Father Foran or Father Callahan, and they spent every afternoon in hearing confessions. The Papal blessing was given at the closing of the mission.
SCHOLASTIC Receives All-Catholic Award
Highly commending the Scholastic staff for its work in the last school year, the Catholic School Press Association has awarded Notre Dame’s news magazine an All-Catholic rating, highest in its annual judging.
A board of three men, chosen from the faculty of the Marquette School of Journalism, made an extensive survey of all Catholic high schools and colleges in making the awards. The ratings are based upon a system which gives credit for seven distinctive features deemed to be important in a Catholic school periodical. The Scholastic was voted 2800 of a possible 3000 points, on the basis of the following: diffusion of Catholic thought and promotion of Catholic activity, enterprise and service to the school and community, editorial content and news coverage, physical appearance (typography, layout, and design), uniformity and consistency in style, headline construction and accuracy, and application of art to news and features.

BENNY GOODMAN'S EX-DRUMMER NOW POUNDS BOOKS ON CAMPUS
By EDWARD JOYCE
If Harry Yeager could squeeze his set of drums into 314 Howard, he would have the sweetest professional music this side of the Palais Royale flowing not too gently out his windows.
Harry’s whirlwind adventure in the major band circuits started in the summer of 1945, just a week after he was
DRUMMER BOY—Harry Yeager, who pounded the drums for Benny Goodman, gives the skins a work-out.
graduated from his home town high school in Collingswood, N. J. The tale from that point is strictly Horatio Alger.
In a restaurant, next to the theatre where they had just seen Benny Goodman, a friend and he were downing a midnight snack when they happened to meet Hymie Schertzer, who, at the time, was Goodman’s drummer boy. The scales started to tip in the high school boy’s favor. Hymie bemoaned the fact that he was being drafted and that B. G. needed a new man to take his place on the drums. Harry let slip that he played the skins. He blinked his eyes and upon opening them he was backstage giving out with an audition for the king of swing. Although, like Buddy Rich, he •doesn’t read music, the old master gave him a thumbs up. So, for the next few months Harry Yeager, age 19, was featured with one of the best bands in the country.
The spotlight of glamor blew a fuse after he worked the drums for a couple of weeks. When playing a theatre date
he’d be on the hop from 8 in the morning till 3 the next morning. Dance engagements weren’t much better.
Among the discs he made with the Goodman retinue are “Benny’s Bugle,” the 12 inch “Benny Rides Again,” and the “Wang-Wang Blues,” which appears in the Goodman sextet album.
Harry left the ensemble in the fall of ’45 to keep his health, but before he said “So long” to the clan he was on the Spotlight Band program and had basked in the glory of being a member of the Goodman crew when they won the Down Beat magazine award.
Benny, (with his wonderful offstage personality), will always be remembered by Harry as a perfectionist and also for the manner in which he featured his players as much as possible.
When the musical member of the Yeager family started his course in Aeronautical Engineering this September, a life long ambition to come to Notre Dame was realized.
Incidentally, if two or three fellows would like to stand the gaff of a good jam session to keep in trim, drop into his room and give him the word. .
Father Phelan Plans Institute Program
Plans for making the newly-founded Mediaeval Institute at the University of Notre Dame the center of mediaeval research in the United States were announced yesterday by the Very Reverend Gerald B. Phelan of Toronto, Canada, who has arrived here to assume his duties as Director of the Institute. Father Phelan had been president of the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies in Toronto since 1937.
“The Mediaeval Institute at Notre Dame,” declared Father Phelan, “is the only one of its kind in tlie United States The Pontifical Institute in Toronto is now a flourishing institution and we hope to develop the Notre Dame institute as the center of mediaeval research in the United States.”
Father Phelan praised the Notre Dame library, asserting it contains most of the great source material and collections necessary for mediaeval research.
“I have also found in the Notre Dame graduate school,” observed the new di
rector, “a considerable group of scholars trained and equipped to carry on work in mediaeval literature. I hope, through the cooperation of the heads of the departments in the Graduate School, to avail myself of their assistance on research projects which are being planned.”
Father Phelan hopes to announce, within the next two months, courses offered for students of the Institute, and to undertake regular work in the foundation beginning with the second semester.
The new director- said that Notre Dame has received a congratulatory letter on the new school from the eminent French historian of mediaeval philosophy, Professor Etienne Gilson of the College de France, who contributed much to the success of the Toronto Pontifical Institute.
Langford Assails Language Critics
By SHAUN McDERMOTT
In commenting on a recent article in Look magazine which stated that foreign languages, “as currently taught . . . are the greatest time-wasters in our school program,” Professor Walter Langford, newly appointed head of the Department of Modern Languages of the University, stated that such attacks, which have been made before, usually advocate a utilitarian point of view, completely ignoring the cultural and mind-training phase of education, and that languages are no more useless than any other subject which is little used after a student leaves school.
Admitting that it is impossible to learn completely any language in the time usually alloted, Professor Langford said that the present system aims at developing a reading knowledge of a language, especially for those students who will have recourse to technical and scientific manuals. In addition, for those who intend actually to use the spoken language, colleges offer- courses in conversation. In either case a grammatical background is necessary and, in addition to this fact, it does not follow that by speaking a language it can also be read.
Claiming that the attack on language teaching was ill-timed, the professor-pointed out that, due to present world conditions, we must strive for better relations with other nations and, in order to like other peoples, we must first know them, which can be done to a great * extent through knowledge of their language.

NFCCS Awards Vets Commission to N. D.
The National Federation of Catholic College Students awarded a national commission of Veterans Affairs to the University of Notre Dame at theii- national meeting held during June of this year at Regis College, Weston, Mass.
This national commission means that Notre Dame is the executive agency for Veterans Affairs in Catholic colleges throughout the United States. The Federation, or NFCCS, is a national organization whose aim is to coordinate among Catholic colleges special interest groups such as international relations, interAmerican affairs, Catholic action, and current economic affairs, to mention only a few. One institution is commissioned to establish headquarters for a designated special interest group and integrate the activities of the local and regional units within its sphere of activity. In the field of Veterans Affairs, Notre Dame has been given the national chairmanship. Thomas McCaffery, has been designated National Chairman, and Gerry Feeney of Howard, as National Vice-Chairman.
One project of the national commission on Veterans Affairs is to bring forcibly to the attention of the veteran in Catholic colleges serious problems confronting us as a nation and the veteran as a citizen of that nation. Relative information will be disseminated by a monthly bulletin concerning such topics as Marriage and Family Life in America, Political Parties Today, The USA in the World Picture, Political Ideologies, (Communism and Fascism.) This bulletin ‘is to be distributed on a national scale. Material for these bulletins are

to be obtained through the students here on the campus. Discussion groups are being formed at the present to carry this plan to its end. The groups will provide opportunity for students to be of service to themselves and Notre Dame in clarifying and discussing important topics of national and international scope. Students interested in joining these groups should contact Tom McCaffery, 216 Walsh, the National Chairman.
KC's Plan Drive
to Get 200 Members
By JACK MILES
Notre Dame Council No. 1477, Knights of- Columbus, has set its membership goal for the coming year at 200 new knights, according to James Sullivan, Grand Knight of the Council. Last year, he said, over 100 new members attained knighthood, and this year’s plans call for redoubled efforts on the part of the membership committee.
Anyone wishing to join the local council should contact Larry Turner, chairman of the membership committee, between 3:00 and 5:00 any day in the council chambers in the basement of Walsh hall. Plans are now under way for the council’s initial first-degree initiation of the year, which will take place within a month.
In line with the stepped-up activity program scheduled for the coming two semesters, the Knights held their first outing of the yeai- last Saturday at Cook’s grove, near Mishawaka. More than 150 members attended, and the picnic committee, headed by hard-working Art McGrath, met the challenge with an abundance of food and refreshments.
Grand Knight Sullivan has called a
meeting for Tuesday, Oct. 1, at 7:30 in the Council chambers, and all Knights should attend. Plans will be formulated then for the approaching first-degree exemplification, and important vacancies will be filled. It will be necessary at this meeting, to elect a new trustee to succeed Father Goodall, and to elect an inside guard to take the place of Johnny Dee, who has left school. A chaplain will also be appointed by the Grand Knight.
Under the aegis of Frank Caccia-paglia, the Lounge committee has inaugurated an interesting program for the coming football season. On the Saturdays .on which the team plays away from home, a radio will be set up in the Council lounge, and Knights will be welcomed in the lounge to listen to the game and relax.
It is imperative that all members of the local council, whether living on or off campus, stop in at the council chambers sometime during the next week and leave their addresses on the paper provided for that purpose on the council bulletin board. By doing this, they will insure their receipt of all council news, and notices of meetings, activities and initiations.
Materialism Decried At Bar Assoc. Meet
The “fundamental, inevitable relationship existing between God and all real law” is being challenged today by materialism, which denies God and morality, the Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., President of the University of Notre Dame, said here at the opening of the 50th Anniversary Meeting of the Indiana State Bar Association on Sept. 6.
Notre Dame was host to the meeting, which was attended by hundreds of delegates—leading attorneys and state, county and municipal officials from all parts of Indiana.
“I think,” Father Cavanaugh said, “that the challenge is presented dramatically in the hectic meetings of the United Nations organization, where God is arbitrarily shut out and another base is sought, for some reason or other, as a foundation of government and law.
“I think that the challenge strikes, too, at the essence of Americanism, if it is true that the essence of Americanism is expressed in the Declaration of Independence. For it seems clear that the Declaration of Independence assumes three fundamental truths: That there is a God, the creator of man; that all men are endowed by God with certain unalienable rights; that the whole reason for government is to protect these rights of men.”

Seven Clubs Attend First NFCCS Meet
The Notre Dame student committee of the National Federation of Catholic College Students held its first meeting of the current semester last Sunday afternoon and discussed plans for- its activity during the 1946-47 school year. Seven campus organizations were represented at the meeting, presided over by Pat O’Meara, sophomore architecture student from St. Louis, who is chairman of the local unit and president of the national organization.
The Rev. William Cunningham, C.S.C., chaplain of the Fort Wayne Region or NFCCS, and Father Theodore Hes-burgh, C.S.C., chaplain of the Notre Dame Veterans Club, participated in the meeting. Students representing campus organizations at the meeting were: Thomas McCaffery of the Vets Club; Patrick Nolan of the Economic Roundtable; Thomas Poole of the Inter-American Affairs Club; Frank Grimaldi of the Press Commission; Robert Reinders of the Rural Life Club; B. J. Bedard of the Catholic Action Club; and Elbert Burgsthaler of the Mass Club.
After O’Meara reported briefly to the gathering on the national council meeting held in Boston at which he was elected president and Notre Dame was granted the chairmanship of the National Commission for Veterans Affairs, the plans for the coming year were outlined. Locally the NFCCS committee will strengthen itself by inviting other campus organizations and special interest groups into the local committee where they can be introduced to relationships with activities similar to theirs on a regional and national scale.
Gerry Feeney, who represented the Student Council at last Sunday’s meeting, invited O’Meara to appear before the first meeting of the S.G.A. next week to present a resolution that the group be established as the permanent committee on campus to represent Notre Dame in NFCCS- activities on a regional and national scale.
The Fort Wayne Region of which Notre Dame is a member is holding three council meetings and one congress during the current school year. Each of the six schools in the region have two official delegates to the council. The first regional council meeting will be held -in the Rockne Memorial Lounge on the Notre Dame campus, Saturday, Oct. 19.
Reinders reported that the local Rural Life Club is making preparations to send delegates to the National Rural Life Conference to be held in Green Bay, Wis., Oct. 11 to 15.
Vets' Club Readies Social Schedule
By PHIL SHEA
Joe Dillon, president of the Vets Club, and, probably one of the busiest men on campus this semester, rolled over on his back and yawned vigorously as we ruthlessly snatched him from the arms of Morpheus the other- morning at the horrible hour of 6:45. Congenial Joe promptly thanked us, as he said it was time he was getting up anyway.
After a few informal introductions Joe presently began to give out with the news that we have been longing to hear for some time, namely, the plans of the Vets Club for the current semester.
Extensive plans are underway for the best in social functions. Those of us who were here last semester will recall the dances held at the Rockne Memorial
WO SAYS WNffDA AfMWttO/AfG? AIN'T YOU GOT ROOM?
under the sponorship of the Vets Club, and how well they were attended. More dances are in store, and announcements concerning them will follow in the near future.
During some of the coming long winter Sunday afternoons don’t be surprised to find yourself down on St. Mary’s lake skating to the tune of a special Vets Club sponsored skating party. Even if you don’t skate, there will probably be plenty of hot coffee to keep you warm.
Another smoker is in the making, during which the chief purpose of the meeting will be complete and uninterrupted relaxation. This will enable the boys to meet one anothei- and swap some antiquated foxhole fables.
By this time Mr. Joseph Dillon had completed shaving and dressing. As he reached for his law books we raced for chow, eagerly hoping that after our next meeting one or more of these plans could be announced as a reality.

BROTHER ANGELUS, c.s.c.
Sixty Years Under the Dome
By JOE WILCOX
Students returning to Notre Dame this fall missed a familiar figure who had, over the past twelve years, become almost a Notre Dame landmark. Diminutive, lively little Brother Angelus, C.S.C., colloquially and affectionately dubbed “Brother Dome” by students and faculty alike, has been retired after more than sixty years of service to Notre Dame.
Few perhaps, knew that Brothel- Angelus’ official title was “guest master.” He was the official greeter of the Administration Building, in addition to being guide to the various offices, departments, and classrooms there. To the majority of students, however, he was known as the watchdog of the forbidden stairs, the man to whom the smoke of a cigarette was the clarion call to duty the bane of the puffer and the pride and joy of the insurance inspectors.
The story of Brother Angelus parallels, in a large measure, the saga of Notre Dame. In a way, the title “Brother Dome”—opprobrious to Brother Angelus himself—is signally appropriate to him, for the year of his arrival at Notre Dame, 1882, was the same year in which the historic and celebrated golden dome was first erected over the main building. Year after year, Brother Angelus served in his double capacity as guestmaster and whistle-catcher, a man of geniality and warmth who nevertheless could be as terrible as Doomsday to the yodeling freshman.
Brother Angelus was born in Ireland, from where he emigrated to New Hampshire at the age of four. When he arrived at Notre Dame in 1882, Father Sorin, founder and first President of Notre Dame, was still living. Brother- Angelus thus has the distinction of being the only man on the campus who actually knew the founder of the school.
Six years after his arrival, in 1888, Brother Angelus made the profession of his vows before Father William Corby, who had won fame as a chaplain in the battle of Gettysburg during the Civil War.
Brother Angelus’ first duty as a brother was teaching in Notre Dame’s “minim” department, which was a school for small boys and occupied St. Edward’s Hall. This department ceased to exist in
1920, when the College of Commerce became a part of the University.
After several years in the minim department, Brother Angelus became the travelling representative for the Ave Maria magazine, a national Catholic periodical which has been published at Notre Dame for many years. This work took Brother Angelus throughout the United States, and to Canada, Australia, and his native Ireland as well. He became well-known to many Catholics at home and abroad during this period of his life which, with intermissions, totaled thirty years.
Brother Angelus returned to Notre Dame, where he became the official guest master at the Administration Building. Here, he was receptionist and guide to the many thousand visitors who came, every year, to see Gregori’s famous frescoes, and to the sightseeing crowds trooping through the corridors of the Main Building on football week’ends. He won many plaudits, some from the press, foi- the

efficient, courteous way in which he carried out his duties. Students came to know him as the general supervisor of the Main Building, minute monarch of all he sui-veyed, and unquestioned dictator of the rules of conduct in his province under the golden dome.
On March 20, 1938, Brother Angelus was able to look back over fifty years as a brother of the Order of Holy Cross. On that day, the anniversary of the profession of his vows, the University tendered him a lavish dinner, including a huge cake, rivaling in size the slight, bent old brother himself. Among those present was Most Rev. John F. O’Hara, now Bishop of Buffalo and then President of the University.
Having seen the progress of Notre Dame in the last sixty-odd years, Brother Angelus looks forward to new things, to greater achievements than ever before. He has seen the University grow from a few buildings in 1882 to the present

CATHOLIC ACTION ♦
College students mixed business with pleasure during a picnic at the Geissler Farm. Roasted corn, generously buttered (!), and hot dogs were the staples, with an abundance of cake, ice cream and watermelon to round out the menu and the picnickers.
These scenes depict the windup of a joint Catholic Action study week and leadership workshop for the national officers of the National Federation of Catholic College Students. The meeting was held on the Notre Dame campus during the week preceding registration for the Fall semester. Over 20 colleges from the East and Mid-West were represented at the four day session.
The ice was broken with a dinner party at Rosie’s, but it wasn’t all play as the days were spent in intense study of the Catholic Student Movement in the United States. Each day was begun with a recitative Mass in Badin Chapel. This was simple for the men who were Quartered in Badin, but the girls had to rise with the sun and make the long trek from St. Mary’s. All the morning sessions were joint affairs for Catholic Action and N.F.C.C.S., covering such basic topics as the history of the Youth Movement in the United States, the Objectives of the Catholic Youth Movement, Subversive Youth Movements here and abroad, Parliamentary Procedure, Pub-

licity and Public Relations, Catholic Ac

These topics were handled by such national authorities as Father Charles Bermingham, Director of the Youth Department, National Catholic Welfare Conference, Clem Lane, City Editor of the Chicago Daily News, Father E. Vincent Mooney, C.S.C., former National Chaplain of N.F.C.C.S., Fathei-Louis Putz, C.S.C., of Notre Dame, John Simons of the Fordham Law School, and Monsignor R. Hillenbrand of Chicago, national liturgical leader.
The Federation officers had separate meetings in the afternoon to revamp their activities and objectives, while the Catholic Action leaders planned their program for the coming year. Every night after supper, the entire group sang Compline in the Badin Chapel. Then followed an evening discussion led by an authority in the field of liturgy or Catholic Action Apostolate. Refreshment, songfests and dancing closed a
busy day. The men paid this
time, as they had to walk the girls back to the Rock.
Father John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., new president of the University, began the fourth and final day by singing a High Mass for which the whole group was the choir. The new vice-president, Father John Murphy, C.S.C., very appropriately gave a sermon on Christ the King inasmuch as the entire convention had been filled with plans for spreading more effectively His Kingship in the Student World. At the final meeting, all the various college representatives gave an account of the work on their campus, and Dave Slattery of Notre Dame summarized the results of tne week.
Then came the picnic. In view of the busy days that preceded, you can understand the general state or relaxation. When the sun sank westward, and the ex-GI’s had finished policing the grounds, a tired but inspired group or college men and women headed homeward. It had
been a truly long week end, yet it marked the beginning of a renewed ef-. fort to make the college world hum with
the old message that is ever new.

Fighting Irish Meet Illinois Powerhouse
'46 Opener Heralded Game-of-+he Week
By JOHN A. O'CONNOR
Not since the latter part of the 1700’s, -when a tribe of the Algonquin family, the Illinois, sniped at trappers and raided frontier settlements, has a band of II-lini warriors threatened with such fearsome power. The resurgent braves from Urbana, who take the field against Notre Dame tomorrow, will be out after Irish scalps, and Big Chief Ray Eliot has his prize tomahawks primed for the . blow.
Most fearful threat in the Illini warparty is of course, dusky, will-o-the-wisp Buddy Young, 9.6 dashman, and a fancier stepper than Fred Astaire. Preseason ballyhoo had Young tabbed as the ball-carrier of the year. Vincent Flaherty of the Los Angeles Examiner even called him the greatest ball-packer of all time, by virtue of his open-field running last fall with the Fleet City outfit on the West Coast. Once he spots daylight the demon Buddy takes off like a scalded dog, and once into the secondary he does a disappearing act. But the first half against Pitt proved that the Illinois scat-backs can be stopped by an aggressive line, and the ND hopes of bottling up the Champaign ball-carriers are pinned to the Irish forward wall.
That’s why Coach Ray Eliot should send his seven roughest, toughest maulers into the fray as the starting line. Beginning with the ends, there’s Bill Huber, former ND man, coupled with Frank Baumann, All-Big Nine man. They excel at spearing TD passes. Sam Zatkoff, another end, who played vicious ball against Pitt, has had it publicized that his life’s ambition is to beat Notre Dame. Add Buscemi and Valek and you have the enemy ends.
Almost a cinch to start at tackle will be a bruiser named Mike Kasap, while his partner in mayhem might be Franks or Les Bingaman, biggest man on the
20	'
team. Then there’s Lou Agase to round out the regulars.
At guard Illinois is loaded. Alex Agase is back, All-American at both Illinois (1942) and Purdue (1943), and anxious to repeat. In addition to being the best guard in the Midwest, if not the nation, Agase is Big Nine heavyweight wrestling champ, and lives on a diet of human flesh. His running mate is a werewolf named Prymuski, and in case any one needs a rest from satiating himself on the opposition, there’s always Wrenn and Serpico ready to take over.
Center Mac Wenskunas is the Illinois captain, and his record proves him a trouble-maker who likes to kill things, anything.
Eliot will probably start Perry Moss, ex-Tulsa sharpshooter, at quarterback, in an effort to bolster the Illini aerial game. If not, then Gallagher, who did magnificently against Pitt will counter-(Continued on Page 29)

HIGH SCHOOL SHOT-PUT RECORDHOLDER WORKS OUT WITH FROSH BOOKS IN B.-P.
By JOHN A O'CONNOR
Under a starry Southland sky last May, at the California State High School track and field meet in Compton, a strapping broad-shouldered 18-year old lad from nearby Mt. Carmel High stepped into the shot-put ring, fondled the big pellet in his right paw, swung his left foot out with a little hop, and heaved the missile in the general direction of Polaris. When the iron ball plopped to the earth judges looked twice, checked it three times. Their decision: a new American high school record, 59 feet, 5 and seven-eighths inches.
Johnny Helwig, two inches over six foot and tipping the beam at about 190, holder of the National Interscholastic shot-put record, is here at Notre Dame now, a modest freshman, over at Breen-Phillips Hall, wrestling with frosh subjects, girding himself for those years of Naval ROTC coming up, and every now and then dreaming of Southern California, the sunshine, the oranges, the drive-in stands. . . .
With fall track season bringing the cindermen and field men out in sweat togs, limbering legs and loosening arms, Johnny is chucking a few every afternoon under the able eye of Track Coach Doc Handy.
hippo, bulging out of his clothes and suffering from a portly dose of elephantio-sis. He’s all shoulders and arms, built rangy and light on his feet. And he’s no Braggadocio. Whenever he receives praise and the encouragement of his friends towards setting new records begins to come cream-heavy, he brings them back to earth with a “Well, I’ll try.”
And John comes from a fine Catholic home in Los Angeles. His proud parents are both glad their boys could come to Notre Dame. Yep, there’s two Helwigs. John has a brother Joe in Walsh Hall, also a freshman, but a little older. Joe served in the Navy in the recent war to save the little people, but is willing to let younger brother Johnny grab the honors. Then there’s that cute kid-sister who is thinking about entering pre-nurs-ing when high school days are over.
Right now Johnny is busy with his studies and warming up slow in the afternoon workouts. But you’ll be hearing more of him soon.
TULSA, OKLA.—(ACP)—Coach Jim Tatum’s Sooner eleven will be known as the “Flying Gridsters” this fall. The Oklahoma U team will travel to every one of its out-of-state games by airplane.
Cross Country Men Train for ND Meet
By BILL SLAVICS
With prospects of a National Cross-Country championship, Doc Handy is leaving no corner of the campus unsearched as he makes plans for the University Harrier Championships Sunday afternoon, Oct. 6.
Any student is eligible to make a bid for the cross-country team, as the top six men in the run on the 6th will virtually be assured a chance at a position in the opening meet against Wisconsin, Oct. 11.
But Handy has little to worry about if no Greg Rice shows up next Sunday, for in the “Gold-dust Twins,” N.Y.U. and overseas ace Corny Styers, an:l vet-• eran of last season’s national runner-up Jimmy Murphy, he has a pair that will be in the running every time out. Then if Bill Leonard is able to go after his summer operation, along with Louis (Bud) Tracy and Bill Tully, both members of the ’45 sextet, he should have little to worry about.
Besides these, John Lyons, an Army veteran and former New York interscholastic mile champ, and Ray Zabota, Notre Dame 440 hope this year, will be after berths.
Styers got his start at DeWitt Clinton High in the Bronx, taking second in the New York prep championships mile run. At N.Y.U. he ran the two and three (Continued on Page 23)
Helwig’s record-shattering heave at Compton wasn’t his best try. John’s coach at Mt. Carmel High, Locke Liver-nash, has a buddy coaching at Los Angeles junior high. So the two coaches got together and planned a little exhibition meet, inviting John to pitch a few. He did. Four times the 12-lb high school shot went hurtling past 60 feet, his best put hitting the mark at 61 feet 6 inches. Because this was an exhibition meet the record was not recognized officially. However his Compton chuck was.
The same evening at Compton he picked up the 16-lb shot and pushed it out 50 feet, 9 and 7-8th inches. This is the longest shot-put heave on record throughout the nation for high school competition.
Helwig’s hefty tosses have surpassed, officially, the then-startling marks set by DeWitt Coulter, ex-Army All American tackle, when he was pushing them out down at Masonic High in Ft. Worth a couple of years ago.
A handsome lad, Johnny Helwig is no beefy behemoth. Unlike the sterotyped weight-tossing athlete he is no blimpish

A TOUCHDOWN'S WORTH SEVEN POINTS WHEN EARLEY'S MAGIC TOE IS ON TAP
By BOB LEANDER
When the 1946 football season finds its way past the Bowl games and into the annals, there’s a watch-charm halfback who may not have played a single minute but whose terrifying calm and verifying toe may well have proved the undoing of several highly touted elevens. For it’s when time is out and the linemen in that Freddy Earley, the drawling West Virginian, trots out to the 9 yard line to split the uprights for one point. Not enough over- a season to establish Earley as a high scorer, often it provides the needed margin of victory. And Fred’s average, 10 for 13, should push Ted Williams into oblivion, for remember everytime this wee Irish back sees his line get down and his center snap the pigskin to the outstretched hands of Johnny Lu jack the count stands at 3 and 2.
These are long and tiresome afternoons out on Cartier Field, but this stocky little place-kicker, whose knees are now both mended following gridiron surgery, perhaps realizes more poignantly than any other man on the squad the importance of “his play.” Just mention the Iowa Pre-Flight game to him and watch the grin it brings forth. It was 1943 and the closing minutes of the Notre Dame-Seahawk clash. Creighton Miller broke away and galloped across to tie the score at 13-all. A substitute back emerged from a flurry of blankets and parkas on the sidelines to attempt his second extra point of the afternoon He reported to the referee and seconds later a crowd, half stunned, half hoarsely delirious, engraved another name in the book of Rockne and Gipp. Fred Ear-■ ley had scuttled the Navy.
That same year- Great Lakes’ piledriving outfit came within seconds of feeling that Earley “kick of death.” For until Steve Lach’s last aerial Notre Dame had an undefeated season almost within grasp, Earley had converted twice while Lakes failed in both its attempts and the score stood 14-12.
But close only counts in horseshoes. This is three years later and with it a new season. One in which coaches everywhere, will lie awake nights questioning the sanity in their choice of professions, but if there is anything besides warm milk that will give the Notre Dame coaching staff sound slumber it’s the knowledge that all touchdowns are henceforth worth seven points. Fred Earley’s back.
Gridders Tune Up For Interhall Sked
By JOE FAHEY
Inter-hall athletic competition embarks on its most ambitious program this fall under the direction of Mr. John Scannell, Dean of the Department of Physical Education. This program includes such diverse activities as tennis, football, baseball, swimming, crosscountry and soccer. Thus far football, the rough and tumble kind, seems to have the greatest appeal, and all of the initial gatherings have drawn large numbers of candidates. The only new feature on the fall docket is the first attempt at autumn baseball, and it seems previous inter-hall programs have been passing up a good bet. Over 100 ball players responded to start the roundrobin play and this number was far in excess of the expected turnout. The. teams have already played preliminary games and the league, under the direction of Mr. Szekely, is off to a good start with hopes of completing a six week season before the weather and decreasing daylight hours halt play.
With more than 200 men qualified by physical examination for football, manpower will not be lacking here either. Ten halls are represented in the two five-team leagues. The four-game schedule is expected to begin the week of Oct. 6 allowing about two weeks for contact
work. Equipment was issued to all teams this week so that scrimmages are already under way. Regardless of the fact that less than three weeks of drill are available to the squads, the majority seem to prefer the complex T-formation but a few have been running from the simpler single-wing. It looks as though Lyons will be one of the powers of their league; along with Zahm, they have the quantity. The league winners will meet in the stadium for the championship some time in November. This program will be supervised by Mr. Napolitano but the touch league, for which plans are going ahead, along with a probable soccer competition on an inter-club basis, are guided by Mr. Maxwell. Inter-hall tennis matches under Mr. Langford have been scheduled now that equipment difficulties have been overcome. The other probable events on the calendar are the cross-country meet brought to your attention in our last issue, and the Freshman Swimming Meet. This event will be restricted to those new on the campus.
So the inter-hall program is back on a prewar footing with all the former attractions and a few additions. This extensive program, though not intended to tear you away from your books, Is provided for the student’s recreation and anyone interested is invited to turn out for their residence halls’ teams in the various leagues.

Rice lapped Styers and his running mate three times but N.Y.U. took second and third to hold their one point margin for victory.
Murphy is not only one of the leading contenders but is the most conscientious man on the squad, and the main cog in the morale of the harriers. He collected 45 points in track last year.
Tracy is back in good health, after a stunted season last spring due to stomach trouble.
Following the University championship, in which prizes may be given to the • first 10 finishers, and the Wisconsin meet at Madison, the Irish harriers take on Michigan State here on Oct. 19, Purdue at Lafayette on Oct. 26, Drake here on Nov. 2, before going to Lafayette for the Indiana State Championships, Nov. . 9.
The next Saturday, Nov. 16, Notre Dame will participate in the Central Collegiate Championships at Urake, and then move on to the Nationals at Minnesota, Nov. 23.

The following biographies of the 1946 coaching staff were compiled and written by Mel Goddard of the Scholastic Sports Staff.
MEET THE COACH
Director of Athletics and Head Football Coach Francis W. Leahy
Francis W. Leahy entered Notre Dame in 1927, was president of the Freshman class, and played freshman football under the late Tommy Mills. In 1928 he played a few games at center. He was moved back to his old position at tackle in 1929, where he played with the undefeated national champions. In training before the 1930 season, he received a knee injury and did not play that fall. The injury made it possible for him to helii Rockne with the line coaching and also permitted him to watch Rockne and the assistants work with the rest of the squad. After the season Leahy and Rockne went to the Mayo Clinic for treatment and Leahy gained a lot of football knowledge in his talks with Rockne while they were in the hospital.
Coach Leahy received his degree in 1931 and was signed as Georgetown line coach under Mills. Jim Crowley took him to Michigan State in ’32 and to Fordham in ’33. While at Fordham, Leahy produced the famous “Seven Blocks of Granite.”
In 1939 Leahy was made head coach at Boston College where he produced teams which won 20 of 22 games. In ’41 his B.C. team beat Tennessee 19 to 13 in the Sugar Bowl game at New Orleans.
When Elmer Layden resigned at Notre Dame in February, 1941, Leahy was selected to be his successor. In his first season here, Notre Dame won eight and tied one, and as a result he was named Coach of the Year in the New York World-Telegram poll.
Leahy was in poor health when the ’42 season opened. After the Irish were tied in the first game and defeated in the second, he went to the Mayo Clinic for three weeks. Ed McKeever took over and directed the team to three straight wins. Leahy returned in time to lead Notre Dame to wins over Army and Navy and two victories and a tie in the other four games.
In 1943 Notre Dame ran up nine straight victories before losing to Great Lakes in the final seconds of the last game of the season. The Irish were rated National Collegiate Champions despite the setback.
tion supervisor in the Pacific area, and was discharged on Nov. 15, 1945, with the rank of lieutenant.
He returned to the campus soon after discharge and remained as a spectator for the duration of the football season.. He officially returned as athletic director and head coach of football in December 1945.
ASSISTANT COACHES
Edward W. (Moose) Krause
Ed came to Notre Dame in 1930, and was first string tackle in 1931, ’32 and

College of Winona, Minnesota, as athletic director and coach of all sports. From there he went to Holy Cross College as line coach, and returned to Notre Dame as line coach in 1942. During the winter of 1942-43 he was appointed head basketball coach.
Ed who is the only Notre Dame athlete ever voted a trophy by the student body served at a first lieutenant in the Marines during the war.
Bernard A. (Bernie) Crimmins
Bernie Crimmins returned to Notre Dame early this year after serving as a naval officer in World War II to assist in coaching the 1946 football team.
While a student, Crimmins won three letters in football and as many in baseball. He is probably the only man in Notre Dame football history to win letters at three different positions. In 1939 he was at right half behind Lou Zontini. In ’40 he backed up Capt. Milt Piepul at full. The next year Leahy arrived and moved Bernie to guard where he gained All-American honors.
John Francis Druze
Druze played his football at Fordham under Head Coach Jim Crowley and line coach Frank Leahy. Johnny was one of the famous “Seven Blocks of Granite” which lost only two games in three years. He played left end and was captain of the squad in his final year.
In 1938 he played for the Brooklyn Dodgers under Potsy Clark. The next spring Leahy hired him to coach ends at Boston College, the post he now fills at Notre Dame.
Druze served over three and one-half years in the navy, being discharged a full lieutenant in Nov. 1945. In his brief coaching career, he has turned’ out two All-American ends, Gene Goodreault at B.C. in 1940 and Bob Dove at Notre Dame in 1941.
Walter I. Ziemba
Wally came to Notre Dame in 1939, played tackle on the freshman team that year, earned a letter at the same position the next fall, then was shifted to center the next season where he became a standout. In ’42 he earned All-American honors at the pivot spot in spite of knee injuries.	'

duty after graduation. He was given an honorable discharge because of physical disability. After- playing in the ’43 AllStar game, he joined the N.D. coaching staff. He concentrates in the development of centers on the football field, and has served as assistant basketball coach for the past three seasons.
Joseph A. McArdle
Joe McArdle is another member of those famous football teams turned out by Crowley and Leahy at Fordham. He won letters there for three years and was graduated in 1935.
He worked for the New York WorldTelegram, played pro football, and sold insurance before going to Boston College as line coach in 1939. When Leahy came to N.D., McArdle came along. His B.C. nickname came right along with him. The men on the squad know him as “Captain Bligh.”
McArdle served almost four years in the Navy, being discharged as a Lieutenant Commander in Jan. 1946.
Martin (Marty) Brill
The latest addition to the N.D. coaching staff never played on a losing football team. Marty Brill entered the Uni

versity of Pennsylvania in 1926 and was elected captain of the freshman eleven. As a sophomore, he earned a monogram as a substitute halfback. In 1928 he left Penn and enrolled at Notre Dame. He teamed with Marchie Schwartz, Frank Carideo and Larry Mullins in ’29 and ’30 to form one of Notre Dame’s greatest backfields as Rockne’s teams went through those two seasons undefeated. Brill gained the reputation of being one of the greatest blocking backs in grid history.
He graduated in 1931 and went to Columbia to assist Lou Little. In 1933, he moved to LaSalle College in Philadelphia for seven years as head coach. He then put in two years at Loyola U. of Los Angeles.
Brill served in the Army as a Tech. Sergeant and in the Marine Corps as a First Lieutenant.
Bill Earley
Bill Earley came back this fall to help round the freshman squad into shape to scrimmage against the varsity. Bill played under both Elmer Layden and Coach Leahy. His brother is expected to convert the extra points after each touchdown. He returned from service this spring.

Doc Handy Smiling;
Runners Look Good
With two hard weeks of practice behind them the Notre Dame 1946 crosscountry squad ran its first intrasquad meet against Doc Handy’s stopwatch. Only three weeks from their opener with Wisconsin, ths boys are working hard for varsity berths. The Badgers, with many of last year’s Western Conference championship team back, and with three meets already behind them, are expected to be formidable opponents for the Irish harriers. Keeping individual times as secret as a Cartier Field scrimmage, Coach Handy revealed that the veterans of the ’45 team headed by Bill Tully, Lou Tracy, Bill Leonard, and Corny Styers battled for the laurels in Sunday morning’s two mile run. Two other bright spots showei up during the week with the marked improvement of Boston’s Larry Keenan and the return of Bob Culver of the ’44 squad. Final team selection will be made after the completion of the University championships the first Sunday in October.

Here’s hoping that the old Notre Dame Spirit dances through our section of the stands tomorrow afternoon. We’re going to have to fall back on it again. Sure, we’ve got the best team in the country but did it lose its top form about two weeks ago on Cartier Field? . . . We hope not, but a fellow hears a lot even when he’s minding his own business. The Notre Dame team has been running, blocking, tackling, passing, and punting for almost a month with the exception of Sundays. And some of those days the boys were out there in the morning and again in the afternoon. They’ve worked darn hard and deserve all the breaks that fall their way. But don’t sit next to your radio or in the stands tomorrow and expect to see Notre Dame run through the Hlini. . . . They won’t. Just pray that the Notre Dame players forget the tough weeks behind them and buckle down to giving the strong Illinois team a run for their money. This might sound like I took a

shower with Coach Leahy’s crying towel, but it isn’t true.
With Perry Moss calling signals for Illinois and Buddy Young running be-hinJ that strong 220-pound line, Notre Dame will have its hands full all afternoon. Then there’s Julie Rykovich who was on our side three years ago. ■. . . You’ll see a lot of him tomorrow. Chick Maggioli is another Notre Dame man who is playing third string for Illinois this year. All he did last Saturday was gallop 75 yards to a touchdown . . . that’s light, a third stringer.
Our starting line-up may look something like this: Martin, L.E.; George Connor, L.T.; Fisher, L.G.; Strohmeyer, C.; Rovai, R.G.; Czarobski, R.T.; Zilly, R.E.; Lujack, Q.B.; Livingston, L.H.; Sitko, R.H.; and Mello, F.B. Bill Walsh’s injured shoulder may keep him on the sidelines in tomorrow’s game. . . . Bill might have started at center if he hadn’t been injured. Leon Hart, an 18-year-old from Turtle Creek, Pa., has been gaining prestige at end. He’s 6'4" and weighs 225 pounds. Wait until he gets some seasoning!
One of the best punters on the Notre Dame varsity this year is John Creevey, who played occasionally back in 1942. John belongs in the same punting class with Creighty Miller, one of ND’s best. Creevey can kick ’em into the coffincorner at will . . . and he’s consistent. If given a chance, John Creevey might become as famous in the punting parade as did Eric Tipton, who used to boot them for Duke. He has another year’s eligibility, too.
HERE'S OUR VIEW:
The newspapers have been playing up the football players who played at both Academies during the war and then left them when the war was over. “Shorty” McWilliams tried to enlist in the army but was told to come back when he was older. At the time, McWilliams was 17. He later turned up at West Point where he found the welcome mat out for him. He played football. This season he is back with his “first love,” Mississippi. Bob Kelly and Fred Earley were at the Naval Academy at Annapolis during the war. Bob is credited with 22 months of service before entering the Academy. . . . Most of (hose 22 months were spent in the ROTC Unit here at Notre Dame. We’re glad to see them both back on the campus again . . . but it looks as though they might take a little “riding” from
the “typewriter jockeys” throughout the season. Here’s hoping that they pull through the Battle of Words as well as the American Army, Navy, and Marines pulled through the Battle of Blood.
NOTES TO YOU:
Angelo Bertelli, after quite a squabble, goes to Los Angeles to play with the Dons. Paul Patton, a teammate of Ber-telli’s and now football and basketball coach at Saratoga Springs, N. Y., has signed with the Troy Bearcats of Troy, N. Y. Patton turned down a National Football League offer so that he could get into coaching immediately after getting out of the service. Lou Rymkus, who played next to Wally Ziemba back in ’41 and ’42, umpired some major league baseball games at Pearl Harbor after the war. . . . Luke Higgins threw the shot put in a track and field meet at Frankfort, Germany. . . . Nick Amato, football equipment manager back in ’43, is back at school teaching history. . . . Johnny Lujack played football with George McAfee at Fort Pierce, Fla. . . . Ziggy Czarobski thinks that Bruce Smith and Bill Daley were ■ the best backs that he ever played against. . . . Hope Buddy Young isn’t included in this group after tomorrow . . . $3.00 for a ticket plus $5.41 for transportation equals $9.00 . . . “Keep the price in round numbers,” says Herb Jones. Notre Dame winning 8 and tying 1. . . . The best of luck to Phil Colella at St. Bonaventure. It was Phil who scored the only touchdown in last year’s 7-0 victory over Illinois in the opening play of the game. Johnny McHale, who may replace Hank Greenberg next year if Hank hangs up his glove, is back in school this semester. Johnny had a great year with Buffalo of the International League where he hit 25 home-runs and drove in over a hundred runs. . . . Notre Dame will have a different captain for each game. An honorary captain will be elected at the end of the season. Here’s a guess: Notre Dame 28, Illinois 26. Fred Earley’s toe might be the difference. . . . See you at Night Check tomorrow night, fellas!

BROTHER ANGELUS
(Continued from Page 17)
great plant, and sees no reason to believe that the progress will not go on apace. To him, the future, and not the past, is the important thing. For that reason, it is difficult to get him to reminisce at any length, although he has often given visitors a clearer insight into Notre Dame with his tales of past personages and traditions. Perhaps, if you pressed him, he might tell you the tale of the wags who, in the early years of this century, trained a parrot to say “out ■ at first base” and thus disrupted progress of a minim baseball game. But he does not think that students have changed much since he first came here.
During the war, Brother Angelus was invaluable in guiding Navy visitors and Navy trainees to their destinations in the Main Building.
It will be hard to get used to Brother Angelus’ absence. It seems almost as if a part of the Dome itself had gone, so familiar had Brother “Dome” become. Student opinion has held that he was indestructible, immovable. But all things must come to an end, Brother Angelus’ tenure as guest master no exception. He himself might agree that sixty-four years’ serving Notre Dame deserved a rest.
Anti-Negro Prejudice Hit in Commerce Forum Talk
John McCormack, a junior in the College of Commerce, touched off a lively discussion at a meeting of the Commerce Forum last week with his talk on the Negro problem. He said that personal likes and dislikes must be put aside in order to get a clear view of the over-all picture.
McCormack stated that the reasons most people give for disliking the Negro have been entirely discounted by scientific facts. Actual I.Q. tests show that he is not inherently ignorant. He is not uncivilized. The fact that he has not had equal breaks accounts for most of the Negro’s disliked habits.
Officers of the organization include: Tom McMahon, president; Dan Danisze-wicz, vice-president; and Rolando Duartes, program chairman. The social committee is headed by Jack Alexander and George Weiss. Assistant Dean of Commerce Edmund A. Smith is the moderator of the group.
ILLINOIS GAME
(Continued from Page 20) the efforts of Lujack-Tripucka-Ratter-man.
When it comes to dangerous backs, Illinois can boast of a quartet that may rival Army’s foursome before the sea
son’s out. Besides Buddy Young, they have Julie Rykovich who was first-string right half at ND in ’43, and Russ Steger, a war-head full. Then they’re well-cushioned with deep reserves that include two more antelopes, Jack Pierce and Paul Patterson, a sensational prep-school full back Ray Florek, who has yet to be tried, and Chick Maggioli, another former ND man, now running with the Eliot pack. And don’t forget Eddle-man, Lazier, and Art Duffelmeier.
The war-drums are rolling at Urbana tonight. The Illinois chieftains remember the close ones dropped to Notre Dame the past two years. As in track, the Illinois Indians are out to scourge the countryside. Tonight they’re putting on the war paint—it’s black and blue.

THE NAVY AT NOTRE DAME
Officer Personnel Thumb Nail Sketches
Commander George Hutchinson, executive officer of the NROTC since September 1945, came to Notre Dame in January of that year as executive officer of the Midshipmen’s School. A graduate of the Naval Academy class of ’35, he is a veteran with nine years of sea duty. At the outbreak of World War II, Commander Hutchinson was placed in command of four stacker John D. Edwards and afterwards served aboard the USS Macomb, again as commanding officer.
❖
Lt. Commander Michael A. Censale graduated from the Naval Academy in ’42 and came to Notre Dame in the summer of 1945. Prior to that he had three years of combat duty on the USS Ranger, where he was assistant navigator and aide to the executive officer, and with the USS Minneapolis, where he was aide to the CO and ship’s secretary. His duties at present are to act as aide to the executive officer, head of the Navigation Department, and instnictor in Communication and Tactics.
❖
Lt. Commander G. T. Shirley of the Naval Academy class of ’39 has just arrived at Notre Dame a few days ago and will act as head of the Seamanship Department. All his time as an officer has been spent at sea on the USS Madison, USS Gregory, and most recently, as skipper of USS Jenkins.
❖
Lt. Commander West, designated as Naval Aviator, heavier-than-air, has been ordered to report here but has not as yet arrived.
STUDENT OFFICERS NAMED
The organization of the NROTC Battalion has been completed and student officers have been appointed by Captain Danis, Professor of Naval Science.
As it exists now, the Corps will consist of one battalion, composed of two companies. J. D. Hereford has been named Battalion Commander with the rank of Lt. Commander; D. R. Haines, 1st Company Commander with the rank of Lieutenant; B. E. Sill, 2nd Company Commander, Lieutenant; and U. A. Hinders has been appointed Battalion Sub-Commander, also with the rank of Lieutenant.
However, these appointments are not permanent but will be rotated from time to time in order to give all students experience in Military Leadership. Towards the end of the semester, those students who have performed their duties most efficiently and have proved their fitness as officers will be appointed to the final student officers’ staff.
New Navy Program At N. D. Outlined
This September, universities all over the country have been converting their wartime Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Programs over to a new peacetime plan. Under this new setup, the trainee has the option of enrolling either as a contract student or as a regular student.
Regular students will be appointed Midshipmen, USNR, with tuition, fees, and textbooks paid for by the Navy, will be uniformed at Government expense, and will receive retainer pay at the rate of $600 per year. In return, they will be obligated to attend three summer cruises or training periods, to complete the prescribed Naval Science curriculum, to accept a commission as Ensign, USN or Second Lieutenant, USMC, and to serve on active duty for two years after commissioning.
Contract students will be uniformed at Government expense, and during their junior and senior years will be paid one commuted ration a day (65 cents) while under training. They will be obligated to complete one summer cruise, to complete the prescribed Naval Science curriculum of 24 semester hours, and to accept a

commission as Ensign, USNR, or Second Lieutenant, USMCR. They will not be obligated to serve on active duty after graduation unless they so desire. In addition, students in this classification are entitled to receive any educational benefits to which they are entitled under the G.I. Bill for previous service in the armed forces.
Students eligible to apply foi* training under the new NROTC program are former NROTC students enrolled in the program on May 1, 1946, beginning freshmen, and veterans who have had military or naval training equivalent to one or more Naval Science courses.
Any men interested in the program or desiring further information may inquire at the Navy administrative offices in the Drill Hall.

CAMPUS CLUBS
By JERRY OLWELL

On hand at the dinner will be Club president Bill Stockman, who will introduce old members to the newcomers. Keep an eye on the future issues of the Scholastic for more data on this event. Am I invited
ONE MAN'S OPINION:
As yet I haven’t seen any pats on the back for the Vets Club and its President for procuring those five-hundred Illinois tickets. Joe Dillon went to Illinois personally before school opened. He arranged for the tickets and also to have the band attend the game and give it some of that much needed Notre Dame spirit. Now as it stands the tickets and their disposition have been lifted out of the hands of the Vet Club and the band is not going. The band isn’t going because it “costs too much.” The story behind the story isn’t known, but around the campus it looks very bad. Now with the Army game coming up soon we wonder if it will be the STUDENT trip after all.. Many things have come up. It is rumored that only one thousand students will be able to go. That is less than one-fourth of the student body. Many NY boys couldn’t get tickets for their parents who would have enjoyed attending the game. This came about through a misunderstanding when a representative of the ticket office was to have orientated the boys from NY as to how to get their tickets. This fellow didn’t do his job properly and therefore, the students and their parents must suffer. It still is a policy of “who you know,” around here where tradition reigns, or should reign. Cooperation, which is vastly important, is sorely lacking.
CLUB NEWS:	'
The Philadelphia Club held its first meeting and is on its way towards a busy year which includes management of Notre Dame Night, and sponsorship of the Bengal Bouts. Elections are in order foi- this club in the near future. . . . Many fellows from the NY Met Club have suggested a House Pool for the Anny game. This would be swell and about 300 students would be accomodated, but now it is out of the question since the NY boys aren’t sure of even seeing the game. . . . California Club president Frank Perez has taken the first step towards the ball and chain. He is now engaged. She is an Elkhart lass. They won’t tell you the date but we are sure it is in the near future. . . . Speaking about the hoys from way out west they held then- first meeting this past week. They are bending their efforts towards making the Southern Cal game a huge success. They would still like to have that enormous Victory Dance a^ter the
game. One of the members even suggested handing out California oranges at the door. (That is California SUN-RIPENED oranges, stranger!) . . . The Married Vets, who aren’t letting their single buddies get ahead of them, have called together their forces and are mapping out their strategy for this year. They have one advantage: two heads are better than one! Last year they held a swell Poverty Dance over in the Mishawaka Legion Hall. They all came dressed as BO Plenty and Gravel Gertie. They intend having more this year. . . . The Cleveland Club isn’t letting any grass grow under its feet either. They have already started functioning. Most commendable is their- getting set for their 1947 Dome page. They are ready to have their picture taken and are interested in securing the other pictures that will represent their club in what should be ND’s greatest yearbook.
DYNAMIC'S THE NAME:
Last semester they called themselves the “Dynamic Detroit Club.” They certainly are living up to their name. They held a meeting and have a great calendar of events for this fall. Pending an OK from the office whence all favors are dispensed and with the concurrence of the management at Rosie’s, a Spaghet Soiree will be held for the members early in October. A portion of the cost will be paid by the club’s treasury and the members are urged to start getting thirsty now. Bob Kane gives out all the poop on the Detroit Club and he is asking all old timers to visit him in his room at

IMPORTANT:
The same procedure will be used for registration of clubs as last semester. Just because your club was active doesn’t mean that you need not go to the Prefect of Discipline’s Office and sign your group up. If you don’t you won’t have the OK of the University for your activities and we can’t include you in the Dome whether or not you want to be in it. Speaking about the Dome, as I said last week, each Campus Club will have one full page for pictures and columns of information. A meeting will be held for each Club president and secretary on Tuesday, October 1st, in the Scholastic Office on the first floor of the

Main Building. Time is seven-thirty sharp. At this meeting you will meet Johnny Walker, editor of the 1947 Dome, who will tell you what pictures of your club he would like to have.
The Philly Club will hold its second meeting of the fall semester on October 2 at seven-thirty in the evening, in room 22 of the Engineering Building. Elections will be held that night and immediately after they chose their leaders they will make final plans for a dinner in the near future. . . . The Cleveland Club, midst rules, regulations and plenty of parliamentary procedure held what could have been the longest meeting on record. It started when theii- president resigned. This caused a calamity. It took fully one hour of motions, seconds-the-motions and everything else that our Congress does, before they had a leader. He is Vic Gul-yassy, a law student. Vic incidentally was nominated by a pal of his who told the club that Vic was well suited for the job because he is a married man with responsibilities and a happy man. The meeting was not all a muddle of conventions however for Ziggy Czarobski spoke, and whenever Ziggy speaks a light, heavenly possibly, settles upon the joint. Following Ziggy another bone-crusher gave a few points on this year’s football team. He was Bud Masters. Incidentally in the election a point was brought out.

One member of the club suggested that at least two prior students who are now returned must be elected. Immediately another student got up and said he wanted new blood. Both ideas are good. Next week this column will outline one method of setting up your Constitution governing elections. . . . All men from Connecticut should watch the bulletin boards. A club representing that state is now being formed.
STUDENT TRIP
(Continued from Page 9)--.. due to the unprecedented demands for sleeping space for that weekend, no reservations were available. Consequently, it is planned to run one section of the returning train on Saturday night for those students who have no place to spend the weekend in New York. The other section will leave New York sometime Sunday.
Estimated costs of the trip will be: §4.80 for the game ticket, approximately S23 for the round-trip train fare with- • out hotel room, or §35 for fare with hotel accommodations.
Railroad officials have assured the student body that their best coach equipment will be allotted to the special trains so that those students forced to return on Saturday night will have a comfortable and sleep-inducing trip back to the campus.
Approximately 1,000 tickets have been reserved for students and will be sola on the same basis as the N.D.-Illinois tickets seniors first, juniors second, sophomores third, and freshmen last.
The student council is planning to poll the student body in the next few weeks to determine how many students are interested in the trip, and who will have their own rooming accommodations.
Thus for the first time since before the war, Notre Dame will have a cheering section to match the throaty Corps of Cadets. Whether Army’s double-indemnity twins, Blanchard and Davis, will be able to perform at their best before such an impressive throng of Fighting Irishmen will undoubtedly be a major problem for Army’s Coach, Earl Blaik.
COUNCIL ELECTIONS (Continued from Page 9)
the College of Arts and Letters. Representatives of the Colleges of Arts and Letters and Engineering have not yet been selected by the deans.
Hall representatives elected were: Robert J. Shaw of Tulsa, Okla., Alumni; Arthur Swain of Texas, Badin; Bob Lanz of Elizabethtown, Ky., Breen-Phillips; Robert R. Uhl of Decatur, Ill., Cavanaugh; Lou G. Streeter of Lancaster, N. Y., Dillon; William D. Pelling of Aurora, Ill., Howard; Gerard J. Fitzpatrick of Ellicottville, N. Y., Lyons; William Griffy of Cleveland, Ohio, Morrissey; Joseph J. Soldo of Hellertown, Pa., St. Edward’s; and Lawrence Turner, Jr. of Indianapolis, Ind., Sorin; Dick Stack, Walsh; and John O’Connor, Indianapolis, Ind., Zahm.
The first meeting of the new Students Council was held on Wednesday, Sept. 25, and the eligibility of the new officers was ascertained and the introduction of new members was accomplished. Next Monday night at a special meeting the election of officers within the council will be held. These will consist of two Seniors for President and Vice President and a Junior elect for the office of SecretaryTreasurer.
Some of the functions of the Student Council are to conduct the organization of the pep-rallies, Victory Dances, and to help all the campus clubs plan for their semester activities. Gerry Feeney has made the suggestion that, “all clubs get their plans in to the Council as soon as possible so that an equitable schedule may be set up.” He also wishes to remind all the campus clubs that, “they must submit a copy of their constitution to the Council for recognition. Otherwise they cannot be considered an official organization.”
VETERANS HOUSING
(Continued from Page 9) une, and other newspapers in this area calling on owners to rent rooms to veterans. Many ads were given a patriotic slant and appealed to the people of South Bend and vicinity to aid the ex-G.I.’s who had fought for them in the war.
Coupled with advertising space devoted to securing rooms and apartments, the University. department of publicity did its bit by releasing-, stories on the situation almost daily. John V. Hinkel, department director, • and his staff devoted both time and effort. Mr. Hinkel, who was a lieutenant colonel in the Army during the war, could well sympathize with the problem as he had his
32
own difficulties in obtaining a home for his wife and daughter’ when he took over his duties a year ago. The releases prepared by the department were given a wide circulation in newspapers., and the South Bend Tribune gave generous play to the activities of the University and its representatives.
In addition to the campaign in the newspapers, South Bend’s two radio stations were used to advantage. Spot announcements were broadcast regularly, and several short sketches personalizing the problem were sent out over the ether waves.
Home owners responded gratifyingly with offers to rent rooms and another phase of the drive for housing opened. Abdallah Samuel Adelo, a former student turned instructor in the Notre Dame language department, previously had been named University representative and, together with William de Sier-ro, student in the College of Law and South Bend resident, began an inspection of proffered rooms, apartments and even summer cottages.
Adelo and his aide traveled far and wide over the county and district, looking over all sizes and types of rooms. Many were attics converted to living quarters, while some were spare bedrooms and empty storerooms.
But Adelo and de Sierro inspected them one and all. If a room needed a bit of replastering, plumbing, a new pipe or two or a window replaced, the two discussed the problem with bne owner to get repairs under way. All refurbishing was done at the owners’ expense as is the customary practice. Extreme premi

ums were not part of the plan to secure housing.
But while Adelo and de Sierro were carrying out their phase of the drive, work of finding additional housing continued. South Bend Red Cross provided valuable help throughout, while both the South Bend Association of Commerce and the Junior Association of Commerce greatly aided in getting the original program under way. The South Bend City Housing Commission also lent its prestige and needed information.
The University’s Office of Discipline and especially Mr. Murray, assistant to Rev. Joseph Kehoe, C.S.C., greatly augmented the work of finding living quarters.
Adelo says the students are spread over a wide radius of St. Joseph and adjoining counties, with the most distant veteran approximately 25 miles away. Only those men with cars were assigned quarters which are any great distance from Notre Dame.
Included among rooms accepted for use were summer cottages at three nearby lakes and along the St. Joseph River. Married or single veterans are living at Eagle, Indian, and Hudson Lakes and in river cottages. Adelo pointed out that only those cottages equipped with heating facilities are being used for families of veterans due to the fact that winter may find them still there.
Meanwhile, work is being pushed on the 117 temporary dwelling units which are located north of Cartier field. Fa-thei- Lane’s office reported that due to the uncertain conditions which exist in the
SOU[hnsehoRE
building field today, even an approximate date for completion of the units is hard to determine.
While the general construction work of the units is itself well along, shortages of supplies incidental to the dwellings are the chief cause. At the same time completion of Farley Hall, new resident dormitory for freshmen, is being hurried along to help alleviate conditions on the campus. Many freshmen are living in other halls pending opening of Farley.

STORY BEHIND AN IDEA: We don’t know who gave us this one but it is wonderful. The idea is tor the ND football team to make about five post season trips to Vets hospitals. Here disabled Vets of both wars could meet in person the many stars they hear about each Saturday afternoon. If you have ever been in a GI hospital during the winter season, you know how these boys relish each Saturday afternoon when football time rolls around. Here’s hoping the University will contact some authority in Washington and cook up something along these lines.
