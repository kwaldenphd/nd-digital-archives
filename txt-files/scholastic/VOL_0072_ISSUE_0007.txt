BACKS
In football, the backfield gets the glory. Is it fair? What makes a great football team—the line or backfield? And which would you prefer: a great backfield and amediocre line, or the other way around? Coach Jimmy Conzelman, who fears no man, says, “I’ll take the backs!” and shows you why. Here’s his story, and we hope he isn’t stuck with it!

DOCTOR ABELL TO RECEIVE LAETARE MEDAL

Dr. Irvin W. Abell 56th Laetare Medalist.
IRISH REBEL REVIEWS FORMATION OF DAIL
“The British had twice ordered me shot; they had jailed me three times —the last time for a year; and when I was free, I was either in rebellion or planning- rebellion against them.” Yet Desmond Fitzgerald, in his Washington Hall lecture on Tuesday, Oct. 25, remembers those days as “a happy time” of his life. “Perhaps,” he continued, “it is because I remember only the fringes of what happened. For instance, I remember vividly one of my friends walking up and down the room talking incessantly, and then apologizing: ‘I know I talk too much, but it’s the only way I can think.’ Or another tragic fellow who was sure he’d be killed— and he was! But most of all Michael Collins, our leader, who was an efficient administrator and kept us hopeful during the most hopeless periods.”
“I was released from jail after serving a year and found Ireland in a quiet constitutional movement. Thereafter my time was spent organ-

Ceremonies of the presentation of the 1938 Laetare Medal to Dr. Irvin AV. Abell, Louisville, Ky., president of the American Medical Association, will take place tomorrow evening at 8 o’clock in Washington Hall. For eminent contributions in psychiatry Dr. Abell has been honored as the 56th recipient of the Laetare Medal, which is bestowed annually since 1883 by the University of Notre Dame upon an outstanding member of the Catholic laity.
Rev. John F. O’Hara, C.S.C., president of the University, will deliver the presentation address. The Most Rev. John A. Floersh, D.D., Archbishop of Louisville, will speak on the significant works of Dr. Abell and his contributions to the medical world.

NAVY VICTORY DANCE FOR BOYS TOWN
•
The S. A. C. will sponsor an added event on the social calendar, A Navy Victory Dance, Saturday evening. The dancing gets under way at the Columbia Club at 8:30 and the South Bend sociallites can bob and weave to the tempos of “Dean” Hennegan and his Modemaires until 11:30 for the modest charge of one dollar.
The S.A.C. is merely giving a long kick to the ball the Religious Bulletin started rolling two we.eks ago when the Bulletin followed up the appearance of “Boys’ Town” at a local theatre with the announcement that contributions for Father Flannagan’s school would be received. The spontaneous response which brought in §54.84 in the few days before the Army week-end encouraged the S.A. C. to sponsor a dance exclusively for “Boys Town.” All proceeds—including a large voluntary donation from the Modernaires—will be added to the fund already accumulated and forwarded to Father Flanagan, Boys’ (Continued on Page 23)

Good speaking and fine preparation have characterized the debates as the pros and cons of “Resolved: That the United States Should Cease Using Public Funds to Stimulate Business,” have been fired from the platforms in the basements of the library and the law building where the oratorical battles are being waged.
All the halls represented in the debating battle of wits are still in the running as two defeats are necessary before a team is finally eliminated. Members of the Wranglers have acted as judges for the contests and have pointed out the fallacies and weaknesses manifested by the hall debat- ’ ers in the constructive speeches and rebuttals.
To date the following results have been recorded by the judges: Alumni (aff.) defeated Dillon (neg.); Cavanaugh (aff.) won over Zahm (neg.) ; Morrissey (neg.) bowed to Lyons (aff.); Brownson (neg.) edged out Badin (aff.); Walsh (neg.) outpointed Howard (aff.); and St. Ed-■ward’s (neg.) lost to Sorin (aff.).

THE WEEK
By Bill Donnelly
Efficiency
Out on the practice field one day last week Elmer Layden wanted his storm coat and asked a Junior manager to get it for him. The efficient wheels of the Notre Dame managerial system got under way immediately, and the Junior told a Sophomore who detailed two Freshmen to dash back to the gymnasium and get the storm coats for all the coaches. The Freshman came back in a flash with the coats and the Sophomore gave Elmer’s coat to the Junior who promptly took it out on the field and held it out for Elmer to slip into it. But instead of putting on the coat Elmer just reached into one of the pockets and pulled out two Smith Bros. Cough Drops. “I knew I had ’em in there,” he said.

Game Notes
If all the sports writers who referred to Benny Sheridan’s long run as “Sheridan’s Ride” were laid end to end, there would be enough ham and baloney to start a delicatessen store.... Rumors of large-scale espionage activities against the United States Army were further verified last Saturday. The snarled side-line markers that it took so long to untangle at the start of the second half were an out and out case of sabotage .... One New York paper quoted Earl Brown on his touchdown catch as follows: “It was a pass play and I was running downfield and looking around for the ball when the sun got in my eyes. The ball struck my shoulder but I had sense enough to reach up and hang on to it. Before I knew it I was on the goal line.” It all sounds so simple to us we wonder just what Army was doing on the field anyhow.
Orchids
The boys who remained campus cloistered over the week-end had a good break from the Chicago papers whose staff members covered the game. Thanks Chi! The local sheetmen thought a rehash of press service good enough for their best customers, and one even tried to make it appear it was his special duty to put Elmer Layden to bed every night.

Suspicious
On the return ride of the student trip last Sunday we became aware that the conductor was prowling
down the aisle and making a thorough investigation under various seats along the way. We diagnosed him as a very suspicious fellow and denounced him to ourself for having the nerve even to suspect that any Notre Dame man would try to hide out from him and chisel a free ride on the railroad. Suddenly he looked up and said, ‘“Well, they’re off!” Our heart sank at once for we concluded immediately that there had been skivers after all and that he had caught them and had already thrown the poor fellows off enroute. “Oh, you beast!” we thought, and we sent a dirty look at the back of his head. He looked under a few more seats and then continued, “Yes, they’re off all right. There’s no steam coming out of them pipes now.”

“Professor” Perennis
That fellow named Phil is a fake. We have concluded definitely that he is not a student at all but a member of the faculty, for who but a professor would have the temerity even to imply that there are students existing who hang on to every word he spouts as implicit doctrine. Of course we said that the proper object of the class was to absorb the knowledge imparted to it by the professor, but we never imagined any one would think we regarded all the stuff our professors hand out as knowledge. Pills are coated with superficial sugar to make them more edible, and so are professors. (In case any of our present crop of professors read this article, it doesn’t apply to them.) Some pills, for instance, have so great a sugar coating that there is very little of the class period left in which they may impart knowledge.
Before reading that letter sent in by “Professor” Perennis, we regarded rumination as a very necessary second step in the development of the intellect. But after considering the question in the light of the analogies he suggests, we have decided we would rather be one of John Locke’s blotters or even one of those slightly spilled buckets of water than a cow.

That Campus Critic
High among campus art critics stands the student who, in a letter to the Scholastic last week, signed “L.S.,” complained that “Stage Door” was “dramatic junk,” “long-haired stuff,” and devoid of “action and fast gags.” He is a practical gentleman, too, for he gave “that stuff plenty of razzberries,” and promises to keep up the “racket” unless the situation is remedied to suit his taste.
I have an idea that the same student thinks “A Yank at Oxford” is about British dentistry. . . especially if he has seen the picture.

DEMOCRACY OF ROME DEFINED BY WALL
At the first regular meeting of the Patricians, Thomas Wall read a paper on the meaning of the terms “Democracy,” as identified with Greece, and the “Res Publica” of ancient Rome. The difficulty in defining these terms, said Wall, was to make clear their differentiation and, if possible, to show the success of one against the shortcomings of the other.
Among the early Indo - European countries there were certain fundamental ideas of law which were bound to have influence in the Greek “Democracy” and in the Roman “Res Publica.” But as time went on both the Greek and Roman civilizations began to adapt aand adjust these carried

over laws and customs to their own use. We soon find the king being stripped of his pontifical character; we find, in the Roman system, the populace taking part in law making while in the Greek system we find the Council becoming supreme.
“So far there seems to be little difference between the Roman and the Greek systems, but further on we begin to notice a significant difference which consists in the dependence of the Roman people upon their magistrates for expression and the reverse condition regarding the Greek magistrate. The Greek magistrate had to render a strict account of his doings in office and unlike the Roman official, he was subject at all times to summary removal if his acts were in contradiction to the will of the demos. “Here then,” remarked Wall, “we have an important difference: Rome was a quasi - representative government while that of Greece w’as constituted by a direct and inexorable rule of the people.”
Wall went on to show the development of division of authority in Greece and Rome. Another striking superficial difference existed in the

UNIVERSITY MAKING TUBERCULIN SURVEY
By Ed Rilham
Following the practice of other universities in this country Notre Dame has instituted a survey to determine the extent of tuberculosis among the student body.
Under the direction of Doctor Mc-Meel over 2,000 tests have already been made. By the middle of November the survey will be complete with about 2,700 students tested. The remaining 300 have already undergone inspection in order to secure employment in the dining hall.
Dr. McMeel is using the Vollmer Tuberculin Patch Test. The test consists of a small strip of adhesive tape with two tuberculin test squares placed on each - side of a filter of glycerin broth. Through the natural moistness of the skin the tuberculin is dissolved and absorbed sufficiently to render an accurate reaction.
The Vollmer Test was selected by Dr. McMeel because it is limited to a small area and prevents a spread of tuberculosis in the skin. A positive reaction is detected by unusual roughness of the skin in the area subjected to the tuberculin germs. The center square appears pale.
Dr. McMeel says: “Any student showing a positive reaction is required to have an X-ray of his lungs to show the extent of the disease.
“However, a positive test does not necessarily mean that the student has tuberculosis, but that he had it at some time in the past. In fact, out of the 80 X-rays that have already been taken of positive cases not one has proved to be active.
“In the event we do discover a serious case the student will be sent home for his protection as well as for the proection of the rest of the student body.
“While we are unable to make the test compulsory all students are advised to submit themselves for their own good. Because of the trend for the suppression of tuberculosis in this country it will be a short time before such tests will be required by employers throughout the nation.”
The tuberculosis test is being provided for at the expense of. the University. Students requiring X-rays will be given a special rate.
To date all halls except St. Edward’s and Freshman have been visited by Dr. McMeel. Students who have not as yet taken the test are asked to call at the Infirmary.

Liturgy
The Liturgy of these two weeks is rich in historical significance. The commemoration of the dedication of the major basilicas of Borne revives the principles of the Christian interpretation of history. Both in their origin and the events they have witnessed throughout the centuries, the basilicas are redolent of the impress of Christ upon all human endeavor. St. Albert the Great immediately brings to mind his pupil St. Thomas. The teachings of both are the surest guides in the pursuit of history.

Doc Milford, of Marion, Ind. In the other corner were Norm Jandoli, of East Orange, N. J., Ben Eilers, of Rochester, N. Y., and Walt Cotton of New York City.
The easterners agreed that the best com was grown in their section of the country. Its quality was higher, its price lower, they said. The west objected. They claimed superior quality as well as greater quantity was grown in the midwest combelt.
“Why,” expostulated Mr. Benedetti, “we always win corn growing contests out here. We always take prizes.”
“I,” replied Mr. Cotton, waving aside the claims of the west, “don’t give a hoot. Where would the west be if it didn’t have the east to sell to?”
“Where would the east be if it didn’t have the west to grow its com for it?” countered Mr. Milford, coming out from behind a slice of rye bread.
“Where was the west when the east was growing its own corn about two hundred years ago? You answer that,” said Mr. Eilers, also appearing for the first time in the intersectional debate.
“You easterners think you’re tops in everything,” asserted the voluble Mr. Benedetti. “Out here we have land, trees, birds. We breathe fresh air. This is the land of the outdoors’ man, the land the poets have raved about—”
“Not Carl Sandberg,” interposed Mr. Jandoli, who once read “The Skyscraper” in high school.

“Tell him,” said Mr. Milford slyly
to Mr. Benedetti sitting next to him at the table, “that New York isn’t even paid for yet.”
“I heard that!” yelled Mr. Cotton furiously. “It is too paid for! The white man bought New York City from the Indian for twenty-five dollars. What a bargain! You can’t even get a ham sandwich there now for that price.”
“I don’t believe it,” objected Mr. Milford mildly.
“Not only that,” went on Mr. Cotton, who was just beginning to warm up, “but the Indian threw in the Statue of Liberty too!”
“He should have thrown you in too,” observed Mr. Milford pleasantly.
“Heck!” said Mr. Benedetti, “I don’t think so much of New York. I can tell you all about it. I made the Army trip last year.”
“You made the Army trip!” This was a bit too much for Mr. Cotton. “Why, we could take Chicago, Indianapolis and Elkhart and put them all into Central Park — and still have room for South Bend.”
“You,” said Mr. Benedetti sagely, “are prejudiced. We could put all of New York City into Garfield Park — and still have room to skate. Heck, people in New York City get so mixed up they don’t' even know what road they live on.”

PHYSICIST SKETCHES HISTORY OF GLASS
By Harry Penrose
Dr. K. Lark-Horovitz, head of the department of physics at Purdue University, put aside his title of physicist Thursday night, Oct. 27, in Washington Hall to assume the role of a lover of beauty and art as he traced the development of glass through the ages.
A connoisseur since the World War of decorted and delicately shaded glass, Dr. Lark-Horovitz brought with him to aid in the illustration of his lecture pieces of almost every age of glass blowing, from the early Egyptians and Romans down to the present day.
“Just who invented glass blowing, we do not know positively,” said Dr. Lark-Horovitz, as he began to outline the history of glass, “but it is known that glass was first used by the Egpy-tians, who imported their glass blowers from Assyria in 1500 B.C.”
Glass making was kept alive by the Romans until the fall of their empire. The Venetians then took up the art, and soon glass became the principal export of Venice.
From Venice the art spread to France and the Netherlands and then it was taken up generally throughout Europe. Today, Venetian glass, i.e., variegated glass, is the most beautiful of its kind.
Modem science has contributed two aids to the art of glass-blowing: it allows glass to be etched by sand blasting, and the rare elements that have been discovered by scientists are used to give extremely delicate colors to the glass. Excepting these two aids, however, every procedure in glass blowing today can be attributed to the Romans.
Dr. Lark-Horovitz started to accumulate art glass 22 years ago. While serving as a radio operator in Sudeten land during the World War he was quartered in the house of an old aristocrat who was a glass collector.
Being fascinated by the collection he asked the nobleman to sell him a vase. This vase was sold to him only after he had read several books on glass blowing and showed the nobleman he was earnestly interested. This was the beginning of his career as an art glass connoisseur.

Man About the Campus
By Graham Starr
Presenting: Frederick James Digby, editor of Scrip, University literary quarterly, which will make its first appearance of the school year next Friday. At least the editor hopes it will appear then. Right now he can be found all in a dither running around the campus trying to collect copy before the deadline.
Success came early in life for this 19-year-old Notre Dame senior. For the last two years he has held the dis-
tinction of being the first man in his class to choose his room for the following year. Strangely enough, the English major has always lived on . fourth floors, the chief reason being for the exercise he gets running up and down stairs.
In spite of the perennial, “Oh, no, he can’t run, he an English major,” Fred made the S.A.C. last year, and this year was elected secretary. Probably a follow through from high school political experience as vice-president of senior class.
Fred worked three years on the Scholastic, but dropped it this year in favor of his brain child. A journalist at heart, the red-haired youth may also be one by heredity (brickbats from sociology profs) for his father is sports editor of the New Orleans Item-Tribune. Fred himself was editor of his high school paper.
Bowing to the picture craze in this country, the first issue of Scrip is to contain drawings of an unrevealed nature. Some campusites complain that Scrip i s written by a certain clique most of the time. Fred invites
LINNETS TAKE BOWS FOR SMASH HIT
They’re still talking about the smashing success of the first Linnet concert which caused local reporters to leap from their seats in Washington Hall, after the first number, and phone their papers for cameramen and more story space. With only three weeks to organize and rehearse the boys came through with a show that vied with anything ever before presented on the campus—and right now the Linnets are hard at work on their next show, “Old Man Football,” to be presented late this month.
The brilliant production numbers, presenting effective living pictures, were the work of Director Orville Foster, for many years connected with the National Broadcasting Company and active in numerous major stage productions. Greatest effectiveness was reached in the “Spirit of Notre Dame” finale. Three pictures were used in this number, each contributing to the representation of God, Country and Notre Dame—the inscription on the University Shield.
The Linnet band showed versatility and excellence in offering both semi-symphonic and modern numbers. Their version of Ravel’s “Bolero" was a colorful highlight of the show. Living pictures of five solo drummers took on the appearance of Arabic grandeur as the rythmic beating increased and the darkened stage was gradually flooded with red lights until its flaming tint vied with the increased tempo of the music.
Their swing version of “Posin” brought roars of applause from the capacity audiences at both performances. That madman of the drums, Johnny Kelly, held the spotlight throughout the number as he delivered in Krupa style to rattle the heart of every true “jitterbug” in the house.
The entire organization is to be commended for the gruelling work which they underwent in preparing their show, the unified spirit which they have maintained, and the successful results that they have attained.
everyone to turn in copy for the magazine, and because the same few do so all the time does not mean that “by-lines” are restricted to these few.
Ye ed roomed with Joe Lewis for two years, and although he is tops in many things, never could beat Joe in ping-pong except for- an occasional game.
What’s Fred going to do when he gets out in June? Look out for a job along with the rest of us. And not in journalism either.

Radio
___________________________________'
By Bernard Feeney
A private newspaper* with any spot in your home as the press room, the world’s best editors and reporters on your staff, and the radio as your copy boy — this, an actual accomplishment, will be available in the very near future to anyone in the United States possessing an ordinary radio receiving set! The name of this new service is Facsimile, and it is basically operated on the same principles as television. For several years it has been in daily commercial use in speeding newsphotos back and forth across the country via the telephone circuits and across the Atlantic by short waves.
For those who haven’t already heard of this sensational new radio development, in non - technical language it involves the conversion of illustrations or other copy into an electrical signal which can be sent over the radio or telephone circuits. At the receiver the signal is automatically converted back into visible form, appearing as a recorded replica of the original copy. This is permanent and like a printed page can be handled, observed or read whenever desired. The actual home recording machine which can be made to sell under $50.00 in mass production is small enough to be housed as a complete unit in a small cabinet a foot square. The operation is wholly automatic and requires no attention.
At first all this sounds fantastic. That it is not, is attested to by the fact that at present many of the leading major broadcasting stations in the country already have been granted FCC permits. They have inaugurated service using regular broadcasting frequencies and full power between midnight and 6 a.m. The service is already obtaining basic engineering data for home facsimile use.
Imagine coming to your breakfast table in the morning and finding your illustrated news bulletin all ready for you! Such a thing will inevitably capture the pubic imagination and a dynamic new industry within the scope of radio will be born.
Whether it will eventually do away with newspapers can only be imagined. Most certainly it will be a boon for rural residents who do not get newspapers for a couple of days after they are printed. In this regard, we can see that some college students might be interested too — in order to get their local news immediately after it happens. Or aren’t you one of those interested in home town doings?
FROSH. KNIGHTS PLAN MINNESOTA DANCES

Traditions are being broken right and left—by the Freshmen Linnets. Now they’re holding a closed dance —the first Freshman class dance in recent years—the evening of the Minnesota game.

Knights Chairman Fluge For him: Competition.
Club where the upperclassmen will be dancing at the Minnesota Victory Dance sponsored by the Knights of Columbus.
Peter Fluge is general chairman of the Knight’s dance and Mr. Orville Foster, director of the Linnets, has appointed Edmund Butler of Salem, Mass., general chairman for the Freshman affair.
The Linnet’s choral group which ran through a five-star performance in Washington Hall two Wednesdays ago will give an encore during the intermission. “One Alon e,” “The Desert Song,” and “The Ranger’s Song”—three numbers which received tremendous applause at the Linnet premier—will be presented.
Chairman Butler will choose an orchestra and announce the date of ticket sale soon. His committee includes William Madden, Santo Belli, John Walior, and Robert Steele.
"Scrip" Makes Bow
Scrip, the campus literary quarterly, makes its debut under the editorship of Frederick Digby, Friday afternoon, Nov. 11. A new cover design on sleek cream colored paper will feature the considerably altered mag-agine. This year—for the first time —many of the stories will be illustrated.
The first issue will feature an essay on Thomas Mann’s Magic Mountain written by assistant editor Frank Cunningham. Other contributing editors are Charles B. Nelson and William Donnelly. The art editors are John Webster and Don Driscoll.

Are you fellows too busy to interest yoursevles in the Vincentian work? Then let me tell you about a man honored by N. D., who lived and worked in New York before any of us were born. This summer we contacted one of his sons, Rev. Vincent Mulry, of the Archdiocese of New York. How fitting it is that he should have the name Vincent!
The man about whom we should know was Mr. Thomas Maurice Mulry of New York City. At seventeen he was a member of the Society. Eight years later, in 1880, he was president of St. Bernard’s Conference. In 1887, two years after becoming a member of the Superior Council of New York, he was made its secretary. The year 1895 saw him a leader of the Special Works that the Society carried on. He became Catholic Home Bureau’s first president. The Particular Council of the St. Vincent de Paul Society in New York City welcomed him as president in the first year of its existence. The efforts of this Council resulted in the formation of the Catholic Boys’ Association of the City of New York. Mr. Mulry was the first president of the Superior Council of the United States.
Besides this work in the field of Catholic charity, he associated himself with non-Catholic movements in social work. He believed that there must be co-operation between Catholic and non-Catholic organizations in charity work. Accordingly, Mr. Mulry was a member of the Charity Organization Society. The National Conference of Charities and Corrections certainly had a leader with this man as its president! Among those presiding, he graced the first White House Conference on Dependent Children, and was largely responsible for the formation of the Federal Children’s Bureau which came as a result of the Conference. Governor Hughes of New York saw fit to appoint Mr. Mulry a member of the New York State Board of Charities.
Mr. Mulry led a full business and family life,. He went up in the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank to the presidency while running the business of Thomas Mulry & Son (contractors). His work brought him various memberships in such organizations as the Mutual Life Insurance Co., and the Advisory Council of Real Estate Interests. With all this he was a model father, three of his sons becoming priests! Mr. Mulry was a' Knight of St. Gregory the Great. Notre Dame conferred the Laetare Medal upon him in 1912. St. Patrick’s Cathedral was not large enough for his funeral!

A great deal of attention has been focused on the magnificent ostenso-rium of the Eighth National Eucharistic Congress in New Orleans . Through the efforts of Professor Francis J. Hanley, of the University Art Department the original drawings from which the monstrance was made have been obtained by the University for exhibition.
This monstrance is without doubt the most beautiful and most valuable sacred vessel ever made in this country. Its designer was Frederick Whitaker of Providence, Rhode Island, who won the commission on a competition basis established by Archbishop Rummell of New Orleans. Twenty-four designs were submitted by leading ecclesiastical art designers here and abroad. The ostensorium stands 42 inches high and weighs 26 pounds. It is solid 14 karat gold with some silver and platinum decorations. There are approximately 825 diamonds employed in various parts. The whole is held together by 500 14 karat gold screws and nuts each of which was made by hand. All told it took about 100 men to fabricate the monstrance. It is computed to be worth $35,000. This does not include the velvet-lined, leather-covered case which in itself is worth $250.
However, the real significance of the monstrance does not lie wholly in its material value, but in the story that it tells of the religious history of New Orleans and of the devout spirit of the Catholics of that city today. This is told in the design itself and in the material from which the monstrance was made. In the design are depicted those countries that aided in the religious development of New Orleans; the first Eucharistic procession in New Orleans in 1734; the history of the Archbishopric of New Orleans; and those saints who have a particular connection with the diocese itself. In regard to the material — the people of New Orleans unselfishly and willingly donated diamonds, precious stones, gold, silver, and platinum in the forms of watches, jewelry, family heirlooms and souvenirs. The entire monstrance was constructed from these donations. It is thus fitting that, after the Congress, the ostensorium should be preserved and used in the venerable St. Louis Cathedral in New Orleans.
Beginning next week the original drawings and designs for this celebrated monstrance will be exhibited in the upstairs gallery of the University Library. Included in these studies will be both the the first preliminary sketches of'Mr. Whitaker and his finished scale drawings and blue prints.

Lurid tales of Shane Leslie seldom come as a surprise. Dillon will never forget him because of his handwriting on the wall — in red letters. But few people really appreciate his flare for showmanship. It is not generally known that, in a dull moment, he contrived to present “Hamlet” in the football stadium, a la Cecil B. DeMille. Our gridiron stars were to play the soldiers’ part so that all the world might know, when it came to the finer things, our athletes were no slouches. The idea died somewhere along the line.

comes along waving a sheaf of pretentious reviews under our nose. But the student critics who have seen it in New York rate it “lousy,” and all of them for about the same reason. It seems probable that the novelty of an all-female cast has accomplished its mild success. Then, too, the chatter of a group of catty girls, especially if it should become nasty, seems calculated to win popular interest. Try it, if you will, but your chances of getting your money’s worth are better if you elect to buy a good book; so they say.
Mr. Sullivan illustrates “order of action” to his playwrighting class: A famous actor, playing the part of a telephone operator, was supposed to be shot in the hand as he worked at the switchboard. At the first performance, he received his wound, bandaged it with his handkerchief and picked up his cigar to gallantly do his duty. The audience response was weak.

Music Notes
By William Mooney
The symphony orchestra is that medium through which composers have found their deepest form of expression. A good symphony orchestra combines in one organization a large number of musicians each a master of his instrument. But instead of freedom and originality of interpretation these artists strive for a combined unity and coordination. The individual becomes as one key under the hands of a great pianist. The orchestra’s dynamic range extends from the most delicate subtleties of moods and impressions, to the maddest crashing of wars, storms, and heroic legends. Orchestral music is made up of millions of shades and nuances.
The symphonic side of music at Notre Dame has long been weak. The organization has been hampered by limited instrumentation and a lack of enthusiasm on .the part of the students. However, as the orchestra grows enthusiasm will quickly follow. This year the orchestra will show a marked improvement. All but of two of last years members are back, and the string section is almost doubled. The instrumentation is more complete. Oboe, bassoon, and French horns have been added.
The symphony at Notre Dame is young, and consequently the repertoire is limited. The symphony orchestra can only be built up by underclassmen, because it cannot be developed in one year. Once it is established firmly it will be able to overcome the hazard of graduation. As it improves it will grow, and conversely, as it gets bigger it will get better.
The first concert by the symphony will be given November 10th. Featured on the program will be piano solos by Wilson Crandell, an extremely capable young pianist. The program is not heavy but should be interesting. It is as follows:
Coriolanus Overture________________Beethoven
Tyrolian Suite_____________________Di Steffano
(In three parts) « « « « «
Humoresque_____________________Rachmaninoff
Fantasie Impromptu Chopin
Mr. Wilson Crandell
« « « « «
Dog Trail_____________________________ March Militaire_______________________Saint Saens
Mill_____________________________________Raff
Adagietta________________________________Bizet
(L’Arlisienne Suite)
Some of the world’s greatest music is written for combined chorus and orchestra. We will have an opportunity later in the year to hear music of this kind.

To Fight Fire With Fire
TODAY and tomorrow the University is host to eight outstanding philosophers who will take part in the symposium on political and social philosophy, and to numerous other visitors who have come to enjoy its fruits. The participants are authorities in almost all branches of philosophy, besides being specialists in several specific fields. The others, who have come to hear these men, are representative of a happily increasing group of people who evince a growing and vital interest in philosophical solutions to the political and social problems of our times.
It is particularly appropriate that such a meeting should take place in these days. The world is beset on every hand by false philosophies, and far too little is known of the true one. Especially in the field of government is the conflict between philosophies apparent. Such forces as communism and fascism everywhere attack the Church, threaten the complete destruction of democracy.
’ Everywhere Catholics are looking to the Church for
an answer, watching her every move, hoping she will use her most powerful weapons against these subversive doctrines. And this is almost equally true of intelligent persons outside the Church. The universalism of Christianity, the time-honored guardian of the cultural heritage of the Western world, is the last resort of all thinking persons.
That the Church militant is fulfilling this function is self-evident. Catholic education, organizations of Catholic youth, the Catholic press, all contribute their weapons to the battle. But none of these is as powerful in combating the opposing evils as a sound Catholic philosophy. This is the only weapon which is equal to their own. This is the only way we can win — by fighting fire with fire.
The course of action is clear. We must propound this one true philosophy to the world. And the very best media for this purpose are just such meetings as this symposium.
Thus it is proudly that we welcome not only the participants in the symposium, but those who come to partake of it as well. We feel that Notre Dame is an extremely fortunate host. And we hope that this is truly the beginning of the inevitably necessary movement to stamp out false philosophy, particularly in government.—Mark J. Mitchell.
Air Waves
We think that the German press had a perfect right to ask, “What shall become of such a people?” If such a thing had happened in any of the unenlightened countries of Europe we would have rolled in the aisles from coast to coast — what more could you expect from the blighted beggars. But it didn’t happen in any of the backward, simple nations — it happened here, in our own sophisticated United States, in this land where cynicism abounds on every street corner, and disbelief covers the land like autumn leaves.
What are we talking about? Only the uproar caused by the broadcast of the “undeclared” war waged against earthmen by men from Mars as presented by Mr. Orson Welles and his company. That an entire nation, (if we can believe the press) could be taken in by such a fantastic concoction as this radio show, shows something or other, the exact nature of which is puzzling.
If a nation of people can be so easily taken in as to be thrown into hysteria by an incident of this sort, what would happen if the real article ever appeared? Of course no one expects any “unfriendly gestures” from the “Men from Mars” — at least not in the near future — but what would be the state of affairs if a genuine alarm were to be given in such dramatic fashion? We shudder to think of the consequences.
What did the incident then prove? Certainly not the desirability of federal censorship of the air waves. Such a proceeding would be far from a cure for jittery nerves and could have only evil results in a free medium of expression.
Then what is the lesson to be learned from the incident? Frankly, we don’t know. Perhaps it is that we are not so smart after all. Probably the best result of the whole affair will be a more humble attitude when speaking of our “superenlightened” national intellect. But even that won’t answer the question: “What shall become of such a people?”—Vincent De Coursey.

DIES IRAE
Translated by Dr. W. J. Irons
The average Catholic, unfortunately, has but slight acquaintance with the hymns of the Liturgy. The Dies Irae, which we are reprinting in view of the month of the Holy Souls, is the Sequence sung just before the Gospel in masses for the dead. It dates from the 13th century and its author was Thomas of Celano, a Franciscan. A very considerable literature has grown up about it, the translations alone numbering several hundred. Sir Walter Scott gives the substance of the hymn in four stanzas of the Lay of the Last Minstrel. Excellent source material is in the Hymns of the Breviary and Missal by Rev. Matthew Britt, O.S.B. The whole subject is a challenge to the interest of students of music, comparative literature or poetry. Perhaps they will accept the challenge and tell us about their discoveries.
Day of wrath and doom impending, David’s word with Sibyl’s blending! Heaven and earth in ashes ending!
O, what fear man’s bosom rendeth, When from heaven the Judge descendeth, On whose sentence all dependethl
Wondrous sound the trumpet flingeth, Through earth’s sepulchers it ringeth, All before the throne it bringeth.
Death is struck, and nature quaking, All creation is awaking, To its Judge an answer making.
Lo! the book exactly worded, Wherein all hath been recorded; Thence shall judgment be awarded.
When the Jttdge His seat attaineth, And each hidden deed arraigneth, Nothing unavenged remaineth.
What shall I, frail man, be pleading? Who for me be interceding, When the just are mercy needing?
King of majesty tremendous, Who dost free salvation send us, Fount of pity, then befriend us!
Think, kind Jesu! my salvation Caused Thy wondrous Incarnation; Leave me not to reprobation.
Faint and weary Thou hast sought me, On the Cross of suffering brought me; Shall such grace be vainly brought me?
Righteous Judge! for sin’s pollution Grant Thy gift of absolution, Ere that day of retribution.
Guilty, now I pour my moaning, All my shame with anguish owning; Spare, O God, Thy suppliant groaning!
Through the sinful woman shriven, Through the dying thief forgiven, Thou to me a hope hast given.
Worthless are my prayers and sighing, Yet, good Lord, in grace complying, Rescue me from fires undying.
With Thy favored sheep O place me, Nor among the goats abase me, But to Thy right hand upraise me.
While the wicked are confounded, Doomed to flames of woe unbounded, Call me with Thy Saints surrounded.
Low I kneel, with heart submission, Crushed to ashes in contrition;
. Help me in my last condition!
Ah! that day of tears and mourning! From the dust of earth returning, Man for judgment must prepare him;
Spare, O God, in mercy spare him!
Lord all-pitying, Jesu Blest, Grant them Thine eternal rest.

THE WEEK IN SPORTS
NAVY. IN SPITE OF MEDIOCRE RECORD. SHOULD
BE AS STRONG AS LAST YEAR TOMORROW
ZAHM IS NEW HALL
FOOTBALL CHAMP
By Robert B. Voelker
A crowd in excess of 55,000 will pack the Baltimore stadium tomorrow to see Notre Dame play the Navy in the 12th game of a series that challenges the Cadet-Irish rivalry in popularity. A “We’re-from-Missouri” attitude rules at Crabtown on the Bay at the prospect of beating the Irish tomorrow.
Navy’s rugged line, manned by such battle cruisers as Wallace, Hy-song, Jarvis and Bergner should find smooth sailing, but in the backfield Navy needs a brilliant climax runner of the “Buzz” Borries type. Navy’s starting lineup will be approximately as strong as last season’s. Among the few veterans of last year’s fray is E. W. (Pumpkin) Wood, who scored an early touchdown lead for the Midshipmen which lasted until a startling Notre Dame rally upset the Navy hopes with a 9 to 7 final score.
A. B. Wallace, a veteran who played fine ball at center last year, will start at that position tomorrow. At guard, Harry Spector and J. J. McMullen will probably start. Spector is dogged and aggressive, and McMullen saw considerable action as a reserve last year.
One of the best defensive tackles in the country, Bergner, and another powerful tackle, Jarvis, may play the •whole game for Navy tomorrow. Due to Navy’s weakness at guard K. B. Hysong, -with two year’s experience, may play either guard or tackle, since Jarvis and Bergner should find clear sailing at the tackle posts.
The flanking positions are strong. Captain L. C. Powell will be at one end, and L. E. Burke, a big, rugged type end who works well with a five-man-line, will be at the other. Captain Powell may be shifted to the backfield since he has had experience there.
As for its scoring raids, Navy will rely on Lem Cooke and Elmont Whitehead. Convoying these two will be Emmet Wood, ’hard as a marlin spike and capable of a handsome blocking job. Either Anderson or Holovak should be at the fullback position. Navy has found it difficult to replace guns of the caliber of Ingram, Franks and McFarland. But if games are really won. up-front, as many of the experts claim, then watch Navy!

On Thursday, Oct. 27, Zahm Hall won the play-off of the 1938 Interhall Pass-Football league by defeating the Freshman team, 6-0. The victory, gained after a hard battle, was a fitting climax to the domination of Zahm teams during the season. The 1938 competition, comprising 175 students, was the most successful in the history of the school.
In the soccer league, the Junior team increased its lead in the standings by a 5-0 victory over Brownson. The contest served to move Brownson into third place, a half-game behind the Sophomores. This win,, the third in a row for Norv Hunthausen’s upperclassmen, left the Juniors undefeated so far this season.
Bees Trim Purdue
The Notre Dame reserves showed that they had a bit of the varsity spirit in coming from behind to overcome an early Purdue lead and go on to win. This 12-6 victory came as a fitting climax close to an undefeated season for the “Bees.”
The Purdue team scored early in the first quarter, but after that the Irish, led by the fine play of Sweeny Tuck, passed and ran for a pair of touchdowns while holding the Boilermaker’s attack in check.
After the opening kickoff a short punt gave the Purdue reserves a chance at the goal line. With a pair of well executed passes the boys from Lafayette scored, but the drop kick for the extra point failed.
Taking the ball on the kickoff, the Notre Dame team began a march which climaxed by a 30 yard pass, Tuck to Cassidy, brought the ball down within the ten yard line, but Purdue held. With the starting backs again in the game the team moved down to the 40 yard line on two long passes by Tuck to Berta. Walt Kris-toff plunged through the line for the tying score. Koch’s conversion attempt was blocked.
A few plays after the Purdue team had received the kickoff, a fumble in midfield was recovered by Kristoff. A quick pass to Berta from Tuck gained ten yards and then Sweeney broke through the line and galloped the remaining 40 yards for a touchdown.

NAVY EDITOR VIEWS MIDDIES’ CHANCES
LARGEST HOME CROWD OF SEASON TO WATCH NOTRE DAME AND GOPHERS NEXT WEEK
By Midshipman Wm. Lee Savidge Sports Editor,
The Log of The United States Naval Academy
Annapolis, Md., Nov. 3.—(Special) —There will be many strange gyrations in the minds of Navy supporters Saturday afternoon when their teams run out on the turf of Baltimore Stadium for the annual Navy - Notre Dame game. They will be thinking of 1938 records and of the games in this series played in 1936 and 1937. The 1936 game, won by Navy on Bill Ingram’s field goal, and the 1937 game lost by two points are fresh in their memories. Both games were the pinnacle of Navy’s football season. For the rest of 1936 season they barely held their own, and last year the Notre Dame game started Navy on a landslide which was only slightly checked by a victory over Columbia.
The 1938 record of Notre Dame is as formidable as that of any team in the country, and no one knows it any better than the Navy. With one eye on the scores of the last two games, and the other on the 1938 Ramblers’ record, Navy’s fans are wondering.
Navy’s lineup will be undoubtedly the same as that which has worked all season. The backfield will consist of Monty Whitehead, the fastest Navy wingback in years, at number one; Ed Gillette, a fast-charging junior, at number two; Emmett Wood, largest ground gainer on the Navy squad, will pack his 175 pounds at number three; and Lem Cooke will pass and run from the tailback position. In the line Captain “Pete” Powell, 180-pound end is expected to continue his fine defensive work and pass receiving. Lou Burke or Clarence Corbett will fill the post at right end.
At tackle will be big Al Bergner, who played for the first time last week after a two weeks’ absence due to a knee injury, and Ken Hysong or Ben Jarvis, both • veterans. The guard positions will be filled by Tom McGrath, a converted tackle, and Herman Spector, a veteran. McGrath so proved his worth by taking over Bergner’s job, that Coach Hank Hardwick feels that he cannot do without the big boy. Mike Wallace will start at center and will be ably backed up by Hal Harwood. Other linemen who should see duty are Wolfe and Witter at guard, and George Ghesquire and Chick Baughman at end. In the backfield Cliff Lenz is a ready and able substitute for Cooke, while Mayo, Gray, Hansen and Blaha are ready to come in at a second’s notice.
A week from tomorrow 55,000 expectant fans will watch Notre Dame try
to repeat its bitterly won victory of last year over Minnesota. None of the iron-nerved crowd who witnessed the exhausting struggle at Minneapolis will
ever forget the dogged, bruising battle
Gopher Fullback Buhler
“... Reminiscent of the past...”
Top Getchell Case
Warren Brown has unearthed from the pages of Touchdown by Alonzo Stagg and Wesley Stout a disputed down incident to match the Getchell-Tech-Notre Dame one of vivid memory: Mr. Brown’s quote from the book in his Herald-Examiner column, “So They Tell Me”:
“The war scuttled our squad in 1917, but with three veterans to nine, he held Illinois 0 to 0. An error of the referee, the only instance of the kind in my experience, all but beat us. At a critical moment he gave Illinois a fifth down, refusing to accept a head linesman’s word that they already had their quota. Illinois employed the fifth down to try for a goal that missed.”
put up by two hardy lines. Minnesota still has four veterans from that line — Schultz at tackle, Captain Twedell and Bell at guard, and Elmer and Kulbitski at center. For the Irish Joe Beinor is the lone survivor of the seven bulwarks who humbled the Gophers at Memorial Stadium. Lost to Bernie Bierman are such stars as Lou Midler, Ray King, Bob Weld, Andy Uram, Bill Matheny, and Rudy Gmitro who fortified the ’37 team. But a line averaging 198 and a backfield averaging 190 are no handicap to any team — especially when the men are as clever and experienced as the present Gopher powerhouse.
In Buhler and Christiansen they have two line smashers whose churning legs and swaying hips are almost impossible to stop without a gain of at least two or three yards. Buhler in particular is reminiscent of the great Minnesota fullbacks of the past — Joesting, Nagurski, Manders, Kost-ka, and Beise. Then there is Hal Van Every whose passing almost beat the Irish in the closing minutes last year. Hal passes, kicks, runs, and is the key-man of the backfield. Last year he gained 526 yards for an average of 5.95 yards per try. At the other half will be Wilbur Moore, a tricky runner and a devastating blocker — a man who really hits ’em and loves to hit ’em.
The Gopher forwards are as huge as ever, but in addition can move with speed and agility — two fundamental assets for a Bierman lineman. Minnesota has two first rank centers in Dan Elmer and Big John Kulbitski ; probably the finest pair of guards in the country in Horace Bell and Captain Twedell; a wealth of tackles in Schultz, Pederson, Kilbourne, Johnson, and Levoir (Babe’s brother); and two fine ends in John Mariucci and George Nash. Nash is a three-letter man in basketball. Yes, he can catch a pass, — anywhere within reach.
Varsity Basketball
After several scrimmages during the past week, the varsity basketball squad is definitely past the opening stages of practice. Handicapped by the absence of Brown and Sitko, currently working with the football squad, the Irish nevertheless show-much potential power. Sadowsky and DuCharme lead the men from last year’s varsity, while Ziegenhom and Riska appear to be. the best prospects from the 1937 freshman squad.

NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC
NAVY - N. D. SERIES IS TWELVE YEARS OLD
•
Navy and Notre Dame meet on the gridiron tomorrow in the twelfth renewal of a football rivalry which began in 1927 and has been an outstanding feature of the autumn season ever since. The Fighting Irish have won eight and the Middies three of the eleven games played to date.
In 1927 the series was inaugurated in the Baltimore Civic Stadium before a capacity crowd. Rockne used his shock troops during the entire first half, and the Middies led, 6 to 0, at the intermission. The first team went into action in the final half and quickly scored three touchdowns. The final score was 19 to 6 in favor of Notre Dame.
At Soldier’s Field, Chicago, in 1928 Johnny Niemiec passed to Colerick in the closing moments of the final quarter to give the Irish a 7 to 0 victory.
In 1929 Notre Dame made it three in a row as they defeated the Sailors, 14 to 7. In the final period Navy led, 7 to 0, but Carideo faded back and passed to Jack Elder who crossed the goal line for the first Irish score. A few seconds later Carideo returned a punt to the Navy three yard line where “Moon” Mullins plunged over for a touchdown. The Middies came here in 1930 to help dedicate the stadium, but Joe Savoldi had a field day and the home team won, 26 to 2.
Marchmont Schwartz was the star performer in the 1931 contest which saw Notre Dame win, 20 to 0. The Clevelanders witnessed the sixth consecutive victory in 1932 as the Navy was trounced, 14 to 0, in the Cleveland Municipal Stadium.
Navy snapped this winning streak in 1933 with a 7 to 0 victory. First downs were 21 to 4 in favor of the Irish, but the Navy line was impregnable when the Irish were threatening its goal line. In 1934 the Annapolis boys won again, this time 10 to 6.
Andy Pitney led the Irish attack in 1935 as they defeated Navy, 14 to 0. The regulars could get nowhere but the second team, sparked by Andy Pilney who was destined to become one of football’s immortals at Columbus the following Saturday, scored rather easily. Pilney’s passes to Gaul and Layden were both turned into touchdowns. In 1936 Bill Ingram was a headache to Irish passers all afternoon and finally kicked a field goal to give his team a 3 to 0 victory.
Last year, in a blinding Indiana snow storm, Notre Dame was the victor, 9 to 7. Going into the fourth quarter the Irish trailed 7 to 0, but after three minutes had passed Jack McCarthy scored on a perfect play and Puplis kicked the extra point to tie the score. With but three minutes

Introducing
By Eddie Huff
Augie Bossu never will be afflicted with “senioritis.”
“Senioritis” is the malady that afflicts four-year football men who were small fry as sophomores and great shakes during the next year. Their farewell year is spent in vale-
dictory from the plush cushions they upholstered as sophs and bounced around in as juniors.
Augie is Notre Dame’s right guard. “Augie” he is to the boys; Mom ’n Pop Bossu use “August Francis” in addressing their one-and-only. But to “Introducing” he will be “Gus.” Speculate: 180 pounds of five-feet-ten guard getting by as “Augie”; not here.
Gus is a gridder’s gridder; he is the fellow who wrote the line: “Actions speak louder than words.”
A one - time all - American guard looking on at the Ulinois-Notre Dame tussle from the press coop observed: “Notre Dame’s ‘17’ is the best man on the field today.”
Gus learned the Pitt system of guard play at Monongahela High near Pittsburgh. He formed “Mon City’s” midway with “Tuffy” Sklar, Big-Six guard at Kansas State, and “Ookie” Miller, who was Indiana’s Big Ten selection at center last year.
Gus fractured a shoulder in high school, and it was suggested that he have the ailing clavicle treated by Doctor Leo O’Donnell, Notre Dame alumnus and team physician for Duquesne University. “I’m not certain whether that shoulder has responded to treatment, Gus,” Doc O’Donnell said, “but you enroll at Notre Dame and play football. If nothing happens there that shoulder will outlast Gibraltar.”
Gus just missed winning a monogram last year. If the Wages and Hours bill doesn’t close the wool factories he will show the Monon Valley an N.D. at Christmas vacation.
MINNESOTA HAS YET TO DEFEAT IRISH
•
Minnesota has never defeated Notre Dame in a football game! In each of the four games which have been played Minnesota has never scored more than one touchdown.
In the first meeting of the schools, back in 1925, the Irish overpowered the Gophers, 19-7. No score was made until the first play of the second period, when Rex Enright plunged over from the four-yard line. The extra point was kicked, and Notre Dame led 7-0. Minnesota followed with a touchdown march, and the score was tied.
In the first play of the final quarter Christy Flanagan scored, and a few plays later Rex Enright plunged over again. In this game the line play of Joe Boland was outstanding, and in the final half his blocking of punts led to the scores.
In 1926, before a capacity crowd of 55,000 Notre Dame triumphed, this time 20-7. The Irish were again the first to score, as Ray Dahman ran 65 yards for a touchdown. Minnesota came back to tie the score, and at the half it was 7-7. In the third quarter Christy Flanagan dodged and weaved his way 65 yards for the touchdown which put Notre Dame ahead. Minnesota did not threaten again, and in the fourth quarter Red Hearndon scored the clinching touchdown.
In 1927 the two teams battled to a 7-7 tie. Minnesota’s score was directly traceable to a mixup in signals which resulted in a Notre Dame fumble, recovered by the great Bronko Nagurski. Niemiec did the point making for Notre Dame.
The 1937 struggle was won by Notre Dame by means of a first quarter touchdown march. Andy Puplis returned the first punt of the game 40 yards to the Gopher’s 33. McCarthy ran and passed the ball to the three yard line. On a quarterback sneak Puplis went through center for a touchdown. Puplis then kicked the game-winning extra point. Minnesota passed for its touchdown, but Faust’s try for extra point was blocked by Chuck Sweeney.
Gus is a 60-minute ball player; he gets better with each game and improves with each minute of the succeeding game. He has not scraped the headlines during the first two-thirds of the Irish schedule, but when Braven Dyer is seeking a lead for that “ninth-inning” at Los Angeles he can write one for the “Sphinx,” ' introducing Gus Bossu.

SPLINTERS FROM THE PRESS BOX
By Andy Wilson
We returned from New York Monday morning highly satisfied with the showing of the football team against Army, but definitely displeased with one or two of the city’s better sports writers. Most of the columnists gave Notre Dame proper credit for defeat-a very spirited and strong Army eleven; a belittling few insisted on “breaks”' and sheer numbers as the winning factors. One fellow even saw fit to wisecrack about the “seven teams” Elmer Layden had along to wear down the scanty soldier squad. He must have failed to note than only 38 men were on the Irish travelling squad. Indeed, till the fourth quarter, when all the Irish extras finally got into the game, Army managed to match all Irish substitutions.
Another writer, who made no mention of the nullification of Earl Brown’s pass interception and touchdown run by the referee’s fast whistle, insists that this same fast whistle allowed Notre Dame to retain possession of the ball when Will Hofer fumbled on Army’s 30-yard line, and thus set up the winning touchdown. And he further insists that the officials missed a clipping penalty against Notre Dame on Ben Sheridan’s long run to the two-foot line. These two perfectly normal incidents he makes into bad “breaks” that broke Army’s spirit and helped the Irish on to victory. The only real “break” for Notre Dame was the recovery of the short kickoff immediately after the first Irish touchdown — and that was nullified by Saggau’s fumble a few plays later.
There were no complaints from the Cadets themselves — but then there never are. Even in 1935, when a highly disputable pass - interference penalty gave the Irish a 6-6 tie, Coach Gar Davidson displayed chagrin, but denounced no one. Indeed, year in and year out, the Cadets are the finest of sportsmen, gracious losers and gracious winners both.
This was the first game of the year in which the Irish had to come from behind to win, and the way they refused to let up after discouragingly missing the first point after touchdown rather reminded us of the last time, in 1933, a Notre Dame team required two touchdowns to catch the flying West Pointers.
Of all the games within our own experience that were won by sheer spiritual determination, this ranks second to only one — an affair at Columbus, Ohio, in the autumn of 1935.
The yearly ballyhoo that makes
All-Americans in December of the opportunists in October is already under way. Men like Johnny Wysocki of Villanova, Sid Luckman of Columbia, and Davey O’Brien of Texas Christian, who have figured so prominently in the scoring of their teams so far, and who have caught the eyes of sports writers, are pretty well assured by now of recognition on one or several All-American teams.
This year we believe Earl Brown deserves All-American ranking, if any one does. He is a good blocker and tackler, fast, lithe, graceful and shifty as a ball-carrier, smart on defense, excellent at pass-receiving.
WITH THE TEAM TO NEW YORK
. . . For convenience the Irish dressed for Friday’s workout around the swimming pool at Westchester Country Club. A good many would have preferred a swim to a shower, but such a muscle-loosening activity is taboo during football season. . . .
... To one who always associates the various hooded Orders with quiet monasteries somewhere in secluded woods, it was very interesting to see at Sunday Mass the bearded and robed Capuchin friars at the Church of St. John of the Cross, West 32nd Street, and the brown-robed Franciscans at the Church of St. Francis of Assisi on West 31st Street, both in the heart of downtown Manhattan. . . .
. . . Because of a misunderstanding about train times, Captain Jim McGoldrick kept the special waiting 45 minutes at Grand Central Station, then came hustling through the crowd around the train-gate, grinning sheepishly ... He looked quite the Notre Dame football player with his Irish face and smile; and his new “shiner” drew numerous “ooh’s” and “ah’s” from the ladies.
. . . Having worked out Friday in green jerseys, the Irish broke all Army game tradition by dressing in blue Saturday. The Cadets themselves wore white, and broke another tradition by kicking a point after touchdown. Oddly enough, it turned out to be the 13th game and the 13th touchdown since their last successful conversion against the Irish in 1925.
Put these down on your list as the best games of the week between teams coached by former Notre Dame stars: Villanova vs. Auburn (Clipper Smith and Jack Meagher); Dayton vs. Xavier (Harry Baujan and Clem Crowe); Fordham vs. St. Mary’s (Jimmy Crowley and Slip Madigan).
N. D. FALTERS. THEN ROUTS ARMY TEAM
0
The Army couldn’t stop the Fighting Irish; Notre Dame was on the move, still on its march to national championship honors; and the U. S. Military Academy became its fifth victim of the year. The final score of the thrill-packed game played in Yankee Stadium, New York City, was 19 to 7.
The Irish had many stars, but the whole team glittered. Some called “Whitey” Beinor the fifth man in the Cadets’ backfield; Earl Brown, living up to the Notre Dame tradition of great ends, was all over the field; Benny Sheridan rode again; Harry Stevenson and Bob Saggau were throwing strikes; Joseph Robert The-sing and Milt Piepul were practically unstoppable; and so on down the rest of the team, the men who made possible the starring work of others.
Again Army Notre Dame lived up to the reputation gained in the Kansas game — potentially the greatest team since Rock’s last eleven.
But a team can’t live on its “rep.” Army proved that on the opening kickoff. The Cadets from West Point took the ball and drove 73 yards for a score. Then they converted the extra point for the first time in 13 years. Yes Sir! the Army meant business. Notre Dame was on the short end of the score for the first time this season. How would they fare now — with the chips down?
Starting to work right then, the Irish drove twice deep into Army territory, but the stout Army line held.
Coming back onto the field for the second half, the Irish went back to work again, and finally a pass from Saggau to Brown netted 48 yards and a touchdown. Saggau’s attempted drop kick for the extra point failed, and Notre Dame fans groaned.
But Notre Dame was on the move, and when Notre Dame is on the move, they are practically unstoppable. They proved that in the Georgia Tech and Carnegie Tech battles. And so to add to the great lore about Notre Dame coming from behind in the last stages to beat Army, the Irish put over two more touchdowns in the final quarter to cop the ball game. One of the markers was the result of a 30-yard prance by Benny Sheridan. The other was a 48-jaunt by Thesing.
NAVY PREWRITE
(Continued from Page 16) of play remaining, Puplis returned a Navy punt from his own 38-yard to the vicitors’ nine. After three plays Notre Dame fumbled on the Navy five. McFarland went behind his goal to kick out of danger but he juggled the slippery pigskin and the alert Chuck Sweeney broke through and tackled him behind the goal line to win the game.

Religious services attending the beatification of Frances Xavier Cabrini in the Vatican will be heard over National Broadcasting Company networks on Sunday, Nov. 13.
In addition to an English description of the solemn service for Mother Cabrini, the Sistine Chapel Choir will offer a new cantata written specially for the occasion by the eminent Italian composer and conductor, Don Lorenzo Perosi. A portion of a new mass by the same composer also will be heard.
Although born in Italy, Mother Cabrini was a naturalized American citizen and her elevation to sainthood marks the first time that any American, either naturalized or native-born, has been so honored. Mother Cabrini devoted her entire life to the care and aid of young girls. She died in Chicago about 20 years ago.
Conze/man Likes Backs
Just about seven-elevenths of every football team in the United States is going to get pretty mad at Jimmy Conzelman, coach of Washington University’s football team, when it hears about Jimmy’s article in the current issue of the Saturday Evening Post. For the likable coach of the St. Louis school’s gridmen makes in that article, some statements that are bound to shock some and amuse others of the conservative school of football.
It all adds up to this: Conzelman thinks that linemen on a modern grid team, when compared to backs, are about as useful as a broom stick in a softball game. Says Jimmy: “Give me eleven 220 pound advance men and our opponents would pass us dizzy, cut didoes after they had knifed through tackle, and generally make us look as if we were standing still when we were trying to advance the ball.”
It’s interesting to note that the Conzelman theory differs from that of “Rock,” who, as we remember it, used to start building his ball clubs with two big tough tackles.
It is apparently quite possible that football players entering the game in the future will have to present union . cards to the referee, and that the larger universities will have to pay players a wage determined by the C.I.O. or the A. F. of L.; for it was recently reported that a gridster at L.S.U. was dropped from the squad for attempting to organize the members of his team into a football union.
Voices and Views I
Mr. L. S.
c-o Editor of Notre Dame Scholastic
Dear L. S.:
Please don’t think for a moment that I am writing in agreement with your letter to the editor of the Scholastic, Oct. 27. However, you did express my sentiments in the last two sentences of the first paragraph when you stated, “You sure can find out a lot about a fellow from the way he reacts to some of these pictures. It really shows him up.” Now there’s a true statement. L. S., if you “feel embarrassed as the dickens,” then don’t heed my suggestion—think for a moment and discover just what you have branded yourself.
You ask for “something really worthwhile” and you slur the picture “Stage Door.” Why, in the name of a considerate and intelligent audience, do you suppose that this very picture was acclaimed throughout the country as one best of the year? Could it be that the U. S. has gone a little crackpot? Honestly, I don’t think so. According to your article, the real crackpots are all those who have sung the praises of dramatic ability since way back when Hamlet was in the making (by the way, Hamlet is a Dramatic Play written by one William Shakespeare) but then I suppose you don’t know that “guy” since “where you come from they are not used to-that kind of stuff.” And because an excellent actress does an excellent job, she becomes a ‘babe’ who is appreciated only by “intellectual dopes.” What do you come to Notre Dame for anyway—gags an’ gals? If so, you’re in the wrong spot, buddy. I am certain if you drank even a sip of the intellectual cup, you would forget all about destructive critical letters.
“All the world’s a stage,” man, and if you’ve had enough of that “dramatic junk” then you better get wise to yourself. If Dramatic Art is an “insult to your intelligence” then I doubt very much that anything has been insulted....If you want some “action and fast gags” go down to the Oliver theatre—Six Gun Pete or Joe Penner, the idol of the grammar schools, play there nearly every other day.

“Summer Time,” “It Ain’t Necessarily So,” and “I Got Plenty O’ Nothin’,” three of the most popular modern classics heard on the radio today, were given their original interpretation by the famous Eve Jessye Choir which is to appear in Washington Hall on November 11 at 8:15 p.m. This distinguished Negro singing ensemble was chosen by the late George Gershwin to appear in his successful folk-opera, “Porgy and Bess,” the opera from which the three numbers are taken.
The program of the group here will consist of examples of the finest Negro folk literature covering the entire field of Negro composition for choral presentation. Many new and little known spirituals, discovered and arranged by Miss Jessye, will be included, as well as folk songs, modern blues, and numbers from “Porgy and Bess.”
Buffalo Club Skate
On Nov. 7 at the newly re-decor-ated Playland Roller Skating Rink the Buffalo Club of Notre Dame will hold its annual skating party. Judging from the success of previous ventures the party this year bids fair to exceed all others. The chairmen of the party this year are George Fer-rick and Dick Ball, both of Morrissey Hall.
Tickets will be on sale by students who are from the Buffalo area, or by the chairmen themselves. The price of admission for men is 40c, for women only 20c. The low cost should make this party attractive to all.
The time of the party is from 7 to 11, and adequate transportation facilities will be available. Races and unique contests will feature the program.

SO THEY SAY
“Army’s gallant football team fought itself to exhaustion to gain a victory it was not supposed to win in Yankee Stadium yesterday afternoon, but in the end Notre Dame’s power, ably supplemented by breaks and official manipulations of the great Code Okeson, prevailed and the blueclad Irish of South Bend, won, 19 to 7.
“Notre Dame had the greater power and better football team, particularly in view of its ability to send in reserves, eleven at a time, but the outcome and the lopsidedness of the score, if retailed without explanation, would work injustice on an Army team which rose gallantly, fought gamely and lost narrowly, and, if we have not been -clear heretofore, without favor from fate or the current interpreters of the official code.”— New York Herald Tribune.
“Thus the Irish march to another crown, after seven years, continues unabated. Beaten, 7 to 0, at the intermission and never beyond the Soldiers’ 20-yard line in the halfhour, the Irish struck like furies in the second half. A combination pass and run of 49 yards from Bob Sag-gau to Earl Brown scored the first touchdown. A 20-yard run and 1-yard plunge by Ben Sheridan accounted for the second, and a 47-yard slash through the line by Joe Thesing wound up the spree. At the finish only fwo Irish substitutes out of a squad of 36 had not been used.”—. Chicago Daily News.
“Things are looking perfectly swell for your Uncle Samuel’s soldier boys from West Point in their silver anniversary football game with Notre Dame this bright autumnal afternoon, up to the last quarter when Sheridan’s ride comes off....
“Then Sheridan takes his ride through the valley of the West Pointers, devastating high hopes right and left.”—Damon Runyan, International News Service.

AWARD LAETARE MEDAL
(Continued from Page 3)
the Fourth Sunday of Lent, Father O’Hara, chairman of the Laetare Medal committee, stated:
“The merit of Dr. Abell in his profession has been signally recognized in his election to the presidency of the American Medical Association; and his varied service to city and state and nation, as surgeon, citizen, soldier, and Christian gentleman, has endeared him the esteem of a numer-

ous and extensive public benefited by his years of devotion to . the complete welfare of his fellow men.
“Most significant perhaps among the achievements of this eminent man of medicine is his contribution to the difficult science of psychiatry and his efficient effort toward the cure and prevention of mental disorder. Hence, it is anticipated that the selection of Dr. Irwin William Abell as the one most worthy of being added this year to the distinguished company of Laetare medalists will have the hearty approval from a large public already aware of his merit.”
As the seventh member of the medical profession to be honored with the medal award, Dr. Abell has had a long and distinguished career in surgery. He has been particularly aggressive in realizing improvements in medical and psychiatric facilities in Kentucky’s eleemosynary institutions.
Born on Sept. 13, 1876, in Lebanon, Ky., Dr. Abell comes from a family who originally settled in Kentucky in 1788. He was graduated from St. Mary’s College, St. Mary’s, Ky., in 1892, and five years later obtained his degree in medicine from the University of Louisville Medical School. In Europe he studied at the universities of Marburg and Berlin.
The Laetare Medal award, intended as a recognition of accomplishment and an incentive to greater achievement, originated in the ancient papal custom of bestowing the Golden Rose on a member of the Italian Catholic nobility on Laetare Sunday. The American counterpart was inaugurated at Notre Dame in 1883 when the Very Rev. Edward Sorin, C.S.C., founder of the University, presented the first medal to the late John Gil-mary Shea, eminent Catholic historian.

In the 1918 elections, Arthur Griffiths was our candidate; and the reaction against the new British Law of Conscription turned popular opinion in our favor. Irish sentiment was so violently opposed to the conscription act that England withdrew it shortly, yet not until I had been arrested (almost by mistake you might say, my conduct had been so exemplary!) by the British Intelligence. I was taken after several stops to Kingston where I was stowed in the hold of a British minesweeper and brought to London and kept in jail there for several months. While in jail it was amusing to get letters from Prime Minister Lloyd George telling me that ‘the King would be honored with your presence at the opening of Parliament.’ ”
Mr. Fitzgerald was released in March, 1919, but refused to attend Parliamentary sessions in London. Instead, the Dail (pronounced Doyle) Erin was formed and met publicly, though all business was transacted at secret meetings. Eamon De Valera went to the United States at this point to get American moral support and funds to carry on. “Ireland will be forever grateful to America for the enthusiastic and generous response she showed our cause,” said Mr. Fitzgerald.
The British government was tired of this constant guerrilla warfare in Ireland and became convinced that the only way to stop it was to give certain people a free hand there. The result was that Black and Tan British troops began with bloody brutality to smash any sign of opposition in Ireland. The British Intelligence forged letters on stolen Irish stationery and published facsimiles of them in The London Times to discredit the rebel leaders, but Mr. Fitzgerald exposed the forgeries in his own paper, The Irish Bulletin, and went them one better by publishing papers and photographs stolen by Irish spies from British headquarters’ files in Dublin Castle.
“Black and Tan brutality failed to accomplish its purpose, so the British Labor government sent a delegation to Dublin to effect some sort of compromise. In November of 1920 th< delegation conferred with General MacCready, and then with Arthur Griffiths, who was in jail. The latter, convinced they were in good faith, told the delegation where I was hiding and they came to see me. But while I was talking to Henderson and the others of the delegation, a lookout signalled that British lorries were coming and I fled. However,” Mr. Fitzgerald concluded, “Lloyd George next persuaded Archbishop Clune of Australia to come to Dublin to see what he could do.”

Bookmen Hear Simon
Professor Yves Simon gave an informal lecture to the Bookmen last week in the Law building. Dr. Simon discussed the backgrounds of contemporary French religious life. Starting with an account of French education in the early part of the nineteenth century, Dr. Simon noted the change from feckless religionism in education to active anti-clericism with the Third Republic.
At present, Dr. Simon explained, the state is indifferent to religious instruction; and the work of Catholic education is obstructed more by financial difficulties than by official opposition. In the face of this discouraging background, Catholic educators and students have progressed enormously and vitally; there are fervent genuine Catholic movements among French students and teachers.
Mr. Frank O’Laughlin, Bookmen librarian, announced the arrival of some of the books chosen for the Bookmen library; they include:
Thomas Mann’s The Coming Victory of Democracy, Jacques Mari-tain’s Freedom in the Modern World, Paul Carrol’s Shadow and Substance, Thornton Wilder’s Our Town, Margaret Halsey’s With Malice Toivard Some, Ogden Nash’s I’m a Stranger Here Myself.
Joe Casasanta stole some of Elmer Layden’s stuff last Thursday when he put his band through their Army game formations in the afternoon, and then followed up with an aftersupper session under the floodlights on Cartier Field.
