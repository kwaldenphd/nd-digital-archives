STAFF EDITORIAL 
Ifyou don't have anything nice.to say... Racial comedy at Notre Dame goes a step too far 
On October 27, two comedians stepped out of their comfort zones with th~ intention of bringing others out of theirs' for serious dia­logue; the results were less than laughable. Seniors Will Seath and Brian Berry addressed issues such as questionable word choice and self-segregation at Notre Dame through the unconventional means 
of "racist" comedy. While this channel for discussion was effective for reaching their audience, it was ill-received and seen as insensi­tive. As widely published as this topic has been, Scholastic feels it is important to further analyze the situation and its.implications in the article "How Open is Open-Mic?" 
Whenever race relations are brought into question, the topic must be handled with the utmost of delicacy. For this reason, Seath's and Berry's methods are extremely reckless, as they degraded an American civil rights hero and made light ofa slur thathas centuries ofoppression 
tied with it. Not only were their comments irresponsible and insensi­tive, but also foolish. No minority group is going to engage and open up to a majority that is seemingly abusive. While these methods may steal a few cheap laughs, they completely undermine one's efforts for sustainable change. 
On the flipside, Scholastic does not believe that Seath and Berry intended to sound racist. The two are much like any student at Notre Dame -easygoing and respectable. Their mental lapse was just made on a grander scale than the typical faux pas. The suspension from Legends can be construed as harsher than necessary. After all, this deprives them of a major, personal outlet to issue an apology or rectify the situation. Being deprived of a channel of communication is a violation of one's freedom ofspeech. As Voltaire boldly proclaimed, "I disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it." 
As for the validity oftheir statements, a number ofstudents wrote to The Observer to confirm that self-segregation happens at Notre Dame for reasons of comfort. As is well-known, Notre Dame is not the most diverse university in the country, with 75 percent of the student body declaring themselves as "White/Non-Hispanic." Many minority stu­dents come to Notre Dame ;from much less homogenous societies. This supposed self-segregation allows Notre Dame students to maintain some oftheir safeguards that they left in their hometowns. Therefore, Seath and Berry have a legitimate argument concerning race relations, but these barriers can only be broken down through careful dialogue between the two groups, not the cantankerous musings of comedians on "the other side." 
However, this drama of comedians and race relations has been stretched out further than necessary with little comic relief. Many of the "absolutes" that come about in such an argument are the only laugh­able matters. Not all minority students are closed to people of other backgrounds, and not all that Seath and Berry have to say is caustic and reckless. No need to take Scholastic's word as absolute dogma -try crossing thatboundaryor speaking with the comedians at a Roundtable Discussion. You will find that there is more common ground than once 
thought; perhaps you will even like each other and share a much needed 
for two weeks? .

High Flyers Flyovers set the atmosphere of Notre Dame home football games 
• Kat:herine Finn 
few times a year, thousands of Notre Dame football fans are treated to an impressive display ofmilitary grandiosity. Conver­sations come to an abrupt halt as a screeching noise crescendos nd the stadium walls. For a moment, more than 80,000 faces turn 
toward the sky to watch a team ofmilitary jets shoot by overhead. 
While everyone can appreciate these displays, many fans do not under­stand why Notre Dame is privileged enough to host flyovers each year. Notre Dame's own Air Force Col. Michael Zenk, department chair of aerospace studies, explains that there are several reasons why flyovers are arranged for pre-kickoff entertainment. 
"Many flyovers occur around the country," Zenk says. "The mili­tary does these kinds of events for a number of reasons: to show our appreciation to the American public; to recruit new prospects; and to demonstrate our capabilities. Obviously it is better to do them at the largest possible venues, and Notre Dame's viewing audience has to be one ofthe largest." 
Military representatives contact the Notre Dame Athletic Department before the season begins, offering to organize flyovers for convenient games. Assistant Athletic Director Michael Danch says, "This year they wanted to do a flyover at the Michigan State game, but, since it was our first home game, we had already planned for a human tunnel. Also, both bands were going perform. It seemed like too much to add seven more minutes." 
There was ample time for flyovers later in the season, however, and Zenk worked cooperatively with the athletic department and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to obtain approval. 
Fortunately, these demonstrations can be arranged without much cost to any of the parties involved. "The flyovers do not cost Notre Dame anything," Zenk says. "They cost the military very little since they are fl.own on training sorties that would need to be flown anyway." 
The flyovers seem to have special significance before the Notre Dame­Navy game. "The concept is to have some pilots from the Naval Academy and some pilots who are Notre Dame graduates," Danch says. "This year, it just so happened that we played them very close to Veteran's day." 
Danch believes that the flyovers are a meaningful expression of the sustained relationship between the two schools. "There seem to be a lot ofsimilarities between the qualities ofpeople who go to Notre Dame and people who go to Navy." 
So while the entertainment value is the most readily appreciable virtue associated with a pregame flyover, there are many other forces at work that make them meaningful to the military and to spectators alike. 0

en senior stand-up come­
ian Brian Berry took the 
tage at Legends to perform on October 27, he delivered his routine to a crowd that "exploded with laughter" over a joke he told about language and the overuse oftaboo words, including a refer­ence to the word "n*****.". But after the show, both Berry and fellow comedian, senior Will Seath, who delivered material highlighting self-segregation at Notre Dame with a reference to Rosa Parks, were criticized by some audience mem­bers for their hurtful comments. What Berry and Seath believed were inoffensive jokes have sparked a dialogue about race relations at Notre Dame. There seems to be a consensus that improving race relations on campus is an important is­sue that needs to be addressed, with the goal ofnot only encouraging diversity but also of facilitating interactions between members of different races. 
Berry and Seath say that the only way to accomplish such a lofty goal is by put­ting such topics in a public forum in order to make people comfortable discussing them. Choosing comedy as their medium for doing so, both students performed at the student stand-up show on October 27, presenting material which they thought highlighted some absurd but true situa­tions. Both comedians were consequently suspended from participating on Leg­ends' stage by General Manager Aaron Perri following discussions Perri had with representatives ofNAACP, Student Activities, Student Affairs and Multi­cultural Student Programs and Services regarding the material.. In addition, a roundtable discussion entitled "Race, Comedy & ND" was held to allow the comedians, members ofthe NAACP, the Black Cultural Arts Council (BCAC) and other members of the community to dis­cuss their differing views on the comedy routines, racial issues, and relations at Notre Dame. 
Neither comedian views his material as racist. Seath says his joke was only intended to highlight the absurdity of self-segregation at Notre Dame. The joke was roughly told as, "Rosa Parks just passed away, which I don't mean to make light of. She is an American hero and a civil rights pioneer. Because of her, black Notre Dame students can sit in the front of the dining hall." Given · Parks' recent passing and her significant role in the civil rights' movement, many students on campus were insulted by the . material. Lauren Frease, vice president of the ND Chapter of the NAACP, stated in The Observer's November 3, 2005 issue that the joke "diminishes the significance of Rosa Parks' refusal to give up her seat on a segregated bus [ ... ] Parks' actions were a means of demanding her rights as a human being and an equal citizen, something that should not be made light ofby a tasteless joke." Seath says that his intent was to point out self-segregation at ND, and not only along racial lines, as a first step towards changing it.

notably Senator Rick Santorum (R-Penn.) tion, the fear among Protestants that 
n a New York Times op-ed from March 30 of this year, a former 
United States senator lamented that the Republican Party "has gone so far in adopting a sectarian agenda that it has become the political wing of a religious movement." 
What was striking about the piece was its author. It was not some atheist lib­eral from the Northeast or West Coast. Rather, it was John Danforth, a Repub­
lican from Missouri and an Episcopal minister. 
Danforth reiterated the sentiment when he spoke at the Notre Dame Academic Forum on September 22. "In the last five or six years, there has been an attempt to form a real religious political agenda, particularly by the Christian right," he said. 
The Christian right. The religious right. Whatever name it goes by, the move­ment by some Republicans to turn Christian principles into American laws has been gain­ing steam in American poli­tics, and it is a controversial movement, to be sure. Liber­als in the Democratic Party as well as moderate Republicans like Danforth claim that the religious right is trying to impose upon the country a set of beliefs that do not represent those ofevery American. But members ofthe religious right say they merely are bringing their beliefs into the political 
dialogue, and the fact that the majority of Americans are Christians enables them to legislate those beliefs. 
Ofparticular interest to members ofthe Notre Dame community and to Catholics nationwide is where, exactly, Catholics fit into the religious right. It is, after all, a movement started and still primarily led by Protestants, its key figures ranging from televangelist Pat Robertson right up to President George W. Bush. But a hand­ful of Catholics also could be considered major leaders ofthe religious right, most and Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. And while some of the religious right's positions align with those of the Catholic Church-both are opposed to abortion and gay marriage, for example -they seem-to differ on others, like the death penalty and the circumstances un­der which it is acceptable for the country to war. 
Catholics now split their votes almost evenly between the two parties, says Da­vid Edward Campbell, a political science 

"You ~nd a new coalition forming. And that new coalition is not Catholic versus Protestant; it's people who go to church and people who don't go to church." 
-David Edward Campbell, political science professor 
professor who specializes in religion in American politics. "Historically, that's . a gain for the Republicans, because they used to lose the Catholic vote, big time," he says. In the 1960 election, for example, 78 percent of Catholics voted for the Democratic candidate, John Kennedy. That election was, ofcourse, exceptional, since Kennedy himself was a Catholic. It also was exceptional, Campbell says, because it was the last gasp of the divide between Catholics and Protestants in American politics. After Kennedy's elec­
a Catholic president would take orders directly from the Vatican was laid to rest. A new way of thinking about reli­gion in American politics would have to emerge. 
That new way of thinking did not emerge until the mid-1970s with the elec­tion ofJimmy Carter into the presidency, Campbell says. Carter was the first self­described "born-again Christian" to run for President. "[Carter's election] brought that term to the forefront. A lot ofAmeri­
cans really didn't even know what that meant," Campbell says. Runningin the post-Wa­tergate era, Carter wanted to establish himself as a person ofstrong morals, and he used his faith to do that. "Thatkind ofcrystallized for people who were born-again Christians and Evangelicals that, wow, maybe we can have a place in politics," Campbell says. 
In the late 1970s and into the 1980s, Christian political organizations like the Moral Majority and the Christian Coalition were formed. These organizations supported Rea­gan's Republicans rather than Carter's Democrats, because Reagan's policies, particularly his opposition to abortion, were more in line with theirs. Over time, Campbell says, "the Republican Party sort of incorporated [the Conserva­tive Christian] movement within the party itself, in the same way that labor unions are basically under the um­
brella of the Democratic Party." 
The religious right is now a powerful segment ofthe Republican Party, in large part because George W. Bush is the first true born-again Republican president. "Because he is in the White House," Campbell says, "I think we've seen reli­gion injected in the public discourse in a way we haven't in recent ye~rs." Issues of importance to the religious right -like faith-based initiatives, abortion, public displays of religious symbols, stem cell research, gay marriage and intelligent

design -have been vigorously debated during Bush's presidency. Some of these issues may have had profound effects on Bush's reelection. A New York Times poll conducted immediately following the 2004 election found that "moral values" -generally interpreted as an opposition to abortion and gay marriage, among other similar issues -was the most im­portant issue to the greatest number of voters in 2004. Ofthe 22 percent ofvoters for whom moral values were most impor­tant, 80 percent voted for Bush. It also was widely suggested that a referendum to ban gay marriage added to the ball9t in Ohio motivated conservative Christian

beliefs, voted 38.1 percent in favor of Bush, and "nominal Catholics," Catholics in name only, voted only 28.9 percent in favor of Bush. 
According to Green's research, the correlation between religious orthodoxy and support for Bush carried over to Protestants as well. Traditionalist Evan­gelical Protestants and traditionalist mainline Protestants suppo~ted Bush at rates much higher than their modernist and nominal counterparts. This suggests what Campbell calls a "brand new devel­opment" in American politics. "You find a new coalition forming," he says. "And that new coalition is not Catholic versus

Ohioans to go to the polls when they might otherwise have stayed at home. This may have tipped the hotly contested state, with its 20 crucial electoral votes, in Bush's favor. 
Another interesting aspect ofthe 2004 election was how Catholics voted. Ac­cording to the Times poll, 52 percent of Catholics voted for Bush. The Catholic vote was discussed in a conference that took place at Notre Dame from Decem­ber 1. to 2 entitled "A Matter of Faith: Religion in the 2004 Election." One of the speakers, John Green, a political scientist from Akron University, found that among "traditionalist," or religiously conservative Catholics, 73.9 percent voted for Bush. And the less orthodox Catholics were, the less likelytheywere to vote for Bush. "Modernist Catholics," or Catholics who hold more liberal religious

Protestant; it's people who go to church and people who don't go to church." He adds, "As a generalized proposition, it's true: People who go to church, or are otherwise religiously devout, are more likely to vote Republican, whether they're Catholic or Protestant or Evangelical or whatever.". 
How did conservative Catholics ally themselves with the conservative Protes­tants in the Republican Party? The party seems at odds with many ofthe Church's positions, including its opposition to the war in Iraq and the death penalty. Nor do most Republicans place the same impor­tance as the Church on social justice and environmentalism. "Evangelical Chris­tians and Catholics, in a sense, make odd bedfellows," says the Rev. Robert Dowd, C.S.C., a professor in the department of political science. 
It is said that war makes such bedfel­lows, and the war, in this case, is about abortion. The opposition to abortion is the strongest tie between Catholics and the Republican Party. "It's issue number one for any Catholic ... any good Catho­lic," says.Arina Grossu, president ofNotre Dame/St. Mary's Right to Life. She says· that though she is sure there are pro-life Democrats in the club, "I think a lot of our members are Republican because of the pro-life stance." ·· 
Jonathan Klingler, co-president of Notre Dame College Republicans, esti­mates that one half _to two thirds of his club's members are practicing Catholics 
whose faith plays a "strong factor" in their political affiliation. "I think their most prominent agreement [with the Republican Party] is on abortion," he says 
of these Catholics. 
Dowd taught a course on religion in politics last fall, and he asked students who were planning on voting for Bush if they would change their vote if the Democratic Party reversed or moder-· ated its stan~e on abortion. Under those circumstances, "half of the Catholics in the room indicated that they would have been more likely to vote for John Kerry," he says. 
The Catholic Church considers abor­tion an "intrinsic evil." Pope John Paul II wrote in Evangelium Vitae that it is "never licit to obey it, or to take part in a propaganda campaign in favor of such a law, or to vote for it." But does abortion 
08 DECEMBER 2005 
trump other life issues, like the death penalty or just war? And is voting for a Republican who desires to overturn Roe v. Wade through judicial appointments or a constitutional amendment necessarily the most effective way to curtail abortions? 
Mark Roche, dean ofthe College ofArts and Letters, believes not, and before last fall's election he wrote an op-ed in the New York Times saying that Catholics should not automatically vote Republican because of their stance on abortion. "It's not enough to be opposed to abortion," he says. "It's also important to figure out what strategies would reduce the percentage ofabortions." In the op-ed, Roche notes that the number of legal abortions increased more than 5 percent during the Reagan presidency while they decreased 19 percent during the Clinton presidency. He attributed this partly to the Democratic concern with the social safety net, "which makes it easier for young women to make responsible choices and for young life to flourish." Roche also doubts that overturning Roe v. Wade will have much of an effect on the number of abortions in the country. "It's not very likely that abortion will be illegal," he says. "It's likely that [the decision to outlaw abortion] will go back to the states." And with the ease ofinterstate travel, pregnant women in states that ban abortions would have little trouble going to a state in which they are allowed. 
But Roche is no advocate of abortion. He believes future generations will con­demn the practice like torture and slavery are condemned today. He criticizes the Democratic Party for excluding the pro­life stance from its mainstream, and he is encouraged by Democrats like New York Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who have softened their pro-choice rhetoric. 
Aside from abortion, there are several life issues in which the Democratic posi­tion is much closer to the Catholic posi­tion, Roche says, among them the death penalty, universal health care, environ­mental protection and the war in Iraq. By writing the op-ed, Roche says, "I wanted to suggest that if you were to vote as a genuine Catholic, you would be in a huge quandary." 
Not so, says Grossu. ''As Catholics, we are urged to put the abortion issue before other life issues,'' she says. According to a voter's guide she provided from'an orga­
. iiization called Catholic Answers, abortion is one of five "non-negotiable" issues for Catholic voters. Other non-negotiable 
08 DECEMBER 2005 
issues relevant in the 2004 election were embryonic stem cell research and gay marriage. Since Bush was opposed to all three practices and John Kerry was op­posed only to gay marriage, according to the guide Bush would have been the appropriate choice. 
J. Matthew Wilson, a political scientist from Southern Methodist University who spoke at the Matter of Faith conference, said devout Catholics in 2004 were able to look past issues like the death penalty, just war and social justice because "the Church's positions on these views tends to be much more nuanced." He said the Church's opposition to abortion, on the other hand, is a "categorical moral judg­ment." 
The fact that Catholics are even con­cerned with such issues when they vote represents a huge change from the 1960 election. "It used to be that Catholicism was considered a sociological identity," Wilson said. Catholics in 1960 voted for Kennedy not so much for his policy posi­tions but because he was "one of them." According to Wilson's research, the op­posite happened in 2004, which helps explain how Kerry, also a Catholic, lost the Catholic vote. More frequently churchgo­ing Catholics were more likely to vote for Bush, suggesting that they were swayed more by Bush's positions than they were by Kerry's Catholicism. 
This trend was particularly evident among young people. Wilson said only 26 percent offrequently churchgoing Catho­lics between the ages of 21 and 39 voted for Kerry in 2004. Eight-six percent of the same demographic voted for Kennedy in 1960. Thatyoung, devout Catholics are shifting so overwhelmingly to the right suggests that the denomination will be increasingly politically conservative in the future. "I think religiously. conservative Catholics are likely to continue to shift toward the Republican Party," Wilson said. He added that the minority of de­vout Catholics who remain Democrats are mostly elderly. And while nominal Catholics may continue to lean left, Wil­son predicted that many would stop calling themselves Catholics, since the label now applies more to a set of positions than it does to a sociological identity. 
Campbell, too, sees Catholics continu­ilig to shift to the right, and he looks to the Notre Dame student body as evidence. "I think the fact that the Notre Dame student body leans Republican and is overwhelm­ingly Catholic says something about American politics," he says. "Not every Catholic who comes to Notre Dame is devout, but many are, and the student body leans to the right." 



What remains to be seen is how big ofa role Catholics will play in the Republican Party leadership and in the leadership of the religious right. Currently, Campbell says, few Catholics in major elected po­sitions could be considered part of the religious right. However, Santorum is one who could be. While Santorum is an advocate for welfare reform and govern­ment accountability, he probably is best known for his outspoken stance against homosexuality. He does not believe there is a constitutional right to privacy and has said that "deviant sexual acts" performed in private "undermine the basic tenets of our society and the family." He also

. a majority of the court will be Catholic, 
and all five Catholic justices -Alito, 
John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Scalia, 
and Anthony Kennedy-would be con­
servative to varying degrees. 
That Protestant presidents could ap­
point a Catholic-dominated Supreme 
Court might suggest that the dissolution 
of the tension between Catholics and 
Protestants in this country is complete. 
"Among voters themselves, I think the 
days of tension between Catholics and 
Protestants are over," Campbell says. 
But a conservative president may have a 
reason for appointing a Catholic Supreme 
Court justice more pragmatic than an 
appreciation of his or her faith. Because 
of the stigma now attached to anti-Ca­
tholicism, a conservative Catholic may 
be easier to confirm than a conservative 
Protestant. 
"People who oppose Alito and who 
opposed Roberts will oppose these nomi­
nees because of their positions on abor­
tion and such," Campbell says. "They 
won't mention their religion, but they'll 
say we oppose them because they're obvi­
ously going to go toward the right. Their I'm predicting this right now, they'll say, 'Well you're just anti-Catholic."' 
So whether or not a prevalence of con­servative Catholics on the Supreme Court represents an effort by the Republican leadership to incorporate Catholics into its religious coalition is unclear; in fact, some people believe religion has little to do with the increasing number ofCatho­lics in the Republican Party. 
Jamie Kralove is co-president ofNotre Dame College Democrats and has been .involved in research about why Catholics have shifted toward the Republican Party in the recent past. "It has more to do with socioeconomic status than it does with any other fa~tor," he says. "The mem­bership of the Catholic Church in the United States is, frankly, becoming more and more affluent.". He adds, "Catholics, who were once strongly Democratic, were also strongly immigrant, strongly urban. Catholics are becoming strongly subur­ban, strongly removed from the social issues that prompted them to become Democrats before." 
Roche notes these changes, as well. "Certainly when the Catholics came to

immigrant culture. And they were vot­ing overwhelmingly for the Democratic Party," he says. But as Catholics assimi­lated, they became wealthier. And, says Roche, "There is [ ... ] a sense that as one becomes wealthier, one might not quite so automatically side with the party that has traditionally been the worker's party or the party ofimmigrants." 
But Roche says the assimilation of Catholics had an effect on their religious beliefs. "[Catholics] have become increas­ingly more Americanized to the point where, in some cases, they don't even see their huge conflicts between aspects of American life and aspects of Catholic life," he says. Such Americanization gives them a "mental license," he says, to "pick and choose" which beliefs they want to adhere to, even if those beliefs aren't consistent with those ofthe Church. 
But it is a reality in American politics that neither the Republican Partynor the Democratic Party aligns perfectly with Catholic positions. American Catholics are forced to prioritize on matters of faith and politics, at least at the ballot box. Some may have to overlook support ofabortion to tty to ensure social justice.

Others may have to accept the continu­ance of the death penalty to ensure that marriage remains only the union between a man and a woman. 
· "It's unfortunate that in our politi­cal climate, which is so evenly divided, people feel compelled to come down on one side or the other," says Colin Taylor, the other co-president ofCollege Demo­crats. "That forces them to make strange bedfellows with political factions that they otherwise wouldn't associate with. And I think that Catholics, at least some Catholics, fall into that trend.'; 
So not all Catholics, not even all seri­ous Catholics, can be lumped into the religious right. "It's a very diverse and heterogeneous group," Campbell says . ."A truly devout Catholic has a very haf,i\ time deciding how to vote."

• D~ri~ Snyder.
On a typical August evening 
Americans around the country 
are gathering around their televisions. Among the millions tun­ing in are some of the nation's greatest minds, including both scientists and theologians, each watching with skeptical eyes. Itisn't a new primetime crime scene investigation show they're watching, but an address from the president on the future of embryonic stem cell research in America. 
In August 2001, President George W. Bush declared restrictions on federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research. The controversial research, made possible by scientific progress in the late 1990s, revolves around the extraction 
· and manipulation ofembryonic stem cells -highly potent cells capable of differ­entiating into many types of specialized cells. Alreagy;·adult stem cell research, advanced by several decades ofwork, has res1,1ltecl in many useful medical applica­tions, such as bone marrow transplants for treatment of certain cancers. More recently, scientists have U:sed adult stem cells in successful repairs ofdamaged tis­sues in laboratory animals and humans. 
Some voices in the scientific com­
munity, such as the National Institutes 
of Health, believe embryonic stem cell 
research holds an ultimately greater 
potential for advancement than research 
into adult stem cells. Thisyear, research­
ers atthe University ofWisconsin-Madi­
son converted embryonic stem cells into 
functioning neurons, the building blocks 


of the brain and nervous system. In the future, scientists hope embryonic stem cell research will lead to excit­ingnew treatments combating cancer, repairing damaged and ailing organs and even restoring lost senses and paralyzed limbs. 
Despite the potential offerings of the research, controversy impedes embryonic

Vl 

Many, assigning human rights and a soul 
......... 16 
at conception, find the destruction ofan embryo equivalent to the death ofhuman being. This belief aligns with the current doctrine ofthe Roman Catholic Church. The Vatican document, Donmn Vitae (The Gift of Life), says, "The human being is to be respected and treated as a person from the moment ofconception." As such, the Church opposes embryonic stem cell research as well as the in-vitro fertilization methods that leave behind embryos the research attempts to utilize. These theological views of the Church are shared by several other religious sects, totaling many millions of followers in the United States. With these ethical concerns in mind, President Bush placed restrictions on federal funding ofembry­onic stem cell research. Federal funding was reserved only for research on more than 60 embryonic stem cell lines estab­lished prior to the restriction. The goal of the mandate was a compromise: providing no funding for research leading to the destruction of embryos, discouraging the act but granting money to research where the embryo was already destroyed. The restrictions did not affect funding for adult stem cell research or prohibit privately funded embryonic research. 
The debate over embryonic stem cell research has continued since the federal restrictions on funding were enacted. Scientists have requested more funding for new stem cell lines, arguing the cell lines permitted under the restrictions have degraded, becoming unusable. Re­cently, several influential congressmen, including Senate majority leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), a doctor, and Senator Arlen Specter (R-Penn.), a cancer patient, have pushed for an ease in the restraints. Ear­lier in the year, a bill expanding funding to new stem cell lines might have been passed, but the vote lacked the superma­jority needed to override the veto threat­ened by President Bush. An additional bill, expanding federal funding for adult stem cell research, passed easily. 
The impact of this national debate af­fects Notre Dame as it is both a Catholic university and a federally funded research institution. According to Professor Charles Kulpa, chairman of the depart­ment of biological sciences, no human stem cell research is being conducted at Notre Dame. The lack of research is not necessarily for ethical reasons but because the department's research focuses on other areas, such as infectious diseases, genetics and ecology. Federal funds help drive some ofthe department's research, so regulations are complied with. 
Beyond the biology department, the ethics ofembryonic stem cell research are a topic for discourse. Though the Catholic Church is strictly opposed to the destruc­tion ofembryos, scholars at Notre Dame are not bound to this doctrine. Notre Dame maintains academic freedom, al­lowing for free debate without Church interference. Indeed, some faculty, even within the theology depa!tment, support embryonic stem cell research. Theology professor Jean Porter argued against the current Catholic doctrine ofa human soul 
, present from conception in the February 8, 2002 edition of Commonweal. Porter finds the support offered for assigning a soul at conception "weak arguments, at least insofar as they are offered as a basis for public policy." She clarifies the current viewwas not always Church policy, point­ing to Aquinas's view that the unborn are not assigned souls until later in their de­velopment. Porter hopes the Church can establish a doctrine based solidly in both scientific fact and religioustruth. @

he odor of stale beer lingers in 
'[
the air. The walls are "deco­
rated" with a poster of a naked supermodel in one corner and a portrait of Kramer from Seinfeld in another. And who even knows what fungal growths have infested the futon. Most male dorms follow this code -or something close to 
•;! it -for furnishing their rooms. But 445 Knott Hall is somewhat ofan oasis amidst the predictability that plagues many of the male abodes on campus. 
The roommates, juniors Jeff Gonzales and Nick McGregor, have transformed 
. their cold, cinderblock confine into a re­laxing, atypical dorm room. "We wanted to get rid of the prison feel of normal guys' rooms," McGregor says. The room­
. mates have . indeed achieved this goal, finding a balance between a nice room and the stereotypical "guy's room." 
The boys pride themselves on the comfortable, spacious feel that the room emits, particularly due to its high ceiling, great view of the Dome and well-placed decorations. The walls of 445 are com­pletely covered with posters that express the roommates' personal interests. "Like lots of people at Notre Dame, we like sports, music and having fun,'' Gonzales says, "and the room is put· together well to express these interests."

Gonzales also likes to collect souvenirs 
from his travels and has included them in 
the room's motif. Such items as a Scot­
tish flag, a scarf from Denmark, various 
mementos from his travels around the 
United States and an Irish flag bedeck 
the room. As a member of Navy ROTC, 
Gonzales also traveled to the Pacific for 
three weeks last summer and brought 
back souvenirs from Australia and the 
Marianas Islands and has posted pictures 
from this trip all around the room. 
Both roommates agree that the hospi­
table feel ofthe ro.om affects how they like 
to entertain their visitors. "We always try 
to buy higher quality beers -like Sam 
Adams or Newcastle-to make the room 
feel a little classier," McGregor says. Gon­
zales also adds that "the room has a really 
chill feel to it, and people like knowing 
they can come to a room where they can 
relax and have a good time." 
Room 445 proves that regular college 
boys can have well-decorated rooms. Airy, 
uncluttered room:s where one can actu­
ally see the color of the carpet seems to 
be a rarity at Notre Dame, and Gonzales 
and McGregor's room is a much-needed 
breath offresh air. For people who need an 
escape from the smothering atmosphere 
of dorm life, room 445 will easily help 
them to regain their sanity and restore 
their faith in on-campus housing. ©

oking back on the fall semester, 
an recall my favorite moments 
Irish football, including junior 
w iver Jeff Samardzija's touch­down streak, junior quarterback Brady Quinn's phenomenal passing record and Notre Dame's glorious selection into the Fiesta Bowl, to name a few. However, when you spend every Saturday for three consecutive months glued to the televi­sion set watching football, it's difficult to forget some ofthe other exciting football programs and their influential games of the 2005 season. On that note, I would like to present to you my list of instant gridiron classics from the previous year, ranging from the season-changing to the heartbreaking. And so, without further ado ... 
1. Vniversity of1>,1imni v. iJirginia 'Iech 
Lane Stadium, home to both the Vir­ginia Tech Hokies and one of the loudest college football fan bases in the country, was brought to silence on November 5 when the Miami Hurricanes handed the Hokies a dominating defeat on Virginia Tech's home turf. At no point in the game did Virginia Tech show any signs of life, and it wasn't until the fourth quarter that the Hokies even were able to put points on the board. By then it was too little, too late. The Hokies' Rose Bowl dreams, not to mention their 16-game winning streak, went by the wayside at the hands of the relentless Hurricanes. 
2. Michigan v. <Penn State 
On the final play of this game, Mich­igan's sophomore quarterback Chad Henne threw a 10-yard pass into the waiting arms of freshman wide receiver Mario Manningham, giving the Wolver­ines a 27-25 upset over the Nittany Lions. Although it was their only loss in an oth­erwise phenomenal season, the Nittany Lions' fall to Michigan was enough to put to rest any arguments that they deserved a shot at the national championship. 
3. 'Texas' entire season 
Unlike USC, Texas hasn't had to rely on fourth-quarter comebacks and lucky bounces to come out victorious. Aver­aging both 50.9 points per game and a 36.3-pointmargin of victory, Texas never slowed up on an opponent, no matter how large their lead already was. It will be interesting to see them tackle the Tro­jans in Pasadena, Calif., for the national championship next month. 
4. 'Tennessee v. J:..,SV 
Down 21-0 on the road at the end of the first half, the Vols somehow pulled off an astonishing comeback to send this nail-biter into overtime. After LSU kicked a field goal on the first possession of overtime, Tennessee.responded with a one-yard run into the end zone to win the game and shock the LSU faithful. Even though the Volunteers ended the season with a losing record, this match stands out as one of the most exciting games of the year. 
5. JVotre ©arne v. VSC 
With more hype than almost any other game in 2005, this match-up seemed des­tined to go down in· the history books. After battling for all four quarters, Notre Dame looked like it was going to win, and the Irish were ahead on the scoreboard as the final seconds of play ticked off the clock. But then, after referees reviewed the "final" play of the game, seven sec­onds were put back on the clock, and USC sneaked into the end zone for the Trojans' victory. While you can disagree with the amount of time placed back on the clock .or the spot of the ball, no one can deny how amazing the game was. This game is one that makes people's eyes grow wide when someone says to them, "I was there." 0

Notre Dame versus Ohio State is the national championship game that could have been, with Notre Dame and Ohio State nearly upset­ting Rose Bowl-bound USC and Texas, respectively. Giving Charlie Weis a full month to prepare the Irish must send chills up Ohio State Head Coach Jim Tressel's spine. Despite Notre Dame's well-coached offense, de­fense -a Buckeye strength-is going to 
· win this one. I expect a hard-fought game, with Ohio State winning, 35-31. 

rease, Kaki pivots to face the 
oalie and catches the ball in her lacrosse stick with ease from a passer 10 yards away. She shoots and scores in the following seconds, and then rushes back behind the crease to try it again, and again, and again. She succeeds on almost every attempt, but each time she encourages her teammate and goalie Erin Goodman to keep doing her best. "Yeah Irish!" she cheers as she rushes out to collect the balls between drills. 
With all the energy that Kakiexh}bits on the lacrosse field, some might assume that she. is play1ng in the middle ·of the afternoon; however, the clock reads 
8:10 a.m., and Kaki has been awake for hours. 
It is approximately 6:30 a.m. when Katherine "Kaki" Orr rolls out of bed, throws on a warm hooded sweatshirt and sweatpants,. and starts off to the Joyce Center Q.A.C.C.). More than anything on cold days like this one, she wishes that she had a bike; or afleast some company· for the long walk. On this particular Tuesday morning, however, Kaki is thankful for the extra hour of sleep she got the night before; it's not ·every day that Kaki is able to wake up at this time. On Mondays and Wednesdays, she awakes to the sound of her alarm at the un­godly hour of 5:45 a.m. so that she can report to the Guglielmina Ath­letics Complex (Gug) by 6:45 a.m. to run laps, workout and do agility drills. 
Kaki meets four team­mates in the women's lacrosse locker room at theJ.A.C.C. and the group heads to the Gug to begin training. They grab their one another to pass balls back and forth in stick-work exercises as assistant coach Alissa Moser leads all four girls in what is called an "individual" workout. 
In "individuals," specific game situ­ations are recreated, and the girls' re­actions to them are polished through hard work and repetition. Because this is November and the lacrosse preseason does not officially begin until the spring semester, NCAA regulations dictate a ratio offour athletes to one coach allowed on the playing field at a time. So the ques­tion is, what do the other 24 girls on the team cio dudng'this tim,~? ' · :· ... , .. 
In a small room away from. the field, five of Kaki's teammates have. been as­sembled in ·frori.t of laptop--computers. Wear-ing headphones · 
they are 12reparing themselves for t'ii.eir first day of "clapping," an exetlcise designed to improve reaction time on the playing field. Originally created as a tooho help develop the mental focus ofchildren with attention deficit disorder (ADD), "The Groove" was adapted by Interactive Met­ronome as a training tool for collegiate and professional athletes. The goal ofthe exercise is to anticipate when a visual or auditory cue will occur and to clap at the same time as the cue. 
By rotating the groups ofgirls between "individu.~ls.". and "clapping," there is never a time to· r!!st· for the entire .t.'11'P . hours of training that morning, but:this.:,;•\:,:,a:·. is not unusual for the lacrosse team. With an intense schedule that requires five hours a week in the weight room, as well as additional workouts, agilities and con­ditioning, Kaki and her teammates hardly notice that this is the off-season. · :. Thursdays ar,e.ver-ysimilar to Tuesdays,

in the state-of-the-art weight room in the Gug where strength-training coach Lisa Shall hands Kaki a stack of sheets with an individualized work­out for each team member, which she promptly distributes. The girls then divide in half and perform quick-feet a.nd jumping exercises , in order to ·warm up for weight · lifting; as well as to build speed. The girls form four• lines ofthree girls each and begin synchronized jumping drills on floor mats. This continues for approximately 15 minutes, with rotations at timed intervals. Afterwards, they divide .into twos with their. previously,: determined· lifting partners .arid ·. begin a 60-minute lifting routine. · "I hate when you do this!"

resistance exercise. 
"Don't waste your breath on talking back to me!Just go!" Kaki encourages her teammate. She is partnered with Burke, a freshman midfielder who has a lot ,9f the same athletic traits as Kaki. Because she is a junior and considered one of the leaders of the team, Shall partnered Kaki with Burke so that they could challenge each other. 
"I always try to pair a freshman with an upperclassman for guidance. The fresh­men are very competitive, and some ofthe upperclassmen feed off the competition," Shall says. With strong leaders like Kaki helping to strengthen the already talented newcomers, women's lacrosse is looking to be very competitive this spring. "This · team is the best that I've seen in my three years here [ ... ] They're more competitive, ·and have. bettfr leaders' than· pre-vious years." 
Not only is her leadership an asset to the team, but Kaki's hard work and energy at practice and in the weight room help her to improve her own skills as well as to stand as an example for her teammates. "Kaki's already a pretty tough kid, and she really boughtinto the [training] program. She goes hard at practice, and she lifts like she plays, very aggressive," Shall says. 
Not bad for a girl who is relatively new to lacrosse. "I had never heard oflacrosse before I moved back to America, but I had played ice hockey [in Switzerland] and I loved it," Kaki says. Born in Houston, Texas, Kaki spent seven years of her life in a "very international" neighborhood off of Lake Geneva in Switzerland. At age 14, she moved back to America and became a three-sport athlete in Con­necticut. She excelled in lacrosse after being serendipitously introduced to the sport. "I needed a spring sport, and I was looking for something to play. I didn't like softball, and lacrosse was the big sport in my town. [The team] needed a goalie, so they asked me to play," Kaki says. 
After her freshman year, Kaki moved to, boarding school at Choate Rosemary Hall in Wallingford, Conn.; where she continued to play goalie but decided it wasn't for her. "I didn't like not being able 
. to run around. Eventually, I convinced my coach to move me to the field," Kaki says, and she excelled as a midfielder. Leading her team in goals, Kaki was elected MVP and All-American both her junior and . senior years. Because of her natural talent in the sport, Kaki decided to play lacrosse at the college level. "There are a lot of life lessons learned just from being a part of a team and working hard to achieve specific goals," Kaki says. "Being a part ofa Division-I team is an experience that 
can't really be described." 
And while being a leader on the team 
has helped her build her work ethic as she 
strives to win a Big East Conference title 
on her way to the national championship, 
Kaki's biggest reason for staying on the 
team is the friendships that she has with 
her teammates. 
"My teammates are my best friends," 
Kaki says. "There isn't one girl on this 
team who I would hesitate to hang out 
with or to call ifl needed anything." And 
her teammates feel the same about her. 
"Kaki let me and another freshman use 
her car when she went home for a week­end at the beginning of the semester. As an upperclassman, she was very warm," freshman goalie Erin Goodman says. And Kaki's passion for others extends beyond her teammates. As an English and . peace 'st'iidies doi.ible"majbr, her·passioxi:;. is illustrated in her academic pursuits, specifically in her plan to do research in war-torn Uganda. "I've learned as much as there is to learn about the war there [ ... ] but I'd really like to see it for myself," 
Kakisays. 
Possibly this summer she may be able 
to fulfill her dream. But for now, she 
will continue to wake up early, enjoy her 
teammates, and work towards a national 
championship. 





o Michael Kim 

tre Dame junior quarterback rady Quinnreceived over 20 cholarship offers from vari­ous schools around the country during his senior year at Dublin Coffman High School (Dublin, Ohio), including -but not limited to -Tennessee, Michigan, Georgia Tech and Ohio State. However, when Quinn visited Notre Dame one fall morning in 2002, he realized it was the place for him. "I walked around campus and went through the stadium and differ­entparts ofNotre Dame," Quinn says. "I really got a feeling thatthis is where I saw myself the next four or five years." 
It is hard to imagine that Quinn was not a first-choice Notre Dame recruit in 2002. His high school teammate and current junior defensive back Chinedum Ndukwe was the one being recruited by then-Head Coach Tyrone Willingham. However, Ndukwe's father, Stephen, urged Willingham to take a look at his son's teammate. Impressed with what he saw onvideo, Willingham invited Quinn to a Notre Dame football camp, but Quinn declined his proposal.By the time Willingham approached him, Quinn already had attended five other camps around the country and consequently thought it unwise to attend the Notre Dame camp for fear of fatigue affecting his per­formance. However, although he did not attend the camp, Willing­ham continued to acknowledge Quinn's potential and eventually extended a scholarship offer. 
What if Notre Dame never offered a scholarship? "IfI hadn't come to Notre Dame, Ohio State would have most likely been my second choice," Quinn says. "Ohio State still recruited me all the way up through their [2002] national championship." Indeed, many Buckeye fans just assumed that the local top-notch quar­

What are the political leanings of Notre Dame's campus? 

Is Notre Dame too conservative? Is the Pope Catholic? Yes, indeed, ye faithful liberals are in for a long road here under the Golden Dom(!. Notre Dame's conservatism runs through her veins, from the dorms to the college breakdowns to the administration. Looking back as a senior, there are a couple ofways in which Notre Dame's rightist tenden­cies have been ofspecial concern to me. First, hearing the average Notre Dame student speak freely in her or his dorm lets you know in what kind of place we live. Being in the dorms, one is bombarded by hair­raising pejoratives that make liberals scream for their defamation of the likes ofwomen, the handicapped, minorities and homosexuals. Political correctness is not a dorm value for many of Our Lady's sons and daughters. Further, calling people out on basic disrespect earns you the title of a crazy liberal. Next, the political climate: Conservatism is the status quo, so ifno liberal groups speak out and step up, one side of the issue dominates. During the 2004 presidential election, Notre Dame students made their choice clear, peppering the dorms with Bush signs. Voting for Kerry here was more than a political preference; it was a sense ofidentity one had to defend continually. Unfortunately, liberals, like the groundhog, only show their faces every once and a while, making a big to-do of it, then returning to warmer caves soon after. Next, our business school is b1tge; enough said. Basically, more than being conservative, Notre Dame is the great homogenizer, telling its students to 1-be this way, think that way, all the while emphasizing

:c 
V, u in the South Bend winters. @ 
tre Dame is too liberal -but only by a hair. 
Mark Roche, dean of the College of Arts . nd Letters, argues _that Catholics "may want to reaffirm their tradition of allegiance to the Democratic Party in 2004" (New York Times 2004), and many Notre Dame professors agree. Indeed, during the 2004 presidential campaign, Notre Dame professors donated three times as much money to Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.) as they did to President George W. Bush ($15,350 to Kerry, $3,600 to Bush). Almost all of Bush's support came from law school professors, while nearly half ofKerry's donations came from 
professors in the College ofArts and Letters. 
The liberalism ofNotre Dame's professors has trick­led down into the student body as well. As shown by Scbolastic's 2004 mock election, the longer a student spent in Notre Dame's classrooms, the more likely he \vas to vote for Kerry 
(approximately 60 percent of polled freshmen voted for Bush, compared with 37 percent of senior students). Admittedly, though, Notre Dame· 
is no bastion of liberalism in relation to other top universities. Of the 115 Princeton faculty members who contributed to a political , party in 2004, just one donated to Bush; the Bush­Cheney campaign received nothing from Dartmouth; 
and at Duke University, where the numbers are less stag­gering but still heavily one-sided, 90 percent ofall donations went to the Kerry-Edwards campaign. 
If Notre Dame continues its relentless pursuit of the prestige granted by U.S. News and World Report rankings, one should worry whether or not it will become as liberal as these other top-20 universities. However, liberalism, by its nature, undermines tradition. 
All the other once religiously ·affiliated top schools have sacrificed their honorable traditions. But Notre Dame has a higher calling. 
"Notre Daine is the only first.:.rate research institute in the world that has its heart in the writirtgs ofJohn Paul II and the classical _tradition," said David Solomon, director of Notre Dame's Center for Ethics and Culture, at a common grou'nd formn last year. "This needs to be 
Notre Damfs contribution to the dialogue." 0 ·
