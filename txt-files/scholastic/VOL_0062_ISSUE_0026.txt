854	The Notre Dame Scholastic
It was very unjust of Clinton Faille, the journalistic gentleman who labored over the last Week, to refer to me as an unsung hero. Heroics and laudations are unbecoming to an humble columnist. Instead of occupying a pedestal in the Scholastic Hall of Fame it is conceded that the columnist must peer out from behind the legs of dignitaries on those same pedestals to spy and pry into the truth-underlying the actions of mankind, and of woman, perhaps not so kind. Truth is our ideal. And truth is funny; unpleasantly funny to the mighty, and mighty funny to the pleasant. Be that as it may, I thank Clinton for well doing this page in the last issue; however, I decline the proffered position on the pedestal. Heroes are too busy being sung at, or making pompous talks about character to the Boy Scouts. You and I would probably throw pennies at the serenaders, and the Campfire Girls would cry their frank little eyes out when we humorously remarked that the Campfire Girls of today are the college girls of tomorrow. All this, of course, would be in bad taste both for the little girls and for you and me. As for a moral to this tale: trim your own nails and keep away from the pedestals.
A pig and a prig have a great deal in common. Among other things they are both egocentric. A pig is happy with a large dinner and a scratching post. A prig is happy with a large following and no scratching post. Therein the grunting pig excels the noisy prig, for the swine gets a sort of pleasure out of irritation, whereas the conceited man wants nothing to brush him the wrong way. Prodigals are prodigal only until they tire of the husks that rightfully belong to the pigs. It was reassuring to find no prodigality, no piggishness, and but little priggishness in the recent class election. The Junior class was fortunate, and their election set an example which all honest students hope to see followed in the elections of the underclassmen. Providing a prig should raise a clamor, there are several ways of reminding him that this is not a sty. One way is to look disinterested and emit a nasel, “Yeah?” Another way is to vote for someone else.
Perhaps you think that you do not like poetry. You are justified in not liking some poems, but you are a queer sort if you do not like all true poetry. At sometime or other you have listened to howls emitted by negro zealots as they went through their rituals under a midsummer tent. And you will agree with me that theirs was a healthy shout, a ritual yell, and, indeed, a primitive form of poetry. That howl, like all poetry, was evoked by inspiration. A spirit, perhaps syn-’ thetic, had motivated the “nigger.” English savants were moved by port, and who can say but that the Afro-American is similarly transported. At all odds, that howl was poetry. And you liked it, a little of it, at least. Again, consider those forms of elemental verse in which you indulged at one time, for da da, or ma ma, as you prefer, are infantile attempts at versification. Rime, rhythm, and sublime motive, all are found in the repetition of these simple syllables. Advanced critics speak of such a poem as a delicately cut
cameo, although that particular form does not appeal to the ' . ladies of today. The cameo is too coldly chiseled, too realistic, ' too,—well, restraining, to fit harmoniously a modern feminine ear. The girls you and I date would rather listen to the	:	’
musical ow, owwwwww of a Blenheim Spaniel than to the disturbing simplicity in the lyrics of a mewling infant. It	.
is, gentlemen, another unintelligible aspect of the higher’ / ' imagism. As one of those self-appointed critics who smokes ■ his own cigarettes, laughs at the Boob of the Month Clubbers, t ■ and believes in Chesterton and healthy literature, you were, ■ I hope, thorough in your reading of the Poetry Number of the Scholastic. Even to the reading of the editorial. And / perhaps you, along with myself, were disappointed to find that the editorial considered Notre Dame poetry disappoint- -ing. Further we learned that the efforts of campus poets , only too often “’met with that reception which is worse than ’ censure or laughter—silence.” Silence is sometimes golden, with the golden refinement of kindness. In the case of the 'J . Scribblers’ poetry, however, there was no need for considerate . silence or for disappointment. But in order to give that satisfaction which comes of satiety, the campus writers of w-'i prominence have been kind enough to present on another page of this issue their opinions of the poetry contest. Read their t opinions and reread the poetry, for I warrant both as worthwhile.	’
Three years ago, when Vince McIntire was still trying to £ buy stamps at Brother Leander’s candy store, John Dubuisson -e was just another freshman. The other freshmen used to argue with John as to the relative merits of Grant and Lee, for John was from the South and believed that Lee was the greatest general to ever swear at an aide. Discussions of I ;; this sort discouraged the natural love of leisure found in all students, until now we find that “Dubie” has been elected .f president of a new club organized for the purpose of discussing nothing in particular. It is called the “Spectators” and is really a heretical sect of that famed group assembling in Brownson “Rec” known as the “Expectoraters.”	j
For thirteen minutes I have been watching a bug clamber • C over the stem of my desk lamp. Now thirteen minutes is a long time for me to concentrate on anything, especially anything so ambitious as this bug. It might be a bed bug, or a lady bug, though I am inclined to think it a species of hum-	V*
bug known as the social bug. The life purpose of a social bug is to find some student whose adolescence has hung over	'4
to college days, and then to bite the unfortunate. The bite	j
injects into the hitherto healthy blood stream a contagion of	$
social aspirations. Emminent psycho-analists refer *to the state as a tea dance complex. The victims are mollified for life. Corsages, afternoons of bridge, bonbons, vegetarian & complexions, politeness of the sort that pains, and a willingness to do whatever she asks, are all associated with the < pitiable youths who are bitten by the social bug. Tomorrow | this particular bug must go back to the Gold Coast. The . remaining season is short, but the bug knows his bait. A	£
few fleas are said to enhance the life of a dog. A social bug	1
will end the life of a man as a man.	—A. H. E

K FATHER WENNIGER TO RESUME UNIVERSITY DUTIES MAY 20
,	The Reverend Francis Wenniger, C.S.C., who has been do-
ing research study; at the University of Vienna, since the fall of 1927, will return to the University on May 20 to resume his office as head of the College of Science. Father Wenniger left Vienna in the middle of April, stopped in Belgium k- to see friends, and at present is in London, where he is inspecting the British Museum. He will leave England on
s May 9 aboard the S. S. George Washington.
At the University of Vienna, Father Wenniger did research work on the cestodes, along with other studies, under such men as Father Schmidt, world renowned anthropologist, Professor Werner and Professor Pitner. On November* 12 of last year he received his doctor’s degree in philosophy with a Magna Cum Laude.
»
The Notre Dame Academy of Science, which was founded by Father Wenniger, plans to give its moderator a reception shortly after his return. Father Wenniger will most likely speak of his experiences at the meeting. Other plans have been made by the same organization to greet him at the railroad station if the hour of his arrival permits.
JAMES C. ROY CROWNED NATIONAL INTERCOLLEGIATE ORATORICAL CHAMPION
James C. Roy, of Fort Wayne, Indiana, a senior in the College of Arts and Letters at the University, has been awarded the greatest honor that can come to a student in the field of national col
JAMES C. ROY
legiate oratory. He was crowned national champion at the finals of the national collegiate competition held at Northwestern University the evening of Friday, April 26.
The contest, which is an annual one, is sponsored by the Interstate Oratorical Association. The membership of this association is composed of representatives of over 125 colleges and universities in the country.
The speech that won him the unanimous verdict of the seven judges of the con
test was entitled “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.” It was delivered brilliantly, and with a flawless technique which has characterized Mr. Roy’s ability as Notre Dame’s outstanding debater and public speaker. His attack on the opponents of preparedness and adequate naval defense was reasonable and extremely well-timed.
The judges for the contest were E. C. Mabie, University of Iowa; Messrs. R. R. Aurner and H. L. Ewbank, University of Wisconsin; Messrs. James L. Lardner and C. D. Hardy, Northwestern University; W. H. Yeager, University of Illinois, and Davis Edwards, University of Chicago. Herman H. Brockhaus of North Central College and president of the association, was the presiding officer at the contest.
James Roy’s victory in the national contest climaxes four* years of the finest oratorical work that the Notre Dame campus has ever known. He has been a member of the Varsity debating teams since his freshman year at the University. In his first year, he took second place in the competition for the Breen Medal Award contest, the most prized award in the field of declamation and oratory on the campus. By winning this same contest in his sophomore, junior and senior years, he established a record which is the first of its kind in Notre Dame history.
Six weeks ago, Mr. Roy started his climb to the national championship when he won the Indiana State competition at Earlham College, Richmond, Indiana. His feat was especially noteworthy because it marked three years of ceaseless effort on his part to win the honor for his university. Representing Indiana at the sectional contest held on April 6 at Monmouth College, he won the right to participate in the finals. The termination of his forensic activities came when he was voted the national champion.

COLLEGE OF SCIENCE NOTES
George Albertson, C.S.C., Dean
The Academy of Science will hold its regular meeting, Monday, May 6, at 8 p. m., in Science Hall.
The Reverend Francis Wenninger, C.S.C., who has been studying at the University of Vienna for- the past two years, will return to the University about May 1-5 to resume his duties as Dean of the Science College.
Dr. Ruth of the E. R. Squibble Company, pharmaceutical chemists, lectured to the students of the Science school Thursday, April 25. Dr. Ruth chose as his subjects, “The Sunshine of the Sea” and “Science as an Aid and Cure in Disease.” The lecture was illustrated with movies which showed the manufacture of cod liver oil, the sunshine of the sea, and the manner in which science has been used by the medical profession to combat disease. Dr. Ruth was well received by the students and his talk was one of the most interesting of the lecture season.
Professor Henry B. Froning, head of the chemistry department at Notre Dame, is at present doing research work at Ohio State University.
Twenty-three students will graduate from the science department in June. ' Many in this group have already been accepted by some of the best medical schools in the country.

TWO NEW MOTION PICTURE MACHINES INSTALLED IN WASHINGTON HALL
Two new Motiograph motion picture machines have been installed in Washington Hall during the past week, according to the Reverend George L. Holdreth, C.S.C., who has charge of the arrangements and showing of the pictures each week. These machines are of the latest type and are a considerable improvement over the former machines. The machines do not provide for talking pictures, however. They will be used for the first time tomorrow night when the movie, “Beggars of Life” will be shown.

ROTOGRAVURE SECTION, AND McELROY’S DRAWINGS TO FEATURE 1929 “DOME”
When’s the Dome coming out?
About the fifteenth of May.
What’s it like?
This qestion is about as easily answered as the cosmology stumper: where is the universe located? Everyone can decide for himself what it is like when he sees it.
The campus views in this year’s Dome are a variation from the usual scenic section in that their makeup is wholly in color. An old firm in Paris, France, that has long specialized in this type of work rotogravured the pictures through a four color process method unknown in this country. The opening pages as well as the division pages were drawn by an Indianapolis artist. Paul McElroy, the inimitable, is responsible for the eighteen sub-division pages in the book. They are wood block designs which consumed much time in preparation, and which of themselves form a valuable set of - drawings.
Of the remainder of the book—the dedication, the cover, the general makeup—little is known. The book promises, however, to be a most presentable volume and favorably comparable to the high Dome standards of previous years.
K. C. TO HOLD ANNUAL PICNIC AT CHRISTIANA LAKE, MAY 9	-
Christiana Lake, in Michigan, was unanimously chosen to be the scene of this year’s K. of C. picnic and outing by a committee headed by Lecturer John Dorgan. The decision was reached at a meeting held last Monday evening in the Council chambers, Walsh hall. The committee also decided to hold the outing next Thursday, May 9th.
The day scheduled for the event is Ascension Thursday, and as there are no classes upon that day it is felt that all the Knights on the Campus will be able to attend without suffering scholastically. Transportation facilities for the men who wish to attend will be arranged for by the com- ■. mittee on transportation, headed by its chairman, Bourke . . Motsett. The carriers will leave from in front of the Post Office at two different intervals during the morning of the . day of the affair. The first group will leave shortly after breakfast, and the second between ten and ten-thirty.
The chairmen of the various committees appointed by. . General Chairman Dorgan are as follows: James Kearney, tickets; Vincent Ponic, program; George Heinemann, prizes; Bourke Motsett, transportation; Robert Streb, arrangements; John Kelleher, spoils; and George Pope, entertainment. Tickets for the outing may be secured from any of these men.
§ § §
CREDITS OF “DOME” SUBSCRIBERS TO BE HELD UP UNTIL PAYMENT IS MADE
Attention is drawn to the fact that through an arrangement with the Reverend Emil DeWulf, C.S.C., director of studies, Reverend P. J. Carroll, C.S.C., chairman of the Board of Publications, and Mrs. Mary Beyer, secretary, the credits of all those individuals (of which there are about 150) who signed for a 1929 Dome but failed to pay, will be held up until payment is made. Further, those who desire extra copies should signify their intent to the Business Manager, 1 Robert Kuhn, directly, inasmuch as there were but a limited number of copies printed this year.	.
NEXT YEAR’S RESERVATIONS CAN BE MADE FROM MAY 13 TO 20 INCLUSIVE

ANNOUNCE ALFRED E. SMITH LAETARE MEDAL PRESENTATION PROGRAM
The complete program for the official presentation of the Laetare Medal, the annual award of Notre Dame to the Catholic layman who has achieved the highest distinction in any field of endeavor during the year, was. announced recently by the Very Reverend Charles L. O’Donnell, C.S.C., president of the University. The ceremony of presentation will be made at a meeting of the Notre Dame Alumni Club of New York City in the Hotel Plaza, New York. Through the courtesy of the National Broadcasting Company, the ceremonies will be broadcast, beginning at 9:15 p. m., eastern daylight saving time.
Father O’Donnell will read the formal document of presentation and His Eminence, Patrick Cardinal Hayes, one of the most celebrated members of the Catholic hierarchy in this country, will formally bestow the award on this year’s recipient, the Honorable Alfred E. Smith. The main address of the evening will be delivered by Dr. Frank Pierce-Pont-Graves, commissioner of education for the state of New York. Former Governor Smith will deliver the response. Ambrose O’Connell, of the class of ’07, is in charge of the arrangements for the meeting.
The formal document of presentation, which will be read by Father O’Donnell, is as follows:
“The University of Notre Dame, to Alfred Emanuel Smith, Greeting: In the year of Our Lord, Eighteen Hundred and Eighty-three, the Very Reverend Edward Sorin, priest of the Congregation of Holy Cross, founder and first president of the University of Notre Dame, established the Laetare Medal as an award annually to some American lay Catholic who in his particular field of endeavor has achieved such distinction as reflects glory upon the Catholic Faith. The list of men and women so honored in these past forty-six years amply illustrates the inspiration which that Faith has brought into all departments of thought and of human life,— into philosophy and literature, the arts and sciences, into the learned professions and into public service, whether in time of peace or in time of war.
“Sir, this year the University of Notre Dame admits you to the historic and distinguished company of her Laetare Medallists. Your title to enrollment there is found in your long and honorable public career as a statesman and in the unsullied virtue of your private life, for both of which alike the soundness and sincerity of your Catholic Faith stand out as the moving force and radiant inspiration. As a public servant you have been such a one as could bring his record into the sanctity of his home without fear of violating that sanctuary: as a private citizen you could present such a record of domestic fidelity as might be fearlessly exhibited in the market place or on the hustings, or in the courts of all the world. Public life in America is the more honorable for your having shared it in the high station which you have adorned, and the private life of the simple home-loving citizen is enobled by your example.
“Therefore the University of Notre Dame, with the single purpose of paying homage to the most worthy of her Faith and nationhood has named you, Sir, as the recipient of her most cherished distinction, to which in turn the full measure of your deserving will but add new lustre.
“In recognition of signal devotion to Faith and country, in consideration of personal worth as a public official and as a private citizen, the University of Notre Dame asks you, Alfred Emanuel Smith, to accept the Laetare Medal for this year of Our Lord, nineteen hundred and twenty-nine. May you wear it into length of days in the serene enjoyment that comes from the consciousness of work well done and in the
me Scholastic	857
peace of heart that is the fruitage of that faith in which a man “has tried to walk humbly with his God.”
Former Governor Smith, Democratic nominee for president during the last presidential campaign, and four times governor of New York, will be the forty-seventh recipient of the Medal which is considered the highest honor an American Catholic layman can receive. The Laetare medal has been presented by the University every year since 1883.

PROF. PHILLIPS SPEAKS AT PUBLICATIONS BANQUET ON CAMPUS JOURNALISM
An address by Professor Charles Phillips of the English department, on Campus Journalism and its place in the life of the undergraduate, and the announcement of the editors
PROF. CHARLES PHILLIPS
and advertising managers for next year, featured the annual dinner given by the Faculty Board of Publications to the various editorial and business boards of the major campus publications last night in the Faculty Dining Hall.
Professor Phillips emphasized the importance of college publications in the life of a university and stressed the point that work on such publications is splendid training for those desirous of entering the
world of Journalism when they have completed their university courses. The Reverend P. J. Carroll, C.S.C., chairman of the Faculty Board of Publications and toastmaster of the occasion, called attention to the close relation between the Faculty administrative powers and the Publications Board, both of which had the aim of furthering the interests of Notre Dame. He complimented the retiring editors and business managers on the work which they had performed during the past year and termed the year as the most successful in the history of the publications at the University.
The Rev. Eugene Burke, C.S.C., and the Rev. Leo Ward, C.S.C., associate members of the Publications Board, complimented the work of the men and expressed the pleasure they have received as members of the Board.
The Rev. J. Hugh O’Donnell, C.S.C., Prefect of Discipline, gave an interesting talk on the progress of the publications and in the name of the University congratulated the staffs on their work.
Short talks were given by Mr. Joseph P. McNamara, editor-in-chief of the Juggler; Mr. Charles Gass, business manager of the Juggler; Mr. John V. Hinkel, editor-in-chief of the Scholastic; Mr. Harley L. McDevitt, business manager of the Scholastic; Mr. Thomas A. Keegan, editor-in-chief of the Dome, and Mr. Robert Kuhn, business manager- of the Dome.
§ o § PUBLICATIONS MEN MUST REGISTER FOR FORMAL BY MAY 10
All members of the various editorial and business boards of the Scholastic, Juggler and Dome who have not as yet registered for the Publications Formal Dinner Dance to be held Thursday, May 16, must do so with their various editors before Friday, May 10. Harley L. McDevitt, chairman of the dance, announces that no registrations will be accepted after this date.	e e e

VARSITY DEBATERS CONCLUDE SUCCESSFUL SEASON BY DEFEATING DETROIT Notre Dames’ varsity debating team closed a very successful season last Friday night when it defeated the University of Detroit team at the Knights of Columbus hall at Detroit. The team, which defended the affirmative, was composed of George Beamer, Charles Haskell, and Francis Mc-Greal. Contending that a criminal code similar to that of England be adopted by the United States, the Notre Dame team greatly manifested its superiority by close coherence to the case and by its fluent delivery.
CAMPUS PERSONALITIES
Joe Keefe is Notre Dame’s drummer boy par excellence besides being a personality, and it didn’t take Notre Dame long to discover either- of those facts.
JOE KEEFE
Before entering the University Joe was a regular-member of a military band at his home in Winter-Haven, Florida. And the experience he gained in that organization began to show soon after he signified his intention to join our own Boys in Grey. For the past four years now Joe has been an outstanding figure in Joesph Casasanta’s musical proteges. He was included in the roster of that famous band of 1926, which was the first collegiate organization ever to make a recording for Brunswick.
Then this year when Notre Dame put the best band in its history on the field there was Joe Keefe at the helm in the role of President. The office attested to the presence both of his popularity and his talents as a musician.
But Joe wasn’t content to be satisfied with wielding the drum sticks in the Band alone. Last year he was a member of the University orchestra and for the past two years has been a member of the Glee Club. He made the Easter tour with this latter body this past season. Then, too, the training he was receiving as a member of Dean McCarthy’s College of Commerce, together with his own innate ability, moved his band mates to select him as their Advertising-Manager in 1928.
Although in his first year Joe was a member of those immortals who lived in Freshman Hall, he has been living off-campus ever since. At present he may be found at infrequent intervals at 407 North Michigan Street. —D.w.S.

SENIOR BALL PLANS COMPLETED
Plans for the Senior Ball of 1929 are complete; the committees under the direction and supervision of Jack Reilly,
ANTHONY J. KOPECKY
general chairman, have done their work well. All is in readiness; the scenery is moved into place; the lights are arranged; the stage is set; the curtain is about to go up!
One week from tonight —the Senior Ball at the Palais Royale. One week from tonight, the curtain rises, and girls from thirtyseven states will be present for the grand event. One week from tonight the members of Notre Dame’s Senior class will hold their final class dance; for many it will be theii* last college ball.
TICKET SALE BRISK
With the time before the Ball growing less and less, tickets are going at a rate that indicates that not a few of the last-minute men are going to be disappointed. The names of all the men who are planning to go must be in the hands of General Chairman Jack Reilly before May 4th, as three hundred tickets have already been sold, leaving only a small number available. Deposits for these tickets will be taken by any of the men on the ticket committee before the date mentioned.
ORCHESTRA FAMED FOR ITS MUSIC
Everything associated with the Ball is on the grand scale. Johnny Johnson and His Hotel Pennsylvania Victor Recording Orchestra will furnish the inspiration with a program of symphonic jazz rhythm. Johnson is recognized as one of the outstanding exponents of the smooth style of dance music— there will be no cowbell jazz at the Palais Royale the night of the Senior Ball. Among other things, this orchestra is famous for its slow “blues” rhythm, and its vocal quartets and soloists, discovered and developed during the seven years in which the organization has played together. Special features for the Ball will include the “Victory March” as the farewell number.
DISTRIBUTION OF FAVORS
Favors will be given out Monday afternoon by General Chairman Reilly in Sorin Hall upon full payment of tickets. The last orders for lavors must be. in Monday night.
DECORATIONS UNIQUE IN CHARACTER
Decorations, which are to be of a unique and unusual character, will be another feature of the ball. The decoration will strike the modernistic note, and will mark the first time anything so pretentious has been attempted at an affair of this kind at Notre Dame.
Lawrence P. Lawless and Peter A. Brysselbout, co-chairmen of the Decoration Committee, have been working out the plans for some time, and when perfected they will represent a distinct interpretation of the new trend that the art of interior decorating has been manifesting. The flambuoyancy that characterizes the modernistic will be used in the decora-* tions, with a care not to make the scheme a freakish one, a happy combination of modernism and conservatism is to be
the order of the day. Above all, the latest uses of color and scale will be employed for a wholly new and novel effect.
TEA DANCE SATURDAY
The Tea Dance, under- the chairmanship of William Siden-fadden, will be held from one to five Saturday afternoon, following the Ball. This is expected to be a delightful addition to the week-end’s entertainment and fun. A Chicago orchestra has been engaged to play for the affair.
SUNDAY MORNING ARRANGEMENTS
Mass for the Seniors and their guests will be one of the features on the program for Sunday morning. The Mass will be celebrated in the Morrissey Hall chapel, Sunday morning at 9:30. The Reverend Charles L. O’Donnell, C.S.C., president of the University, will be the celebrant. There will be a special breakfast served in the Faculty Dining Room of the University for the Seniors and their guests immediately afterwards. Reservations for the breakfast can be made with either General Chairman Jack Reilly, or with Jack Grey, chairman of the Sunday morning arrangements committee.

The Church of The Sacred Heart
Reverend Lawrence Broughall. C.S.C.
Secretary, Church Restoration Committee
1868—1931
These years enshrine holy memories. They proclaim the inspired wisdom of Father Sorin in making- this temple the consecrated center of religion and learning. . . . His love of excellence in bringing from Europe a renowned artist, Greg-ori, to adorn the vast reaches of the interior. . His dominant courage in undertaking the work with no resources, other than his confidence in the living faith of the friends of Notre Dame.
The archives are eloquent with testimony of the ready response, often touching beyond words, that came from the Americas, Europe, and even Australia. The powerful and the wealthy gave of their treasure, the poor of their mite. In truth all these voices attest with the Psalmist. “I have loved, 0 Lord, the Beauty of Thy House and the Place where Thy Glory dwelleth.”
The urgent needs of the expanding University, but especially the disastrous fire of 1879, crowded aside the full fruition of Father Sorin’s hopes. Instead of the appropriate furnishings required by the Liturgy, only substitutes were possible. The new years brought new problems and the church remained unfinished, though entwined with the-loves of many generations.
Time has either dimmed or effaced much of its compelling beauty. Temporary altars still occupy the seven apsidal chapels. The crypt is almost as bare as Bethlehem. The lighting is antiquated and hazardous. The chimes are silent. The organ is but a faint echo of its former celestial quality. The restless feet of the thousands who here found consolation and inspiration, have worn thin the boards on which they trod.
An admirer of Notre Dame has generously made it possible to restore the glory of Gregori’s brush. This gives rise to the hope of at last attaining, in the spirit of Father Sorin’s beginnings, the full realization of his ideals with regard to the church in time for the Diamond Jubilee of the blessing of the Foundation Stone (1931).
Mr. Wilfred E. Anthony, the present architect of St. Vincent Ferrer’s Church, New York, has received the commission to supervise the restoration and to harmonize the new with the old. The designs reveal marvels of loveliness, befitting the august use of the various pieces. Assuredly, from, high heaven will Father Sorin exclaim, “Thou art all fair, 0 My love”f
Those friends of Notre Dame whose interest may especially lie in such a work, will rejoice at this announcement. An altar, a statue, a lantern, a foot of pavement, to mention only a few details, would be a fitting memorial to their dear departed, a gracious tribute to a revered professor, a grateful remembrance of a son’s graduation.'
A “Book of Golden Deeds” will bear all the names. Placed under the High Altar for enduring memory, they will plead with the Divine Love in union with the thousands of Masses, the millions of Holy Communions, the countless prayers that here ascend as incense in the sight of the Lord.

Brownson and Carroll Halls
PAUL J. HALLINAN
The Main Building with Carroll Hall {on the left) and Brownson Hall (on the right).
A gong, let loose, splits the air of the Main Building with its shrill impatience. Groans, yawns and unmusical imprecations volley from behind white curtains. A dull thudding on resonant bedposts by the prefects, brings shouts of, “Cut it out,” “Shut off that siren.” Several doors slam open and shut; unsteady feet in heavy shoes, plod down the stairs. Brownson and Carroll halls are awake at last.
Fifteen minutes later, the unjoyful symphony has become a cacophony of running water, rattling lockers and gargled Listerine. Thirty or so toothbrus h e s move up and down, across and back. Soapsuds splatter. Three hundred fresh-
men straighten their ties, brush back the unruly hair and saunter out. Carroll and Brownson halls are ready for a day.
That's the early morning routine. And as the day goes on, we learn that the men of these halls not only “rise and shine” together: they dress in the cosmopolitan locker-room for their daily work, their interhall games and their dates; in the blue smoky haze of their “Rec” they sing, shoot pool and play bridge together; and in their big study hall, they work their analytics and Latin, write letters and act like normal freshmen.
Brownson and Carroll life then, is a democratic affair; at times bordering on communism. It is migratory for your Brownson and Carroll freshman distances four or five hundred yards before the day really begins. Ownership is rather indefinite, for the resident of these halls has no place to hang his hat with the assurance that it will be there at his return; no place where he can settle in a comfortable easy-chair for an evening with the radio. Such luxuries are for Howard; they smack of the “Gold Coast.” The boys of the Main Building, although they assure you otherwise, thrive on migrations, democracy and sociability.
Brownson and Carroll are the oldest halls on a campus which is famous for the traditions of its halls.. Long before the chintz curtains of Morrissey waved in the lake breezes, long before the walls of the “Cardboard Palaces,” Freshmen and Sophomore, creaked before an Indiana wind; even before the most celebrated of all residences, Sorin “Sub” saw the light of day,—as far back as 1866, Brownson and Carroll were Notre Dame. When the fire of April 23, 1879, reduced all the buildings (except the unfinished Sacred Heart Church and the
“Ave Maria” building) to a pile of ashes, the untiring priests rebuilt and in September of the same year, the two halls were again crowded with boys and men.
A distinction is made here between “boys” and “men”, because Carroll at that time was the home of the “preps” and only the college men lived under the Brownson roof. Each hall had its “Rec",, in the first floor of W a s hing-ton hall; each had its gym in the eastern end of Rockefeller hall; each had its campus, Brownson in the quadrangle now bounded by Chemistry hall and the G y mnasium; Carroll to the north of • the gym and extending thru the territory
now occupied by Sophomore and Freshman halls.
The two halls reigned in a dual monarchy for many years. Sorin, the first hall with individual rooms, was built in 1887; the others followed later on at different intervals, and about the time of the war, Brownson and Carroll—once the cherished homes of “lifers,” four year men and past-graduates, —became practically freshman halls. The University catalogue comments briefly upon them as follows: Brownson and Carroll halls are located in the wings of the Administration Building and are conducted under the common-room system with dormitories and study halls.
Numerous men have sat at the “thrones” of either hall, in the position of rector, but none has left a more indelible mark upon the history of the hall than Brother Alphonsus, C.S.C., who was Brownson’s rector for thirty years from 1898 to 1928. The old grads cherish his memory; younger men, living in the hall, learned to respect his word and presence; leaving, they remembered .him. So the cycle was formed, and the spirit of Brownson increased with the years of his rectorship. Last winter he retired from his beloved “throne” and his “boys”, coming back to visit the campus, feel that much has gone out of Notre Dame life, since Brother Alphonsus left. ’
The history of Carroll’s rectors has been more varied. Brother Alexander, C.S.C., was one of the first to guide the “preps,” in the earlier days. Brother Lawrence, Brother Just and Brother Albeus, all Holy Cross brothers, succeeded him. The Reverend James Quinlan, C.S.C., the Reverend Devers, C^.C., and the Reverend Joseph Heiser, C.S.C., followed, which brings us to the present times: Brother Mauri-lius, C.S.C., grants pers, delivers mail, and—rules the Car

pool balls. The rival manor, Brownson “Rec” is presided over by Brother Aloysius, C.S.C., in a like atmosphere. All these rectors and prefects remember the Brownson and Carroll halls of years ago and it is to them that the alumni come for talk-fests and recollections of yesterday.
This period of happiness, common to graduates, is known as the “old days”. It extends from the first year in which Carroll and Brownson existed down to about the time of the war. Discipline was stricter then than now; the case of the unfortunate Carroll man expelled for smoking a cigarette on the streets of South Bend, was not uncommon. There were no night permissions, and absences during the day had to be sternly accounted for.
The study halls themselves were slightly less noisy than tombs. Prefects who remember Brownson hall in 1900, shake their heads dubiously now when they glance around the room. Not an unnecessary word was spoken and it is reported that vigilance was so efficient that a note could not be passed from desk to desk without receiving the attention of the man on the throne. Professors came to the door every hour to call for their classes; the men marched out in rank, each one accounted for. It is hard to picture this performance with the crowds in the Main Building today.
AU this was in the “old days”. The war brought freedom of cigarettes, indirectly abolished the hitching posts and gas lamps and brought lengthier and snappier dances. Brownson and Carroll men profitted in the result. Although the direction of the priests and brothers has always been paternal, it is now less intimate and the discipline less severe.
But aged bricks, firm old pillars and memories of the old days are not the only distinctions of these halls. In only a few universities and colleges’ is there a similar “commonroom” system. Dormitories with white curtains on iron bars, and study-haUs with a hundred men in them, disappeared like one-horse shays and bicycle paths. They have been retained at Notre Dame, not only because of an overcrowded campus, but on account of certain popularity which they still enjoy. The men who graduated in the ’90’s insist that their sons live at least a year in the old halls. Fellowship is unmistakable there.	(
In their dual history, the two halls have always shown a common rivalry and support. Every fall, in at least one game, the interhall teams representing Brownson and Car
roll fight to the last whistle, for the mythical Main Building championship. No matter, if previous to this, neither aggregation has won a game. Brownson “points” for Carroll, and Carroll “points” for Brownson. Past accounts of these annual games go back to the first days of football.
Successful grid teams, in Brownson colors have come and gone, but forensic talent seems to be a heritage of the hall. With a few exceptions, Brownson, has won the yearly championship in debating. Tim Galvin, now a Gary lawyer, and James O’Shaughnessy, a Chicago lawyer, were among the speakers who once swayed the minds of their hallmates in the older days. James C. Roy, national intercollegiate oratorical champion this year, began his college debating for Brownson. So did scores of others; the hall seems to inspire them.
Other traditions center about the brick walls and yellow lights of these halls. For instance, the name “Arabs” as applied to the residents; this is derived from the Happing “tents” and the nomadic existence, in general. Another is the locked doors which look so hospitable to the stranger. Entrance and exit is made through the central portals of the building, ?iot through the individual doors of each hall. Then there is the annual Brownson Smoker, an event of late Octobei- at which everyone sings, listens to speeches, and eats to capacity. Because it is a smoker, the cigar-rettes usually run out before many are served. The affair takes place in the “rec,” already referred to as the manor of Brother Aloysius. His room there and the walls of the “rec” are literally filled with trophies, photographs, clippings and mementos of Brownson.
Perhaps the most beautiful of all the traditions is-found in the two chapels, one on the third floor of the Main Building, the other in the basement of the Sacred Heart Church. In the first, the men from both halls gather every night for a visit to the Blessed Sacrament. Night prayer is said in the study halls below, but in that half hour before the prefects check up in the dorms, the chapel is filled. In the early hours of the morning, after the boys have straggled from St. Joseph’s, St. Patrick’s, St. Thomas’, St. Aloysius, and St. Edward’s dorms, the Basement Chapel is filled. Confessions are heard, Holy Communion is distributed and Mass is celebrated. Then the boys go to breakfast.
Under the narrow aisle of the Basement Chapel lies the body of Orestes A. Brownson, illustrious Catholic philosopher, and the man in whose memory Brownson hall is named. The tribute to his memory which is inscribed on the tablet in the Basement Chapel, translated, reads: “Here lies Orestes A. Brownson, who humbly recognized the true faith, and lived a full life. He defended the church and nation with pen and tongue. And though his body has perished by death, the works of his mind have remained as immortal monuments of his genius.”
Carroll’s history, because the early years were filled with the activities of the ‘preps” is not so extensive as Brownson’s, but the spirit is equally as enthusiastic. The hall was named in honor of the first archbishop of Baltimore—the Right Reverend John Carroll.
Brownson; Brother Alphonsus; thirty years; Carroll; rivalry; “Philopatrians”. Basement Chapel; Main Building championship; the “rec”; the old grads; “Arabs”; debating teams; the trunk room; talking in sleep; yellow lights; comics in the dorms; Notre Dame as the original Notre Dame was. . . I
No wonder, the alumnus looks at you and says, “What! You’re not in Brownson or Carroll halls? Why, you’re missing your college life completely.”

A very novel way of showing your dislike for an act of vaudeville has been brought out by some students of Yale university. • A band was playing on the stage during a theatrical performance, when to the surprise of the musicians alarm clocks began to ring in all parts of the house. The matter was investigated and it was found that a number of students from Old Eli disliked the orchestra and took this method of showing their annoyance.

From The Toiver, a weekly paper published by the students of Catholic University of America, Washington, D. C.:
“Shake, brother students! An investigator has completed a tour of foreign universities. He states that American and foreign students are about equal, except that foreign, as a whole, do not have as much money as American students. Far be it from us to be cynical, but we venture to say that the phenomena of being “broke” is not uncommon on American campuses.”

A literary magazine with the purpose of allowing “self expression,” written, edited, and published by a single student, is the curiosity of the University of Missouri campus.
The magazine is The Literarian Enquirer. It is owned, printed, and circulated by Ernest W. Tedlock, a freshman student at the University.
All of the details of putting out each issue of the magazine are attended to by Tedlock with the exception of casting the type. This, he says, takes too much time.
The financial burden of the magazine is borne by Tedlock. He does not sell advertising space and gives the issues away.

An honorary professor of the Wasedo university in Tokio, Dr. Yuzo Tsubzouchi, has, for the past forty-three years been translating the works for William Shakespeare into Japanese. He recently finished the thirty-fourth and last volume. Scholars have appraised the translation as a masterpiece of technique and literary skilly since there has been such a perfect rendering of the English original.
Dr. Tsubouchi undertook this great work in 1885 when he was twenty-six years of age. He began his translation with “Julius Caesar.” On his seventieth birthday, which he is approaching, a commemoration will be made by his pupils in the establishment of a dramatic library at Wasedo University. Also the Tsukji of Tokio will present “Midsummer Night’s Dream” at the Imperial Theatre in a performance which will be attended by the Emperor and Empress.

Although life at Notre Dame is not perfect, we are free from at least one of the vicissitudes which the students must undergo at schools with an R. O. T. C. unit. The following is from the University Daily Kansan:
“Rummy-Tum-Tum—Rummy-Tum-Tum—Rummy— “‘Well, what’n hell! Where’s the circus?’
“ ‘For Gosh sakes, don’t they know I jus’ got to bed?’ “‘Oh shut up! It’s jus’ the bum and pipe corpse. My boy friend’s in it. He smokes a pipe.’
“These were a few of the cries to be heard in the houses Saturday morning between 5:30 and 7:30 o’clock. Eventually, however, most of the would-be snoozers convinced themselves they were not having a nightmare or a hang-over from the night before, and raised weary heads to see the drum and fife corps of the R. O. T. C. go by.>
’ “Oh yes, the dear boys must attract attention some way, even if they have to get up at 5 o’clock and disturb honest folks to do it. It was just another way of telling us that the day of the Kansas Relays had arrived.”

The average student is the one who gets the most out of school, according to the Oregon deans of men and women. The average student is defined by one of them as “the mean between the two extremes; the sincerely culturally inclined who recognizes the value of social^ activities in their proper place. The opinion was that while some day colleges for the scholars and colleges for the “country club class” would be provided, just now they benefit most this great average class.

THE -TIK I AK I T- CLEE
A recent news item in the Scholastic tells us that a new club, the “Spectators,” has been formed on the campus, “for the purpose of discussing contemporary events and developments in the arts, sciences, politics, religion and like fields of knowledge and endeavor.”
Certainly this is indicative of a significant trend in undergraduate life; a trend towards greater awareness of the life round about one and a more intense consciousness of both its presence and its import.	*
In college one is apt to become almost wholly occupied with the accumulated wisdom of the ages; not that thi^ is not a thoroughly laudable purpose; but it may become something of a handicap if one makes no attempt to see his own age in the new light shed by his century drenched knowledge; and in order to know one’s age, one must know the events taking place in his age.
The Club, although organized by Juniors, should have a special appeal to the sophomores and freshmen, but particularly to the former, because it is they who must carry on the work after the present founders have gone out into the world to take their places in the fields of “knowledge and endeavor.”
The “Spectators” will not, as has been suggested, overlap the domains of either Scribblers or Wranglers; they are, as it were, on a plateau which surveys both of the fields apposite to these two organizations—and much else, in addition.
In one meeting such diverse topics as the debenture bill, European attitude towards America, modern spirit in Arts and Letters, and the significance of Humanism, may be discussed. Each member is allowed from ten to fifteen minutes in which to present his matter; then the meeting automatically becomes an open forum for the discussion of wha+ever ideas, views, and opinions may have been evoked by his treatment of his topic.
Nor is the matter presented confined strictly i o the wide but sometimes restrictive pastures of contemporaneousness; effective rendition of a subject may demand the setting forth of a background, which, in its turn, may retrace its devious path for some decades of years. But this is done only in order that a better understanding of the material under consideration may be had by the members of the club.
“Knowledge and Endeavor!” To obtain knowledge of events that are shaping national and international history in all lines of thought and action; and to endeavor to become more than passive onlookers at a spectacle in which they are soon to become not only actors but directors as well; such are the aims of the “Spectators”; and to them the Scholastic extends a hearty welcome and best wishes for success!	—M. H. L.
NETRE IAHIT NEWEST CEAMEICN
James C. Roy came into his own last Friday night at Evanston. Four years of indefatigable work bore rich fruit and he was adjudged the best college orator in America. Unanimously, the seven judges in the Interstate Oratorical Association Contest gave him their votes for the honor.
Notre Dame regards James C. Roy’s achievement with pride. For the second time in'her history one of her sons has been singularly honored with the title of National Intercollegiate Oratorical champion. Others of her forensic sons have reached brilliant heights, but none the pinnacle that Mr. Roy achieved the other night in receiving the unanimoics decision of the judges. Few colleges or universities can boast of such an honor falling to one of its sons, so Notre Dame has every reason to be proud. '
Mr. Roy was more than deserving of his outstanding feat. Breen Medal Contest winner for the last three years at the University; three times finalist in the Indiana Intercollegiate Oratorical Association’s competition, this year the winner of that contest; certainly if ever an orator deserved recognition for faithful and 'conscientious efforts it is Mr. Roy;
The Scholastic congratulates Mr. Roy on behalf of the officials, faculty members, students, alumni and friends of the University for his pre-eminent success; not only because of his hard-won victory, but because it appreciates the toil that was his before success finally crowned his efforts.	—J.

Japanese Sunrise
FRANK M’ADAMS
|» "W”T was faster Sunday morning. We had traveled 4500 I miles in ten days of stormy weather, and in twenty minI utes wre were to dock in Yokohawa. The Bos’n entered the forecastle to awaken me again, for I had not arisen at the first warning. Since I was only a deck hand whom | duty called, I tumbled out of my bunk, and fell into dun-i . garees, sandals, and shirt to go “topsides forward” to my I * entry-to-port station.
The hour was five oclock, the morning cold, and the sun not yet risen. When we docked in port my gang let down the after gangplank, thus ending my port obligations.
“	I walked back to the poop deck. Beyond me I could see
the breakwater, a fishing boat out to sea, and the light on the • treacherous rock point, Imiboe Saki, which is the first light are seen upon entering Japan from the east. As I stood looking seaward I became suddenly aware of the closeness of a faint red streak just over the horizon. The tip of this streak soon evolved into the shape of a red half disc that radiated specks of color in every direction. It was the rising sun. Its rays made my eyes blink in the same peculiar manner as * shadow bands had done before the last solar eclipse. The 1pearl white sail of the fishing boat became strangely red, and the sailor upright in the stern seemed to be a squat, red column with almost no shape. The spell of the rising sun
4^ made me imagine many queer things. It led me, for instance to fancy that the fishing boat was the Argo with its tall mast from the forest of Dodoma, and that the sailor in the * stem was one of the Argonauts who steared while Jason and the rest of the crew slept. I felt like chiding them for being asleep, because was not their destination Colchis, just beyond the horizon?	_
The waters were as golden and as bright as the sun. It was not cold then, for the heat rays fairly enveloped me, *	making me shiver because of the contrast between the
-	warmth and previous cold. The sun rose slowly and im-
pressively as though its power were something as inevitable as the end of the world. It seemed to say to me: “Through , countless centuries before you were bom have arisen and set, and will rise and set after you are gone.” The higher in the heavens it arose, the farther away it seemed. I was * filled with awe.. The scene before me was really fairy like. - A remembered line from a poem of Dorothy Parker struck me as being singularly appropriate: “The sun rose dripping, a bucketful of gold.” It did just that, for after its lowest extremetiy had cleared the water on the rim of the horizon,
it seemed to drip gold spangles for the enjoyment of wondering and for the playful denizens of the sea.
I reflected that the gray, burnt out world of earliest dawn, sin blackened in aspect, seemed, with the appearance of the sun, to have repented, confessed, and been encouraged to assume a cheerful brightness. I was sure that the big, clean sun was capable of inspiring confidence in the hearts of all discouraged ones. It gave me a lasting impression of the vastness, goodness, and mysteriousness “Del Buen Dios.”
Faintly, I could hear bells. With all the brightness of the morning and the joy of the bells I could almost imagine the splendor of the Savior’s Rising. I thought that the cleanness of that sunrise would be enough to banish the devil forever from the re-sanctified earth.
Another queer thought struck me because I suddenly remembered my family and wondered if they would have enjoyed the sunrise as I had. My sister, the esthate of my family would, but the others probably would not. I realized that while it was day here it was night at home. I thought of how the sun affected those on this side of the world upon whom it cast its warmth and cheer. What emotions did the sailors of Commodore Perry experience when they were confronted by their first Japanese Sunrise? I should like to . know if the natives of Yokohama feel thankful for the gift of another day, or do they see nothing in the sunrise? Do they feel an awakening in their soul each new day ? No, it was just commonplace to them. The marvel in the distance or just beyond the horizon is always the greatest. This method of reasoning is characteristic of human nature, and is the same in all men regardless of race or creed.
Such was my entry into Japan. It was no puzzle to me then why Alfred Noyes and Burton Holmes have visited the little, picturesque oriental island kingdom nine times. The former is a poet who puts his emotions in verse for all the world to enjoy. The latter is a travel-talk artist that makes a business of satisfying the romantic travel desires of the stay-at-homes who possess fertile imaginations. I am unlike either of them. I am more selfish. I want to look these impression safely in my heart so that any time I wish I mayunlock this chest and enjoy my memories again.
Japan, to me, is not Japan, the rising world power, or Japan, the cherry blosson country, but Nippon, the land of the Rising Sun.

Being An Ordinary Seaman

“Now woidd I give a thousands furlonps of sea for an acre of barren
—The Tempest I.
land.”
HE indescribably strange feeling that I knew when I gazed daily at the sea dominates me now as I register thoughts of her mysteries, her glories, her charms— those charms which hold intact the many “yarns” of
adventure; those charms which forcibly drew me to her bosom, there to remain, for once her lures are felt they become irresistible.
I recall that when I was a boy my elders spoke fantastically of the sea, saying that she was the inspiration of poets and a “hideout” for thieves; that the mucky rain from the gutters ultimately found renewed life in the sea; that the virgin waters from the mountains mingled with the muddy rills from the cities—and the two became part of the vast sea. Her lovely characteristics were portrayed and magnified; but I was never told of her mighty swell, nor were her eternal whisperings translated to me.
I became famliiar with the sea by contact, since for three long months she was my home, my book, my taskmaster. During early life none of my undertakings had amounted to a great deal. I lacked the thing vital to success. It mattered little, then, if my capacity at sea was just “ordinary,” because even this humble position offered me the splendid occasion of rising to lofty heights, of freeing myself from the mediocrity of the recognized average. Somehow, though, I never accomplished that freedom for which I strove. I was, like the sea itself, elevated to the crest, for I reached the position of bell-boy, being decked out in a gold-buttoned blue uniform and enjoying the privilege of contact with the passengers, . but I was soon pitched into the trough, being demoted to the labours of an ordinary seaman, for which I seemed predestined.
When I entered the services of the sea I was afraid of her sparkle by day and of her black nights. True, my feeling was not that of dread: rather the fear of respect—or lack of it—that a boy knows for his stem foster-father. Often too, I conjured up visions of encountering a pirate fleet which would loot us and compel our crew to go down into the ancient waters; or, perchance, there would be met the invincible Armada, between whom and us would ensue a test of naval supremacy. Vague phantoms of the glory I might attain danced before me. Paul Jones was the prototype whose daring in battle I would emulate.
But the duties of a sailor disturbed me from my dreams —those numerous, difficult duties. To sail the sea one must be versatile. For the seaman, it is to do and not to think. And I, who was baffled by my new and strange surroundings, was mistakingly regarded by superiors as one who had served before the mast at least two years. Hence I was left to interpret their orders as best I could. On being issued a holystone, I would dumbly withdraw to the cook’s galley to offer my services in sharpening knives. So consistently did I err in the performance of my nautical duties that the crew asserted it would be my fault if the ship never reached Europe. I was repeatedly made aware that co-operation of units— sailors are units—is a law of the sea. I, though, could never make my right and my left hand co-operate.
The voyage proceeded without mishap until one night when I took my watch on the fo’c’sle deck to peer out over
the sea in quest of green and red signal lamps which warned us of ships and their course. Suddenly a storm, furious and treacherous, blew up. Tidal waves rolled amuck. Havoc prevailed. I stood my post, but not for long. As unheralded as the storm, an enormous splash of troubled water hurled itself over the fo’c’sle and sent me reeling against a bulkhead, knocking me unconscious. I was relieved of my post and declared “not sea-worthy.”
Never have I understood the sheer endurance which enabled me to bear up under the trials of that voyage. Perhaps being given to romanticism, I was obsessed by the fancy that Neptune’s apple-like cheeks might puff me over-board, if I but hinted the shirking of my duties. Perhaps it was the lure of adventure which kept me at my post.
And so I survived each tribulation and hard-knock rendered unto me, each curse and sarcasm flung my way. I suffered the pains of purgatory patiently, knowing that I was to be redeemed into a miniature heaven; for were not foreign lands just beyond the horizon! In the attainment of the better things of this world one needs must suffer the preliminary bitterness. Success is subjectively measured by the methods one employs in contending with the distasteful and repugnant elements of life. And was I to abandon my purpose because of my destitute heart? Emphatically no!
As though to check me from further despair, sea gulls appeared swimming and diving in the blue sea of the sky, and indicating the proximity of land. They were a perfect reception committee. Upon our reaching land strange places appeared before me. There were historic parts to be seen— Winchester and its aged church where knightly knee had often knelt in prayer; London with its fog and its glamour, its ostentatious court and its puny looking inhabitants; splendid Versailles, with its phenomenal fountains and comely ladies. There were sad areas—Verdun whose desolation dimmed its otherwise victorious aspect; Flanders where I whispered a prayer for my brother who rests there. And there were gay places— famous Paris, luxuriant Monte Carlo, and the blue Mediterranean—at which to revel if one cared to. And there were romantic places made for dreaming— Venice with her watery avenues, in which I sailed the gondolas, for it is the forte of sailors whilst on leave to spend precious time aboard some other vessel; Vienna, which offered for one’s contentment luscious ales and exquisitely soft music; and the Black Forest, which I dared not enter.
But I must return to the ancient waters, for the sea invariably claims her own. Even I, who served her most ignoble, most frugally, am welcomed back. Having feasted my -eyes and adorned my soul with the splendors of the Continent, I am recalled to the “ordinariness” which I needs must endure at sea. The majestic waters were the means which conveyed me to the promised lands, and for the service rendered they demand due requital. Back to the toss of the ship and the roll of the waves I must go. But while I am being tossed and rolled, I will never forget the calmness of the land—a land which unveiled its every treasure for me and wrapped me in an embrace of joy like the caress of a mother. No matter what allurements the sea may hold out to others, she will never usurp, in my affections, the place held by the gentle, the always smiling, the secure, safe land.

Dreams End
S1RDAH RUMJAHN
THE recent appointment of Herr Johann Von Gluck to the exalted position of Director-Laurate of the Imperial Academy of Music at Nuremburg, was an honor which the famous person had long desired and which had been his most cherished dream; one for which he had spent many long and tedious hours of preparation and study. The greatest honor that all music-loving Germany could bestow on a single man, had been conferred on Herr Von Gluck, and tonight he was to appear before the residents of Nuremburg and prove to them his gratitude and happiness by directing the orchestra of his dreams.
Herr Von Gluck was sixty, unmarried, and had served in the capacity of Director-extraordinary of the Munich Symphony Orchestra, that prodigiously famous exponent of the works of the old masters, that sits in stately dignity within the fine old tradition-covered walls of the Munich Opera House and plays soft music to the finite world. Herr Director had attained a degree of success and popularity among the critics of the country and it was largely through their efforts that his recent appointment had been effected.
But the great musician was puzzled and worried. For the entire preceding week some strange heaviness of spirit, an indescribable premonition, had pervaded him; dark circles under his eyes were mutely pronounced. Even his eyes were oddly bright and he breathed just a little heavier and faster. Something seemed to be continually telling him that his work was done; his life was complete; going on was futile now that he had realized his dream. But Herr Von Gluck wanted to go on with his music. He wanted to charm his people of Germany with the Baton and never grow tired. Tonight was his first public appearance as Director-Laurate and Herr Von Gluck was proud—but he was also tired and he could not drive the morbid thoughts from his mind.
He pondered over these struggles of emotion in his heart as he adjusted his black bow-tie, with the slow deliberate movements characteristic of his race, then stepping back with an audible sigh he surveyed himself with the indifference of long practice, in the long gilt-framed mirror before him. Herr Director leaned a little closer to the mirror as he noticed the change that had come over his countenance. He sighed again as he tugged disconsolately at his little dutch mous-tach, then with a shrug of his shoulders and a forced lift of his eyebrows, he turned, picked up his ivory-inlaid baton and opened the door of his dressing room. There he paused and through a chink in the folds of the drapes across the corridor, he saw the semi-lighted pit where his orchestra awaited his appearance. Stepping over to the doorway, he drew the drapes slightly apart. The Opera House was packed; packed with the young and old aristocray of old Germany. White-haired old warriors, glistening in their evening attire; young German officers, fresh from their military training at Berlin, dashing, in their attentiveness to beautiful cultured women at their sides in the luxurious boxes. Up in the gallery were the struggling student poets, musicians, and clerks, with their quasi-senti-mental craving for immortal music, leaning forward in their cramped seats with an uncontrollable air of expectancy.
With a little twisted smile, Herr Von Gluck allowed himself to muse over the chagrin of the audience should he disappoint them and fail to appear. But, nothing in the wide world could ever permit him to disappoint his people. He turned his thoughts to the years ahead—the brilliant concerts—the honor—the glory of unquestionable fame and re
nown, and he smiled again, but the telltale marks of haunting visions were still on his face.
Quite suddenly there was a hush, as the huge dome light of the Opera House slowly dimmed and faded out. The lights of the music pit brightened simultaneously, flashing on the satin lapels of the orchestra members, and reflecting the rich rose-color of the damask hangings on the railings of the pit.
Herr Director Von Gluck stepped into the pit and gazed up at his audience with a courteous smile. The air of expectancy was finally released. He was greeted with deafening, enthusiastic applause. Then he bowed, turned, and with baton in hand he stepped on his director’s platform and raised his arms slowly.
The orchestra like a single instrument, softly commenced and swung into the vivid, aesthetically colorful strains of Shubert’s “Serenade.”
The audience lived from then on under a spell; partly from the heart-song of the immortal Shubert and partly from the irresistable swing of Herr Von Gluck’s directing. His movements were passionately rhythmatic; his baton was inspired; his eyes shone with a brightness seldom seen before. Shubert and Herr Von Gluck reigned supreme.
The famous composition was almost half through when the audience became aware of an odd laxity on the part of the orchestra’s director, Herr Von Gluck. His movements were slower; his baton was aimlessly uncertain as he mechanically waved it to and fro. His contenance had turned deathly pale, but his eyes,—the eyes of the director were like stars. He was not looking at his orchestra nor was he looking at his audience, but seemed to be gazing through interminable mist, trying to fathom some unattainable secret of the heavens. Then slowly a strange peace seemed to settle over his tired features; a look of resignation, almost a smile, overspread his face.
Suddenly, as if Herr Director remembered, he brought down his baton, a signal for the orchestra to cease playing —unheard of, in the very middle of a masterpiece. The audience leaned forward in their seats. Someone in the gallery tittered.
The director murmured something to his orchestra and again resumed his interrupted rhythm and immediately the music came forth in the form of a funeral march. The audience was aghast; all eyes were centered on Herr Von Gluck who seemed imbibed with the somber, slow-moving notes of the death march as he coaxed forth melancholly chords from the instruments of the perplexed orchestra.
Some person among the assembly was audibly sobbing.
The march was drawing to a close. All Germany would echo with this strange occurence on the morrow.
Herr Von Gluck raised his baton for the last, sad, lingering note, turned half toward the audience and with a smile —but Herr Director, your baton—. The baton had clattered sacriligiously to the floor as the last shred of note died away. With an incoherent murmur, the director' crumpled, and slid to the floor, his falling body shattering the fallen baton which leaned against the platform.	'
A woman screamed. The orchestra sat goggle-eyed in pathetic consternation.
* * * *
“Quite dead,” pronounced the tall doctor in evening clothes, as he straightened up from the prostrate form of the director, “Quite Dead.”

Idle Thoughts of An Idle Fellow
JOHN L. NANOVIC
AS the title suggests, “Idle Thoughts of An Idle Fellow” is a collection of essays on a variety of such non-essential topics as love, weather, cats and dogs, . babies, eating, drinking, furnished apartments, dress, memory, blues, vanities, shyness, idleness, being “hard up,” and getting on in the world. Though each essay is unrelated to the rest of the selections, all have in common the philosophy of an “idle fellow,” a man who sees all things although he himself does nothing, and admits that he does notliing, or as little of it as he possibly can do.
For particular characteristics of the writer, it is not necessary to look far. Most of the essays begin in an intersting, and even appealing, way. The essay “On Being in Love” starts.
“You’ve been in love, of course!”
That is a very familiar opening; something like a slap on the shoulder when a fellow comes up from behind and says “Hello!” Equally familiar is the beginning of “On Getting On In the World,” which starts with,
“Not exactly the sort of thing for an idle fellow7 to think about, is it?”
The sentence has a personal touch which makes you feel as if the author had lived with you and been your chum for a long time.
“Oh, yes, I do—I know a lot about ’em” is the way he starts the essay on babies, using the title as really a part of the sentence, as it were, and also keeping that important personal element.
This air of familiarity is continued throughout the essays. It seems that you are not reading, but listening to a friend as you chat before the fire. There is none of the formality and dignity that you expect in most essays. The dash, that handy little mark that saves much time for many a writer, is his good friend. An instance:
“. . . met a man and broke Jiis head—the other man’s head, I mean—then that proved that his ' —the first fellow’s—girl was a pretty girl.”
He goes on explaining this in detail, as you would in a conversation, and only succeeds in becoming more entangled, finally giving up like this:
“the first fellow who—well, if he broke his head, then his girl—not the other fellow’s but the fellow who was the------ Look here, if A broke -B’s head. . . .”
Or, in “On Eating and Drinking,” he goes into reminiscing about an old friend in a most serious and sentimental tone, and suddenly shows you the real reason by a brief sentence,
“He owes me 14 shillings, too.”
This tone of the essay is further enhanced by his sudden
changes from seriousness to levity, as the illustration just mentioned shows. Just at the time when a passage may tend to grow dull from overweight of matter, he inserts a sprite statement, an aside that causes a smile and at the same time bears upon the subject. Abundant examples— whole lines of them—bring the essays closer to the appropriate level where they will be enjoyed by most readers, Instead of saying that a thing was like a snow bank, he will say it was like a snow bank, or a pile of sand, or a dense bush, or— and so on for about six or seven times, so that no matter how unfamiliar you are with many things, he is almost certain to bring up one that is familiar.'
There is also about his essays a peculiar rambling style. He writes on cats and dogs, and yet, in the essay he uses about one fifth of the space to talk about rats, and the Pied Piper of Hamelin, and the faces of little children. About a fourth of “On Furnished Apartments” is given to a tender memory of a screen which his mother’s hands had made, and upon which he built a dream of the courtship of his fathei* and mother. Only occasionally does he go so far off the subject that it seems impossible to get back to it without a sharp break, and here his familiar style proves its worth in that it is possible for him to say,
“But to get back to the subject, after rambling away so far ...”
and you feel that you have been given a treasured glimpse into another field without being led off the main road. Many of his ramblings merely make the essay a bit more interesting, and are used as “relief material” to make you ready for something more important.
Narration is very prominent in most of his essay. “On Furnished Apartments’” opens with narration. Many others —in fact, almost every one of them—have narration in some part or other. This, too, serves to make the essay more familiar in its tone, and more readable.
Although most of his essays are on light subjects, and treated in a light manner Jerome often drifts into a serious mood, and becomes as noble in his language as he is familiar. His essay “On Babies” shows this most aptly. It reads:
“God speed you! We would stay and take your little hands in ours, but the murmur of the great sea is in our ears, and'we may not linger. We must hasten down, for the shadowy ships are waiting to spread their sable sails.”
Jerome’s essays undoubtedly belong to that class of writing which, though it appears light and trivial, is really serious and important. Upon such small topics as he chooses, he places thought and beauty to create a deep appreciation of a lot of the smaller things which man usually overlooks. The style has a smoothness and a friendliness that is hard to resist—that kind of style that you like to read when you’ve planned for weeks to spend a day in some lovely glen, and the day comes after long waiting; but it’s raining!

Rain Halts Indiana-Notre Dame Game In Tenth
Teams Battle to a 5-5 Tie In An Erratic Game
With one Hoosier clown in the opening half of the tenth inning of the Indiana-Notre Dame game played on Cartier Field last Tuesday, April 30, Umpire Con Daly decided that
CORNELIUS J. CAREY
Junior Athletic Manager
the players had had enough and waved them to drag theii- muddy spikes to the showerrooms. This timely verdict met with the approval of the few scattered spectators who had remained through incessant thunder showers to witness the finish of the struggle.
Coach Mills selected Oskar Rust to do the pitching foi* the home team, but the inclement weather evidently did
not agree with the southerner. Although he went the entire nine innings and at times twirled excellent ball, he was not up to his usual standard and was knicked for thirteen hits by the visiting batsmen. But it was the loose support given him by his teammates that accounted for most of Indiana’s runs. Indeed,
only Rust’s ability to keep his opponents’ hits well scattered saved the day for the Blue and Gold.
The only redeeming feature of the game, as far as Notre Dame was concerned, was the sixth inning when the Blue and Gold players acquired three runs. Feehery laced out a double to center and then scored on an error and a wild pitch by Paugh. Bray followed with another double and added to Paugh’s embarassment by stealing third, scoring on an infield out. Finally, Griffin reached second on an error and was driven home by Lordi’s single.
The contest resolved itself, for the most part, into a comedy of errors, with both teams employing all known means of losing the game. In the seventh frame, with two out, Col-rick dropped O’Keefe’s easy throw to first, permitting Harrell and Hickey to cross the plate. In all, six errors were chalked up for both teams by a very broadminded scorekeeper.
Rust got off on the wrong foot in the opening inning when his wildness permitted the bases to be filled, and then his third straight base on balls forced home the first run for the visitors. But Notre Dame came back strongly in the next frame with a pair of tallies. McCleary and Griffin singled and were scored on Rust’s long hit to right field.
Paugh, who started on the mound for Indiana, displayed symptoms of wildness and gave way to “Lefty” Bell in the fifth. Thereafter, Bell, with his slow-breaking curve ball, kept the Millsmen guessing. The best hitting of the day was
done by “Pooch” Harrell, Indiana’s third sacker and leading hitter of the Big Ten. Harrell accumulated four hits from his five trips to the plate. Joe Lordi’s defensive work was outstanding for Notre Dame. Box score:

RACQUETMEN TRIM DRAKE IN FIRST HOME MATCH, 4-1
Displaying a form far superior to that showed against Western State, the Notre Dame tennis squad overwhelmed the Drake racquet wielders last Tuesday on the home courts. Kain, which had been threatening all afternoon, broke up the final match of the afternoon but this was inconsequential as far as deciding the victor was concerned, for the Gold and Blue had already piled up a score of 4 to 1.
Bud Markey, Notre Dame net star, met defeat at the hands of Brady in a match replete with thrills. Brady took the opening set 6 to 2, but Markey opened up in the second with hard driving and excellent net play winning 6 to 4. Brady was forced to carry the third and deciding set to twelve games before he won, 7 to 5.
Buras, Griffin, and O’Brien also turned in more than average games to defeat their Bulldog opponents.
Scores:	-
SINGLES—Brady (Drake), defeated Markey (Notre Dame), 6-2; 4-6; 7-5. Griffin (Notre Dame), defeated Everett (Drake), 8-6; 6-1. Burns (Notre Dame), defeated Moorehead (Drake), 6-0; 6-4. O’Brien (Notre Dame), defeated Meelir (Drake), 6-2; 6-3.
DOUBLES—Bums and O’Brien (Notre Dame), defeated Moorehead and Meelir (Drake), 6-3; 6-2.
NOTRE DAME LOSES TENNIS OPENER TO WESTERN STATE, 6-1
The Notre Dame racquet squad dropped their opening match of the season last Saturday to the Western State Teachers College tennis team on the Kalamazoo courts. The Hilltoppers displayed professional form in all of their games winning all of the doubles and all but one of the singles. The final score was 6 to 1.
The one feature of the afternoon as far as Notre Dame was concerned was John O’Brien’s victory over Householder in straight sets, 8 to 6, 6 to 3. O’Brien was in brilliant form and managed to keep his opponent continually on the defensive with his hard and well placed drives. Bud Markey, number one man of Notre Dame, extended his match against Warren Byrum to three sets as did Burns, Kane, and Griffin, the other Gold and Blue players. Scores: .
SINGLES— Byrum (Western State), defeated Markey (Notre Dame), 6-2; 4-6;. 6-3. Beller* (Western State), defeated Burns (Notre Dame), 3-6; 6-2; 6-1. Bradford (Western State), defeated Kane (Notre Dame), 6-4;l-6; 6-2. Lesis (Western State), defeated Griffin (Notre Dame), 4-6; 6-4; 6-3. O’Brien (Notre Dame), defeated Householder (Western State), 8-6; 6-3.
DOUBLES—Beller-Lewis (Western State), defeated Markey Griffin (Notre Dame), 6-4; 6-2. Bryan-Householder (Western State), defeated Burns-O’Brien (Notre Dame, 6-1; 6-2.

RAIN FORCES POSTPONEMENT OF MANY INTERHALL BASEBALL CONTESTS
Veritable washouts during the past week caused the postponement of several of the major and minor league games. A few teams in each of the leagues braved the rain and completed their regularly scheduled contests.
Morrissey and Sophomore are still deadlocked for the leading position in the major league with four' wins and no losses apiece. They have both been going at a rapid pace and this tie should be broken when the teams meet on May 12. All prospects show that it will be one of the feature games of the interhall baseball seasons.
Corby retained its sole leadership in the minor league, although it lost its game to Carroll, 16 to 6. Carroll by virtue of its victory crept up to a three-way tie with Sophomore and Brownson halls for second place. Each team has three wins and one loss to its credit. Corby now holds first place by a scant margin, winning four games and losing one.
All of the postponed games will be played off at some time in the near future. Arrangements are now being made •for the scheduling of these playoffs. Coaches and teams are asked to watch the official announcements for time of the games.
Results of games played:
Thursday, April 25—MAJORS—Carroll 6, Corby 4; Sorin 11, Badin 1; Morrissey 7, Brownson 6; Freshman 7, Walsh 4.-..

.. BRACEY DEFEATS ELDER IN CENTURY AT DRAKE RELAYS
Representatives of Notre Dame’s track team traveled in several directions last week-end. Captain Jack Elder, sprint » star, and a relay team composed of football lettermen went to Des Moines, Iowa, for the annual Drake Relays, while the foui- mile relay team journeyed in the opposite direction to the Penn Relays.
Elder gave an exceptional performance in the 100 yd. dash finishing a close second to Claude Bracey of Rice Institute, an outstanding speed merchant. The event was run • in a downpour of rain on a water filled track, which made Bracey’s time of :09 8-10 the more remarkable to a small ■ lead at the outset which Elder could not quite overcome, j The special 440 yd. relay for football lettermen was won I by the Anny team composed of Murrell, Sprague, Messin' ger, and Hall. The Notre Dame representatives who finished third were Elder, O’Brien, Mullins, and Brady. Ne-• braska took second.
At the Penn Relays the four mile team made up of W. Brown, J. Brown, Morgan, and Brennan, handicapped to a certain extent by the previous illness of two of the quartet, _ was relegated to sixth position. The event was won by Penn i State out of a field of twenty entries.

ST. EDWARD’S STAR APPOINTED TO U. S.
MILITARY ACADEMY
Tom Kilday, star fullback of last fall’s St. Edward's Uni, versity football team, received word last week from Con' gressman James P. Buchanan that the Texas representative has nominated him to be a cadet at the United States Mili-’ tary academy at West Point.
Kilday, who is a candidate for an A.B. degree from St. Edward’s in June, expects to report to West Point on July 1. His friends believe that he has an excellent chance to make the Army grid team before he gains his commission.
' During the past four seasons, Kilday has been a dependable fullback, and last year his work was of such rank that Frank Bridges chose him as fullback on the all-Texas con-l ference team that played the Southwestern conference team ’ in Fort Worth on Dec. 29.
' Kilday is known as a strong line plunger and an unusual-p ly good blocker and defensive player. He is also a letter I man in baseball.

This afternoon the Irish diamond squad crosses bats with Iowa U. at Iowa City in an effort to obtain “sweet revenge” for the 13 to 7 defeat suffered here at the hands of the Hawkeyes. Tomorrow afternoon they will be seen in action at Des Moines, opposing Drake . Oskar Rust was slated to hurl one of the games with either “Tank” Donohue or “Lefty” Lisicki working in the other battle.
* * * *
The two little men of the Irish nine form a strong keystone combination. Joe Palermo and Bill McCleary figure in some snappy plays out around second base. Together with Captain John Colrick they have executed seven fast double plays to date. Colrick has also participated in two other double plays originating at the mound and in Ed Feehery’s right field.
4:	4:	4:	4*	__
When the Kalamazoo Teachers forced over a lone run in that freak ninth inning out at Cartier last week, they broke a string of fifteen consecutive scoreless innings Oskar Rust had pitched in his first two home games. In addition, ten of the fifteen were hitless as well, and in only one inning . was more than one base knock obtained from the Arkansan’s delivery.
* * * *
Withe the exception of Feehery’s triples and Rust's lone homer, the home games so far haven’t provided much excitement for the lovers of hard hitting. But in the Southland Captain Colrick and Joe Palermo both connected for two home runs, while Jim Bray and “Lefty” Moran each hit for the circuit once.

After the return next Sunday from the three game trip, a week of rest and practice will be in store for the team until Friday, May 10, when they will take a short trip to East Lansing to meet Michigan State, returning in time to play Noi-thwestern here on Saturday. ♦ * * *
Not that it pertains to Notre Dame exactly, but a headline like this is undoubtedly news—“Holy Cross Defeated on Diamond”—and the Tiger of Princeton turned the trick.
* * * *
A pair of three-baggers by Ed Feehery proved the hittinggems of the day during the Indiana game.

After Oskar Rust had poled a long drive to right field and circled the bases before it was returned, Paugh, the pitcher was sent to right field and southpaw Bell took his place on the mound.

SPLINTERS FROM THE PRESS BOX
the classic time of 9 3-5 will go by the board sometime in the near future.
It seems as though the impossible is about to be achieved. Seldom has any array of sprinters in the history of athletics launched such a terrific attack upon a record as has this year’s crop of sprinters on the 100-yard dash mark. Should Simpson, Bracey, Elder and Williams meet in the final at the Ohio State Relays tomorrow on a fast track it is highly probable that the time of 9 2-5 will be attained. A couple of years ago sports writers laughed the idea to scorn, but now it would be hard to find one who would not agree that
If Borah and Wyckoff were to be added to the finalists mentioned above we can think of several things we would rather be than a judge at that particular race.
The crews of Columbia, Yale and Pennsylvania meet tomorrow tor the Blackwell trophy, won by Yale for the last three years. While Columbia looks the strongest on paper, they are not overwhelming favorites to win, as a Columbia crew has not beaten a Yale crew since 1922, and this will be quite a mental hazard to overcome.

They include ALL-BRAN, Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies, Krumbles and Kellogg's Shredded Whole Wheat Biscuit. Also Kaffee Hag Coffee *—the coffee that lets you sleep.
Kellogg’s Pep Bran Flakes will pass the most critical taste. That famous flavor of PEP plus extra crispness set a new standard in bran flake goodness.
Eat them daily and see how much more pep you have for college activities. You get the nourishing elements of the wheat. Just enough bran to be mildly laxative. Ask for them to be served at your fraternity house or campus restaurant.

“Kentucky” Oberst’s Penn Relay record for the javelin throw went by the board Saturday when Dave Meyers, dusky N. Y. U. star, threw the steel-tipped spear 196 feet, 3% inches. Meyers is about the only really good javelin thrower who throws left-handed.
Still the records fall. Herman Brix, former University of Washington weight star, now competing for the Los An
geles A. C., broke the national intercollegiate shot-put record at the West Coast relays last Saturday with a heave of 51 feet, 11% inches.

There are more college graduates in the major leagues this year than ever before. Evidently there are more ways of a college student preparing to meet the world than merely that of completing a curriculum.

Gentlemen:
Just a line to let you know where some of your tobacco has been going for the last ten years. •
I have been smoking Edgeworth for the past ten years; in fact, since I started smoking, and it ij just as good now as it was then. Have given other brands a fair trial, but there is none like Edgeworth. During that time I have had costly pipes and some not so costly, but I have decided that it is not the pipe but what is in it that counts.
With best wishes for your continued success in the manufacture of this high grade tobacco, I am,
Sincerely,
(Signed) N. A. Vaeth

ELECTRICITY—
the modern prospector
You will find this monogram on powerful motors that drive heavy mining machinery and on tiny motors that drive sewing machines. Both in industry and in the home it is the mark of an organization that is dedicated to electrical progress.
A STOUT heart; a burro laden with pick, shovel, and the bare necessities of life; and the prospector was ready for the gold rush—Sutter’s Mill, the Pike’s Peak country, Cripple Creek, Klondyke. A scattered trail of half-worked claims marked his sacrifices.
To-day mining is a business, with electricity replacing wasteful brawn in mine and mill.
The deep mine, with electric lights, hoists, and locomotives; the surface mine with huge electric shovels scooping up tons of ore in a single bite; the concentrating mill with its batteries of electrically driven machines; the steel mill with its constant electric heat—here are but a few of electricity’s contributions to the mineral industries.
So in every industry, electricity increases production and cuts costs. It is the modem prospector, leading the way into wider fields and tapping undeveloped resources—that we may enjoy a finer civilization and a richer, fuller life.

With a cigarette as good as Camels the simple truth is enough
Camel
WHY CAMELS ARE THEBETTER CIGARETTE
Camels are made of the choicest tobaccos grown—cured and blended with expert care.
Camels are mild and mellow.
The taste of Camels is smooth and satisfying.
Camels are cool and refreshing.
The fragrance of Camels is always pleasant, indoors or out.
They do not tire the taste nor leave any cigaretty after-taste.
