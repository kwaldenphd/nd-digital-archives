Perspective 
. Like anyone. else who is about to leave a place after .four years of both rewarding and frustrating in­volvement, I wanted to write this article so that;I could have my final say. Somehow, I feel that the prob-. lems, struggles and successes I. have experienced. in connection with. de-_ veloping a women's tennis team at Notre Dame are barely realized :or understood by my.: fellow students. I am asking that you read my state-. ment, not for my sake, but for the. cause -of the friends and dedicated teammates in tennis _and all_ of the other women's athletic. activities.· They are the ones who are going to suffer the pains and receive the sat­isfactions of further development of our teams. of Notre Dame, as we challenge _this University to make a complete commitment to coeduca­tion and to provide equitable oppor­tunity for its women students in all areas.

on any level, . except through male­dominated physical education classes: Gradually,' with ·. much _.· effort and persistence by the Notre Dame ·worn-. eri students,·. and with the help of coaches, -the athletic departments and faculty, interhall and intercol­legiate activities were developed' in 
a . number of sports. The initiative was usually taken _on the .part of women who demonstrated talents and interest in ·particular sports, Oftentimes there were frustrations and problems concerning lack of funds, competition _with already existing · male teams for.·facilities, inadequate coaching and unfortunate misunderstandings .with male _admin­istrators, coaches and students. 
Happily, the Notre Dame Women's Tennis Club was one of the first groups that was able to get organ­
ized. ·Jane Lammers and. I spent . numerous hours _organizing a team 
in 1973-74. Dr. Carol~ Moore enthu­· · siastically · undertook the• res.ponsi­bility of guiding the new and penni­. less team, and we played ,a busy spring . schedule of • intercollegiate 
matches. I will. not enumerate the 
vital ways, but the conflicts -begin .. problems we encountered (getting

have given us. Working through this organization, the Women's Ten­nis Club had a financial base with which to .. operate, some University _nize_ and aid an official women's ath-.. 
letic program. . We petitioned for.club status, and 
gained it, as did three other women's 
groups, in the faHof 1974. Basically, recognition and some leverage with which to arrange court . time with the men's team._ 

Many of the problems we . en­countered during 1974-75,. however, could not be solved by the Club Sports office. The.. women . and coaches of the team were w~rking for the best feasible intercollegiate program, · and club status did not 

· fulfill all of our. needs .. We had -to put hours of extra work into spon-. · soring a. movie. and. working . at 
Mardi Gras in order. to make enough money for travel arid . tennis balls. (The women still spend a good deal of their own money. in order to play in the club.) We had inadequate coaching for. 14 players, because we could-not pay anyone to give. us spe-; cial attention. We, had difficulties obtaining the varsity tE:nnis courts for.· meets,· and found constant· resis~ tance when using the outdoor courts for regular practice. When we_ ·had practice. hours: in the ACC, we often were•·usurped by volleyball,. baseball and track groups; and' . we . usually were entitled to only one-haif of. the lights >in .the .

These are some of the frustrations that led us to cali for a -meeting with the athletic administrators last spring. We believed that we had demonstrated real enthusiasm and

It was made clear. at. the meeting that : the University .• had . not the funds or the desire ·to promote any women's club to varsity level ·for 1975. Our problems of facilities, funds and·lack of cooperation were discussed,·and we were told that one more year of, club development would allow time for the athletic department t9 help us work .out such difficulties, ·and, for ·us to prepare further for -~Varsity consideration this · year. I was encouraged by the interest of the administrators at the meeting, and my club started this year enthusiastically. . ·, A' large turnout at tryouts, : daily practice and lots of spirit and talent led to a 5~2 fall season record; · We were gaining:more support, had been careful .with . our funds . and were gract'ually working out scheduling and c:,ourt conflicts with Dr. · Fallon, the 'coach of the men's team. · We lo*ed· forward; to a winter and spring of-practice,· fund-raising, suc­cessful compethion and likely ;pros motion to varsity . status. , . .'' Somehow, this optimism is fadin'g as! look forward to afinal semester with a· wonderful group of players and coaches. I see that the Tennis Club is faced with many unfortunate problems cif 'communication that we should no( have to overcome again: The resistance we face from, admin­istrators who 'are concerned about funds and facilities has been · com­pounded by' the position 'that has been taken by the new· office for the

The University of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College are taking their place amidst the fanfare and philosophy by hosting a Bicentennial Festival from March 7 -11. Central to the five-day festival, entitled "An Almost Chosen People: The Moral Aspirations · of Americans," is an academic conference which will fea­ture· eight scholarly papers aimed at an analysis of America's moral heri­tage: · 
In this · 200th anniversary of the begfoning of America;· one cannot ignore the feeling that the public is being "bicentennialized" to death. Com_mercial enterprise · has swiftly 
capitalized on the affair and con­tinues to turn out mass productions of vulgar gimmicks in the name of patriotism. Red, white and blue paint is in low supply and, as one student suggested, .· "Even the. gas rate is going up' to 76¢_ to commemo­rate the · Bicentennial."· · Here at Notre Dame we have had our share cif activities celebrating the national event. From Mardi' Gras to· special menus in the dining hall we have

been around the flag so mtich recent­_ly that we are beginning to see stars. 
Of course, this year'it-is just as

Some citizens are ·usirig the Bicen­tennial as an. opportunity :to::expe­rience, . firsthand, .· the historic sites of America. When.:asked how she was going to celebrate,1976, Mary, a maid on' campus, answered, "I'm going to.'go to Washington, D.C.!" She plaris . to take in all-the sight­seer's.delights.in-the naUon's,capital and is eager fo see the monuments, especially"that great big high one.'' 
·For those who prefer to avoid the rush to the historic cities of the East this ···.year, -· · ·many•-communities throughout -the nation are •finding ways,: to: celebrate ·the Bicentennial in their own, specific localities: The South Bend community; led by Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, is sponsor­ing. the· BicenteriniaL Festival this week for· such: a ·purpose. 
· Dr. Thomas Bergin,-serving as·co~ chairman, of. the: festival· with•'Dr: Weber, described the: conference· as ''an appropriate one for a university· like Notre Dame/' Dr. Berghi rioted ­the: excellent' array:of:speakers high.: lighting>the week· but stated that "rather' than just• ari academic • con­ference we wanted also•to appeal-to the public through arts' and culture. So,, for , those·• not ! interested ·in all the philosophi~al•aspects of our:.his­fory_•there might be··an interest.in the: liturgy;. or:theater; ·or poetry of the conference; ·It is a tremendous opportunity -to·• bring 'together those aspects ·ofcomrimnity arid academics· which touch ·on the cultural and the· artistic as welh1s the phiiosophical.'' 

.The approach taken by the aca­demic· conference is to be an inquiry into the inner as well as the outer history of.'the United States;·'. The title · of :the festival,·· "An' Almost Chosen. People," is a phrase· from a speech of President · Lincoln which' expresses the ambiguous nature of our moral development ·as a nation. Referriiig to the ethicar:a:ngle that has been designated· for the:confer~ eilce/ Dr; Weber says, "It is ·a• wayof really penetrating' at' a deep'-level the• American ·experiencef If •is ~ an appropriate' theme today after· the· experiences of "Vietnam and 'Water­gate _:_ we-may have some doubts about -· ourselves' as. a virtuous· people.'' 
. ' Senior Au.gie Grace ·• who, along with . Art Derse is acting .as ' the Notre, Dame student chainnijn ·for the· Bicentennial conference,· senses the need for· critical' evaluation·-of ourselves as a n·atiori arid proposes that this.is the chief purpose of the t_alks ::throughout the.,\Veek. : Grace points out that,·-"The Bicentennial as a nationwide ·affair is affecting us all in'one form· or another. Community·. involvement has beeri mainly in the form ,·a{ · parades. As an.' academic community. it is; more -important; to look at the'-Bicentennial•in an aca­
:9 demic light with some serious think-, · 

ing about where our country is 
going." 

The conference this week repre­sents a conscious attempt to step out of the streain of commercialism and use the Bicentennial as an occasion for reflection about America -past, present and future. The formal.lee.:: tures balanced by artistic presen-. tations in music, art, and theater offer a variety of opportunities for ·· ·· participation within the context of the festival. 
The festival will open· Sunday afternoon at the Athletic and Con­vocation Center. The ceremonies will. include performances by the Notre Dame Band, Orchestra and Jazz En­semble. Senator William Proxmire

Michael Feord is an undergraduate at Notre Danie, who claims that he has done nothing noteworthy nor interesting. . ­
The curtain rises and reveals a park berich set on a gravel path that winds from upstage left to down­stage center and then to upstage right: At downstage center it .• widens out· into a circular are~· where the bench is' located. Around. the path isgrass which mightwell be represented bya green1dropcloth. At thesides and alorigthe back of the' stage there might be some one­dimensional representations. of ..• shrubs, green and in fuli' bloo~.. At upstage right there should be a three-dimensional tree like. that· used 1 in Waiting for Godot." 
Enter Samuel Beckett; an 'old . man; 'tall and lean·; he's wearing a turtleneck sweater under a: tweed sports coat, ·and walks with the aid of:a 'shillelagh. He enters along the path upstage left,· cuts across the· grass to the barren tree.' He has·a tired look on his face, he breaks off a small twig, and, after contemplat­ing it 'tor a few moments, he tosses it over his shoulder and walks. down the path to the bench. He sits heavily,-,leans back and.stares out 

;. into space. Two old, :distinguished-looking gentlemen,; w~aring long, black over­coats,: shiny' black shoes, new bowler hats, and carrying black, silver-tipped walking sticks enter from upstage -left.

The first gentleman, Estragon, . and the second, Vladimir, walk along the path and sit on either side of Beckett. He doesn't notice them.

ESTRAGON: (accusingly) Why do you say that? What are you getting at? . 
VLADIMIR: Nothing, I was just wondering; · · 
ESTRAGON: Well, where's the·_ sense in that? How do you know that he even sees that tree? He doesn't see . us; 
· VLADIMIR: You needn't get so .. upset. I.was just thinking about old times. 
ESTRAGON: Who needs them? Do you-want to go back to that empty place and wear those shabby clothes again? •, · • 
VLADIMIR: No, it's just that we're still here-and that tree's still here, so he must be meaning to do something with all of us.

I think Kubrick began working with this emphasis on the visual in A Clockwork Orange, but in Barry Lyndon he l,las truly given · the import of the film over .to its visual communication. My reason forthinking Kubrick is doing some­thing important and innovative ­and. that he is fully aware of what· he is doing -:-is ·my feeling ·that there is · something· ·very strange going on here. The film.haunts_you, and an examination of the plot and..· · 

dialogue holds no hint why you should be disturbed by it. ' 
Ithink thatapossible e~planation -· is that Kubrick is actually -opposing· dialogue and plot with. the visual. · Especially. in ·the first·• half. of the film, Kubrick's close-ups of facial expressions say something visually that is .not totally congruent with what is being ·said cir going 6n in the scene. The most vivid example· is a confrontation between Barry arid·an English officer when the' two meri find out'_they are both invoived with the ·same woman. The·.situation is 
Barry Lyndon (Ryan O'Ne_il) and Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) 
important and rather· trauma.tic for the: characters ·as far· as· their dia­logue· and the piot woiild lead you to' believe, but the officer's facial expressions caused me to find the scene e~treinely humorous. ' · 
. This :happened.again and again in' the ·course of the film, and each time I:felt• i.ui'comfortable in finding it funny. Kubrick_ seems to be de-· termined ,to ·show the audience his power, over tis through the purely visu~l; . then,·, once he· has warned us' of this strange visual influence; he. abandons-th~e ;·in.or~ . accessible' denio'i1strationsi· The discrepancy is: still'there, however, as in the deaih scerie of Barry's son, Brian. There is something disturbing. here, ·and per­haps it, too; is founded in the incori-' gruity between the rather trite dia'... logue and the visual message Ku­brick gives us; 
Kubrick has said, "The most im:..

Lent has been repressed .in mod­
ern-times. 
That sounds like a· strange way to say . Lent .has almost disappeared froin our culture..We have decided that there ·is no need to set aside a speciaHime for whatever constitutes Lent. : No logic can . explain.: such practices as . fasting, repentance, withdrawal, deprivation and what appears as self-torture, especially in 
a. society where we can, easily meet our own needs. Why make ourselves struggle and suffer?· Life passes. all too quickly and we face:enough suf-. fering; Lent wastes our time when we could be really living; 
But why· is Lent repressed? Why 
don't I• just say :that Lent has na-,· 
turally disappeared in a society that 
no longer sees a need for it? Mod­
ern man needs Lent more than ever; 
we don't understand the great wis-. 
dom, oLLent and its ·psychological 
necessity. The great problem is that 
we don't see, and we don't see a need 
for Lent. But if .Lent --,-: the great· 
preparation for Easter_:-:-disappears, 
then Easter .disappears. The central 
mystery of Christianity,. no longer 
has enough value to, be preceded by 
a time of preparation. 
· What is the psychological neces­
sity of Lent and· why does modern 
man need Lent? The fact that life 
passes very quickly and that we de­
sire. to live fully in that time may.be· 
the most profound reason for a peri~. 
od of time, such as Lent._ Man needs 
a pause.: Man needs to stop, break 
with -his-habits .and customs and 
compulsions and ask where , he is 
going. We all need to stand back and 
cut ourselves loose from. the oppres­
sions of society and our own life 
structures in order to view them 
with an evaluating eye. 
· In order to live, man must at least

·.. by Tom Lischwe 
have some illogical, .unspoken idea 
of what living is for and in what 
direction he wants his life to go. 
Man needs: some , goal in order to· 
have direction to his life.. Once he 
knows where he is going· and what 
life is for, he can see more clearly 
what helps him get there and what 
hinders him. , When we are locked 
within the daily patterns and 
routines, we· have no chance to see 
beyond them.. , We drift along, un­
bothered by the need to evaluate, the 
effort and pain · of · searching, .the 
anxiety -,of . living ,with uncertain 
answers;:,· 

. Society, . the "system;'' . provides­
ready-made answers. It sees man in:· confusion over the _infinite number of possibilities ·in life and, it offers an answer: a. hopeful belief that science, money and· goods will bring success and comfort.·, The -whole of society_ is .a type of "religion" that offers conclusions to our_ life prob­lems. But its demands are high: cone formity, work and, finally, a dulling of sensibilities. It may .bring peace of mind but.the price is, mental and spiritual slavery _;_ to Wall Street, Washington, Rome, . the,, provost,· alcohol,· teachers, :rectors :or one's self. Man, turns over his feelings and thinking to them, and they take care of e~erything. Life happens to him. . There . seems to_ be.. another ap­proach: Man can strikeout in search for. his own vision. We can strive to reconne_ct . ourselves to the. rhythms of life. We can critically· evaluate the limiting effects which our habits_ and training have had on our range of· choices .• Man cannot do this_ in 10 m!nutes or a couple of hours or even a couple of. days. He needs time to fii:td freedom fro!Il his habits and acknowledge his }imitations. Man · must renew and reevaluate. his situ­ation_ continually.. We all need to rec.enter and -put ourselves in touch 
with new life. . . . . 
Thus, the wisdom of Lent: 40 days 
every year to stand back and re­
orient our lives. Modern man, who 
has become trapped in complex rou­
. The wisdom of Lent · goes deeper than simply setting _aside i time to pause; it gives basic guidelines for · freeing ourselves from our habits~ Lent is a time_ to become sensitive to ourbasic _instincts: hunger, sex, fight; flight and_ many others.

The Observer: 
A View from the Inside 
(The following is an interview with Tom O'Neil, the editor-elect for The Observer. The interview was taken · on February 28 by Sue Grace, John Phelan' and J. Robert Baker.) · 
Scholastic: What is the purpose and/or function of a 
daily newspaper here at Notre Dame? 
O'Neil: The ObserL'er serves as a• form.of communi­
cation between the administration of the University 
and the student body ·and as a form of communication 
between the student body members. As I was saying·. 
the other· day, 50% of our responsibility is to com­
municate meetings, assemblies, lectures and s·uch. Our 
other 50% of the. _responsibility is to enlighten as far 
as the contemporary issues on campus, giving them 
background and giving them evaluative material. 
Scholastic: So ·you're saying The Observer is depen­
dent on other sources and has no purpose in and of it­
self. Why then a daily newspaper? . 
O'Neil: Because we feel the University is large. We· 
believe there is enough happening on campus to record, 
to relate and to 'pass on, that the paper should exist. 
Scholastic: An obvious part of communication is opin­
ion, so is The Observer here to_ change· student opinion 
or should it reflect stude.r:it opi~ion? 
O'Neil: Like mosf·newspapers, The Observer will first 
of all illuminate an issue that would otherwise go un­
noticed or go withotit the prope_r amount of illumi-­· nation. We will do that and then we' will examine the issue ourselves, believing, as we do, that we have as 
. many of the facts as can· be accumulated. · And we be­
lieve that having that,_our judgments will.be superior 
to those of the .average student; insofar as we have.­
more information than they do. Our decisions are iiot ­
necessarily always passed on_ as being superior. to 
others. They are passed on as being The Observer's 
opinion. 
: Scholastic: Are those opinions generally accepted by the student body? · 
O'Neil: The ~pinions-themselvesare eval~ated by the student body. It goes one step·further in.the sense that we have not picked one SBP-candidate since 1971 when -.. Marquette was elected. We have endorsed other can-. didates, but they have not been elected. ­
22 

Scholastic: ·Should. The Observer reflect the student 
opini~n ·also? 

O'Neil: It should reflect their opinions; That's one. of the changes it will be undergoing tl1is year. We have a group .of superlative reporters· and senior staff re­' porters, and. we are beginning a system of polling in. all the halls. An informal polling in which we would poll, ·. hopefully, at least 400 students. And within 24 hours of a certain issue being presented by: The Observer, the stud_ents' opinions can be reflected in the poll.. The poll 
· would be presented in an Observer insight: 
. . . 

Scholastic: ·Obviously, The Observer's ~pinion is re­flected on the editorial page. Do you think you shape , opinion by the stories you select or by the type ofnews: 
•-that_ you emphasize? . . . -. 
-O'.Neil: That's journalistically inevitable. There are no newspapers -that can .be as philosophically objective as they. hope to be or even a~ they prefend to. be. The Observer strive~ for objectivity:-We are limited by the' number of pages and the amount of' copy we· can run.· -Therefore, we cut the size of stories to ruri'more stories. For insta.nce, in .the last SBP election, there was an instance where the _three platforms presented_ by the candidates . themselves were run with_ different size headlines. As it turned out, the headline which accom­panied the. article on Gassnia.n-was larger than the .other headlines. That's something we try to pay care­ful attention to, and that :has·a ·fot to do with what you're saying. On the news·pages ·we can accidentally 
_legislate opinion. . ­
·• Scholastic: .Even more than accidentally, do you ·have an overriding philosophy ·on _what stories you print?_ 
,_ •·.. , '! . ' •.. _' -·· .-.• ' •· 
;O'Neil: Th~ priorities are ;et in the,eveni~g, usually · around ·7:00; by the news· editor or, ~s it will be next year, by the executive iiews editor. There is usually con-. sultation that·_goes on before the prioritie~ are set, and. it is ultimately :up to the ·night editor ·-how· the story. will . be presented-'-whether. it will . be boxed .o~,-given special emphasis. The news editor will th.ink 'in terms of the' newsworthiness or. the importance-of the story. The night editor will thinkprimarily in terms of design. ­Through thatprocess, it cari occur that we might overs . emphasize something we had no intention of empha­sizing so strongly. · · · · 
Scholastic: But there are things you'd rather _,run· 
first? -.. , 
:·. · SCHOLASTIC 


O'Neil: Right. In the past, The Observer has had the policy that it should run all SLC and all Faculty Senate stories on the first. page. That is no longer true with The Observer. :If the SLC meeting.does not merit front page attention, then the story will.not get front page attention. Depending on what happens atthe meeting, we will decide.where the story will go;; • 
Scholastic: I think it's clear that there is always a lot ofconcern. about the issues on campus, and one of the purposes ·of a campus newspaper is to relate what's going on campus. But there is also a lot of concern about .the fact that this university is so isolated. M9st students don't have access to a daily national news7 paper. ·no you feel it is your duty ,to cover national news on an equal priority with campus events? . 
.. , " .,-· ·. . ' . -. 

O'Neil: Our -priorities are first being a N~tre 'name ne\vspaper/ We go with the World. B;iefs Box every day. ;It's a_traditionat_ The Observer that we will give s·maU summaries of naUonal events, things that are occ'urring:on' the, outside. And then, if·they wish to read more about: those particular events, they -can ,purchase a Soutli'B~n'd--Trffmne or a· Chicago Triaun·e. When we feel itis important that the students in general read it or _that they will all want to ·read'_a particular kind of news·'story,' 'we will go -with an'Associat~d Press'story. For . instance, -when Carter-. won the. New .Hampshire primary, we felt it -would be interest 'to everyone on campus. Therefore we ran a whole story-as opposed 
to0 :runnirig.just a news brief. -. -. . ' ­. ,. . : ; ·: . ~ . 
Scholasiic: 0 Maybe it' wouid be better to, ask, do. you see a lack ~{student interest•or concern about national affairs? 
O'Neil:' For the 'most' par't; l feel we are dealing ~ith an apathy, a'' political apathy among students about 
, -.. , . . .. , . ' 


national events: We do not try, to reflect that in our own -newspaper. We believe that every citizen has a responsibility to stay on top of whatever is occurring outside of the University. We do not think we are reflective of this apathy that we feel exists outside campus. But we do have, at the same time, a high priority for Notre·Daine news. 
Scholastic: What is The Observer's relationship to stu­dents? Is it to inform them? ·To entertain them? 
O'Neil: Every college newspaper must inform· and en­
tertain and enlighten. The distinction that is important 
to make is that The Observer is a college newspaper, 
and can eventually or occasionally be less professional, 
less rigid than an outside or national paper~. That dis­
tinction is very important to us in that {ne can ·enter­-tain and at the same time, we can, for tlie most· part, · be more: informative than most newspapers. · 
Scholastic: Perhaps better stated, when 'you talk of relations, are you apart from the students? _Are you_ friends? How cio Y,OU view the student body? ­
-. 

-O'Neil: We had calleffou~i~lves for a 'few yea~s an in­dependent stmlent_newspaper. The independent implied that we were free from the administration and the stu­dent implied, of course, that we were somehow a voice or sounding ground for the_ student body at Notre Dame. We are more carefully aligned to student opin­fon than to theadministration's,. although we have at times 'taken opposing views ~o things, in contrast to what the students fe~t. ·-. · · 
...• i. ; 

Scholastic: The .paper,. in its history,. seems to have had two dist.incttypes of _editor-in-chief: one being like John Abowd .·with a very dynamic, ·very strong_ person~ ality,. whose presence E~rvades all_ of the -paper and in fact, becomes the paper and· the paper becomes .that personality. You have other editors.who function basi­cally. a~ administrators, people ·who -coordinate .things, such as Tom Drape.. And then, the -section editors assume a great deal of responsibility and: influence, the section with their personalities. Where do you see yourself? 
O'Neil: -I don't want to.seem like a Communist, but there is a large number ofjuniors presently on the staff who know the paper very well and it wili' be a_ com­municative effort to run the paper _this year; My posi­tion, as I see it, is more administrative than legislative. For instance, I will not step in and override someone ·else's. opinion unless I would have an editorial board consensus ·behind me, among any of· the autonomous sections of the paper. There wili be more social accent among.the staff. One of the very few rewards for work­ing on The Observer is the social . reward, something which·has been neglected this year, I believe. So I will run the paper primarily_ with the consensus of many people, hopefully. 
Scholasti~: Th~ paper under people like Abowd and Lutkus had a strong sense of cohesion and it held to­gether, whereas; under people like Drape, it had dif­ferent sections going off on tangents, completely unre­lated; so when· you opened up the paper you had in effect, three, sometimes four, -different papers ev_ery day. , 
O'Neil: This semester Lbecame a part-time student and I believe it is advantageous for me to assume con­trol of all departments first and then redistribute the so-called. power among the varying staffs. Hopefully I can• serve as, in: one sense, a personality center for the paper and in a second sense, a professional center for th_e paper. : A lot of what you're saying is this: for years the paper was run by one person with a strong personality; last year it-_was run by _two people pri­marily. And there was ·no formal, no de jure recogni­tio~ that it ~wa_s run by two people. De facto, it was.. Next year, there will be de jure _recognition of many pe_ople operc1.ting. the paper. Honestly, I. can't say now if I will have an overly stro,ng influence, oil the paper itself. I am especially careful of being that way be,-­cause you can't start passing on your personal. biases in anewspaper:· For instance, even on a.national level; running Reagan stories. or.running.Carter stories..And that has happened over tlie years. In that insta~ce, I 
hope that I don'.t overstep, my boundaries.

Scholastic:What is The _Observer's·relation.to student government, presently· arid ~ncludirig ·any transitions that will come? . 
. --~ . . 
O'Neil: Widabel~d our relationship ·1:c/student go~~rn­mef!t as adversa_ry. We believe tha(Uis very impor~ tant because at the same time we serve as a service to students, we serve as a checkmate organization against. inefficiency in student government, against corruption iri student ·government; against general incompetence: · we· don't believe that· the incoming administration is incompetent We believe that they will prove to ·be· ~ri excellerif admiriistration.: We have to bE(careful at the same time· of being overly . coojierative with them, be­cause every'strident. body. government is. prone. to make mistakes.' ,It: ;is our responsibility to ·relate those niis: takes to 'thestud~nt body aiici·to sttidenf government

Scholastic: Can we apply the same question again, this time to the administration? What is your. relationship with the administration?•'"·'· · 
. . 
O'Neil:' I'll have to digress. to explain'that question.' The Observer is an ·odd egg a·mong campus newspapers in• general, at, least in a legal sense. We are not cons nected formally to the University arid we are. not an independent corporation.. According to. our advisors; we are :in the most beneficial, most satisfactory situ­ation among campus papers in generat.:Beirig in mid­water, we can. be very ·critical· of the administration if'we wish to or if we feel:a need to.· The trouble is,. .as T believe, that we're· dealing. in general with people who are paranoid by nature of authority, at least in this age.' They're paranoid of the administration, para­noid in·general. Therefore, the student body would-like us• to· be. more: critical of the administration. This doesn't. mean that we .wm take a patronizing stance 

towards -the -administration. Instead; we tend to be conservative with our criticism, as far as we will double check our facts before we· take a stand. We don't see the administration.-as· being a' threat :10 the ·student body. 0 Some students ·do.. We are not in a position at The Observer to patronize-the beliefs/of-those students. Instead we can be reflective of the student body if there is some kind of difference between the two.

O'Neil: When The Observer was created,:ba'ckin 1967, I it was diametrically opposed to the administration. There was almost a violent relationship ·with the ad~ ministration; Today 'The Observer has a very comfortl able relationship with the administration at _Notre Dame. They understand that we must keep im adver: sary stance as>far as they're coricerned. They under~ stand, at the same ·ume, that we have a responsibility to do so.

Many sounds can be heard: the slap of hockey sticks hitting pucks, the clank of weights in the training -room and the crack of bats meeting baseballs. But0there are other sounds·'-the pounding of running feet and the frequent yelling of a 'coach at" unwary nonrunners crossing the track, "Watch the out~ side lane!" The · track . team is running a workout. 
Actually, quite a few athletes are around the track area in addition to those running· against··the -coach's watch.: Some are heaving a heavy ball, while others are attempting to clear a: high horizontal bar as they fly into the air: Still others of this group are not actually in theACC; they are running outside on the local roads for a number' of miles.

Dave Betlach has been consistent in the long and triple jumps." Coach Piane adds, "We have a young weight crew headed by Mike Meyer," referring to those compet~ ing in the shot put and discus. 
The pole vault is • the strongest segment of the field events. Captain Mike Hogan leads ·them,· ·vaulting 15'6" • this . year, and coming very close to ·16'0" many times. The NCAA ' indoor standard is 16'6'', which Hogan feels he has a chance of making if everything works out. George Matteo and ·Ted Burgmeier have ...·. also .. cleared · competitive heights. i'Plus myself, we have these two, who have cleared 15 feet .:_ which is as good as· any school in the Midwest," says Hogan. 

With all of these talented and dedicated performers working· to­gether, it's no wonder there is a good attitude among them. "The biggest change this year is the difference of attitude in running and competing," remarks Hurt. "Everyone's a lot more competitive and we're going to meets with much more of a positive 
· attitude." Yates agrees; "Piane and Kelly have been tremendously posi­tive influences, and that has been imparted to the team," he says. Wills also agrees, "There is a better atti­tude in general, which leads to better performances." ' 
The ·coaches feel that team unity and spirit have made stricles, also. "The team seems to be much· more unified this year because of our 
· seniors Mike Hogan, Jim ;Hurt and Joe Yates," states·' Piane. "Their spirit and competitive drive have been much improved this year," Kelly adds, "I've been really impressed with the good attitude of the major­ity of those who I've worked with." · A vifal part of the ·team's im­proved attitude and its success is its 
· youth. More·than half of the· mem­bers of the squad are underclass­men. •"The positive feeling is par­tially due to· younger people," says Hurt, "especially ' the sophomores and freshmen who are . running really well for us.". This activity of the underclassmen, of course, makes many optimistic about races to come ~ this year and beyond. "The fresh­men and sophomores are doing well; this can only mean things will get better in. the· future," remarks Ho­gan. Hurt agrees, '"The future, more 
· than · in ·other years, · looks very bright as. far as returning Notre Dame to track respectability." 
· The track team is putting in maxi: mum . effort towards accomplishing :that goal, and they are succeediIIg. · · It requires work, butteam members .have the desire to do· so, if they are national championship qualifiers or not. So next time you hear the pounding .of running ·feet while in the ACC's north·· dome, remember the group who is ·working hard to achieve strength in the track pro~ 
... gram at ·Notre Dame; Remember, too, to get out· of the· way before someone yells "watch the outside lane!!" in your direction.

Coach Kelly was the man chosen to replace Jake; .as he held his first workouts last fall there ·was aiot he had to contend with..Be­cause of graduation, we _were inexpe­rienced at many positions: The out~ field lost two of three starters and the· infield demanded a '.new starter at every position.

joined .the . women's. movement unofficially in_1962.. I was _in second grade, caught up in the preparation for First Communion and, in the course of my studies,· I. was _amazed to discover that women could not receive all seven of the sacraments. In some myst~ious fashion, · it seemed,·-the . slightly grimy fellow with the dangling shirttail and with the lopsided monsters doodled in the margins of his reader, by virtue .of his·. manhood, was •of a · different moral fiber than I. 
•I was skeptical, but chary of con­testing the wisdom of the ages. ­
Insult::was then added .to injury when . · the . actual practice for the ceremony began. In what appeared to be a flagrant violation of the most basic tenets of proper etiquette; the "men'.' went. first down . the aisle, leaving us women to bring up the rear. "Harrumph," you may well: be saying. -."It is a small-point, and someone-, must go first; , someone, last." True, but the murky reason I remember being given by the sisters who taught.· us was that the. boys were somehow intrinsically. first in the Church. 
.At that time I did not boycott the Church, set fire to my undershirt or engage in any other demonstration of wrath. My attention span, par-less given up on the Church. No one could give me a satisfactory ex~ planation as to why women were continually . excluded or demoted, particularly if they.• wanted to.· help with the most central, communal celebration of. the Church, :the Mass. 
I. decided that the Church still had a few quaint . notions in the shadows of its rafters, .and. eventually, with the opened· windows of Vatican II, they would find their way out, or be shooed _out by more visionary. or revolutionary people than myself. I still attended Mass, but channeled my leadership and creative energies intq Girl Scouts. 
A conversation with a friend one September morning -· this year brought my dissatisfaction to mind again. He. seemed .. surprised that any . woman ..would want. · to be a priest, or that the exclusion of this option would make any· difference. I disagreed. .,,.The priest is,in areal sense, the shepherd of the people, the "father''. in more than mere title; One of the attributes of adulthood is the ac­ceptance of responsibility for self 
·and for any community of which one . is a member. Symbolically, the priest is the adult of the Church·. and _al­though.the lay people are beginning to take on more responsibility for 
Ucularly for abstract causes, was· • themselves and the commimity, the 

short and by May I had_ mellowed 
enough to take an interest in the 
selection of the girLto crown the 
Mary statue in the May procession. 
.. Besides, God was Father and so 
male.. Though purported to be just, 
Heseemed to embody a number.of 
contradictory virtues and I wasn't 
at an.sure that He.wasn't partisan, 
ready• to zap ·. me soundly for •· my 
revolutionary thoughts. . My chagrin was ._ rekindled in 
f<>Urth grade . when Confirmation 
rolled around. The bishop sat in . front'of the altar and wehadto go·-.. up the steps into0 the sanctuary. to reach him.. Suddenly I realized-that 
· priest is, by ·virtue of ordinatiori; •• endowed with a special status and · is the only one who can act as min~ ister in the Sacrifice.· If we believe 
in grace, .the priest is, in Holy . 
Orders, given special strength with <which to carry out priestly ministry. · To exclude women from priest~ . hood, then, is to relegate .them to a 
symbolically ·. dependent.· position, puUing undue pressure o-n the inen of the Church to carry, not only their own lives and the life of the community, but also the·lives.of the women and their share of the com­munal responsibility. The women, by delegating _their. adulthood,-or 
women couid indeed pass within the . rather, by having .it delegated ·for 
communion rail without the altar 
cracking and I wondered, perhaps 
jealously, · why there weren't altar 
girls as well as boys. 
By the sixth grade I had more or 
'.30 
them, lose a degree of their respon­.sibility for self and are barred, by thei~ exclusion from priesthood, from complete acceptance of the communal responsibility and so 
from complete membership in . the 
community. 
Women· may -_come to ·serve. un­
officially as ministers, but without 
the grace · of • ordination,·,. their 
strength is Hmited..·• . . 

For · a while· I subscribed ·to the standard · argument :used to • calm wild-eyed radicals: -such'' changes will take: time; tradition can't be changed in a fortnight; think of all the older . people whose, faith · you will disturb. I now believe these plat­itudes to be manifestly insufficient. As 0long as inequality exists in the Church, everyorie;s · faith , must• be disturbed because•we are all part of that community and its structure is out of whack. · Necessary changes are, often painful,' but'rio less neces­sary by their pain. Against the tradition• must · be balanced ·the loss to that'tradition of the full power of · individual lives:. lives which cannot come _to fruition -within the Church; which · must· channel ·their energies elsewhere,· when' their: true desire inay be within; which' must. recon­. cile their individual feelings of truth ;_:, 'that· they are called to· serve within the Church .:...,-•with. another "truth" which they, as members of 
the community, feel compelled ­
and which they desire -to accept, 
but which denies them thei_r personal 
vision.
