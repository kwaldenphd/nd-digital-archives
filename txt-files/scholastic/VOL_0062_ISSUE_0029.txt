^^OME of us will paddle ice during the summer. Ice is consoling stuff to peddle on warm days, much more comfortable than would be flat irons or pianos, and perhaps that is why college men take to the ice wagon during vacation. Presumably every salesman has a line, collegiate salesmen have two lines, and both of them are artificial. Ice is admittedly artificial, and so too, is the collegian’s line that he is peddling it to insure playing quarterback next year. Whether you are an ice man on a wagon, or just a nice man on a vacation, I hope your line is one that goes over. And in case you fail, there is consolation in knowing that even an undertaker must admit something is funny when the corpse begins to guffaw.
| ATHER CARRICO will no longer be startled by croaks and gurgles as he leads in morning prayers. Mrs. Hosinski shall cease to examine back of ears and under finger nails for the companionable dirt of the playground. And the new stadium shall never see an excited group of boys herded through its entrances by anxious brothers. Only those who fought the fights of all brave minims, and loved the pals of all true minims, can know the meaning of their passing. Tom Brown at Rugby could easily be surpassed by a Dick Jones of Saint Edwards, if only an ex-minim were to dip a pen of talent into the ink of his experiences. The minims have been banished, but their memory shall not be minimized.
| HE MONOGRAM and Publicity dances were good affairs, the Publicity dance was, moreover, an innovation. The Jugglers juggled, a chivalrous editor divided his time between a chaperon on one hand and a cigar in the other, and the dimness of the candle light so dulled my perception and wit as to make impossible any of those unkind observations in which I am told I delight. One girl remarked she liked the dance because it was different. And in that she is of the sort to know when dances are likable and when they are different, I believed her. When a girl makes every dance of the year, and does it -without playing politics or resorting to the maneuvers of the social monomaniacs, then even a columnist can humbly bow in admiration.
LD BILL BONES, who died from too much rum, was a very rummy chap. WTien he drank he never drank alone, for reformers had not then told mariners to blush at the tastes and tipsiness of their fathers as having been illusion-ary or illegal. Had Bill been so enlightened he might have been a vegetarian -with leanings to the futuristic, and a belief in the survival of the lettuce eaters. Mr. Bones sang a refrain about rum and dead men’s chests that was both hearty and healthy, for he believed in his refrain and himself. With us at this time of year certain morbid mouths are opened long and loud to inflict a refrain from which the howler might with more consideration desist. Restraints and dissatisfactions are the keynotes to this lament, and the weary
dirge concludes with the wail: “This is my last year at this place—I’m going to Oshkosh where you can enjoy yourself.” That then is the swan song of the unfortunate, whose only hope is futile because his only solution is in running away from himself. As in the past three years, the self he finds during the summer will chase him back to the shelter of the Dome for one more year of chronic griping. In his -worst moments Bill Bones may have ran from snakes of a vivid and vicious variety, but even then he was happier than the hypocrite who can never run quite far enough from himself. A FEW of the class pins received last week remain on the campus. The majority went out to seek a feminine wearer the day after their arrival, and those remaining belong either to the doubting Thomases who will make the bestowal a personal one, or to students who bought pins because they wanted to wear them. Fellows like Joe Moran, who*think that the way to eat your cake and .have it tod, is to buy two cakes, will find by the end of the summer that their sister pin will be as errant as her twin. Any girl is a sob sister if she fails to get the pin she expected. And, as vagrancy runs in the pin family, all sister pins will find joy with a sob sister.
^^ENIORS will soon become alumnae. They will come back in future years and chat about the events of this past year as having been their greatest at Notre Dame. And amongst other things they will recall that they were the last men to sit as Seniors in the stands of Cartier Field. The new stadium, the new buildings, and the new students, will change the Notre Dame they know, and amidst the back-slapping and hand-clasping of alumni gatherings there will be sighs for the good old days. But the days we are living now are no better or no older than the days that have gone or will come, though the age and the goodness will be a quality of the alumnae. And about all we can say is that we hope the seniors will be as successful as alumni as they have been as seniors.
E are told by imagists and other varieties of modernists that we are taking part in a wild dance of liberty and joy of life. Women have lost their hairpins, and men have dropped their garters. Our artificial simplicity has something of the simpleness of the aged, who replace bad teeth with poor imitations of good ones. While we are mouthing over the teeth question, I may as well remark that this par-ticulai1 tidbit is my last offering to you. Like any complacent kine, or half-shot bull, I am about to swallow my cud and seek new fields for the summer. Should the daisies and dandelions of whatever pastures I manage to break into agree with me, I’ll be roaring bully opinions to you across the barked wires of the Week again next year. Till then— to all good fellows: Good-bye, and good luck!	—a. h.

COMMENCEMENT “JUGGLER” NUMBER TO BE RELEASED TONIGHT
The good ship Juggler is due to dock at its home port tonight. A Scholastic correspondent boarded the ship while' yet a few miles out and reports that the Funny Fellow has on board an unusually fine commencement cargo of choice jokes, drawings, satires and vers de so-dete. Audible on shipboard (wires our correspondent) are the sighs of the chief skipper, Joseph P. McNamara—sighs of relief at having weathered seas that were not always calm—but also sighs of pardonable pride over a voyage nearing a successful close.
Mr. McNamara is deserving of high praise, not only for this, the Commencement number, but also for
Joseph p. m’namara the general standard of excellence maintained by the Juggler through-the year. In every respect the magazine has consistently measured up to the best of all that is artistic, clean and funny in the foremost publications of college humor. He leaves the burden of upholding such a record on the capable shoulders of John Nanovic. Mr. McNamara says, “In all earnestness’ and sincerity, I am confident that next'"year’s Juggler will equal, if not surpass, that of this year.” And if we had any fears, they are now at rest.
“Cover by McElroy.” That has come to be a popular slogan with Juggler fans. This time the cover’ is an attractive three-color design, containing a delicate thrust—well, you must see for yourself. But Paul C. McElroy, art editor, and Richard Zimmerly, another staff artist, have sailed their last voyage with the Juggler. They have made the scenery beautiful as it sailed along, and they will be missed when the ship lifts anchor again in October.
Of the associate editors, three are transferring to the good ship Graduation . They are David S. Lehman, who has made the Theater Section brilliant and informative with his sparkling dramatic revues, and who has contributed some fine “text”; John de Roulet, whose skits and verse have been especially delectable; and Walter (Bud) McMorrow, a dependable worker who has never failed to come through with work that is first, last and always—funny. Fred J. Wagner, a member of the business staff, also passes on.
For the seniors the Commencement number brings out the silver lining of the black clouds of cap and gown, and for the others it offers that supply' of humor so essential to social success in the summer with the friends back home.

NOTED BRAIN SPECIALIST ADDRESSES SOCIOLOGY STUDENTS
Dr. James Pennington, superintendent of the sanitarium which bears his name, an institution for the insane located near South Bend, spoke on mental disorders in relation to social diseases Tuesday night in the University Library. Students in the department of sociology at Notre Dame, and other interested undergraduates filled the South room of the Library to capacity for the lecture.
’ Besides conducting his sanitarium, and treating patients at the Indiana State Hospital for the Insane at Logansport ' for the last eight years, Dr. Pennington has also been prom. inently identified at various times with the United States Army Medical Corps.
VOLUMES DATED 1425 ARE OLDEST IN -
LIBRARY	v
About twenty years before the birth of the Genoese discoverer, Columbus, two books were published: the first, a collection of articles pertaining to problems of the Catholic	’
religion, especially the Wycliffe heresy, the other a book of	‘
Psalms and various prayers. For five hundred years these volumes have withstood the ravages of time, and both are now in the University Library. There, among the scores of manuscripts and rare first editions which have been carefully preserved by students of philobiblical research, they are the peers of them all.	'
The probable date of the publication of both of the works, according to Mr. Byrne, the librarian, is about 1425 or 1430. The collection of controversial articles is in excellent condi- <» tion, written in a clear, legible handwriting on rag-paper. The text is in Latin and frequently illustrated by illuminated letters done in bright red. On account of the poor workmanship of the binders, many of the marginal notes which ac- , companied the original work have been cut off. The cover is of two wooden boards, enclosed in calf-skin, and held together by brass clasps.	-•
The history of this volume is unknown except that the book at one time belonged to the Reverend A. A. Lambing of Pittsburg, whose name is in the front.	.
The other book, a psalter, is a Coptic version of all the * psalms, written in the Abysinnian language. According to a note in the book when it was given to the Library, there is only one other similar to it in the United States, in the Astor	"v
Library of New York. It was presented to Notre Dame by	,
Dr. Benjamin De Costa. The cover is of wood, embossed with a cross. Half of the front cover has been torn off.
c
• Other books which had their origin in the fifteenth century v are included in the collection. Several of these are Psalters, painstakingly written out by the monks. Depending upon the ingeniousness of the authors, the texts are usually enlivened by fanciful drawings. The illuminated letters afford many 4 examples of these. Figures of birds, serpents, animals and caricatures of men are drawn into the capitals. This was ‘ probably done to relieve the tediousness of copying page after page of manuscript.
It is interesting to note that at the time of the publication .. of the two earlier books, Joan of Arc was routing the English forces from France and planning the coronation of ~ Charles VII; Wycliffe’s heresies were being circulated in Europe; the Schism of the West was drawing to an end, with the resignation of Pope Clement VIII at Avignon; and the Academy of Louvain was founded. The volumes have survived reformations and revolutions and now claim the dis- ▼ tinction of being the oldest in the Library.

THOMAS MARKEY
From Indianapolis hails Notre Dame’s own Bill Tilden in the person of Bud Markey, the ne plus ultra of local racketeering— not the Chicago kind, of course. Among Bud’s many trophies of the court are the championship of Indiana in the singles, and in the doubles, paired with Burns. Another aspect of his court activities is the fact that he is a student of law at the University.
Last year when Bud was captain of the tennis team he was the one to whom thanks are due for inviting Johnny Hennessey to give an exhibition on the local courts.
Besides proving that this state of inclement weather raises something else than basketball players and au
thors Bud is somewhat of an activities man hereabouts. He has been a committeeman for all his class dances, was one of the ones who made this year’s Lawyers’ Ball such a success, and was a member' of the Senior Pin committee.
But his crowning achievement in this sort of thing was his supervision of the reception tendered the football team after they had beaten the pitying Army last Fall. Larry Moore, chairman of the Blue Circle,’ (Bud is a member of that too, by the way,) couldn’t be in town to take charge of the celebration and delegated the task to Bud. As everyone knows by this time, he could not have given the assignment to a more capable or a more efficient man. Tire manner in which the affair was run off and the smoothness with which it moved was a fitting compliment to its organizer.
At present, the hallowed walls of Sorin, hoary with tradition and old pictures, are graced with the benign presence of this lad. But he doesn’t spend all his time in Father Lavin’s hostelry, nor does anyone who is a business associate of the genial Mr. McHugh, and Bud is just that. However, his admirers, and their number is legion, can address all his fan mail to that address with the reasonable assurance that he will receive it eventually.—D.W.S.

THE “DOME” OF 1929 REVIEWED
If for no other reason than that the Editors of the Dome of ’29 had the happy thought to dedicate the book to Father O’Hara, their craft is a complete success. It is indeed a fine courtesy to the seniors that the revered name of Father O’Hara should be held up for honor in the same Dome that glorifies them.
The Dome of ’29 has however, other claims to distinction. The cover is attractive. The plates are exquisite. The satire is classical. The periodic division of the book is of keen historic interest. It is difficult to decide which of these features tends most to enhance the beauty of the Dome. It would perhaps be best to say that they equally conspire to the same harmonious effect. I have my prejudices however and I think that the sceenic color plates are the outstanding feature. They have a delicate beauty that captivates. They have the frail charm of a summer day. They are distinctly atmospheric and lend a tone to the entire book.
The work of Cy Mullen and Dave Lehman in the satire section cannot be too highly commended. They have achieved in the Dome of ’29 probably the best satire ever produced at Notre Dame.
Paul C. McElroy’s art work is outstanding. Those who have had any experience in this field will readily realize the labor incident to the achievement of such a result.
Harry Sylvester has brought to his work in the Sports section the athletes’ point of view. One result is that the various fields of athletics have been covered in an interesting r-nd vivid manner.
The least satisfactory department of the Dome is, to my mind, the senior honor section. Somehow, it fails to convince. For while those who have been chosen are quite deserving, it is difficult to conceive how the committee selecting the candidates for this distinction could have overlooked such men as Johnny Colrick and Joe Jachym. The committee does not seem to have used consistently its criterion of activity, worthiness, and representativeness. One feels that the names of Colrick, Jachym, Crowe, and others will linger in the memory of Notre Dame men when other figures less heroic have passed into what Carlyle calls the “eternal silences.”
The Dome of ’29 is however, on the whole, eminently satisfactory and desirable. Thomas Keegan, the editor, and those associated with him may well be proud of their production. They have done a good work and have done it well.

MEN YOU KNOW
Included in the faculty of most leading universities are a few men whose accomplishments have brought them the recognition and distinction they deserve. Such a man is the Reverend J. A. Nieuw-land, C.S.C., who has achieved brilliant success in Botany and Chemistry during his twenty-five years at Notre Dame.
Father Nieuwland graduated from Notre Dame in 1899 and in 1904 he received his Ph. D. from the Catholic University of America. He returned to Notre Dame after his ordination to the
priesthood and has ever since been a professor in the College of Science, of which he was for a time Dean.
His exhaustive research work in the field of Botany soon earned for him a high position in the list of American botanists. In 1909 he began publication of the American Midland Naturalist, a journal devoted especially to natural history. He is still editor of this magazine, to which he has contributed more than seventy-five papers on his library, laboratory, and field researches. He has in addition contributed more articles to various other magazines, as well as preparing articles on Botany for an encyclopedia. All this extensive work has brought increasing renown, until now he ranks ' pre-eminent in Systematic Botany in this country.
Father- Nieuwland has spent much time in the collection of’ a scientific library, and his success in this has been great. It was through his friendship with the late Professor Greene, the greatest of systematic botanists this country has ever produced, that the wonderful Greene Library of Botany came into the possession of the University.
During the last ten years Father Nieuwland’s efforts have been devoted chiefly to Chemistry, and his successes in this field have been as great as those in Botany. His researches in Organic Chemistry and particularly in an important branch of it, Acetylene Chemistry, have brought him numerous honors. He is a member- of the American Chemical Society, before which at least one of his papers has been read at each meeting for the last several years and in which he has filled several positions of honor. He is also a member of Phi Sigma and of the Deutsche Chemische Gessellschaft and is a Fellow of the Indiana Academy of Science. In 1911 the University of Notre Dame bestowed an honorary Sc. D. upon Father Nieuwland.
While studying for his doctorate in 1903 Father Nieuwland discovered the compound which was developed by the government during the World War into the deadly gas known as “Lewisite.” At present he is writing a book on the Chemistry of Acetylene, a book certain to be accepted as authoritative in that field.
Last December he celebrated his Silver Jubilee in the priesthood. He is a quiet, serious man who is always busy. He derives much pleasure from his work, as is evidenced by the fact that when once asked by a magazine to write an article on a hobby of his, he wrote on Botany. Every student who knows him soon comes to respect him highly, and to many a student he has been an inspiration. In him Science finds a striking example of individual vitality.
LAETARE MEDALLIST EXPRESSES APPRECIATION OF AWARD
The Very Reverend Charles L. O’Donnell, C.S.C., president of the University, received a letter of thanks last Wednesday from the Honorable Alfred E. Smith, this year’s recipient of the Laetare medal, and former Democratic nominee for president. The letter addressed to Father O’Donnell follows:

Northwestern university observed its annual Candle Lighting day on Wednesday, May 15. Promptly at 8:01 p. m. on that date President Scott, in company with an official party of alumni and student representatives, lit a huge purple candle standing in the tower of the Education building, known as “Old College,” and repeated a ritual which was being enacted by Northwestern alumni all over the world.
At the same time all the fraternity houses on the campus repeated the same ritual using smaller candles as symbols.
This candle-lighting ceremony corresponds to our own Universal Notre Dame night and is repeated each year by Northwestern alumni and undergraduates.

The freshman class at Georgetown university, Washington, is socially non-existent,. according to a ruling recently handed down by the student council. This decision was made after members of the first year class had refused to aid in caring for the athletic field and running track. The council has decreed that as long as the lower classmen decline to work, they shall be barred from all social privileges.

Reading tastes of students have changed considerably during the past two years, according to the circulation librarian of the University of Oregon. This change of interest in student reading has not been confined to the Oregon campus alone but has been noted by librarians throughout the country.
Prior to the present time the most popular writers have been H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, and Sheila Kaye-Smith, but now these writers’ books languish on the rent shelf and instead, mystery stories, poetry, and books translated from foreign tongues are the ones which students demand.

The straw hat season has been officially opened at Indiana university. At the end of the fourth inning of the recent ball game with De Pauw, the denizens of the press box, enshrouded in copious dignity, filed to the front of their cage, and stood with bared heads while a bottle of christening “champagne” was broken over the hat of one of the members. This ceremony ushered in the reign of the straw hat on the university campus.	'	.

A columnist in the Daily Princetonian has been spending his spare moments lately in making a list of platitudes. Here is the list as published in the Princetonian:
“Its’ not the heat ....
“Life is like that'. . . . you’ve got to take the ups with the downs.
“Here today and gone tomorrow.
“Not so bad overhead, but kinda sloppy underfoot.
“My motto has always been, ‘Let us reason together.’
“All I can say, fellows, is we’ll do our best out there tomorrow.
“Let him hit it, boy. we’re all here behind ya.
“According to University regulations, all students must register for their term bills within the first ten days of the term.	•
“Our aim has been to treat you undergraduates like men.”
A college education was far less expensive in pre-Civil War days than it is at the present time. The Daily Iowan states that an expense account recently displayed at the centenary exhibition of the University of Iowa law college contains a rendition of the expenses of an Amherst student for the year 1846-47. The total charge for the year, including tuition, room rent, a fraternity initiation fee of $5, laundry bills, and, most surprising of all, railroad fare to and from the college, was only $200. -
Whisker-raising contests have become .popular on the American campus. The latest school to fall in line is the University of Minnesota. One hundred and twenty-five sets of whiskers of all colors and descriptions were present in a Minneapolis theater recently for the final judging of the University’s 15-day whisker contest.
The contest was judged by three barbers and three beauty experts. Length, thickness, and color were the points on which the judges based their decisions. E. 0. Greer, by virtue of having the most attractive facial fuzz, won the first prize of 825 and a razor.	'
* * * ❖
This education business is becoming more commercial all the time. North Carolina State university has a provision calling for the collection of an official university fine of fifty, cents for each time that a student chooses to cut one of his classes. This move seems rather futile. It is not only contrary to the still prevailing standard of higher education that learning cannot be measured in dollars and cents, but it will probably prove quite incapable of producing the desired effect.

Athletes, evidently, are destined to be the intellectual leaders of the nation. This conclusion results from the following item from the Purple and Gray, student publication of the College of St. Thomas:
“Having examined more than 100 men of science, Dr. Alex Herlicka, noted anthropologist, has found that strong minds were accompanied by strong bodies. Good health, large heads and superior physique all were partners of an active brain. A frail and neglected body has not the power to furnish energy enough for an active brain, he said. A man may be brilliant, but if his body is weak there will not be that driving force necessary for great work.”
“At the University of Oklahoma they have instituted a complete drugstore for the training of the pharmaceutical students. They announce that everything found in an ordinary drugstore will be included. What kind of chaps do the boys down there w.ear, we wonder.”—The Rockhurst Sentinel.	•

The National Catholic Welfare Conference
OUR COMMON CA THOL1C WORK
BY WILLIAM F. MONTA VON, ’98
Director, N. C. W. C. Legal Department
FOR more than a century the national life of our country was mainly a process of amalgamation, of consolidation. Thirteen states, dis-united by physical conditions and social ideals, themselves in turn made
up of local communities loosely held together, in many instances isolated and of necessity existing independently one
of the other, through growth and progress were being amal
gamated at a time when a vast frontier was being dominated
WILLIAM F.
MONTAVON, '98
and consolidated under the political system which evolved out of our Federal Constitution.
It was but natural that the Catholic Church in the United States should follow, in her development, lines not unlike those just described. Beginning with a single diocese comprising parishes and distant missions, her growth in membership was rapid and the progress of her institutions reflected the energy and resourcefulness of a new country. The growth and the progress were, however, parochial so far as they entered the fields of social action, education and benevolence.
As early as 1866 the Second
Plenary Council of Baltimore gave evidence of a purpose to co-ordinate Catholic action on a national scale in the field of education. The creation of the Catholic University of America by the Third Plenary Council in 1884 was a superb manifestation of the spirit of cooperation and coordination the need for which had made itself felt and which had already struck deep root in the minds of Catholic leaders not only among the members of the hierarchy but among laymen as well. The Catholic press early became conscious of the need for cooperation. Efforts were made to organize a news gathering agency to cover the special field in which the Catholic weeklies are interested.
The War brought opportunities for united effort extending to every part of the nation. The Bishops were quick to seize the opportunity. With a spirit of zeal and patriotism worthy of them as the ministers of God’s Church and the leaders of the vast body of Catholic citizens in our country, the Bishops, acting jointly and for the whole body of Catholic citizens, gave assurances to the President and to the nation that in the conduct of the war there would be whole-hearted loyal cooperation on the part of Catholics not only in military activities, but in the vast field of welfare work which a prolonged struggle would involve. To make effective this assurance the Bishops organized the National Catholic War Council. This War Council succeeded in coordinating the welfare activities of American Catholics during the war both at home and with the army overseas. As Archbishop Dowling so eloquently says in his pamphlet on the National Catholic Welfare Conference:
“In all that we as Catholics were called upon to do, in the care of souls and the spiritual interests of the Church, in service to our country, no partial or local attitude was taken,
but one of national extent and of common resources, of common help and common problems. We met the challenge not as many and separated, but as one and united. For the assembling and care of the Army and Navy chaplains, a Bishop General, the present Cardinal Hayes, was appointed with the approval of the Holy See. With extraordinary zeal and ability, he organized his Army vicariates over night,— eventually enlisted and directed almost one thousand priests and chaplains. Every diocese cooperated. The ■ result was a revelation to ourselves of our strength, our responsibility and oui- opportunity.” ;
That revelation projected itself beyond the days of crisis. It embraced the future. The parochial methods of the past were no longer adequate to meet the problems of national scope affecting the Church, and the moral well-being of Catholics and of the nation. “When peace came, we were called upon to decide what to do with the great organization of our Catholic resources made necessary by the war. Catholics had developed a consciousness of greater strength and responsibility. They had come to a larger participation in the religious and spiritual life of the country. Were they now to disband and to depend upon scattered and divided efforts, or combine and develop this new strength as a means of further service to the Church and the nation?
During February, 1919, seventy-seven Bishops of the United States met in Washington to honor Cardinal Gibbons on the occasion of. his golden jubilee. The now Cardinal Cerretti, speaking for the Holy See, suggested the good that would flow from frequent meetings of the Bishops at which “they would take common council on matters of general import” establishing “definite departments that would, under their supervision and direction, carry out the work assigned.” With enthusiasm the Bishops accepted the suggestion of the Holy Father. As a preliminary step a General Committee on Catholic Affairs and Interests was appointed, whose duty it would be to make a survey extending into every diocese and report to the next general meeting of the Bishops which, it was directed, would be held during the following September.
The September meeting was attended by ninety-three Bishops. The report of the General Committee was received. An organization of the Bishops to be known as the National Catholic Welfare Council was formed (some years later the name was changed to the National Catholic Welfare Conference) and "an Administrative Committee of seven members of the hierarchy” was elected by the National Catholic Welfare Council to transact between meetings of the Council such business as might be expressed at the annual meetings.
The National Catholic Welfare Conference is the logical outgrowth of our development as a nation; it is the expression of that spirit of zeal for religion and of that love of country which have been the inheritance and the glory of the Catholic people of the United States and reached eloquent expression in Catholic action during the war.
The Pastoral Letter of the Archbishops and Bishops of the United States issued in 1919 as the result of the deliberations at this general meeting is a noble document. In it Catholic interests and activities are analyzed in the light of our national history and of our political and social institutions. To meet the necessity for unity of action the Bishops declare:
The Notre Dame Scholastic
959
“We have grouped together, under the National Catholic Welfare Council, the various agencies by which the cause of religion is furthered. Each of these . . . will now derive additional support through general cooperation. And all will be brought into closer contact with the Hierarchy, which bears the burden alike of authority and of responsibility for the interests of the Catholic Church. . . . Several departments have been established, each with a specific function. ... To complete the organization of the departments time and earnest cooperation will be required. The task ... is so laborious and yet so promising of results, that we may expect surely, with the Divine assistance and the loyal support of our clergy and people, to promote more effectively the Glory of God, the interests of His Church, and the welfare of our country.”
Ten years have passed since the Bishops organized under the name National Catholic Welfare Conference and set up an Administrative Committee of Bishops for the purpose of giving help and direction > to those entrusted with Catholic action national in scope and calling for unity of effort. They have not been free from trials. The spirit of zeal and patriotism, of cooperation and union out of which the Conference had its beginning have at no time been lacking. Progress has been made in extending that spirit until today the Conference through its various departments and above all through its lay organizations, the National Councils of Catholic Men and Women, is extending its influence to every parish of Continental United States and even to the remote regions of insular possessions and territories. The life of the Conference has been a - life devoted to service,—service to God and to religion, service to Country, service to mankind.
With the years the field of Catholic action has become more clearly defined. In a symposium, published at the beginning of 1929 and later reprinted in pamphlet form under the title “Our Common Catholic Work,” that field has been briefly described. It extends to education, to social work, to rural life, to the Catholic press, to legislation, to immigration and the Catholic immigrant, to industrial conferences, to the preservation of the Christian home and the family, to industrial justice, to religious vacation schools, to Catholic defense and apologetics, to citizenship, to Catholic historical records, to the organization of Catholic laymen and women, and in the international field to the problems of international ethics and the direction of a Catholic Peace Association.
In times of crisis the strength that comes with union is most needed. Unity of action cannot be improvised. To be effective it must connote harmonious functioning, and individuals or groups do not learn at once to function together without friction. It is only by years of experience that heterogeneous bodies can be made to cooperate. At no time was the wisdom and the timeliness of the action of the Bishops in founding the National Catholic Welfare Conference more apparent than in the crisis which grew out of the Oregon School Case. In the Oregon School Law were planted seeds, which, if allowed to grow unhindered, would have smothered and blighted the beautiful tree of liberty under which our nation has grown strong and has prospered. In meeting this crisis the Conference under the direction of the Administrative Committee defended not only the Church and the Catholic people by carrying the case through the Supreme Court of the United States and presenting the points involved so clearly that in its findings that august Court declared:
“The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the State >to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. The child is not the mere creature of. the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.”
The Oregon School Law was a manifestation of the doctrine and spirit of secularism. With what seems to be increasing determination and with a shrewdness borne cf repeated defeat, the opponents of religion are assaulting the foundations of Christianity. At the sight of the significant and rapid strides that discovery is making in the domination of material nature, men are bewildered. No longer- able to clearly distinguish natural from divine forces, engrossed in the affairs of material existence, the number is increasing of those who out of doubt pass to indifference. Efforts are being made to revamp our laws and our institutions to make them conform to the doctrines of materialism. Education has been a powerful force for the preservation of religion. More and more education is falling into the hands of those who abhor- or are indifferent to religion, and who are willing to pervert the school into an instrumentality for the inculcation of their doctrines and make it impossible for the children of the land to escape by outlawing the right of parents and of the Church to educate. The godless school has been the instrument by which men have sought to root out the religious convictions of peoples. The school is being employed as such an instrument in Mexico. Secularism is exercising a powerful influence in legislation, both national and state. It is today the enemy of religion, and threatens to undermine the very foundations of our free institutions.
The doctrines from which the founders of our Republic drew the inspiration for our Constitution are the doctrines of our Church. They were taught by Jesus Christ and were preserved to the world by Catholic theologians like Thomas Aquinas, Bellarmine, etc. Root out religion, destroy the Church which is the stronghold and defender of Christianity, and you open the way for the destruction of our institutions. The edifice cannot long stand on a foundation that is crumbling.
As Catholics we have in the teachings of our Church, in her philosophy, in her ethics, in her doctrine of social justice, a treasure which it is not alone our duty to guard,, but which it is above all our duty to apply and make effective in the life of our nation. This is the service demanded of our patriotism. It places upon us the obligation to know the teachings of our religion, to make of our lives a testimonial to the excellence of those teachings. It places upon us who enjoy the responsibilities of leadership the inescapable duty and responsibility of stemming the tide of paganism which threatens to engulf us.
The National Catholic Welfare Conference is the Church of the United States acting organically to this high purpose. Under the guidance of the Bishops its officers are amassing and distributing the information that must guide and through the National Councils of Catholic Men and Women, that lay apostolate of which the Holy Father speaks with so much hope, is being made a force for practical good in every part of our country.

clatter and bang of wash basins, the slamming of shoe lockers, the tic tac of Brother Cajetan’s huge bell on the water trough, the hasty falling into ranks,—the minims begin another day! Every one knows stately Saint Edwards Hall whose mellow bricks and weather worn staircase give evidence of an age which merits reverence from the Administration Building itself, but few know what goes on behind those tall spotless windows.
The Minims are just as much a part of Notre Dame as any hall on the campus. They have the same school spirit and they revere the same traditions as their bigger brothers. At one time when big “Ken-tuck” Obert vas head coach, the Minims were undefeated in any sport for four years and the next year the only game they lost was a hockey match to the Junior Seminarians. In 1922 they boasted of the smallest organized football team in the world. This team was captained by Bill Rockne and their center could barely get the ball between his legs.
Studies were by no means neglected- The first Monday of the month was a momentous day in the life of every Minim. Father Burke, then Prefect of Studies, came over to read out the monthly marks. For those who were lucky there was a word of praise and for those who lagged behind,—there was silence! But what a silence! It was worse ibau any scolding.
The most idolized person in the heart of every Minim during our time was Gene “Kentuck” Oberst. Notre Dame just couldn’t lose if the lanky southerner was in the lineup. Six feet four and a half, over two hundred pounds, he took a yard and a half at a stride. His biggest admirer came barely up to his chest. He astounded us one time by telling us that he was the smallest one in a family of seven. When he broke the American record for the javelin throw a deadly feud broke out in the Minims as to who should have the honor of carrying the precious shaft from Cartier Field to the gym.

“Kentuck” was not the only one to bask in the light	of hero wor-
ship. All kids must have some one to look up to, some	one to mimic,	even	in habits of	dress. Next to Oberst and Mrs. Rock
I think that Harry Stuhldreher was the most popular. At night there	were	always one	or two' that used to sneak over to So
“Sub” just to sit in Harry’s room and watch him work.	It was a dangerous	undertaking	because if they were caught it meant 1
raps on the hands from a certain little stick in the competent hand of Brother Cajetan, but it was worth it! Another pair favorites were Chuck Collins and Bill Cerney in 5 Corby “Sub.”
A popular diversion in those days was skunk trapping but, sad to relate (from personal experience) the trapping usui ended disastrously for the hunters. The author was once nearly expelled for bringing a prize of the chase into the classroom d ing Physiology class. His intentions were good but his specimen for examination was not appreciated. It was a common thing see some kid with a sheepish looking grin walk in to the gym with nothing on but a bathrobe,—Bis clothes buried in the sr pit near the running track.

away in reckless dissipation at the candy store. A couple of boys went into the banking business and would save their alk ance until the middle of the week and then loan out nickels r dimes at a hundred percent profit. “If I lend you a nickel } pay me a dime next Thursday!” That was the agreement r strange to say the youngsters usually paid their debts.	'
This became such a profitable business that a certain part of the locker room got to have the nickname of “Money Changers’ Row”. But that racket was stopped as some of the boys formed a money trust and were getting a corner on all the loose change in the Minims.
The sales system of the store was original of nothing else. The line began to form at three thirty in the afternoon and by the time it was opened the line reach-ed across the locker room to the door. The sweets were doled out in penny quantities and anybody that spent a nickel on one kind of candy was considered a plunger. One kid created a sensation that was talked about for weeks by spending his whole quarter at one time. The store was presided over by Brother Leopold. In all the years pf his service he had the reputation gene of never being bested in a bargain. It was his cus- it

tom to take the money first and then deliver the merchandise.
The ‘•'Army game” of the Minims was the annual football game with the Niles Tigers. This game was talked of for weeks in advance and if the game happened to be in Niles the team was given a regular send-off and if the team returned victorious the rest of the department received a special permission to stay up and greet them on their return (sometimes until nine o’clock!) and the team was always welcome when somebody received a package.
There was one game that is still talked of in the Minims It was in the last year that “Kentuck” coached. The Minims had been victorious througout the season and they were winding up with a team a little bigger than the average, the Hebrew Eagles of South Bend. Things wrere not breaking right for the little Blue and Gold and at the end of the third quarter they were trailing at the end of a twelve to nothing lead. With five minutes more to go they decided to use one of their touchdown plays. On their own five yard line they pulled a clever triple cross buck and lateral pass (“Kentuck’s” pride and joy) and while the bewildered Hebrews were wondering what happened a little ‘ end with both arms wrapped around the ball was streaking tow-ard the opposite goal line.
The other trick play was pulled with a minute and a half more to go. The quarterback took the ball through the line and then laid dowm on the ground, groaning, but -with the ball still in his hands. There was no whistle blown and while the Tigers stood around wondering what had happened the Minims quickly got on sides and the quarterback snapped the ball over his head to a waiting half who was never even bothered. Of course it wasn’t exactly legal but “Sleepy” Crowley was an exceptionally broadminded referee. The Minims kicked the point as the game ended and the puzzled Eagles walked off the field knowing that something was wrong, but just what it was they couldn’t fig-
।	ure out.
• nlike our luckier successors we very seldom saw the temptations and pitfalls of South Bend. When our parents would come ; we could get a week-end and have a grand time wandering around the Oliver Hotel. Before the arrival of the parents we k through the traditional ceremony of “Sunday Clothes.” This wasn’t very popular with the gang as we had to wash our necks mdergo a thorough examination in the capable hands of Mrs. Hosinski, who looked after her hundred or so charges with the care she would give to her own children. Many were the tousled heads, that homesick and lonesome, let loose the flood of tears mumbled their childish fears into the security of hei- motherly shoulder.
'he Minims “pounded their ears” in five dormitories, presided over by a brother. There was one dormitory set aside for the

At three o’clock in the morning old Brother Cajetan would shuffle up to this dorm and awaken everybody. :r about three months of this that habit of laziness” would be broken, for which many worried mothers gave humble thanks, highest honor was to get in Brother Cajetan’s dorm, especially in the winter time. The boys in that dorm could get- up in
^e room while the more unfortunates would shiver into their as and- hurry down to the washroom with teeth chattering.
i.fter the closing of this school year the Minims will be gone, [forgotten? I don’t think so. Their cheers and peppy chatter be missed at the games and the echo of their footsteps along

the corridors of St. Edwards Hall will sometimes be heard in the stillness of the night between the ticks of the old clock in front of the chapel and the statue of St. Michael will sigh for the touch of greasy little hands along the edges of his flaming sword.
Next year an entirely strange group will take up their home where the little Minims left off. Most of them will be new to the traditions of Notre Dame and of the stately old hall which they call home. Their task to continue those traditions will not be an easy one. They must maintain an envious record in athletics, for the Minims never lost more than three games a season in any sport. They must keep up a great record in supporting Notre Dame teams—no Minim ever received letters of complaint from indignant alumni.
The Minims will be gone next year. Their places will be taken by an older group. But they will not be forgotten—how could they be?

Notre Dame-A Blend Of Localities
NEIL HURLEY
PRINGING from a mere handful of 150 students scattered throughout four residential halls in the year-1005, the Collegiate department of Notre Dame has increased in such a notable manner that it now boasts
of an enrollment of 3,070 students. Or in other words it may boast an enrollment increase of over two thousand per cent in the past twenty-four years. Notre Dame is truly a blend of localities. From Spain, China, Hawaii, South America— the students come. Some from Canada, the Canal Zone, Cuba and even Australia. And from the United States men from nearly every state point to the Golden Dome as the symbol of their alma mater.
Ine traditions established by this same small handful of men, the hardships that they endured, and their loyalty to lofty ideals, even in 1905, have tended to make Notre Dame what ic is today—one of the leading universities of the country. Scattered throughout Corby, Sorin, Brownson, and Carroll Halls these men of early Notre Dame set the pace for future generations to follow. It is a peculiar fact that even in those early times the students came from all parts of the world. This is borne out by the statement that at that time there were more foreign powers represented on the campus than at present.
Since the first days of the University not a year has passed without some increase in enrollment, save in the turbulent year of 1918 when every physically able Notre Dame man -went across the seas to participate in the World War. This year marks the passing of the three thousand mark for the first time.
The year 1928-29 has not proved to be an exception in the enrollment increase. Rather, it is one of the biggest steps in advancement since the founding of the University. Notre Dame has proven herself to be an international institution in scope, and an institution that is so appreciated throughout the land that all but three states—Maryland, Delaware, and South Carolina—are represented, together with nine foreign countries or dependencies among the student body. And of this number large delegations have been sent from each. It is worthy of notice that all but fifteen states are represented by a good deal more than five men. Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, and North Carolina are the delinquent states in this respect, each being represented by less than five students.
Notre Dame is a haven for many scholars from foreign lands. F. Li from Nanking, China, holds the record for the greatest distance travelled to reach South Bend, although the Milan brothers from far away Madrid are a close second. In the number of student residing at the University, the Republic of Mexico is foremost among the foreign powers, being represented by twelve men from nine different cities. Canada runs second with nine students to her credit. Three men hail from South America, the Rivera brothers from Chili, and J. O. Romano from Peru. L. G. Godoy journies from Oriente, Cuba, and W. Allen travels all the way from the Canal Zone. From Honolulu, H. R. Hong comes as Hawaii’s only representative.
While we are on the subject of distance it should not be amiss to mention something concerning the travelling done by Notre Dame’s American population. It is a surprising fact that the majority of men do' not come from the immediate vicinity of Indiana. California, the furthest state from
South Bend in the Union, sent thirty-four favorite sons to our campus this year to view the “unusual weather." Oregon, another remote state, sent eleven. It is this way “all down the list.” We find the student body to be a mixture of practically every locality in the United States. In the words of that celebrated author, Henry Van Dyke, one may hear the “maple-sugar twang of the Vermonter’s sharp-edged speech; the round full waisted r’s of Pennsylvania and Ohio; and the soft, indolent vowels of the South.” Truly, Notre Dame is a national institution.
It is usually customary to concede that the home-staters are in the majority over any other state. However, this year, if one excludes the Seminarians, who nearly all come from some section of Indiana, it will be found that Illinois has nosed out the home team for first honors by scoring 481 students to Indiana’s horde of 349. New York was third in the total by state membership with 335, almost defeating the Hoosiers. The next three largest states are Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan, boasting of a few hundred apiece. Wisconsin trails the Wolverines with a delegation not quite as large.
It is an interesting fact that although forty-five states and nine foreign countries or dependencies are represented, exactly half of Notre Dame’s enrollment is from only six states. These six are the ones mentioned in the above paragraph: Illinois, Indiana, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan. The remaining fifteen hundred men are scattered throughout the entire nation.
In respect to the cities, Chicago, as in all previous years, reigns supreme. The great majority of Illinois’ enrollment comes from the Windy City. New York City is again second to the Chicagoans.	’
Notre Dame, then, is a mixture composed of spices ranging from the mysterious Orient to the everglades of Florida, and from the wind-blown spaces of our own American desert to the creaky tenements of New York. Take men from every locality, bring them together under Notre Dame’s individual type of bond, and the answer is oui- big household here on the campus.
It might be interesting to pursue the table that was recently traced out by the Reverend Emil De Wulf, C.S.C., since the year 1905, which is far enough back for all practical purposes. The table which he cited is made up in synopsized form as follows:

THE lllld IXIIKHff HIT TEANEJ
By the time the next issue of the Scholastic, the “Commencement Number,” is released, most of the students will have left for their summer recess. So the editor takes this opportunity to make public his appreciation of the invaluable assistance rendered to him throughout the year by various parties associated with the publication.
To the Reverend Patrick J. Carroll, faculty adviser of the Scholastic, the editor extends his sin- cere appreciation for excellent and constructive advice given him on numerous occasions. To Mr. Harley L. McDevitt, business manager, the editor is grateful, very grateful for the splendid cooperation given him at all times, a cooperation which expedited immeasureably the composition of the Scholastic.
To Brother Mark, C.S.C., foreman of the composing room, to Brother Martin, C.S.C., foreman of the press room, and to the rest of the employees of the University’s Printing Department, the editor cannot adequately express his appreciation of their many courtesies to him at every opportunity.
To Mr. David Saxon and Mr. Vincent McIntire, managing editor and assistant managing editor, respectively, the editor is deeply indebted for capable and faithful services rendered to him during the year. Mr. Archer Hurley, writer of the “Week,” has turned out one of the best efforts, if not the best, since that department was first inaugurated. “The College Parade” has never been done in more cleverly consistent fashion, nor has there ever been a staff member as faithful as its conductor, Mr. Bernard A. Walsh. The Music and Drama department was well taken care of by the versatile Mr. James J. Walsh.
Too much credit cannot be given the efforts of Mr. Murray Hickey Ley, literary editor, for the invaluable assistance he rendered the editor since taking over the supervision of that department last November. Mr. John Bergan, news editor, while incapacitated through illness part of the year, also merits praise for the interest he took in the publication and the assistance he rendered the times when he was able to do so. Mr. Harry A. Sylvester and Mr. Gilbert Prendergast, sports editors, handled their department in commendable fashion every issue.
. Mr. John A. Kiener, interhall sports editor, edited the finest Interhall department that has ever appeared in the Scholastic. “The Club Page” had an excellent editor in Mr. Thomas A. Cannon, who equalled the excellent standard set by that department last year. For originality and clever humor Mr. Bayard Kurth, conductor of the “Wink,” had few equals on the campus.
The work of the individual staff members, while not receiving the publicity attached to the efforts of the departments heads, was eminently satisfactory on the whole. The work of these staff members ' was the foundation upon which the magazine rested. Largely upon their efforts did the successful composition of each issue lie. And the great majority of these men more than justified the confidence the editor reposed in them. So to these individual staff members, to the departments heads mentioned before, and to all other parties who assisted the editor in any capacity whatever during the year, the editor is grateful, very grateful.
; The year taken as a whole has been successful. The Scholastic organization has been far from perfect. But it is an organization that has done its very best at all times, and in doing so has no apologies to offer to anyone in this respect. Fortunately, faculty members and students have all appreciated the fact that the Scholastic is a magazine of any by and for the students.	-
The editor in spite of his potential gray hairs and shrinkage of avoirdupois has spent an enjoyable yeai at the helm of the magazine. He has served his time, however, and is ready to turn the directorial reins over to his more than capable successor, Mr. Murray Hickey Ley. With the next issue he will retire to the side-lines, and attempt to restore the color of his hair and regain some of the weight he lost through the vicissitudes brought on by the year.	—J. V. H.

The White Whale
Some Remarks on Herman Melville
MURRAY HICKEY LEY
“All’s o’er and you know me not!”
—PIERRE.
IN the year 1851, the White Whale, ever present in Life, swam into Literature. A few people noted its coming and commented, rather idly, on the seas it lashed, but never did they really think about, or realize the import of it.
In that year Herman Melville published Moby-Dick, or The White Whale; then waited for the recognition that such a masterpiece deserved. Exactly seventy years later it came, when, in 1921, Raymond Weaver published the first biography of Herman Melville, calling him a Mariner and a Mystic. Since then, the name, Melville, has become a magic word; certain of the co-called sophisticates have made of it a fetish ; both limited and popular editions of most of his works have come from the presses, and men and women, wondering and amazed, have begun to ask themselves, “Who is Herman Melville?”
To the foregoing question this paper shall attempt to formulate an answer; with the emphasis on Melville as a thinking man attempting to satisfactorily situate himself in the cosmos, by the light of the revelation of that attempt con-ained in his books. To that end, we will examine his life, certain of his works, and venture an estimate regarding his place in American literature and culture.
On August 1, 1929, Herman Melville was born in New York City. His parents, at the time, were in comfortable circumstances, but, shortly after, the father died, and Mrs. Melville found a hard task facing her in the support of her family.
At seventeen, after a brief period of school teaching, Herman went to sea and, once across the waters, explored the slums of London, seeing in the course of his wanderings, many things of a dark and sombre nature, things that were to haunt him for many years after—and, haunting him, be set down in his books.
Again back home, he became an omnivorous reader and a great seeker after truth and knowledge; but the call of the ocean was strong, and, at twenty-one, he again went to sea. This time he was gone three years; and, during that period he lived for some time as a guest-captive with the quiet, easy, calm Marquesans. Finally, breaking away from them, he joined the Navy, was almost flogged for an alleged breach of discipline, and barely escaped death by drowning.	■
In 1844 he returned to Boston, and, a year later, wrote Typee, and won—success. Shortly after came Onioo. By this time he had become a rather well known author, and in 1847 married Elizabeth Shaw, the daughter of Chief Justice Shaw of Massachusetts, and settled down to a quiet home life.
Two years passed; y_ars of stiuggle to adjust himself to the marriage state and find happiness by the fireside rather than on the deck of a ship. Then came a new book, Mardi; a few months later, following on its heels, Redburn (in which he recounted the experiences of that first voyage to London), and in 1850 White Jacket, which, by its revelations of corporal methods of punishment in the United States Navy, led to the suppressiong of flogging on board.ship. (He had his own experience in mind!)
Then in 1851, came Moby-Dick, or The White Whale, and, the year following, Pierre.
The work of his later life is remarkable only for Benito Cereno, (declared by Edward O'Brien, annual selector of the year’s best stories, to be the finest of all American short stories); The Confidence Man, 1856, a novel reflecting certain of the tenets advanced in Pierre; and several volumes of verse, which, though comparatively unknown, rank him as one of America’s best poets, one whom Conrad Aiken has included in his quite strictly selective Anthology of American Poetry.
From 1866 to 1886 he was inspector of customs in New York City; and in September, 1891, his wife with him to the last, he passed away, unknown and unmourned by the literary world of that day.
Such, in barest outline, is the life story of Herman Melville.	.	’
Now, our purpose here, as we have said, is to trace his development as a thinking man; and it seems to me that this whole process of development is crystallized, as it were, in three of his books, Mardi, Moby-Dick, and Pierre.
A three-day chase of the great White Whale is the climax of Moby-Dick. Would it be impertinent if we took each one of these books to represent various stages in the spiritual questings of Melville himself? Three stages in his ozun chase of the White Whale?
The reasons for this arbitrary choice of symbolic usage, will, I hope, be obvious as we proceed; so let us to our task.
MELVILLE’S MIND
The Chase—First Day
Mardi
Mardi is the World. Taji, the narrator of the tale, finds a beautiful girl called Yillah, early in the opening of the story, who, it seems to me, is a symbol of world love, of self sacrificing general love of one’s neighbors, practically the same kind of love of which Dostoevsky was to write, some few years later, in far-off Russia. (For Melville this love is never particular; it is an all-embracing love of mankind.
The Notre Dame Scholastic
965
Melville was never happy in a particular love; he always seemed unhappy with his wife; and yet, paradoxically enough, was disconsolate when away from her.
After a brief period of happiness Yillah vanishes. Taji enlists the services of Media, a demi-god, Babbalanja the philosopher, Yoomy the poet, and Mohii the historian, in his world-wide attempt to find her. In company with these concrete personifications of quite abstract subjects, he journeys over the whole of Mardi (World) in a vain attempt to find her.
Three messengers from one Queen Hautia are eternally beseeching him to abandon his quest, and seek pleasure with their Queen. The Queen is safe single love; but Taji must find the secret of World love which he had once possessed and then lost.
The company sails over the globe; Great Britain, America, and many other countries (masquerading under elaborate names) are visited in the course of the search; but no Yillah is found.
At last they come to the isle of Serenia founded by Alma (Christ). On this island, Babbalanja the philosopher finally finds peace; but Yoomy the poet and Mohi the historian, go on. Why? Because, it seems to me, Melville thought that poetry, no matter where it was situated, always had the spirit of Alma in its utterances, and History must needs keep rushing on in order that it may be History.
But Taji cannot stay. He visits Hautia and discovers that Yillah has been transformed, on Hautia’s isle, and is lost to him forever. (Melville’s early World love merging into single, particular’ love.) Then does he head out into the open sea crying “Now I am my own soul’s emperor; and my first act is abdication!”—and the books ends with the line, “And thus, pursuers and pursued fled on, over an Endless sea!”
Here we have, I believe, an excellent setting forth of Melville’s own spiritual plight. He is Taji; he has found particular love in Hautia (his wife) but he cannot reconcile himself to this. He must find Yillah (World love). He has found the isle of Christ but he cannot understand why the rest of Mardi will not accept the sweet beliefs and practices of the people of Serenia, and so steers out into the open sea to hunt the reason for this non-acceptance of love.
Once this cause is discovered, then, perhaps, can he call Yillah back from the dead; but not until he has found the object of his search, can he permit himself any pleasures whatsoever. ’
In this book Melville gathered up the threads of his life and wrote symbolical autobiography; Taji wanders over the face of the earth; so did Melville. Taji found the secret of the highest kind of life—self-sacrifice to mankind—and lost it; so did Melville find this and lose it when he-married, for, for him, marriage submerged the universal in the particular. Taji discovered God and Love, and, wondering why all men did not do the same, set out to find the reason; so did Melville, too, find Christ—and, looking about him, seeing others all too forgetful of the injunction, “Love thy neighbor as thyself,” set out to find the cause of this neglect.
Taji becomes Ahab, the mad captain in Moby-Dick; and Melville steers into the open sea to find—the White Whale.
The Chase—Second Day
Moby-Dick
Melville is now in'full command of himself; he will project a search for the cause of Ey^ in the World, and eradicate that cause; he already knows full well what that cause is; it is the soul of man, blackened and streaked with the boomerangs of human non-acceptance of the word of Christ —and this, as I see it, is the White Whale!
The book itself concerns the search of one Captain Ahab,
commander of the whale ship Pequod, for a great, invincible white whale known as Moby-Dick. All types of humanity are in his vessel, and they are, one and all, fired by his intense desire to find the White Whale.
Finally, Moby-Dick is sighted; the first day’s chase finds honours even between the Pequod and the Whale; the second day sees Ahab losing his wooden leg (only of wood, because, years before, Moby-Dick had taken off flesh and bone); and the third play’s sunset sees the Pequod, Ahab, and all his crew crushed and swept to their deaths by the terrific onslaughts of Moby-Dick. But one man, Ishmael, the teller of the tale, survives, and he lives only because he is picked up by the ship Rachel hunting for the lost child of her captain. And here Melville compresses his whole secret in a short two-paragraph Epilogue. His Ahab is a Christ intent on subduing the hardened soul of Man: The three days of the search are Christ’s three years on earth; the White W'hale is Ahab's Golgotha; but for Melville there is no Resurrection, no Easter Morning, and yet, in spite of it all, one man survives to tell the tale ;and were it not for the saving offices, the healing agencies of Love, he, too, would be lost. Ishmael, the surviving sailor, is rescued from the sea by the Rachel, the very name symbolizing Mother Love, which, ineffably pure as it is, was to Melville the nearest approximation to his World Love, and the furthest removed from anything partaking of the sensual.
And so, Love alone survives to tell of the wreck and loss of nobility; but, the point is that it does bring about a survival; Melville hurled himself after’ the White Whale; on paper, in an objective medium, telling of the hurling, he died; but the essentially surviving Melville, Ishmael and outcast that he was precisely because he had seen nobility founder-on the hard rocks of Man's soul, (and therefore could never laugh again) was saved by the Love, that, after all, he saw did exist in the World.
Christ told the young man that if he would be perfect, he should sell all he possessed and follow Him; Melville caused Ahab to rid himself of all he held dear and pursue the Anti-Christ.
Melville’s fear of the color white is a characteristic of all his works but especially of Moby-Dick. In Pierre, in speaking of the white amaranth, he refers to it as symbolizing the “ever encroaching appetite of man for God.”
’ Would it be going too far to say that he saw Men’s evil-streaked souls hypocritically clothing themselves with the white cloths of religion, and, while detesting the imposture, nevertheless was attracted to the colour?
Moby-Dick is ended; Ishmael survives. Melville had shown how nobility is torn to pieces on the smug, ignorant, heedless, unsympathetic, uncomprehending soul ;he wonders how the world will accept this masterful painting of his; and his book drops into a pool of silence.
He wonders at himself, he wonders at the world, he rages; but still is he faintly enamoured of the good (which is Love)
• and, taking the sole survivor of Moby-Dick, Ishmael, he determines to see how another type of nobility, the idealistic type, will fare in the world. Ahab was an ideaistic idealist hunting down the cause of evil; Pierre is an idealistic ideaist preaching the doctrine of Love and Truth to the White Whale —and so we have
The Chase—Third Day
Pierre
Young Pierre Glendinning is engaged to beautiful Lucy Tartan; suddenly a long lost sister comes to his attention and he realizes that he must protect her. To do so will involve giving up his Lucy, as he cannot publicly acknowledge Isabel, his sister, without causing grave hurt to his mother.
966	The Notre Dame Scholastic
Accordingly, he gives up Lucy and goes to New York with his sister Isabel to earn his living as a writer. He is also protecting one Delly Ulver, who is an object of disgrace (and wrongfully so) in his village home. Lucy, in spite of all, flies to him; her brother accosts him, horsewhips him, and Pierre draws a gun and kills his tormentor.
In jail Lucy and Isabel come to see the newly condemned to death murderer, Pierre Glendinning: Lucy collapses and dies, and Isabel and Pierre take poison, dying as the turnkey enters the cell.
Certainly a melodramatic, overstuffed, affected, sometimes almost ridiculous plot. And yet, besides its many fine passages, it possesses great merit derived from its worth as a picturization of the last assault of Melville’s objectively projected self upon the world.
In a sermon in the very early pages of Moby-Dick, Father Mappie foreshadows Pierre when he declares that “Jonah did the Almighty’s bidding. And what was that, shipmates? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! That was it!”
Ahab fights Falsehood with Truth; Pierre preaches Truth to Falsehood; and both are broken by the White Whale.
The characters in Pierre are symbolic of the besetting ideas of Melville’s life; Isabel, from whom Pierre (Melville) is forever “unsistered” by a stroke of Fate (Melville’s meeting with his future wife) is altruistic, all-embracing, all-sacrificing love of Mankind; Lucy, (whom he can no longer whole heartedly love because in him is the voice of Duty as he sees it, “Go and minister unto Mankind”) is particular love. And Delly Ulver, the girl he has taken under his protection, is a symbol of the eternal demands of Charity; she is Isabel made more concrete.
Midway through the book Melville remarks how “earnest loving” youths will become imbued with the wondrous teachings of the Sermon on the Mount, and then, with love in their souls gaze upon the World; and be overcome with a sense of the World’s falsity.
This simply restates Melvilles’ own life and sums up the case I have been presenting. These three books show Melville in three stages of development; Mardi shows him finding the Sermon on the Mount, and setting out to find out why the falsity that militates against the acceptance of this simplest and finest of all homiletics is not obliterated: Moby-Dick pictures the cold, yet impassioned, calm, yet frenzied, search for the blandly indifferent soul of Man that is the White Whale; death; and the ultimate survival of Love: And Pierre displays the ruin of one who faces the White Whale with Truth and Love.
Pierre and Isabel in their joint suicide represent the end of the individual and his attempted fostering of universal love; the latter perishes with the former.
In this book Melville, bitter, vitriolic, cannot permit any survivals; were he coldly logical he might have committed suicide. But some sparks of the Love that caused the story of Moby-Dick to be saved, still lingered—and he stayed on.
This great trilogy, uneven in artistic merit, unequal in tone, unbalanced in execution, constitutes the first great epic of the spiritual questing of a modern man; it is the record of a great soul who found the word of God and the world, as he saw it, incompatible; and set out to conquer that world. That the White Whale broke him, as it has broken so many others is tragic; but that the still lingering words of Christ caused him to give us a report of that tragedy is, indeed, our eternal gain.	,.
Two short stories of his later years merit attention here, one, Benito Cereno, for reasons already mentioned, and the
other, Billy Budd, Foretopman, because it is, as it were, Melville’s last will and testament.
Benito Cereno is a finely balanced and exquisitely told short story; the hero is the pawn of forces beyond his control, but the end of the tale sees him freed from them; though, broken on their racks, he cannot but remember them, and remembering, die. E. M. Forster has commented on the use of the word Delight as the name of a ship in Moby-Dick; one wonders if he has marked the ship in Benito Cereno, the Bachelor’s Delight? And the significance, in Melville’s own life, of this word, Bachelor, followed by Delight, is worth noting.
Billy Budd, Foretopman, finished in 1891, the year of Melville’s death, sums up Ahab and Pierre. It is an American version of Dostoevsky’s Idiot (as is also Pierre); the hero, Melville’s last venturing of a Christ-like character, destroys evil, and is hanged for it; but at his death he blesses his executioner, his words being reminiscent of those of the crucified Christ. Through good and evil, Melville burrowed, till, at teh last, he found good, though perishing at the hands of death, nevertheless the redeeming factor in the universe. Billy Budd is hanged; but his name and fame go in the minds and hearts of the sailors.	'
In Pierre Melville says that where words stop, music begins. Just as in Aristotelian numberology, the number* ten sums up in itself nine plus one, so does the first movement of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony melodize the threads of Melville’s thought; it is a tone painting of the slow, thoughtful search for the White Whale, the clash, Ahab’s attempts to scale the great back, and the repulse; but Beethoven goes on to bring up from the depths, at the very end of the movement, a strain of pure joy and love. Melville faltered on the last but one of the'lower levels; Beethoven plunging even further down into the mines of Life, brings up the golden bar with which both he and Melville started—Love.
Hawthorne, once a good friend of Melville’s, is said by some to have lost the latter’s friendship because in Ethan Brand he pointed out that Ahab had committed the Unpardonable Sin—“the sin of an intellect that triumphed over the sense of brotherhood with man and reverence for God, and sacrificed everything to its own mighty claims.”
Melville is supposed to have resented these words; what is not seen is that he had only lived to tell of the Unpardonable Sin because of lingering flickerings of this very sense of “lost brotherhood” said by Hawthorne to have been so irretrievably lost to him.
Melville was hurt by Hawthorne’s misunderstanding of him; but he could hardly have expected the author of the Scarlet Letter to follow him in his flights of the intellect; the creator of Hester Prynne occasionally ventures from the day into the twilight; the father of Moby-Dick leaps from high noon to darkest midnight—and back again.
In one of his letters to an enthusiastic reader complimenting him on the size of his White Whale, Melville depreciates the magnitude of this monster of the seas and enigmatically refers to a still vaster and more terrible creature—the kraken.
From an old, curious book, published in 1752, by one Pon-toppidians, we discover that this kraken “is the largest and most surprising of all the animal creation.” Also we find out that it may be something of an intangible form capable of assuming many and varied guises at will.
Here is something greater than the whale that urged on Ahab; the captain of the Pequod hunted down the roots of

evil in Man’s soul; but in back of him stood Melville whom Love kept alive after the White Whale had killed all; and, in back of Melville was the dread kraken. And this horrible, many shaped animal, was, I believe, to Melville, the Devil; the only possible creature more monstrously great than the White Whale. Moby Dick was blind, cruel, implicable, but at least he was human; against the kraken, the forces of humanity were unavailing; the natural was helpless against the supernatural. The Devil is Love’s most terrible enemy.
In Melville’s immediate consciousness the White Whale engaged his attention; but in the far seas of his mind there lashed and roared that horror of horrors, alongside of which even Moby-Dick was small and puny—the kraken.
Waldo Frank in The Rediscovery of America pleads for the formation of a Whole (of American Culture) and the discovery and functioning of men who will act as conscious integers of that Whole; in Thoreau, Emerson, and Whitman, men who early contributed to the formation of that Whole a wealth of positive enthusiasm, cornucopias of sound and often beautiful cerebral nourishment, we have revealers of a dramatic and joyous sense of life; but in Melville we have a
conveyor of (to borrow a phrase of Mumford’s) “a tragic sense of life.”
Frank says that in Walden, Leaves of Grass, and Moby-Dick we have the “text of an American tradition;” certainly Melville has given an enormous impetus to the shaping of a culture that will reflect the American spirit—he has emphasized appreciation of life, respect for the dignity of each individual man, and awe of the tremendous potentialities of the human soul.
He was a man who sought far and wide for the key to the maintenance of a balanced existence—a life that would preserve a nicely adjusted balance between the agreeable and the disagreeable, the good and the bad, the ugly and the beautiful. And as we accompany him in his quest he shows us much that we might advantageously make part of the warp and woof of our lives.
While the diapason bellow of the kraken trumpets Melville’s failure to secure this adjustment, the curved flutes of his art blow delicate and tremulous notes sounding our triumph! For we have the flowerings of his splendid failure; < and therein lies our glory!

Notre Dame Defeats Fast Meiji Team
Jachym Pitches Five Hit Victory Over Nipponese
. The fast Meiji University team from far-off Japan showed rheir wares before the largest crowd of the season at Cartier Field, Monday afternoon, only to be defeated by the Blue and Gold, 9 to 6. Joe Jachym pitched.for Notre Dame and but for several bad innings turned in one of his best victories of the season. The Japanese were able to collect but five hits off the slants of Jachym.
After a scary first inning in which Akagi, starting moundsmen for Meiji, had the Millsmen guessing, five runs were counted in the second and three more in the third inning. One more was added in the eighth. Three pitchers were used by the Far-Easterners, Akagi being knocked out of the box after the heavy second inning rally.
To open the second inning, Feehery got on base on an error and Lordi walked. Jachym scratched a hit through the pitcher’s box. Palermo walked, filling the bases. Hart then drove a terrific drive over the right fielder’s head. It rolled to the stands in right field for a triple, cleaning the bases. Moran lined a Texas leaguer into left, scoring Palermo and Hart.
The Japs scored two in the sixth after Joe Jachym began to loosen up a bit. Only thirteen batters had faced him up to this time, but in this inning Jachym passed three, which with an error and a single netted two runs for the losers.
The Meiji rally in the seventh was opened with Mano flying out to Francis in right. Zenimura was hit and when Palermo bobbled an easy grounder, Tabe was safe on first. Matsuki then hit to McCleary who touched second, forcing Tabe. Zenimura took third on the play. Masu walked and with the bases full Sumida cracked a single into center field, scoring Zenimura and Matsuki. On Yonezawa’s hit to right field, Masu and Sumida crossed the plate with the final runs.
Besides hurling a great game against the diminutive Japanese, Joe Jachym had a perfect day at bat, knocking out four hits, one a double, and scoring two runs.

NOTRE DAME, 12; MICHIGAN STATE, 5
At Cartier Field, May 16
Lefty Lisicki made his home debut in a very auspicious manner, letting the Spartans down with five hits while his team-mates were walloping the ball around the field to win, 12 to 5. Lisicki himself led the heavy Notre Dame powers at bat, getting a triple and two singles in three official times at bat.
Notre Dame opened the hostilities when Palermo walked to start the first inning, and went to second on Morgan’s sacrifice. Bray also walked and Feehery singled over short, scoring Palermo. Bray came in on Colrick’s sacrifice and after Hart was hit by the pitcher Feehery was retired stealing home.
The sixth was Notre Dame’s big inning with five runs coming across the plate. Hart started with a triple to right and scored when the throw-in went over the catcher’s head. Griffin lofted a Texas leaguer into left and Law dropped one in back of the shortstop, but Sachs was able to nail Griffin at second. Law got to third and Lisicki to first on an error by Eggert. Lisicki took second, and Palermo struck out. Moran got a walk, and Law, Lisicki, and Moran scored on Bray’s single to center. Feehery sent one to the same place and Sachs juggled the ball, both runners being safe. Colrick then flied high to center, ending the inning.
Lisicki was in trouble in only two innings, the second and ninth. The Spartans got to him for two runs on three hits in the second and pushed three runs across in the ninth on two hits. Summary:

Oskar Rust took the slab after having been knocked off the mound at Illinois the day before and pitched a splendid three-hit game over Coe College. Rust struck out ten batters and kept the three hits well-scattered. The big hurler aided Notre Dame’s 5 to 0 victory by pounding out a double in the eighth to score two men.
Notre Dame scored a run in the second and led by that narrow margin until the seventh when they added another. The eighth inning rally netted three more. Moran led off and was safe at second when White, Wernimont and Burroughs let his high fly drop safely back of second. Colrick rolled out to the pitcher, Moran going to third. Feehery scored Boran with a single over short. Francis ran for Feehery and promptly stole second. Hart popped to White, and Law walked. Rust then knocked a double to left, scoring Francis and Law. Palermo knocked one through the pitcher’s box but was out, White to Harper.
Lefty Moran was the hitting star of the game, being credited with a double and two singles in three official times * at bat. He also got on base when he was hit by Moeller, the Coe pitcher. Summary:

ILLINOIS, 9; NOTRE DAME, 0
At Urbana, Illinois, May 17
With Meyer on the mound for Illinois, Notre Dame was shut out, 9 to 0. Meyer allowed the Irish only four hits and only one man was able to reach third. Perfect support by the infielders saved Meyer on several occasions, Johnny Law being robbed of a double when Shaw leaped high into the air to snare his terrific line drive over short.
Rust and Jachym shared the hurling burden for Notre Dame, Rust being removed in the sixth inning. Illinois began its rampage in the second inning with Brown leading off with a single into right, going to second on Williams’ sacrifice. Colrick had to go wide for Shaw’s smash down first and Rust, covering the bag, fumbled the ball, Brown taking third on the play. Kusinski hit to short with the infield drawn in but Brown was safe at home by a narrow margin. Meyer got on base via an error and Dora cleaned the sacks with a double to deep left.
Moran got the only Notre Dame extra base hit, a double. Palermo, Bray and Law had singles for the remainder of the hits. Moran got as far as third base but was left stranded. Summary:

COGGESHALL IS C. I. T. C. SINGLES CHAMP;
WINS DOUBLES PAIRED WITH STOWE
Harais Coggeshall, fourteenth ranking national star and perhaps the best college player of the year in the midwest, won the Central Intercollegiate Tennis Championship Saturday by defeating Tom Markey, of Notre Dame, in four hard-fought sets. The Grinnell college ace, paired with Don Stowe, also won the doubles title a few minutes later, thus taking back to the Iowa both first place trophies presented by Knute K. Rockne.
Markey was off to a brilliant start, in his match with Coggeshall and grabbed a 5-2 lead in the first set while his more experienced opponent was vainly trying to find a way to halt the driving game of the former Notre Dame captain. Bud soon took the set at 6-3, and proceeded to keep the Hawkeye on the defensive by again taking a 5-2 lead in the next set. The pace was beginning to tell on Markey, however, and Coggeshall tied the set at 5-5 and ran off the next two games for the sc* before Tom could recover.
After that the Blue and Gold star slowed up as the match

wore on ami Coggeshall had things his own way. He won the third set by a 6-3 score and the final by 6-2.
In the finals of the doubles tournament Coggeshall and Stowe were forced to five sets before they downed Frank Brody and Max Everett, of Drake University. In this all-lowa final, the Drake stars took the first set rather easily and then secured a 2-0 lead by chalking up the next set at 8-6. They had spent themselves in their spectacular rally, however, and Coggeshall and his hardly less brilliant partner walked through the next three sets by 6-3, 6-3, 6-2.
Bud Markey won his way into the finals by defeating Junior Boehmer, of St. Louis, 6-1, 9-7, in the quarter-finals and then taking the measure of Frank Brody of Drake, in the semifinals. The scores of this match were 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.
Coggeshall earned the right to play Markey by eliminating Warren Byrum, of Western State Normal, in the quarter-finals, in two hotly contested sets, each of which ended 7-5. In the semi-finals, he surprised everybody with the ease ■with which he vanquished Tom Wilson, of Butler, 1928 Indiana Collegiate Champ. The ranking Iowan allowed Wilson only five games in the three sets, the scores being 6-2, 6-0, 6-3.
Coggeshall and Stowe went into the finals of the doubles tournament as a result of their clean-cut victory over Markey and Captain Griffin, of Notre Dame. The Drake combination of Brody and Everett defeated Bergherm and Reil, of Northwestern, in the semifinals Saturday morning after Bergherm and Reil had previously walked over Murphy and Weise representing Washington University of St. Louis.
. The meet was the first annual tennis tourney of the Central Intercollegiate Conference, sponsored jointly by Notre Dame and the Western Lawn Tennis association. Harry A. Walsh, president of the association, and Knute K. Rockne had complete charge of the play. Leo J. Lunn, of Chicago, was head referee of the tourney, all matches of which were played on the courts of the Chicago Town and Tennis Club.
The winners in both singles and doubles won trophies presented by Knute Rockne, while the runners-up received conference medals.	'	—H. B. ASMAN.

MORRISSEY HALL WINS SWIM TITLE: BROWNSON SECOND IN MEET
The Morrissey Hall tank stars easily outswam their opponents, garnering 34 points, to win the interhall swimming championship held in the University natatorium, Thursday, May 16. Brownson Hall was second with 20 and the other halls placed as follows: Carroll 16, Howard 5, Lyons 5, Walsh 3, and Sorin 2.
Individual scoring honors went to Cap-ter of Carroll Hall. He won the 40-yard breast stroke, and took third place in the plunge for a total of seven points. Close behind Capter was Acers of Morrissey ■who rated six points by virtue of second place in both the 40-yard breast stroke and the plunge.
First places in the 40-yard back stroke, plunge, and the 60-yard medley relay attributed greatly to Morrissey’s victory. In the 60-yard medley relay, Morrissey’s team of Ponic, Acers, and Crowley, swam a great race to nose out the team from Brownson. Brownson turned the tables however in the 100-yard free style relay and won with their team of Hutton, Wilson, Nugent, Groves, and Nash. Morrissey placed second in this relay.
The summary:
120-YARD FREE STYLE—Won by Digan (Badin); Cas
sidy (Walsh) second; Winkler (Morr.) third; Svete (Carroll) fourth. Time 1:19.

FRESHMAN BASEBALL AND TRACK MEN RECEIVE NUMERALS
The Freshman baseball team concluded its season in a tie game with Moreau Seminary Tuesday. A ninth inning rally by the Frosh tied the score, but they failed to put across the winning run. The final score was 5-5. Farrell, Palt and Wise worked on the mound for the freshmen, with Dolan catching.
Those who received numerals were: Pitchers, Wise, Del Prete, Burns, Smith, Malloy, Farrell, Palt and Augustine; infielders, Sullivan, Grueffre, Duffy, Shelley, Bosco, Hall, Dressen and Kolski; catchers, Dolan, Meyer and Luckett; outfielders, Lomasney, J. O’Connor, E. O’Connor, Locke, Powers, Conti and Murnane.
The team played no games with outside teams but performed yeoman service in contests against the varsity. Two games were played with Moreau Seminary, and all members of the squad saw action in the intra-squad games. The coaching was capably handled by Joe Sullivan, captain and second baseman of last year’s nine.
The freshman tracksters who received numerals were: Wilson, Little, Hutton, Tuohy, Scanlon, Miller, Crawford, Rudd, Brandstetter, McCormack, Bonsbach, Devlin, O’Malley, Madden, Cummings, Krall, Groves, Proctor, Holbach, Lane, Hausman, Molander, Behrman, Danish, Darling, Kenny, Remier, Vaughn, Sabala, Rohrbach and Russell.
The Frosh trackmen emerged victorious in all their meets this year. They defeated Culver in an indoor meet; Western State Normal both indoor and outdoor, and Illinois frosh in a telegraphic meet.
Coach John Nicholson, varsity track mentor, worked hard with his freshmen as he expects them to form the nucleus for a strong team next year. The results more than justified his efforts.

Hats off to John “Lefty” Lisicki for his well earned victory over Michigan State May 16. As a sophomore making his college debut, Lisicki’s five hit win is worthy of much praise. Throughout the game he showed clever headwork in his pitching, and in addition scored three hits in as many times at bat, one of them a lustv triple.

Credit is also due, of course, to his mates for their twelve • runs and faultless fielding support, and to Johnnie Law for his able handling of the new hurler.

McCleary started at second base for the first time since the Indiana game. By the style of his play his wrist evidently handicapped him but little. Jim Bray was on the bench with an injured leg, and “Vic” Hart cavorted in his usual fine style in center field.
fl fl fl
A crippled battery was assigned to take care of the Meiji University team. Joe Jachym and Joe Lordi both had injured-ankles which ■were taped before the game to allow them to play. Both required runners when they got on base, which was not infrequently.

John Law, running for Lordi, scored three times, and Jachym connected for four healthy singles in as many trips to the plate.

Hart’s triple might easily have been- a homer Lad he tried for the extra base, but the third base coacher held him up.

SPLINTERS FROM THE PRESS BOX
It seems that human speed is at more or less of a standstill whereas human ingenuity is moving right along. A recent resume of the records of the I.C.A.A.A.A. shows that in recent years only one of the track records for the great annual meet has been altered, whereas six field event records have been shattered lately.
Columbia’s regatta with M.I.T. resulted in a clean sweep for the Lions, and gave the Blue and White the unusual record of fourteen straight victories in four consecutive regattas. Incidentally the hallowed custom of the losing oarsmen tossing their shirts to the victors has brought Columbia’s four-
crews a total of 126 shirts. It looks like it will be California and Columbia all the way at Poughkeepsie.

Now that the results of the Eastern dual meets are coming in, some comparison with Far-West and Middle-Western standards may be made. It looks as though Stanford will take the I.C.A.AA.A. again, but not without some strenuous ' opposition from Yale. As usual the Far-West’s supremacy , -will lie in the field events, dashes and high-hurdles. We leave out the low-hurdles because we doubt that anyone in 1 the country can beat Kieselhorst of Yale over the low barriers. Hickey, Cox, Offenhauser, Hagen, Edwards and Reid will prove too strong for any of the California distance men, although Mossmen and Carter will be anything but also-rans. I

It is rarely that a trained runner collapses before the ‘ finish of a race-; it takes the very essence of strength to run one’s self out to that extent. It has happened only twice in recent years that we know of. Once was two years ago in the Intercollegiates when “Red” Haggerty of Harvard rolled over on the side of the track after following the classic stride
of the Olympian, Cox all through the mile. The second time was last Saturday at the Indiana state meet when John Brown dropped on the backstretch of the last lap of the two-mile.	'
* * * ¥
The first of the season’s upsets is upon us. Last Saturday in a. quadrangle meet, U.S.C. decisively defeated Stanford after having been beaten just as badly by Stanford earlier in the season. Incidentally Rothert shattered the Intercollegiate record for the shot-put again. But this has ceased to be news.

| HE sun of student life has set, and this issue of the Scholastic, intended for the alumni, the seniors, and their friends, is but a faint shadow cast by that home-seeking sun. To those of us who have just completed another scholastic year the campus is too peaceful; our friends are gone, we are going/ and the campus air has the heavy atmosphere of a wake. The visitors who see Notre Dame now see a school without students, a garden without flowers, and, though it may be ever so beautiful a garden, it has not the coloring tc which it is accustomed.
"|~THE Week welcomes the alumni. And wishes that Lyons, Howard and Morrissey were all equipped with dictaphones to record the stories of the things that were in the days when you were, students. It must be a pleasure to come back and find the scIiod! growing as it has, with new halls, an excellent refectory, and a suitable stadium about to be reared. Next year we hope to see you in Chicago at the games, and me year after Notre Dame will welcome her own in a stadium abie to accommodate a goodly share of the numerous supporters of our teams. Cartier field you will miss, as it has missed you, but no i healthy lad ever yet regretted growing out of short trousers. We have outgrown Cartier, but we put it i aside with all respect to the memories it harbors.
I
> I IKE the mushrooms popping up after a rain, knickers came into prominence so suddenly this last I	week as to be already the accepted thing to wear, even though the	echo of classroom boos and	hisses
I	have scarcely died. The alumnae may look with amused tolerance	at Notre Dame men on their own
j campus attired in knickers and sport shoes, and may even draw inferences as to the deterioration of the ।	breed since the construction of “the Gold Coast,” and the passing of	the crews. But the men of	Notre
g	Dame still fight for their school, and, of more importance, still pray	for their teams. Black and	white
shoes, and linen knickers prove nothing if not that the wearer is as sincere, as unpretentious, and as plain as anything else in black and white.
|N their unconcern and hurry the alumnae will scarcely notice the blessing which befell us as a result of the recent taxi war. The monopolists of other days were so embarrassed by a recent taxi rivalry as to give a rate that is just to both the company and to the students. And though this may not mean a great deal to you of the alumni, still to those of us who walk a mile to buy two packs of cigarettes for a quarter the low rate is to be classed with such-blessings as chicken dinners in the refectory, and excursion tickets for the student trip games.
^TUDENTS may come and student may go, but the school goes on forever. And now we have something like a palace from which to come and go, for the new railroad station is such as to make even a New Yorker feel a pang of memory for the Grand Central. South Bend, gentlemen, is trying to keep pace with Notre Dame, and the new station is a fine tribute to their effort. Next year when the Sophomore welcomes his first guest at Cotillion time he will appreciate the truth that a station , makes the first and the last impression on a visitor.

Commencement Notables
THE RT. REV. BERNARD MAHONEY, D.D.
The Right Reverend Bernard Joseph Mahoney, D.D., S.T.D., Bishop of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, will celebrate the Solemn Pontifical Mass tomorrow morning in the Sacred Heart Church at 9:00 a. m.
Bishop Mahoney was graduated from the College of Arts and Letters of Mount St. Mary’s College, Emmitsburg, Md., in 1899, and received his master’s degree at the same institution in 1901. He was ordained in 1904 and received his S. T. D. at the North American College at Rome, New York, in 1912. His consecration as Bishop of Sioux Falls took place on June 29, 1922.
Since his consecration to the bishopric of Sioux Falls, the Right Reverend Mahoney has done hero
ic work for Catholicism in the Far Northwest. His is the
apostolic spirit that inspired the great De Smet in his ecclesiastical labors in this far-flung vineyard of the Lord.
THE REV. NORBERT C. HOFF, PH.D.
The Very Reverend Norbert C. Hoff, S.T.L., Ph.D, president of Mt. St. Charles College, Montana, will deliver the Baccalaureate address tomorrow morning, in the Sacred Heart Church.
Dr. Huff is a national figure in American letters. He is a famouus educator, a noted lecturer, and a great churchman. It is due largely to his ability and enthusiasm that Mt. St. Charles College to-day occupies a leading position among the educational institutions in the Pacific Northwest.
After the entry of the United States into the World War in 1917, Dr. Hoff
was particularly active in the cause of patriotism. It was at
this time that he organized a lecturing campaign that took him into various sections of the country.
Dr. Hoff has also distinguished himself in the field of science and is a leading authority in the United States on the subject of botany.
COLONEL WILLIAM J. DONOVAN, LL.B.
The class of 1929 at Notre Dame feels particularly honored that Colonel William Joseph Donovan, who is to be the recipient of an honorary degree, will be the principal speaker at the Commencement exercises. Colonel Donovan is a soldier, a lawyer, a Republican and a Catholic. Bom in Buffalo, New York, on January 1, 1883, Colonel Donovan has held important political posts in New York state and for the national government. His most important position was the assistant attorney generalship which he held under Mr. Sargent during the Coolidge administration.
During the World War, Colonel Donovan served as assistant Chief of Staff of the 27th Division, A. E. F.; as major of the 51st Brigade: as major of the 165th Infantry (the old
“Fighting Sixty-ninth” of New York), and as lieutenantcolonel of the same regiment. He was wounded three times during the War, and was the recipient of the highest awards for valor that the United States can bestow, the Congressional Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Medal, and the Distinguished Service Cross, all for extraordinary heroism in action, being one of the two Americans to receive all three decorations. He also received the Croix de Guerre and was made an officer of the Legion of Honor by France.
Colonel Donovan received his A. B. degree from Niagra and his LL. B. from Columbia. His present residence is in Washington, D. C. He was engaged as a member of the delegation representing the United States in the Conference between the United States and Canada relative to the customs regulations between these two countries in 1923.

UNIVERSITY ALUMNI HAVE PROMINENT PART IN 1929 COMMENCEMENT
Alumni from all parts of the country and representing nearly every Notre Dame graduating class from 1880 to 1928, are honored guests of the University during the weekend of Notre Dame’s Eighty-fifth Commencement exercises. Old faces are seeing things, new buildings, and a newer and a bigger Notre Dame. Alumni Secretary James Armstrong and his office personnel spent a busy day yesterday registering alumni and assigning them to rooms in Lyons, Morrissey, and Howard. As a result Notre Dame’s “Gold Coast” is
teeming with tales of wild escapades back “in the good old days” in Sorin, Corby,-and Badin.
The Faculty Dining hall last night was the scene of the class of 82’s reunion dinner. Not to be outdone in this respect the classes of 1883, 1884, 1885, 1901, 1902, 1903, 1904, 1920, 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924 also held informal reunion dinners either in the Faculty Dining hall, the Student Dining halls, or in some convenient though secluded little Blue and Gold or Turkish room in one of the South Bend hotels. After the dinners most of the alumni attended the University Theatre’s presentation of “Julius Caesar” in Washington Hall.	.
The alumni attended a Requiem High Mass in a body for the repose of the souls of deceased alumni this morning at 8 o’clock in the Sacred Heart Church. At 10 a. m. the members of the Alumni Board met in executive session in the Administration Building. The Alumni Office was also busy this morning registering late arrivals.
Alumni badges will admit all alumni free of charge to the Notre Dame-Illinois Athletic Club dual track meet this afternoon on Cartier Field. Sabin Carr, world’s record holder in the pole vault; Ray Conger, internationally known miler, and several other track and field stars will be on hand with the I. A. C. outfit which will oppose Coach John P. Nicholson’s trackmen.
The annual alumni banquet will be held tonight in the East Dining Hall. Brief speeches will be in order from prominent alumni. The 430 graduates of the class of ’29 will be guests at this banquet. Shortly after the banquet Professor Joseph J. Casasanta will present his University Glee Club, Columbia and Vitaphone recording artists, in the annual Commencement concert in Washington Hall. The concert is scheduled to start at 8 o’clock. The alumni will have another get-together in the form of the alumni smoker immediately after the Glee Club concert. The smoker will be held in the West Dining Hall and will be patterned after the old Brownson Hall affairs.
The annual alumni meeting will be held in Washington Hall at 2 p. m. tomorrow. At this meeting the class of 1929 will be welcomed officially into the Alumni Association, and the results of the alumni election will be announced.

CLAIR J. BLACKALL, CLASS VALEDICTORIAN
Mr. Clair J. Blackall, of North Baltimore, Ohio, is the valedictorian of the class of 1929. Mr. Blackall is graduating from the College of Science with the highest scholastic
honors Notre Dame can bestow, a “maxima cum laude.”
No more worthy man, than Mr. Blackall could have been chosen of the class of 1929, to deliver the farewell address.
Unassuming, and reserved in demeanor, Mr. Blackall stand high in the esteem of his professors and classmates. His is the quiet, unobtrusive way of the man of character and unchallenged ability.
The high purpose evidence in his address today is in that an uncompromising morality is our only stay in a materialistic world.

The 'University of Notre Dame considers the spiritual
welfare of its students as something of the most vital im
portance, and certainly that is as it should be. The task of
REV. JOHN F. O’HARA, C.S.C.
controlling the religious life of our students is entrusted to the Reverend John F. O’Hara, C.S.C., who admits that he was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on May 1, 1888. Early in his youth Father O’Hara left the United States with his parents for South America, his father having been appointed to represent the United States as consul in the countries on the east coast of South America.
After serving in a secretarial capacity in the consular and diplomatic service from 1905 to 1908,
Father O’Hara returned to the United States and
in 1909 enrolled in the University of Notre Dame. Due to the knowledge of Spanish which he gained while in South America, he qualified as an instructor of Spanish at Notre Dame, and while yet a student he was the sole instructor of the Castilian tongue in the University at the time.
In 1911 he received the degree of Bachelor of Philosophy from the University, and he then entered Holy Cross Seminary to study for the priesthood, to which he was ordained in 1916. The year following his ordination he was made Dean of the College of Commerce, and the year after that, because of his intense interest in religious work, he was appointed Prefect of Religion to succeed the Rev. Charles L. O’Donnell, C.S.C., now president of the University. He is still Prefect of Religion, but the College of Commerce grew so rapidly that in 1924 he was forced to resign as its Dean because of the condition of his health, which was impaired by the immense amount of labor entailed in the conscientious performance of both positions.
It was indeed fortunate for the students of both that time and this that he retained his position as Prefect of Religion, for if he had not there is a possibility that many of us would not have become acquainted with this great priest, inspired by Pius X, who has been so successful in bringing the Holy Grail to the faithful among the student body at Notre Dame. Father John O’Hara is without doubt the priest best known to the students here at Notre Dame. This is due largely to the daily and intimate contact he has with each and every one of them through the medium of the Religious Bulletin, of which he is both editor and publisher.
Besides the Religious Bulletin Father O’Hara also edits the Religious Survey, which is published annually as a separate part of the University Bulletin. The eighth edition of the Religious Survey was recently issued. It is a compilation in book form of the most noteworthy answers submitted in reply to the questionnaire given out the preceding Spring. It was a novel idea when Father O’Hara first published it eight years ago, but since then it has attracted a good deal of attention and present day educators consider it an important contribution to the study of undergraduate life.
Coupled with these two publications he has for the benefit
of the students a pamphlet rack adjoining the chapel in Sorin Hall. This rack is unquestionably one of the best and most extensive collections of its kind. It contains short articles concerning everything that might be of interest to a Catholic student, written by writers who are authorities on such matters of Faith and the like.
Outside of his class hours Father O’Hara is always to be found in Sorin Hall. Throughout the morning he is in Sorin Chapel hearing confessions and distributing Communion, and during the rest of the day one may find him in his office, ever ready to help and advise students in any difficulty.

In the old days, when a man was dead he was dead—make no mistake about that. With all these modern methods of
resusitation, however, it has become quite difficult to deter
PROFESSOR FRANK KELLY
mine precisely what constitutes the state of permanent deadness—if we may be permitted to use that expression. For example, when we witnessed the very satisfactory way that “the noblest Roman of them all” knifed the hapless Caesar on last St. Patrick’s night, we hardly expected to see the estimable emperor trod the boards of .Washington Hah again. And, at that time, we regretted the fact very much; first of all because Mr. Rowland was a friend of ours; and secondly, because we really wanted to see the whole performance over again.
It seems, now, that our first assumption was incorrect,
and our last wish was gratified. Last night the University Theatre again presented its production of “Julius Caesar” for the benefit of the guests at the Commencement exercises, and also for all students who found it possible to attend. The
decision to revive “Julius Caesar” was made only after numerous requests for repetition of the play had been received by the directors of the Theatre, and Washington Hall was filled to capacity for the presentation.
The play was the most successful from an artistic standpoint that the University Theatre has presented in its three years of existence, even exceeding the first production in many respects. The acting was almost perfect; the settings excellent, and the direction worthy of being classed with that of many professional effects. In fact the entire production could be placed in the first rank of amateur performances.
As was the case with the first presentation of “Julius Caesar,” the play was entirely in the hands of Professor Frank Kelly. He directed the entire production and also played the part of Mark Antony. As head of the Department of Speech at the University, Mr. Kelly is well versed in all details of theatrical production, and it is largely owing to his indefatigable efforts that the play was so successfully enacted last evening.
With the exception of a few minor roles, the cast of the production was the same as that of the first presentation. Professor Kelly in the role of Mark Antony exhibited a keen understanding of the lines and a remarkable power of expression which found enthusiastic favor with the audience. Mr. Albert J. Doyle’s performance in the role of Brutus left nothing to be desired. His characterization was marked by that nice restraint and sympathy of interpretation that fea
tured his acting in the first production. The role of Cassius could not have been better filled than by Mr. John Leddy, whose portrayal of the part which is so often overdone even by the best professionals, could not have been improved upon. Mr. John Rowland not only looked like Julius Caesar, but acted like that illustrious Roman so well that he even outdid his previous splendid performance in the same role. Too much credit cannot be given Miss Pauline Jellison’s characterization of the part of Portia, wife of. Brutus, and the interpretation of Calpurnia, wife of Caesar, which was so excellently acted by Miss Collmer. These two ladies sacrificed time and trouble to assist the University Theatre in the production, and Notre Dame is indeed grateful for their kind and valuable assistance.
The acting of the minor characters was also finely portrayed, and the mob scenes would have done credit to a professional performance so well planned and executed were they. Due credit must also be given Professor Charles Phillips of the English department, whose excellent adaptation of the text of the original play to suit the needs of the Theatre did much to insure the success of the production.

JOE ABBOTT TO CAPTAIN 1930 TRACK TEAM; ELDER ENDS BRILLIANT SPRINT CAREER
Joseph Abbott, of Rutherford, New Jersey, a junior in the College of Physical Education, was elected captain of the Notre Dame track team for next year at a meeting of the monogram winners, held last Thursday in the gymnasium. He will succeed Jack Elder, who winds up his collegiate career as a sprinter against the Illinois Athletic club this afternoon on Cartier field.
Abbott, a consistent point winner in his sophomore and
junior years, was forced out of track competition this year due to illness. His record as a half-miler in other years is an enviable one ,having won many points in his specialty. He ran second to Alvo Martin of Purdue in the state track meet for two years. He holds the gymnasium record for this event at Illinois, and the outdoor record in the Central Intercollegiate Conference games. He has also garnered points in the various dual meets. He will rejoin the track squad in 1930.	■
. The election was unique in that it elevated to the captaincy a man who had not participated in competition for more than a year.
Jack Elder, retiring captain, will end his period of collegiate competition as one of the outstanding dash men in the United States today. He is also one of the finest sprinters Notre Dame has ever turned out. He has equaled the world’s record for the sixty-yard dash eleven times; the forty-yard dash three times; holds the official world’s record for the 75-yard dash, and has consistent records of 9.3-5 for the century and 21.5 for the 220-yard dash. He was also a member of the famous Notre Dame 440-yard relay team which cracked the world’s record for this event at the Kansas relays in 1926.

SCIENCE ACADEMY FETES FATHER WENNINGER ON RETURN FROM EUROPE
The Reverend Francis J. Wenninger, C.S.C., Ph.D., returned to the University Friday, May 24, after a two-year study in the University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria, where he recently received his degree of Doctoi* of Philosophy.
Father Wenninger spoke of his experiences and studies in Europe at a reception held for him Friday night in Science Hall by the Academy of Science, which he founded.
The talk was a personal account of the system of scientific education at Vienna, the system and customs at Oxford, and the conditions in France, Germany, and Italy, countries which he visited during his European stay.
Father Wenninger was introduced to the men by Robert Schulz, president of the Academy, who was attending his last meeting. Mr. Schulz is graduating from the College of Science this June.
The duties of dean of the College of Science will be taken up by Father Wenninger at the beginning of school in September.

Over four hundred young men, educated in a Catholic university, will tomorrow afternoon be -graduated. Their four years at the University are ended. They have achieved their ultimate scholastic goal—a degree—and the time is at hand for them to enter into the business of the world and to earn themselves their proper niches in society.
This editorial is not meant to preach or to moralize. Neither is it meant to impress upon these men that the world will judge them critically as to the worth of the University whose degrees they attach to their names. It is meant solely to suggest to them the most efficacious use to which they may put their Notre Dame training.
In their years at the University they cannot but have obtained a new slant upon their religion, an intellectual slant which has made them appreciate and evaluate their faith as probably they never appreciated and evaluated it before. For the most part these men have builded upon the foundation of intelligent understanding a faith which will be a source of consolation to them as long as they live. For the most part they have been drawn more closely to their faith in bonds of the strongest tensity—bonds of a sincere, tender love—than they ever have been before. And for the most part they are well qualified to explain the fundamental doctrines of their faith to non-Catholics. This they should do at every opportunity, on every hand.
, In every Notre Dame man’s heart there is indelibly inscribed in letters of faith—God, Country, and Notre Dame. This is the sacred triumverate about which centers all that is good and constructive and	.
noble in life to him. Particularly so is this true cf the graduate. He is entering a world in which materialistic and atheistic principles are steadily growing in dominance, a world of speed, of sensationalism, of the almighty dollar instead of Almighty God. Yet, never before in the history of our country has the time been more ripe, the situation more propitious for making better known the doctrines of Catholicism among non-Catholics than the present. The seed of truth if sown in the minds of tolerant, reasonable non-Catholics is bound to bear fruit and result in a much better and more comprehensive understanding among them as to what the Catholic Church is and what she teaches. And the graduate of a Catholic university such as Notre Dame is bound to be a potent force in this favorable publicity for the Church.
To the average Protestant Catholicism is regrettably but little, if at all, understood. To many nonCatholics it is an enigma. But no matter how much the fundamental doctrines of Catholicism are mis-	;
understood, its purposes maligned, its services ridiculed by its enemies, most non-Catholics appreciate	'
the fact that there must be something worthwhile to a religion which has over twenty million adherents	:
in this country alone.	i
We Catholics appreciate what is worthwhile in our religion—the elements of divine origin, un-	|
broken continuity through the centuries, and the I ope of ultimate salvation. That is why we are	:
Catholics. But most non-Catholics while realizing vaguely that there is something tending for permanency in the Catholic Church which makes it worthwhile, misunderstand or fail to understand at aP	|
in what respects it is worthwhile.	<
Therefore, it is up to us, graduates of a Catholic university, to enunciate and explain clearly the	i
elements which make the Catholic religion worthwhile. Light is the great dispeller of darkness. Sim-	j
ilarly, truth is the great dispeller of ignorance, of. prejudice, of misunderstanding. Let us not forget	'
then, that as graduates we owe it to our God, to our country, and to Notre Dame to propagate among	"
non-Catholics at all times, on every hand, the truth concerning the faith which is our most treasured and revered possession.	—J. v. H.	;

^he Patriotism of
JOHN P.
z=sy>OR those of us who are graduating this is, indeed, a patriotic occasion, for in the eyes of the nation a man who graduates from college is a potential leader of his fellow citizens. And as he is a good or a bad citizen-leader .so will be his numerous and less educated followers. Hence, at time of graduation it is a concern of the nation to know how well such men are equipped for leadership and it is a concern of the graduate to know how well his training has fitted him for this function.
We have chosen a kind of education which is not a popular one. We have introduced into our studies something which is omitted by most college men in America—namely, Christian Doctrine. As American, our patriotism is needful to the republic; as college graduates, who aspire to be leaders of others, our patriotism is vital to the republic. Therefore, as graduates of a Christian education in America, we must be prepared to show clearly that such education is patriotic.
We have assumed, with most Americans, that this is a Christian nation. We have assumed that to be educated as Christians, not as pagans, is to put ourselves more in harmony with the principles of American government. Is America, then, a Christian nation? To ask that question seems almost treason. If there be any conviction, held in common by all Americans, inherited from the first days of the Republic, invoked almost as a solemn prayer in times of crisis, ingrained from the beginning in our national consciousness, it is the conviction that America is a’Christian nation.
What do we mean by saying that America is Christian? We do not mean that our country excludes those who are not Christians. That, in itself, would be un-Christian. We do not mean that any religion, or that any minister of religion should control the affairs of government. We do not mean that the man who is not a Christian should be denied the right to vote, or the right to hold office. We do not mean that Christianity is a national religion . We mean that it is ■ a national culture. When Americans affirm that this country ; is Christian, they mean that it has been discovered and de! velopsd by Christians. They think of the early discoverers - and explorers planting the cross in the new soil; they think * of the settlements of Christian pioneers in New England, in * Maryland, along the Atlantic seaboard, around the missions I of the Middle-West and on the Pacific Coast. Even in our ! daily conversation we cannot help but testify to the Chris-| tianity of the pioneers who gave to their towns such Chri-; stian names as St. Louis, St. Paul, San Antonio, San Fran-| cisco. When Americans speak of the Christianity of the ‘ nation they mean that American government is founded upon | Christian principles. They recall, perhaps, that when Jeffer-| son in his draft of the Declaration of Independence had no | reference to the Deity; Congress very deliberately put it in. ; They recall that the laws of the United States and of the j several states are founded upon the Magna Charta and its | purely Christian principles. They recall that our presidents | and other public men have, numberless times, spoken of this | as a Christian nation. They may recall that only thirty | years ago the Supreme Court of the United States declared I' unanimously, ‘‘This is a Christian nation.”
! Now, if America is a Christian country, Christian education is a necessity. It is a necessity because the Christian culture is dur traditional culture; because as such it is the foundation of American patriotism; because in it Americans have a bond of understanding and sympathy which binds
Christian Education
O’NEILL
them to each other; to the early founders, and to the laws of the country. We could not discard Christian culture without discarding our patriotism.	,
It is in this bond, this common tie of a common culture, that the strength of our* nation lies. Confident that America still has this strong spiritual bond Americans face the future undaunted, undaunted even by the numerous social evils of today, or by such a calamity as the World War. But while we are confident of America’s Christianity, let us be watchful also, let us guard it jealously against indifference and skepticism. For we know that when the decay of skepticism attacks our nation we may fear the worst . We know that when the man in the street loses faith in the ideals that built this country, already the government shall have begun to totter, for the man in the street is the government. And how shall the man in the street be loyal to his Christian heritage if the men who lead us are not loyal?	•
And surely there is need for a more real Christianity in our country today. The thoughtful American, while marveling at our strides in engineering, our conquests in commerce, and our stupendous achievements in science, must at the same time tremble at the signs which tell him that America is in danger of becoming Christian only in name. Of these signs the most noticeable is the growing secularism of Christian churches and the steady falling off of their adherents. That many Christian churches are today in chaos is only too evident from the panic among the leaders in these churches.
The fact that Christian principles are losing ground in . politics is one of America’s sorest grievances. When we con- -sider that the Christian gentleman may not accept or give a bribe, that he may not use public funds to reward his friends, either outright or through the public payroll; that he may not wink at crime entrenched^behind wealth; that he may not use his country or its property as a tool for any selfish purpose; that he must keep his Christianity even at the sacrifice of his political career—when we consider these things we see what an unprofitable profession American politics is becoming for the real Christian.
In the perverted Christianity of today one often finds politics and religion fused into what for many people is their only Christianity. For instance, we have the creed ‘ of Nationalism. This is neither Christianity nor patriotism, although at times it has disguised itself as both. The Nationalist urges his country to worldly gain, even at the sacrifice of national honor and world peace. The patriot values the honor of his country above all else. The altars of this creed of Nationalism are set up in Christian churches which it has invaded and in the temples of commerce which it has called its own. Nationalism has prompted ministers of Christianity to sacrifice their God upon altars of perverted patriotism and to come shouting into the street, into the politicians’ club and into the back alleys of legislation. Nationalism has prompted its disciples of the business world to use the power of capital to bring the world into submission to a selfish national culture, a culture opposed to all true patriotism and all true Christianity.
The mission of Nationalism is selfishness ,and selfishness leads to national strife. The recent World War is a plain example of what will happen when Nationalism is substituted by an ambitious country for a Christian concept of national and international life. But even after the terrible lesson of
The Notre Dame Scholastic
993
that War, Nationalism still prevails throughout the civilized world. When, but yesterday, as history runs, supposedly Christian nations gathered at the peace conference there was much greedy talk of reparations and indemnities. No representative of Christian teaching was invited to attend, no one who did attend dared to make a plea for Christian principle, Christian justice and Christian charity in international rela-. tions. Contrast with this scene of un-Christian avarice a similar occasion toward the close of the Revolutionary War. It was the first Independence Day, July 4, 1779. To thank God for the preservation of the new nation through its first year, the President and Members of Congress, together with state officials, gathered in a Christian chapel, for the solemn singing of the “Te Deum.” In those days, the only voice raised against this act of Christian patriotism was the voice of the traitor, Benedict Arnold.
Opposed to Nationalism are Patriotism and Christianity. Nationalism is not patriotic, for its creed of national avarice eventually destroys the nation’s honor and plunges it into war, just as excessive selfishness draws the individual into ■ conflict with his fellowmen . On the other hand, Christianity is patriotic, for, it commands allegiance to one’s country and it forbids national greed and imperialism, which destroy the national honor.
Because this creed of Nationalism has already become firmly rooted in many other countries of the world, we must be ever on guard against its growth in our own country, for America, with hundreds of different Christian sects and with a strong, but often innocent patriotism, is falling an easy prey to this parasite.
In business, too, Christianity is fast losing ground among the less scrupulous. When Christian culture is a strong national voice there are few who dare defy it. But when it falters before the new philosophy of “Do what you please, but don’t get caught” society has no defense against unscrupulous men of business. Corruption and bribery of city officials by private corporations is an everyday occurrence. The corruption of high officials of the national government by a private corporation a few years ago is still remembered to the shame of the American people. There are still many corporations which defy Christian principles of a living wage and a fair guarantee against wholesale unemployment. A few years ago when the United States Coal Commission investigated nine large anthracite coal mines, it was reported that the majority of these corporations were making the exorbitant profit of more than 31 per cent on investments and at the same time were hiring thousands of men, exposing
them to constant danger of death or injury and paying them less than a living wage. A year ago, some United States Senators, touring these same mines were horrified at the conditions under which the miners were forced to work and live. If Christianity were strong in this country, how long could such dishonesty and inhumanity last?	•-	_ .
What does all this mean to the graduate of a Christian education? It means that if he sell his Christianity in business or in public office, if he be ashamed to stand as a Christian when he sees the parasites of Nationalism and Paganism eating at the foundations of his country; if he can sit by while un-Christian radicals and grafters' twist and pervert the laws and the culture of the nation, then he is not a Christian gentleman; he is not a patriot; he is a traitor. And in the scheme of Christian education there is no place for such. That is the answer of Christian education to the roll-call of patriotism. '
Gentlemen, we are gathering together for the last time as if to renew a common pledge to one another before becoming scattered apart forever. We wear black as if conscious that the pledge is a solemn and a sober one. And what is this pledge? Is it that we are to be successful professional or business men, or eminent scholars? No, for too many of us have come great distances when we could have learned these things near at hand. What, then, is the pledge we make? Be silent, and the very echoes of this old campus will answer. It is a pledge that has been made and renewed for each day we have spent here; it is the pledge that built this University—the only excuse for its continued existence or our own presence here. It is the pledge that from here shall go forth only Christian gentlemen.	-
We are about to make that pledge and to accept'a challenge. It is the challenge of the sophisticated and cynical. It is the challenge of those multitudes who have scorned Christian education and are about to engage us in the struggle of life, prepared to prove that we have made a mistake in our choice. It is the challenge which we cannot escape, hurled at us because we have chosen an education which is different and individual; it is a challenge to our patriotism. And not only our University, but also our country,'anxiously awaits the answer that each man will give. It is the' challenge which dares us to make good, which dares us to carry our Christianity with us into the battle of business, of professional life, of public office and to go down fighting, as others have gone down, rather than sacrifice that Christianity and that patriotism.

Of dusk stood lonely on a parapet,
Ascending from his lips, Macswift began
And as the stars broke through their chrysalis
The cogitations which the stars provoke
He watched, and drew upon his cigarette.
Forever in the troubled heart of man.
The sharp geometry of one great star
Exilic memories stirred in his mind
That swung alone, a crystal in the sky.
Of that lost land noiv laid away in gold,
Caught at his throat, and cut against the far
That lost fantastic land that lies behind
■ Cold shadows with its perfect symmetry.
A gateway broken, and a river cold.
A ivind with rain blew upward from the east_
By ivhat unhappy ways lie left that land
And placed its dripping fingers on his face, And though the shadoived sky gave not the least
Only a bitter taste remains to tell;
These things are all forgotten, yet his handle
Assurance of a moon, he sought a trace
At times repeats the gesture of farewell.
Of moonlight, for he felt the need of such
But ivhat faint light the shining pentagons
Romantic properties to fix the scene
Inscribe upon the air is too jmecise
More to his mood; the stars disturbed too much
An argentine to finger skeletons,—
With their austere perfection, bright and keen.
The past’s forgotten bones will not suffice.
To be alone ivith stars within the brief
Within the vast, dark shifting of the light,
Sad changing of the light demands a heart Of steady equilibrium, belief
Unshaken, and firm strength in every part.
His eyes unequal to the stars’ cold stare,
Macswift blew smoke against the coming night, And kneiv confusion darker than the air.
Those stars, those stars, he could not raise his head
Up to those stars that burned immaculate
Against the sky; and over him was shed
The wind's cold, wet, intolerable weight.

Why were those stars set there complete, alone,
Could searched out wisdom give the hidden word,
While all his mind made riot with no guess
Or must he plead the darkened face of death?
To set it straight, not one indexing stone
And listen ivithin himself he heard

To point, and mark, and mutely tvhisper, “Yes”?
No ansiver but the movement of his breath.
He could not raise his head while all before
But all at once the shadowed skies gave place
Him stretched a dark, uncertain way; no horn
To bright lucidity, and stars cried down
To call him forward; only to implore
Upon the upturned gesture of his face,

The inexplicable; the unicorn
And all the hope that seemed almost to drown

Of unicorns to chase, but not believe
Beat upward as he heard the testament
The verity of that for which he sought.
Of stars within the dusk, and knew that they
Always to stand confused while two lights weave
Were not at all a cold perfection sent
A subtle net in which the stars are caught?
To trouble weary dust with sad dismay,

And was not this the end of seeking done,
But held with him the measure of a beat,
The final word that ended each surprise,
And he must keep his strength as theirs was kept,
To see beneath the death of each hot sun
Unshaken in the face of each defeat.
Old men, old men, with sleep beneath their eyes?
On every hand the dusk cried out, “Accept!”
Could cigarettes and metaphysics mix
And then within himself he felt a stir
Within his mind an alchemy to make
Those stars seem less ironical, and fix
A resolution which no stress could break?
.4s all the rythm of his blood sent out „ An answering. And in his mind there ivere
No echoes but the echoes of that shout. .

On dusk, stood lonely on a parapet,
And lifting up his face toward the stars,
He waved a greeting with his cigarette.

The Notre Dame Scholastic
Clair J. Blackhall
IGHT Reverend Bishop, Reverend Fathers, and Friends: The Notre Dame men of 1929 are now at the end of their college career. On an occasion of this kind there is a common disposition to emphasize the sadness of graduation, to the neglect of other thoughts which commencement should inspire. The sadness of our event comes from the fact that the past has been clear and bright, and not from any misgiving in regard to the future. We can rest assured that the preparation for life received here gives us pledge of success in both a material and a spiritual way.
The University of Notre Dame may indeed be proud of the schooling she gives to her students, but her special glory lies in her uncompromising emphasis upon character, especially upon that phase of character which enjoins in the first place loyalty to God, and in the second devotion to country. Giving God the first place in our homage is not, as some regard it, an act of treason to government. It makes stronger the right of government over its subjects. Reverence for the supreme source of authority, law, and order will always prompt respect for human authority and obedience to it.
In the June of every year an army of graduates goes forth into the world from the colleges of the country. In the cases of many of them religion has little or no part in their philosophy of life. Now man is very apt to think and speak and act as he has been trained to think in the days of his youth. If religion has had no part in his education, his philosophy will be largely, perhaps fatally, of the materialistic sort, and we know that materialistic principle is a veiy poor foundation for the kind of life a man ought to live. The Notre Dame education provides religious training in the right measure as the basis of all knowledge and of all conduct worthy of the human being. It is this very fact which prompts the high esteem in which Notre Dame is held by all who have an appreciation of the real values in human life.
It is not the whole aim and ambition of Notre Dame to teach the mere lessons of the curriculum. After four years here we cannot but believe that Father Sorin had much more than that in mind in the founding of this school. In 1838
he was ordained to the priesthood in France, and shortly afterward he was invited by the Bishop of Vincennes to establish here in Indiana a branch of the Congregation of Holy Cross. Accordingly, he sailed for this country in the August of 1841 in company with six brothers of the Congregation. After a year or so in southern Indiana they came here . Though the place was at that time but a small mission in the wilderness, it impressed Father Sorin with its fitness as a site for his school. With enthusiasm he determined to establish here a college, which he named Notre Dame du Lac. Deeply and solidly in the Christian faith he laid the foundation of the institution, and the Notre Dame of today is the magnificent monument to his genius and zeal in religion and in education. All the rest of his long life Father Sorin spent here. In the course of duty he made many trips abroad, but his heart was always at Notre Dame. His was a life rich in every real respect and without doubt he knew that among the recollections which brighten and enrich the fading years of a man are the pleasant associations of his earlier years. If he intended to provide these for Notre Dame, and we cannot doubt that he did, he chose this spot with rare judgment. The natural beauties of Notre Dame make time seem swift and memory perennially pleasant.
These are but two or three of the reasons why Notre Dame is long and lovingly remembered by all her sons. Among the best things which the student of Notre Dame takes with him into life are the memories of his associations with his classmates and with the priests, and brothers, and lay teachers of the University. We of the class of 1929 are second to none in our appreciation of these treasures.
Students are sometimes assured by their elders that their school days are the happiest of their lives. But good sense tells us that the best days of our life should be those in which we can do the most good. The years at college are but a preparation for the work, for the good that we are to do in life. Of course this does not mean that our Alma Mater will not always hold a most sacred place in our hearts. If our lives be truly successful, as we hope they may be, then Notre Dame will surely have merited a large share of the credit. Our days here are now at an end, and we wish, before leaving, to bid them and our school a fond farewell.

By consuming a total of 19% pies, two more than his nearest competitor, Dick DeRose, of College of the City Detroit, won the college’s pie-eating contest. Excerpts from the story of the contest, as told by the Detroit Collegian, follow:
“Berkhaw, DeRose’s nearest competitor, claims he lost due to the fact that two Home Ec girls (who are suspected of being in cahoots with DeRose) fed him sandwiches and cake before the contest.
“DeRose, although he was the smallest contestant, has a reputation in pie-eating circles as a past master in the art of consuming circular pastries. He modestly attributes his skill to the fact that his mouth has become slightly enlarged due to excessive cheer leading.
“Three of the contestants were ruled out when it was discovered that they were stuffing pies under their- shirts. Theodore Barusch, senior debater, insisted on eating only blueberry pies and was finally thrown out.”

According to the University Daily Kansan, a- chair built of rocks salvaged from the first building erected on the University of Kansas campus is the scene of the traditional selection of new members of the Sachem society, honorary society for senior men. The selection takes place in the manner used by the Iroquois Indians at their annual council to choose leaders or sachems for each of the tribes making up the Iroquois nation.
* * * *
In order to awaken a sense of responsibility in the junior class and because this same class was noted (according to the seniors) for its total lack of interest or activity in the university, Bob Behlow, member of the class of ’29 and president of the student body, recently challenged the president of the junior class to a paddling duel.
The Southern California Daily Trojan quotes Behlow as making this statement:
“It doesn’t seem possible to instill any loyalty or any Trojan spirit into this hopeless bunch by any ordinary means, so I have devised this method of beating some sense into them. I think the means is admirably appropriate, and particularly so on Newman, who is notorious for not having his brain in the usual location.”
Among the rules for the duel were these:
1.	Paddles shall be made of the usual barrel staves.
2.	Nails, spikes, brads and other impediments are barred.
3.	Each contestant shall have alternate swats.
4.	The first man to give up, or drop, shall be declared loser.
5.	Padding, two pairs of trousers, extra thick cords, and similar protections are barred.
Red-haii-ed girls get a big hand from Mrs. Helen Murphy, director of girls’ physical training at Texas Christian university. According to Mrs. Murphy, the Titian-haired lasses are more athletic than blondes and brunettes. “I cannot think of a single instance where a red-haired girl is not an all-around sport,” she said, “and loves to play at games as hard as she can.”

Life became so dull in West Philadelphia recently that five hundred University of Pennsylvania students staged a riot and took charge of the signal lights at a street intersection near the campus. They switched the red, green, and yellow signals at split-second intervals, tying up traffic in a jam that required half an hour to disentangle. Trolley poles were jerked from the wires and torpedoes placed on the tracks. By the time the police reserves arrived, the explosions, yells of the students, and honking of horns were producing a din that rivalled the historic Tower of Babel scene.

Why the library hides all the good books and tells the students they are on.faculty use.
Why eight o’clock exams are postponed until the last day.
Why classes will be held on the Friday after Memorial day.
Why it costs so much to get a degree from the University.
Why term papers aren’t substituted for finals in many of the courses.
Why some universities don’t believe in freedom of the press.
Why Aeons exist.

THE YEAR IN REVIEW
SCHOLASTIC
John V. Hinkel, Editor-In-Chief
David W. Saxon, Managing Editor
Business Manager alumni and noted Catholics
The Scholastic concludes its fifty-seventh consecutive year of existence with this issue. The magazine has endeavored sincerely to live up to the traditions established by other volumes of the publication. Whether or not it has succeeded is left entirely to the faculty members and students who were forced through no choice of their own to receive the “Scholastic” every Friday afternoon.
The outstanding accomplishment of the magazine was the change in format which was inaugurated with the second semester. The page size was increased slightly and the type-style reduced from ten-point to eight. There was no addition in the number of pages, however. Several new featuures were also incorporated in the new format. The introduction of “Men You Know’,” which is a weekly column devoted to a short biographical sketch of some prominent member of the faculty; a book review’ section; and, the publication of articles by prominent w’ere important features in the
new editorial policy of the magazine.
Mr. John V. Hinkel, of Washington, D. C., served as editor-in-chief during the past year. He was assisted by Mr. David Saxon, of Memphis, Tenn., managing editor, and Mr. Vincent McIntire, of Zanesville, Ohio, as assistant managing editor. Mr. Bernard A. Walsh, of Springfield, Ill., handled the College Parade. Mr. Cyril A. Mullen, of Chicago, Ill., wrote a very creditable Week during the initial half of the first semester. After his resignation, brought on by pressing outside interests, he wTas succeeded by Mr. Archer Hurley, of Friendship, New’ York, who successfully continued where Mr. Mullen left off.
The Music and Drama department w’as wTell taken care of
by Mr. James J. Walsh, Jr., of New’ York. Mr. John DeRoulet, of Chicago, Ill., occupied the position of literary editor and handled the Week in a highly commendable and clever way, until he, too, wTas forced to resign because of extremely important outside affairs which demanded his full time and attention. Mr. Murray Hickey Ley, of Des Moines, Iowa, Mr. De Roulet’s successor as head of the literary board, handled his duties in such consistently splendid fashion that he w’as recently appointed to be next year’s editor-in-chief.
Mr. Harry Sylvester, of Brooklyn, New York, and Mr. Gilbert Prendergast, sports editors, Mr. Jolin Kiener, of Cleveland, Ohio, Inter-hall Sports Editor, Mr. John Bergan of South Bend, Ind , new’s editor, with the other members of the staff, also worked hard and faithfully throughout the year.
JUGGLER
There may have been—and assuredly there have been— great editors of the Juggler—but just as surely there have been none greater than the “Funny Fellow’” of this year— Joseph P. McNamara. McNamara worked consistently, efficiently, and effectively. Never for one moment did he abandon his purpose of making the Juggler the very best college publication in the country. His ideas were always brilliant and original. His fertile mind conceived and carried out plans that transcended anything ever tried at Notre Dame—and for that matter, anywhere else.
Mr. McNamara inaugurated several new’ ideas in the field of comic publications during the year. In the first place, two oil covers were used on this year’s Juggler. This marks the first time that such a practice has been attempted by any collegiate publication. Both of these covers were reproductions of original oil canvasses painted exclusively for the Juggler by Paul McElroy. Their success w’as instantaneous and widespread. Next, Mr. McNamara produced two full page sketches of Knute K. Rockne and Captain Miller of the Notre Dame football team. These pictures were also drawm by McElroy.
In speaking of Paul McElroy, art editor of the Juggler, one cannot avoid using superlatives. McElroy’s drawings contributed in no small measure to the success of the publication. His covers w’ere both beautiful and unique; his

work in the interior of the magazine was always of the highest possible merit.
CHARLES GASS
Business Manager
The Juggler will lose five associate editors this year. John De Roulet, who contributed so much of the sparkling satire that pleases the campus; Dick Zimmer-ly, whose work was far above the usual collegiate level, and whose cover drew the praise of professional critics; Tom Lawless, whose sketches enlivened almost every page of the book; Dave Lehman, whose remarks on the Theatre and criticism of the various dramatic productions auger well for his future success; and Walter McMorrow, who was always dependable and
whose humorous quips never failed to draw applause.
The business end of the magazine was also more than capably taken care of by Mr. Charles Gass, business manager, and Mr. Frank McAdams, circulation manager.
SCRIBBLERS
Literary men have always been wont to gather about a
table in groups to discuss the matters of a literary world. Here at Notre Dame, the Scribbler room in the Organizations
John de Roulet
Building is the scene of such a discussion each week. Here the budding writers of the campus bring their work and have it praised or blamed, as it deserves, and receive all the help that sincere criticism and earnest advice can give.
The work of the Scribblers this year marked an advance in the activities of the club. In its campus activity the annual Poetry Contest was the outstanding event. Theodore Maynard, Vincent Engels and Catherine Bregy, noted American poets, were
the judges who picked Murray Young’s poem, “The End of Labor,” as first prize winner; Brother Basil’s “Past Communion,” as second, and Cyril Mullen’s “The Man of Imagination,” as third prize winner. Close to a hundred poems were submitted by campus poets taking part in the contest, carrying on Notre Dame’s tradition of singing youth.
In the course of the year, several lecturers gather with the members to discuss literary matters. This year’s program included Mr. Fredericks, editor of The Midland, and ' Mr. Maynard. The Rev. Leo Ward, C.S.C., was a very interesting campus lecturer, as was Professor Charles Phillips, both members of the department of English at the University.
The Scribblers this year lose many of their best members through graduation. Mr. Young, the president of the Club,
and without a doubt the outstanding campus poet, is succeeded by Cyril Mullen, who was secretary for the last two years, and Murray Ley is secretary for next year. Although the older members leave places that will be hard to fill, the younger men have shown their ability well enough to dispel all fear as to the future of the club, and the following year should be even more successful than the last.
STUDENT MANAGERS
AUGUST M. GRAMS
One probably often wonders just what kind of' an organization is behind the management of athletics with its countless important details for .the smooth functioning of the numerous games, contests and meets held at Notre Dame each year. The Manager’s Club is the center of managerial activity at Notre Dame. From its headquarters and office in the University Gymnasium come the delegation on numerous tasks so vital to the success of the affair. Every manager takes a distinct measure of pride in his endeavors and the spirit of cooperation backed by a high degree of efficiency all tend to make the promotion of athletics a very business like proposition.
The development of the Notre
Dame Managers of late has been due for the most part to the efforts of August M. Grams, assisted by Fred D. Schopp-mann and Thomas A. Ryan. Mr. Grams besides serving as Head Manager Tor two years handled the many details of football in a very efficient manner. Schoppmann was the man responsible for the successful staging of the Central Intercollegiate meet held at Notre Dame druing the indoor season.
Ryan guided the destinies of the Notre Dame Basketball team through a most successful season. As successors to these men the managers for the year 1929-30 give every indication of promise that could be wished for. Con J. Carey of Saranac Lake, will take Ryan’s place as basketball, manager. John J. Quinn of Massillon, Ohio, wall manage football and serve as Head-Manager for the next scholastic year. As his associate, Bernard Conroy of Pittsburgh will be on hand to assist in the direction of the Blue and Gold gridders. Track, including the staging of several indoor meets and other- outdoors, will be under the management of A. W. Keg-owicz, of Chicago, Illinois. J. Franklin O’Marah of Buffalo, New York, will act as associate manager of track for the Indoor and outdoor seasons. Robert T. Hellrung of St. Louis, Missouri, will again aid Coach’ Tom Mills in the handling of the Notre Dame baseball team for next year. Minor sports will be under the able direction of Gene J. Kennedy, of Brooklyn, New York.
The appointment as a Senior manager only comes to a man after three years of hard w-ork intermingled with many disallusions and disappointments coupled with many happy days and pleasant journeys. Other colleges and Universities throughout the country have displayed a keen interest in the system of Managers at Notre Dame and through correspondence they have obtained much valuable information on the system. Among the institutions who have received details of the organization are, the University of Wisconsin, the University of Missouri, Butler- University and the University of Iowa.	*	,

lesson from the drilling and formation work of the Notre Dame band, he paid the organization a compliment that was entirely deserved. Sixty-three m e n, led by a drum major and under the direction of Professor Joseph Casasanta, delighted the 120,000 spectators with perfect drilling and stirring martial music. The day was one to be remembered in the annals of Notre Dame’s bands.
But there were other high points in the year. The
annual concert given by the band in Washington Hall on March 4th proved that the band was qualified for handling overtures and symphonic arrangements as well as march music. After the Easter holidays, the men gave a concert in South Bend and then made a short trip through northern Ohio, stopping for concerts at several cities.
Every football game on Cartier field found the band men furnishing the inspiring music for the games. When the cheer-leader chanted “Everyone stay for the singing of the
Victory March,” the band led the massed voices in putting it over. Basketball and track contests of major importance were also occasions made more enjoyable by the programs by the band.
Among the social events of the year were several smokers. A compliment dance to the Junior Prom guests in February was given by the band, as well ■ as an entertainment for the J Carnegie Tech Band when ; the Scotch organization visited Notre Dame on that rainy day in November.
JOSEPH KEEFE
President of the Band
Joseph F. Keefe was president of the band; Patrick McLaughlin, publicity manager; Virgil Cline, vice-president; Henry Tholen, drum major, and Edmund Lea Mond, librarian.
Of the personnel of the band this year eleven of the sixty men will be graduated, giving a nucleus of fifty-two veterans for next year’s organization.
From their initial concert at Dixon, Illinois, in March till the final strains of their melodies die away after the commencement entertainment, the Glee Club has had a sea
son that will be remembered in Notre Dame musical history. Under the direction jf Professor Joseph Casa-santa, each selection was capably rendered; under ;he leadership of Fred Wagner, sweet-voiced baritone and president of the Club, each concert was a successful unit in the season’s program.
The opening concerts were held at Dixon and Rochelle, Illinois. Following this, the annual Easter tour was made, with the
FRED WAGNER
Glee Club President
new Music Hall of Cleve-
land, Ohio, as their first performance. The concert
there, given through the help of the Cleveland Alumni and Notre Dame College for Girls, was one of the most distinctive events held in that city this year. The Club then traveled, to Canton, Ohio, where another attractive program was given for fifteen hundred people at the City Auditorium. A dance followed each of these concerts.
Rochester, New York, held the record for attendance, when twenty-four hundred people packed the K. of C. hall to hear them. At Rome, New York, the Club dedicated the new Capitol Theater.
Anthony Kopecky, favorite soloist of the Club, was heard in most of the concerts on the trip and maintained his popularity in every respect. Fred Wagner, the president of the organization, charmed many an audience with his “Swinging Vine” and„ other selections. Accompanying the club were Zeno Staudt and Edward Donovan, banjo artists, and the Happy Four, John Beljon, William McAleer, Zeno Staudt and Thomas Salmon.
No little credit for the high place in music circles which the Glee Club holds must be given Director Joseph Casasanta, head of the Department of Music at the University. At the helm of the organization since his graduation in 1924, Professor Casasanta has carefully welded together a Glee Club second to no other collegiate glee club in the country. Considering the fact that two-thirds of last year’s personnel received their sheepskins last June, the success Professor Casasanta has achieved this year in rebuilding almost a new organization is doubly commendable.
Only eleven members are lost through graduation this year, however. These men, all of whom have had two or more years’ experience with the Club, are: Fred Wagner, Tiffin, Ohio; Anthony Kopecky, Chicago, III.; Fred M. Won-derlin, Des Moines, Iowa; Vincent F. Carney, New Rochelle, Ill.; William J. Donelan, Ottumwa, Iowa; Joseph E. Keefe, Winter- Haven, Fla.; Roland G. Schlager, Elgin, Ill.; John V. Hinkel, Washington, D. C.; Edwin E. Leach, Grand Rapids, Mich.; Thomas F. Carey, Chuckatuck, Va.; and John P. Walz, Masillion, Ohio.
The officers of the Club for the past year were: Fred Wagner, president; Jerome Parker, business manager; Vincent Carney and Peter Wacks, assistant business managers.

Every club has a purpose, of course. All of its activities are wound about that central purpose. That purpose is made the standard, the platform, the chief tenet of the club.
JAMES J. WALSH
At Notre Dame the clubs are happily so divided in the nature of their activities that the whole field of extra-curricular work is adequately covered. There is abundant room for those students interested in literature, history, public speaking, debating, world -events.
Such a club is the Wranglers, organized for the stimulation of debating. All of the work which the Wranglers carry on is based prima
rily on their interest in college forensics.
This year has been a particularly good one, a tribute to the retiring president, Joseph P. (Publius) McNamara. During the entire course of his presidency, he has sacrificed his own time for the Wranglers. He has thought wholly in terms of the Wranglers, formulating his theory of relativity to include that club and other campus organizations. Pedants might consider the phrase, “the gliding spirit,” a platitude whose merit was long ago exhausted by stupified newspaper reporters. But we are inclined to venture their criticism and say that we think the phrase appropriate when applied to Joe McNamara.
As plank number one in their platform, the Wranglers fostered interhall debating among- the Freshman groups. Mr. Walter Stanton’s debaters of Freshman Hall won the trophy. The club’s contribution to varsity debating is incalculable, because the interhall system has brought out so much material. A large percentage of the varsity teams is Wrangler.
As plank number two, the Wranglers fathered the Northern Indiana Oratorical Contest for high schools. The object of this is the securing of a permanent organization among the high schools of the northern part of Indiana that public speaking contests and ultimately debates may be held.
In the third platform, the Wranglers held debates with outside colleges on any subject agreed upon. This year the discussions were with Indiana Central, Manchester, and Hillsdale.
The officers for the coming year are: James J. Walsh, President, and William Brown, Secretary. Mr. Walsh has made every problem of the Wranglers his problem. He has worked tirelessly that seemingly insuperable • difficulties might be overcome. With such a president as he, one can confidently anticipate a successful year- for the Wranglers.

The outstanding achievement of the S. A. C. this year was the establishing of a very definite morale among the undergraduates during the football season. Last fall Notre Dame met with unusual reverses which at times threatened to demoralize the students. The S. A. C. very effectively reestablished enthusiasm and confidence. The work of the S. A. C. reached a climax in the monster pep meeting just prior- to the Army game and the effectiveness of the rally was very adequately shown when Notre Dame took the Cadets into camp.
Mr. William Kreig was president of the S. A. C. this year and he is worthy of all praise for the very creditable manner in which he discharged the duties of his office.
The S. A. C. was very ably assisted by that subsidiary organization known as the Blue Circle. This distinguished body was presided over by Larry Moore, of California. Suffice it to say that this year the Blue Circle met with unprecedented success.
DEBATE
“Mister Chairman, Honorable Judges, Ladies and Gentlemen’
Here is one varsity team that has finished its season with much more than the usual amount of success and yet has kept off the picture pages of the Sunday metropolitan editions. Debating of all kinds, Sorin Hall style and Washington Hall fashion, has always enjoyed an enviable record at Notre Dame. This season was no exception. Four teams representing the University performed in great style under- the prudent guidance of Father Francis Boland, C.S.C., of the Department of Economics. The four teams have done honor to the University and to the record handed down to them by the forensic stars of the dim
past.	Thomas Happer
The first question to be debated this year was that of the Indiana Conference of Colleges which read as follows: Resolved: That a criminal code similar in procedure to the criminal code of Great Britain be adopted in the United

The Notre Dame Scholastic
States.” James J. Walsh, Jr., Thomas V. Happer, and Joseph P. McNamara (captain) built their case upon the proposition that the “agencies” and not the “code of procedure” was to blame for the ills of the legal machinery in our government. George Beamer, Francis McGreal and Charles Haskell (captin) presented a very splendid case in an excellent manner, pointing out the evils inherent in our judicial system. The season opened with a dual victory over Detroit University, McNamara starring at home and McGreal turning in the best debate at Detroit.
Notre Dame next won a triangular match from Franklin and Earlham Colleges. Captain Haskell and Frank McGreal starred in the victory over Franklin while Walsh and McNamara captured the honors on the home floor. The affirmative then closed the season by winning a very exciting debate from Detroit U., at Detroit in which Beamer and Haskell shone in rebuttal work.
Probably the most signal victory of the year was won by a team composed of Arnold L. Williams, Charles M. Hanna and Walter E. Stanton on the question: Resolved: that the public should operate all hydro-electric power plants in the United States, offering electric energy for all. The strong Western Reserve University team, victors over a score of other leading teams, was bested in Washington Hall by these three young men in a truly great debate. Arnold Wil liams and Walter Stanton were easily the outstanding speakers in this contest. The same week the affirmative Water Power team lost to Purdue in a close tilt at Lafayette. In this debate two men made their debut to collegiate debating and proved particularly good. They were John M. Keefe and Fred Baer. The other speaker on this occasion was Joseph P. McNamara (captain) who, speaking in his last varsity !	debate after four years of competition, won special commen-
i	dation of Critic-Judge Claude Sifiritt of Butler University
i and of Purdue student publications.

|	On paper the 1928 football season was the most disas-
|	trous under the Rockmen regime. But the season was a suc-
1	cess for three important reasons. First, because Coach
J Rockne’s men, although outscored and even outplayed in E their quartet of reverses were never once out-fought. The I Blue and . Gold players gave everything they had—win or |	lose—in every battle. Secondly because the four teams to de-
feat Notre Dame—Wisconsin, Georgia Tech, Carnegie Tech, . and Southern California,—were indisputably the four strongest elevens in the country last fall. And thirdly be-
• cause the Rockmen scored notable triumphs over Army, , Navy, Penn State, Drake and Loyola, a representative array of strong teams. Taking these factors into consideration it i ;	can be readily seen why the 1928 season can be called a

success—not a brilliant success compared to other seasons— but a success nevertheless.
Loyola, the Wolfpack from New Orleans, opened the schedule and was turned back, 12-6. The Southerners were in mid-season form and had a much smoother running machine than Coach Rockne’s, but Elder’s perfect running in the early minutes of the second half and Niemic’s accurate passing accounted for the winning markers.
Then came the first heartbreaker -—one in which the Rockmen clearly outfought their opponents for they piled up eleven first downs against Wisconsin’s three, but, despite the fact they were humbled at Madison by the Badgers, 22-6.
The next week found them reinstated, however, in the minds of the football populace as a “great team” when they defeated Navy, 7-0, before a huge crowd of 120,000 rabid fans in Soldier’s Field. Here, John Colrick raced over to one corner of the field, neatly grabbed a pass from Niemic and carried it across for the one and only touchdown of the game.
Practically exhausted from these three hard struggles, Notre Dame went south to Atlanta where they met Georgia Tech “Golden Tornado.” Georgia Tech was victor, 13-0, because the Blue and Gold lacked the punch to put score from inside the ten-yard line after they had carried the ball down from midfield on numerous occasions.
The heretofore undefeated Drake eleven next came to Cartier to atone for set-backs in previous years, but the Rockmen ran away with the Bulldogs, 32-6. “Moon” Mullins, recently converted into a fullback to fill the shoes of Freddy Collins who was out because of injuries, was the mainstay of the Blue and Gold eleven in its crushing defeat of the lowans.
A 9-0 victory over Penn State followed; a flurried rush in the opening minutes gave the Irish their lead and win. Fred Collins returned to action in this contest and although handicapped by a cast on- his arm, played one of his best games.
Then came the really big game of the season, and Notre Dame, given little chance to win by the dopesters administered a stinging defeat to one of the finest teams the Army has ever- put on the football field. From the opening play of the game, with Red Cagle being thrown for a 15-yard loss by Ed Collins, to the last few seconds of the fray when the Ramblers’ line did not “Ramble” but stopped Hutchinson on the six-inch line, the Notre Dame team played like supermen to cop 12-6.
The tradition of 23 years standing was washed away with Carnegie Tech’s crushing defeat of 27-17. It was “crushing,” to say the least, for every one of the Notre Dame men put all of his effort into this almost hopeless contest until he was either led or carried off the muddy Cartier Field. A well-drilled team pitted against a fatigued band of players, tired from the strenuous efforts of the week before, was rewarded with the honor of being the first to win from the Rockmen on their own field in over a score of years.
A slight two weeks’ respite and then the Blue and Gold traveled west. Their opponents, Southern California, swept to a 27-14 win. A brief but spirited attack in the final half, led by Jack Chevigny, the fleet halfback playing his last game, was not enough to stem the tide of the Southern California team determined to avenge defeat at the hands of Notre Dame in 1926 and 1927.

The 1928-1929 basketball season was a highly successful one, taking into consideration the fact that injuries and sickness incapacitated several members of the team during the

opening weeks of the campaign. The entire schedule was completed with fifteen wins and five losses. Notre Dame lost four out of the first twelve contests and then bucked up to cop seven out of its last eight.
The Keoganites, led by co-captains Joe Jachym and Frank Crowe, defeated such noted basketball quints as the University of Pittsburgh, 1927 national champs; University of Pennsylvania, eastern intercollegiate champions; Kansas; Michigan State; Butler, and Wabash. Hard fought games games were dropped to Northwestern, Butler, Kentucky and Indiana.
The last game marked the passing of the combination of Joe Jachym and Frank Jachym, co-captains, Johnny Colrick, Jim Bray, Bob Newbold ,and Tim Moynihan, from the Notre Dame basketball court . During their three years of competition these artists won 53 games and dropped only 11. Surely, a distinguished career after taking up the burden left by that wonderful group of Clem Crowe, Vince McNally, Johnny Nyikos, Bucky Dahman, and Louie Conroy.
McCarthy, Busch, and Smith, all-western guard selection for two years, will certainly form a fine combination next season under the capable leadership of “Oonie” Donovan.

ment against the Middies. Mr. Thomas Mills, head baseball mentor, had about a hundred candidates at the start of the season, and from this group he molded a nine which turned in creditable work in all its games. Coach Mills was aided in his early season coaching by Big Ed Walsh, famous hurler for the Chicago White Sox a decade ago; and “Red” Smith, 1927 captain and catcher, now with the Boston Braves; Joe Sullivan, 1928 captain and crack keystone guardian, turned out a strong freshman team in his capacity as yearling coach.
The team toured the South on its annual spring training trip and defeated such teams as Ouachita, Baylor (twice), Baker, and Southern Methodist. The only defeat they encountered was at the hands of Texas A. and M.
Upon their return, the home season was opened with a win, and throughout their schedule have defeated such strong nines as Drake, Northwestern, Michigan State, Iowa, and the fast Meiji team from Japan. More than the usual share of tough luck was encountered by.the squad. Lordi’, first string catcher; Jachym and Donahue, two best bets on the hurling squad; McCleary, sterling second-sacker; Jim Bray, who cavorted in the center garden, were handicapped at one time or anothei- during the year. Captain John Colrick, crack first x baseman in collegiate circles, was called home by the sudden death of his father two weeks ago and has not since returned to the University. Most of the six defeats chalked against the Millsmen were by one or two-run margins.
Some extraordinary \vork has been turned in by newcomers on the squad. “Lefty” Lisicki, a sophomore hurler, pitched a two-hit game against Butler; Joe “Rebel” Palermo performed capably at the shortstop position; and Harry Francis exhibited a brilliant brand of outfielding and stellar base stealing. The veterans, Captain Colrick, McCleary, Hart, Lordi, Law, Moran, Feehery, Griffin, Jachym, Donohoe, Rust, and Bray played their usual brand of consistent baseball, which at times rose to brilliant heights.
JACK ELDER
The record of Coach Nicholson’s 1929 track team is a very impressive one. The team opened the indooi- season on February 9 by trouncing Indiana, 47-37. The week following, Illinois won a hard-fought meet with the Irish at Urbana, 61 1-2 to 33 1-2. On February 23, Notre Dame nearly doubled the score in the meet with Northwestern, 55 1-3 to 30 2-3. In this meet, Tom Warne, the Purple pole-vaulter, broke the gym record by soaring to the remarkable heights of 13 feet, 3 and 3-8 inches. Wisconsin took the final indoor dual meet at Madison, 57 to 29. Notre Dame came back the following week to win the Central Intercollegiate meet, piling up a total of 44 1-2 points. The team finished its indoor season by turning in several splendid performances at the Illinois relays on March 16.
On the outdoor track Notre Dame decisively defeated Michigan State, 83 1-2 to 41 2-3; but lost their dual meet with Illinois. The team participated in the Indiana state meet at Bloomington on May 18, and although the men took eight first places this was not enough to surpass the Indiana University trackmen who won the state title by a narrow margin. However, the Blue and Gold artists came back in great shape the next week to. sweep through to victory in the Central Intercollegiate meet at Milwaukee, Wis.
After today’s struggle with the Illinois A. C., the team will formally disband for the 1929 season. Five men will remain, however, to enter the National Intercollegiate meet at Chicago on June 8. Captain Elder, Boagni, Walsh, Bailie ’ and O’Brien comprise this group.

N.D. Overwhelms Opposition in C.I.C. Track Meet
ELDER, BAILIE, O’BRIEN, AND WALSH SET NEW CONFERENCE MARKS
Capturing first place in twelve of the sixteen events on the afternoon’s program, and placing at least one man in every event, Notre Dame’s well-balanced track team overwhelmed all opposition in the’ fourth annual Central Intercollegiate Conference outdoor games held in the Marquette University Memorial Stadium, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, last Saturday. The final Blue and Gold score of 79 1-3 points more than doubled the point total of the Spartans from Michigan State who finished second with 37 1-2. Marquette placed third with 34 5-6 points and the following institutions trailed in the order named, DePauw 8, Lake Forest- 7 1-3, Detroit 3, Armour Tech 3, and Rose Poly 2. Five other colleges represented in the meet failed to place.
Seven recording breaking performances, in which Notre Dame representatives figured in five, featured the meet.'Captain Jack Elder competing in his last conference games smashed his previous record time of 10 seconds flat in the 100 by negotiating the distance in 9.9, and came back a few minutes later to set a new conference record in the 220. His time for this distance was 21.7 which bettered by several tenths the old mark. Bailie of the Blue and Gold, topped the 220 yard low hurdles in 24.8 another meet record, and Johnny O’Brien won the 120 high hurdles in 15.2 still another new conference mark. Bob Walsh heaved the shot 48 feet to surpass the old conference mark in that event over four feet. The other conference records shattered during the meet were in the 880 and the mile relay. In the former event Hackney of Michigan State raced the distance in 1.58.1 for a new mark, and in the latter event the DePauw University quartet shaved five and one-half seconds off Notre Dame’s old time of 3.28.
Coach John P. Nicholson’s proteges made their best showing in the discus when Schaeffer, Walsh and Hoffman finished one, two, three respectively. Schaffer’s winning heave went for 122 feet, 3 1-2 inches.
John Brown achieved sweet revenge for the licking his namesake L. Brown of Michigan State gave him in a dual meet on Cartier Field recently, by capturing the two mile in 9:41.8 Bill Brown, not to be outdone by his brother, came through with a spectacular win in the mile over Clark and Roosien, Michigan State aces, and Rohan of Marquette. He was clocked in 4:27.3.
Notre Dame’s half mile relay team composed of Nichols, McConnville, Rourke, and Boagni, raced to a thrilling victory over the Marquette, Michigan State, and Lake Forest quartets in the fast time of 1.30.2. The Blue and Gold runners secured a small lead at the outset of the race and were never headed.
Tom Quigley ran a fast race in the 440 to breast the tape ahead first in 51.2; Frank Merailer threw the javelin 175 feet 2 inches to cop that event; and Bailie with a leap of 22 feet 5 inches was first in the broad jump, to register the other Notre Dame individual victories.
Summary:
One-mile Run—Won by W. Brown, Notre Dame; Clark, Michigan State, second; Rohan, Marquette, third; Roosien, Michigan State, fourth. Time—4:27.3.

With Lefty Lisicki allowing but two scattered hits, Notre Dame shut out Butler, 2 to 0. Lisicki issued one pass during the game in the ninth inning, but a fast doubly play stopped any further .damage.
Notre Dame scored one run in the third with Francis singling, going to second on Lordi’s sacrifice and scoring on Palermo’s single. The other run was counted by Feehery on Moran’s triple to deep center.
Lisicki pitched a superb game of ball and was in no trouble until the last two innings, but with excellent support he came out unscathed.

Notre Dame made a clean sweep of the Minnesota two-game series by winning, 4 to 2. Joe Jachym and Bjorgum, the opposing pitchers both hurled excellent ball but the Notre Dame sluggers got to Bjorgum in the fifth inning, counting three runs on four hits, including a triple by Palermo. Another was added in the sixth on a walk, a stolen base, and a single off Jachym’s bat.
Minnesota counted one run in the initial inning and another in the fourth.	■
Joe Palermo, diminutive shortstop, apparently found his batting eye for he cracked out two hits, a double and a triple.

NOTRE DAME 3, MARSHALL 4—At Cartier Field, May 26
With the tying run out at home plate in the ninth inning, the Blue and Gold team lost a tight game to Marshall College, of Virginia, 4 to 3. Toler, on the hill for the mountaineers, allowed only three hits.
Two were out in the last half of the ninth and Palermo was safe at first on an error. He took second without a throw being made and went to third the same way. Palermo scored on an error by the left fielder, Hart going all the way to third and scoring on the throw-in. Bray walked, and Francis running for him wTent to second and third on two errors. When the throw from center went over third, he dashed for home but was out at the plate on a close decision.

WHITNEY DEFEATS CONWAY FOR FRESHMAN TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP
Sam Whitney, off-campus student, Utah State junior champion, and third ranking inter-mountain junior, won the freshman championship of the University by defeating Jim Conway, of Howard Hall, in four hard fought sets which brought out some of the most brilliant tennis seen on the University courts this season.
Conway, with his long, well-placed strokes, kept his opponent on the defensive and took the first set at 6-3. Whitney found himself at that time however, and proceeded to take the next three sets. His victory did not come without a fight though, and his less experienced opponent ran each set to deuce at least once. The scores, 6-4, 11-9, 7-5, give but a slight idea of the closeness of the match and the comparative ability of the two finalists.
Whitney won his way into the finals by taking the measure of C. R. Huse in the quarter-finals, by scores of 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, and then disposing of J. Tunney in the semifinals in another three-set match. These scores were 6-2, 2-6, 6-4. Conway earned the right to meet Whitney by causing the biggest upset of the tourney in defeating Ed. Halpin in the quarter-final round. Halpin, who had advanced to that round with the loss of only five games, was the favorite to come through the tourney unbeaten. Conway caught him unawares, however, and handed'him a clean-cut straight set beating. The scores were 6-3, 7-5. In the semi-finals, Conway easily disposed of Connor by a 6-2, 6-2 count.
SPLINTERS FROM THE PRESS BOX
It is seldom that one sees so many remarkable performances in a single meet as were turned in Saturday in the Western Conference Championships. There are varying opinions as to the most outstanding performances of the meet, but we believe that Rockaway’s great race over the low-hurdles is far and away the best track performance turned in since the immortal Nurmi ran 8:58 3-5 for the

two-miles. It seemed almost beyond human comprehension that anyone would ever run better than 23 seconds for the low hurdles; better time than most athletes can run 220 on the flat.

Next to Rockaway’s performance we believe that Orval Martin’s two great victories rank second. They are all the more remarkable when one considers that he ran a heat in the 880 the previous: day.

It is rarely that one man is picked off of second base in a ball game, let alone two, as in the first game with Marshall.
Incidentally we believe that Harry Francis did the right thing in coming home as he did. Under the circumstances his brave gamble was justified. Because he did not win does not
detract from the fact that he made a very heady and very brave play.

The most popular ready-to-eat cereals served in the dining-rooms of American colleges, eating clubs and fraternities are made by Kellogg in Battle Creek. They include ALL-BRAN, Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies, Krumbles and Kellogg’s Shredded Whole Wheat Biscuit. Also Kaffee Hag Coffee —-the coffee that lets you sleep.
That’s what you’ll say when you taste Kellogg’s Pep Bran Flakes. More appetizing crispness plus the famous flavor which only PEP can give. ’
Just the cereal to keep you fit for study and college life. You get the nourishing elements of the wheat. Just enough bran to be mildly laxative. Ask for them to be served at your fraternity house or campus restaurant.

Speaking of consistency, John and Bill Brown'ran two of the finest races of their careers to win the mile and two-mile races in the Central Conference Meet last Saturday. Always in the future will the name of Brown be as synonymous with track at Notre Dame as are the names of Desch, Oberst and Harrington.
The university’s plan for financing the new Cartier Field Stadium is novel—and the best of which we have heard.

WHY CAMELS ARE THE BETTER CIGARETTE
The world3s largest group of tobacco experts... one brand. . . one quality. . . one size package ... everything concentrated on Camel goodness. The smoothness and mildness of Camels are possible only through the use of choicest tobaccos. The most skilful blending gives Camels an individuality of taste that is beyond imitation.
They have a mellowness that you have never known in any other cigarette, regardless of price. Camels never tire your taste or leave an unpleasant after-taste.
