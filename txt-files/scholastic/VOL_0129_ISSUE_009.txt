.otre Dame's policy of maintaining investments in South Africa is confusing. Applying the rationale of constructive engagement, the University says it believes that a financial 
presence in South Africa has a more positive effect on the black's situation than divesting would. But the vast major­ity of civil rights leaders in both the United States and South Africa believe that divestment is the best way to help change the present system of apartheid since the U.S. government refuses to employ its power and enact 
economic sanctions. In the spring of 1985, the administration said that if the situation in South Africa became worse the University would divest. Since then, a state of emergency has been declared and a press ban has been enacted. Nevertheless, the University still has not divested. Last fall, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops urged Roman Catholic institutions to divest their holdings in companies operating in South Africa or at least to per­suade those ·countries to withdraw the business. The university still did not divest. By only investing in corpora­tions which hold to the Sullivan Principles, a set of guide­lines created by the Reverend Leon Sullivan, the Univer­sity follows a policy of constructive engagement. But in June, Sullivan decided that his own principles were not significantly affecting the ever-worsening situa­tion in South Africa. He therefore urged complete divest­ment. And with Sullivan's change in recommendation, the major support for Notre Dame's position disappeared. For the past few years, the administration has used Sullivan to justify their unwillingness to divest. Now, with that jus­tification gone, the immorality of the position held by the University is made painfully obvious.

Alcohol is Everywhere 
Alcohol consumption was a success 
at the Head of the Charles regatta, according to the Metropolitan District Commission. The com­mission was referring to the crackdown on drinking along the banks of the Charles River, where the annual race is held. According to the Brown Daily Herald, alcohol had always been banned at the event, but the rule was never enforced until this year. In their effort to res­trict drinking, the number of security officers was increased from 30 to 300. The officers made eleven alcohol related arrests and confiscated enough cans and bottles of alcohol to fill eight industrial sized dumpsters. The MDC, which had previously talked of cancelling the race because of the drunken rowdiness, ended their blasphemy. In response to the effect of the sup­posed crackdown, one Notre Dame student who attended the race replied, "The what?" 

Jail never looked so good as to 
Amanda Wilhite, after she was sentenced by a judge to return to college. The eighteen-year-old University of Arkansas -Little Rock student was found guilty of twice trying to hire someone to kill her parents, according to the College Press Service. Wilhite confessed that she once tried to persuade a former co-worker and then an undercover detective to kill her adoptive parents because she was "real depressed." Her adoptive parents testified in her defense at the trial. "We realize that she's got a lot of problems, emotional problems, but would like the charges dismissed," her father told Special Judge Harold Madden. Madden accepted the plea bargain and suspended the ten year sentence on Wilhite, ord­ering her to continue her studies, her counsel­ing, and her part-time job. 


Stanford University recently adapted 
its stance on the consumption of alcohol inside its stadium when it realized that one over­zealous fan was dying for a drink. Apparently, the gentlemen left the stadium to replenish his supply of alcohol during a recent football game. According to Stanford Athletic Director Andy Geiger, a man was running to the stadium from a nearby liquor store when he collapsed and died. Because of the event, high-ranking administrators at the university have decided to limit the amount of beer in the football stadium to one six-pack per person. Stanford's unique policy was established on 1979, and it is the only Pac-IO Conference member to allow drinking in the stands. Evidently, with the football team sporting a· 3-6 record, the school feels that sobriety would be too much to.ask of the fans. 



Playboy's 1986 ranking of Mercer 
University as one of the country's best party schools last week led to a large student rally against what the · students say is a struggle for control of the school. Ail Atlanta businessman has tried to get Mercer, a Southern Baptist insti­tution, to oust the board of trustees because they allegedly have let the campus stray from its rigid disciplinary rules. The un-named businessman cited the Playboy article and other "dramatic evidence of filthy language, lewd photographs, heresies, student drunkenness and sexually explicit material" in an open letter criticizing the administration. Stated Holly Mccorkle, a senior and school vice-president, "We are not a party school." 

Alcohol consumers have found a new 
outlet at Columbia University. A local variety store recently started stocking eight-packs of Colt 45 malt liquor, and the response has been tremendous, stated the Brown Daily Herald. "They rule," said senior David Jagoda. "I can get 33 percent more. drunk than with a regular six pack." He continued to praise the beverage's higher alcohol content. When asked if he knew the price of the_ eight-packs, Jagoda had to admit, "I really can't remember."

Handicapped Students At Notre Dame 
~ -:x:NPIA-WA ~ 




~~~-5 7 bi.ST/~~..___------~ 
BY MIKE WIEBER
Long walks in the moon­light by St. Joseph's Lake, pick-up basketball games and discussions about the difficult exams given by professors are some of the . most popular activities for Notre Dame's students. However, not all students can share in such pleasur­able diversions. By no means known throughout the world for its physically handicapped stu­dents, Notre Dame nevertheless has some thirty students with vari­ous disabilities attending its classes and sharing in activities on and around campus. Notre Dame's expansive grounds and high pressure academic environment would seem an unnecessary burden to a person who already faces more than aver­age difficulty in everyday tasks. Yet, the physically disadvantaged students here confront Notre Dame life with a positive attitude, not seeing themselves as handi­capped; rather, they see their con­dition as simply one small addi­tional challenge among the many difficult requirements of college life. 
The handicapped students have many reasons for wishing to attend this . university. Claire Conerty, a senior in Pasquerilla West who transferred to Notre Dame sophomore year, said, "I've been a Domer since birth." She transferred from North Carolina after freshman year on a friend's suggestion. She added, "This is the first year I feel like I really, really fit in. And though some stu­dents are ignorant, for the most part the students are great." Pat Reese, a junior in St. Edward's Hall, chose Notre Dame for Connerty's reasons, and more. "I met Bob Monday in the admissions office and he said he thought it would work. Fr. Mario [former rector of St. Edward's Hall] was positive, too. I really felt wanted here," said Reese. "I'm really for­tunate to be where I am." 

"I didn't look at it [Notre Dame] any differently than any other university. I figured I'd deal with it [his blindness] when I got there," said Matt King, a senior in Grace Hall. He added, though, that the University seemed to let him do what he wanted --receiv­ing assistance only if he felt it necessary. 
On the whole, the disadvan­taged students at Notre Dame enjoy life and face the challenges bravely and cheerfully, yet several complaints arise repeatedly. Both the blind students and those res­tricted to wheelchairs feel a need to inform the student body as well as the general population about their conditions. They said the public must learn to provide assis­tance without pity. "The general public needs to realize Braille and a long white cane are basic things to deal with blindness. Blind peo­ple can function in society," said King. 
Social life for the physically 
--, 
Scholastic 





disadvantaged students can be 
somewhat difficult, especially in 
the first, year or two. "The social 
aspect [of life] is more difficult 
than if I wasn't in the chair, but 
it's not insurmountable," Reese 
said, ·adding, "I haven't liad any 
difficulty meeting people in the 
dorm." 
Conerty said, "I wasn't so 

self-conscious at a public college. 
It's a different social structure 
there. I like to be surrounded by · walking people. I forget I'm in the chair.'' 
Matt King agreed with Reese 

and Conerty, saying, "I'm accepted like everybody else. Any social situation I find awkward is just as much my fault as anyone . else's. I have to teach them about 
blindness." 
A third complaint, from the students in wheelchairs, regards the accessibility of the university grounds and buildings. Despite Notre Dam.e's efforts, certain buildings on South Quad are still inaccessible to wheelchairs. Conerty remembers when a pro­fessor of hers who lived on the third floor of Morrissey unwit­tingly invited her to discuss the class although there is no ramp leading ·into that dorm. 
"Sometimes tlie school seems to spend ~oney on irrelevant things . . .like Stonehenge,". said Conerty. She also hopes the University will reconstruct some of the elevators, especially the old one in the infir­mary and wishes that she had been able to live in one of the older dormitories. 
Reese mentioned a similar situation, saying that he wished he could visit his friends in Mor­rissey. "Things would go better if I could go on a whim to visit a friend," he said. 

Fortunately, for most students who are blind, deaf, or restricted to a wheelchair, the University stands behind them and encourages their participation in student life, and has, in accor­dance with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, provided wheelchair entrances to most buildings and elevator service to upper floors in classroom buildings and most of the dormitories. Donald Dedrick, Director of the Physical Plant at Notre Dame, is in charge of reno­vation of the University. "Reno­vation is a very difficult job," he noted. In recent years, with the 
,,, 
· 

help of co-workers, he has installed ramps and elevators to Washington Hall and La Fortune Student Center. For the two stu­dents living in St. Edward's Hall who are restricted to wheelchairs the Physical Plant has installed special handicapped showers and toilets. 
Regarding the current con­struction at North Dining Hall, Dedrick adds, "We're renovating the North Dining Hall and we will be putting accessible toilets on the first floor for the handicapped." Most recently the University has commissioned the construction crews to modify an apartment at Grace-O'Hara Female Student Residence to accomodate Lance Perez, a physically handicapped graduate student. Beyond these changes, the University plans to continue increasing accessible entrances for the handicapped until most buildings are available to students of all physical disabili­ties. 
In addition, since King needs much equipment to prepare his· exams and essays, the University allows him to study in one of the kitchenettes in Grace and has had a special large desk built for his supplies. 
Dedrick remains on call for the students restricted to wheel­chairs in the winter. Conerty said that during the winter, among the first paths cleared are those needed by the students in wheel­

chairs and if some other access route were necessary, Mr. Dedrick would assist. He said, "When we receive a call we will respond. This is a difficult place for a handicapped person to get around in the winter. The snow is handled pretty well." 
The physically handicapped students agree that the professors have assisted wherever possible. "The professors here have been very helpful whert I need their help," said King. He said they

schedule his exams at special times and make adjustments as necessary so that he has ample time to prepare his work. 
"The fact that the University has appointed a leader shows its concern for these students," said Sister John Miriam Jones, Coordi­nator for Disabled Students at Notre Dame. Sister Jones is the most direct contact between the University and the handicapped students, carrying requests and information between the two. "I am the central point where needs get articulated and met. I try to keep in touch. with the handi­capped students," she said. 
When a problem arises, Sister Jones works through the Univer­sity lines to resolve the situation. Since there is no elevator in the Administration Building and her office is on the second floor, Sister Jones said, "I go to their rooms to meet with them." Notre Dame has recently purchased two golf carts and a van with a wheelchair lift for use by the handicapped stu­dents. The University also put a computer in Reese's room since he is not able to access the system in Hayes-Healy Hall and the installing an elevator there could cost $400,000, according to Sister Jones. "We've done as much as is practical," she said. 
Sister Jones noted there are about ten visually impaired and another dozen deaf students at Notre Dame in addition to three students in wheelchairs. Many stu­dents, however, are not aware of all these students present on campus. She said certain students, especially the hearing impaired, try to keep their situation to them­
selves. 
Sister Jones is pleased with the reaction of the student body as a whole to the handicapped popu­lation at Notre Dame. "I've watched our students. If the rest are like those I've seen, it speaks well for our human touch. The handicapped students' world is a bit distant to some. They can't use the same landmarks and go at lif c with the same case," she said. 

The handicapped students appreciate Sister Jones and the University's involvement in their lives. Reese said Sister Jones is very good --she will do what must be done to get things fixed. When Conerty had a class in the Archi­tecture Building, Sister Jones arranged for it to be moved to the Center for Social Concerns. The students in wheelchairs have also been given keys to the elevators in the classroom buildings. 
Although there are organiza­tions for various minorities on campus, support among the handi­capped is not strong for such a group. Reese said, "It doesn't bother me that there aren't any. My situation works out well." King strongly agrees, "I don't like the idea of having a support group. I have no need of a support group." 
Life at Notre Dame has been tough for many of the blind, deaf, and physically handicapped, par­ticularly during their first months on campus, but most have adjusted well to the academic, social, and physical challenges presented by the University. As Reese said, "I've grown in all areas and am more outgoing in some respects 
than I was as a freshman. Yeah, I'm very happy. It's the best place for me. I've made friends here."

stant struggle to be available to the stUden ts," said Boswell. 
Creary said he feels the conclu­sions of the study are not applica­ble· to him, due to the fact that there are very few black students in the chemistry department. 
Boswell's position attests to the fact that a low black faculty popu­lation does place a certain amount of strain on the few that do work at Notre Dame, a strain he accepts gladly and with no resentment. 
The situation created by the scarcity of minorities in general at Notre Dame was acted upon last year by the University's adminis­tration. Provost Timothy O'Meara appointed a group, the Notre Dame Committee on Minority Stu­dents, to study the situation of minorities here. When their research was complete, the com­mittee submitted a report to O'Meara, which was published in the August 14, 1987 issue of Notre Dame Reports. The report states that affirmative action effort with regards to minority groups other than blacks have been effective at Notre Dame. Over the past decade, the number of women faculty members rose five percent and _the number of Hispanics teaching at Notre Dame rose 2. 7 percent. "By constrast," the report states, "the situation with respect to black faculty at Notre Dame is embar­rassing." The committee believes 
that an increase . in black faculty would be beneficial and "in keep­ing with the mission of the University." 
"The c·ommittee's report and the resolution included in · it," O'Meara said, "has not yet been fully initiated by the administra­tion but the fine tuning of its structure is still going on." The presentation of the report to the President in its final form will occur when deliberations are com­plete. 
Creary, in his fourteenth year of teaching at Notre Dame, recalls when the number of black faculty was higher than it is now. He says that the situation of decreasing numbers is not exclusive to Notre Dame, "but is true across the country." 
Indeed, the falling population of black college instructors is becoming a cause for great con­
j 
" 
~ 

cern in America. This trend, elim­inating blacks from teaching posi­tions in universities across the U.S., is having a similar effect on the black student populations. The committee report on minorities states: "A study by the American Council for Education shows an 
11.9 percent drop in black enroll­ment in graduate and professional schools from 1980 to 1984 and an overall decline of 4.3 percent in the number of black faculty in the same period." The report then goes on to stress the presence of black faculty members as a deter­mining factor in black student enrollment in and graduation from colleges. 
Boswell stated that he agrees that the lack of blacks (both faculty and students) seen by pros­pective black employees or stu­dents would instill a certain amount of confusion and intimida­tion about the black situation at the University. He sees the lack of blacks as a perpetual deterrent to any increase in their numbers. 

Boswell said he believes that those who hire professors at Notre Dame are negligent to the need for more blacks in the classroom. He views the administration of the University as "a slow moving bureaucracy" that, despite weII meaning intentions, is simply not making enough moves in • the direction of hiring more black professors. 
Inconsistencies exist in the University's administrative policy regarding black enrollment and employment of blacks. according 
to Boswell. He said, "The school talks of social responsibility, but it's not put into practice. The heart is there but there is something ter­ribly wrong." 
The hiring process at Notre Dame also contains deficiencies, says Boswell. "People (those who hire faculty at the University) do not know where to look (for black candidates) and do not look hard enough." He believes certain "net­works" exist, composed of Notre Dame alumni and those connected with the University, to which the administration is confining itself in terms of who to hire. 
Boswell describes his attitude 

toward the administration's hiring 
policies "not as anger at the insti­
tution, but as disappointment, and 
it's not by design (the lack of 
black faculty), but by ignorance." 
Creary, on the other hand, feels that the problem is not caused by administrative negligence, but by the simple fact that fewer and fewer blacks are going to college and entering the role of college educators. 
He believes that if the waning levels of black professors across the nation are to be revived, the lowest le'vels of education among black children must be imple­mented in such a manner that the students become better prepared for and swayed toward a college education. 
With the total number of eligi­ble black candidates declining, a university's attempts at gaining that higher cultural diversity which those candidates would offer, may resort to simple "out recruiting" techniques. Creary believes that this sort of effort to raise black faculty numbers will have only short term effects on the particular recruiting institution and no long-term benefits on the current national situation. 
Creary believes that only through a reconstructive effort of the majority of black elementary and high-school education will the absence of blacks in faculty and student positions in higher educa­tion be filled, thus improving the college experience as a whole. 
The committee on minorities report, in identifying the want for more black faculty members at Notre Dame, states specific recommendations with regard to administrative procedure in hiring minority professors. One sugges­tion is to appoint a "senior administrator" to be assigned the task of implementing the committee's plan "that the University reconstitute it's affir­mative action procedures for faculty and administration." The report hopes that the senior administrator will "become actively engaged in the process of hiring, ensuring that every effort is made to bring minorities into 

the pool of candidates." With the report still under dis­cussion, steps have not yet been taken to appoint someone tq this position. Boswell commented on the committee report's call for such an administrative office: "It'll take a long time before it's done but it's a good first step." In his Inaugural Address, University President Father · Edward Malloy said, "Justice demands that we act decisively and with real conviction" on the current situation of blacks and other minorities at Notre Dame. With the report of the Committee on Minorities under deliberation, and with recommendations and steps for a resolution of this prob­lem circulating, a "culturally diverse" atmosphere for Notre Dame could be just around the corner.

Between 1966 and 1968, no
'There is a definite void in the histori­cal records" on minorities at Notre Dame, said Kevin Rooney, Direc­tor of Undergraduate Admissions. Complete and accurate accounts were not taken before the 1960s, 

I I he said. "Minority enrollment has varied throughout the years. The first black student graduated in the late 1940s," Rooney said. "Before 1966, no more than nine black stu­
dents graduated each year." 
Hispanic or Native American stu­dents graduated. Hispanics currently represent 
3.2 percent of lhe student body, blacks, 2.8 percent, Asian­Americans, 1 percent and Native Americans, less than one percent. 
Initial recruiting was directed by the Committee on Minority Enrollment, which was formed in 1964, and at first concentrated on a mailing campaign to prospective students. Then in 1967, it ini­tiated a program of personal inter­views with those students. 
Students also contributed to recruiting efforts by orgamzmg the Recruitment Action Program in 1968. This student-run and adminstration-funded group visited various cities throughout the year, encouraging qualified minorities to attend Notre Dame. 

In the early 1970s, "emphasis was basically on black students. It was a catalyst for other minority groups," said Kenneth Durgans, Director of Minority Student Affairs. At that time the Univer­sity began to formally recruit minority candidates. 
In the mid 1970s, "there was a concerted effort to bring more Hispanic students here," said Dur­gans. While most of those students had ethnic ties to South America, lately the University has been heavily recruiting Mexican­Americans in Texas and Califor­nia. 
The admissions office invited minority candidates to visit the campus on an informal basis, in the early 1970s, but at their own expense. In 1975, the University received a . grant from the Dow Chemical Company for the travel expenses of prospective minority science majors~ The next year, 13 high school seniors came to the campus. 
"The issue of minorities has been kind of sporadic in terms of the amount of expressed dissatis­faction," said one black Notre Dame alumnus. "Minority students have kind of suffered and agon­ized periodically," said Roland Smith, who is an Associate Profes­sional Specialist in the department of Urban Studies and director of Upward Bound at Notre Dame. 
Smith said the expression of discontent is an indication that the students feel more comfortable in their setting. "There were some periods when black students felt uneasy protesting." 
Encouraged by the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, black stu­dents on campus began to evaluate their own situation, said Durgans. They voiced much concern about what they perceived to be wide­spread discrimination on campus, Durgans said. 
Black students began to unite and form organizations in the late 1960s to better cope with the pres­sure and stress "from their predominately white environ­ment," Durgans said. Their efforts also helped "push the campus for more (minority) representation" in other University student organiza­tions, he said. 
During the winter of 1969, the black basketball players threatened to boycott games unless the administration agreed to discuss issues with a group of students. This peaceful demonstration prompted then University President Father Theodore Hes­burgh to form a univeristy-wide committee to study the problems of black students. The administra­tion also approved a proposal for a Black Studies program, which was instituted into the curriculum the next fall. 
Around that same time, the Notre Daine Spanish-American community began to request an increase in Hispanic enrollment, which then consisted of 20 stu­dents. The administration responded to the complaints and 20 Hispanics entered the 1971 freshman class. 
Toward the end of the 1970s, some black students still ques­tioned the Univerity's committ­ment to "their needs. The discon­tent eventually stimulated a nine hour sit-in on the steps of the Administration Building by 30 members of Concerned Black Stu­dents on April 21, 1977. 
The protesters presented University officials with a list of complaints. among which was the 
under-representation of minority staff, faculty and administrators and, in particular, black students, who then comprised only 2.5% of the total enrollment of 7,000. 
The Freshman Counseling Office hired its first black, George 
C. Seabrooks, in 1970. The administration set up the Minority Affairs Office, to be directed by a full-time Minority Student Coor­dinator in 1977. Durgans currently holds that position. 
Hesburgh's staff also created the position of Student Secretary for Inter-racial Concerns in 1977 to act as a liaison between minor­ity students and student govern­ment. 
Clubs for students of Spanish and Oriental heritage can be traced well back into the 1940s. The Afro-American Society, founded in 1966, pioneered the modern era of minority student unification in organized groups. 
The Black Cultural Arts Coun­cil has emerged as the main organ­ization for the black Notre Dame community during the last decade. The Council "help_s· black students have a social life on campus by sponsoring different events and helps them keep their identity," said Rochelle Holder, BCAC president. "It also acts as an umbrella encompassing all other black organizations," she said. 
Holder contends the BCAC serves as an important function on campus because "the subtle discrimination is still present." Some non-minority students "treat you as an outsider. A lot of black students find that hard to deal with," she said. 
The BCAC, according to Holder, is presently confronting the "carelessness" with which the administration handles the con­cerns of minority students. She predicts, however, that adminis­tration officials will begin to ack­nowledge and respond positively to their concerns. 
The minority visitation week­end has expanded over the years to include prespective minorities of all intended majors. The program is now funded by the administra­tion. "The amount of money allo­cated and the number of people who attend the events has increased over the years," said Rooney. Last April, 80 high school seniors attended Notre Dames's minority recruitment weekend. 

In 1969 the University experi­mented with the concept of con­centrations (of blacks) in residence halls. Fourteen blacks lived in a section of Dillon Hall and 18 blacks occupied a section in Alumni Hall. The concentrations officially lasted only a couple of years because of the inter-dorm conflicts which resulted between the black concentrations and the other sections. 
For many years the number of blacks that actually enrolled was minimal compared to the number which was accepted. In 1967, 77 black students were accepted, but only 28 confirmed their accep­tances. 
A majority of the first black students came from urban areas and could not afford full Notre Dame tuition. Thus, scholarships· played a major role in obtaininng an education. Twenty years ago, many blacks contended that there was a shortage of scholarships. They blamed lack of financial support for discouraging.· :other blacks from attending Notre Dame. 
In 1971, the University made its first financial commitment to ethnic minorities when it allocated the net proceeds from the 1971 Cotton Bowl Game ( over $200,000) to a minority student scholarship program. By 1977, 42 percent of the scholarship grant money from the University Endowment Funds went to minor­ity freshmen.II

Campus groups BY ANDY HILGER 


urrently at Notre Dame, 186 black undergradu­ates (2.5%), 240 Hispan­ics (3.2%) and 24 native 

Americans (0.3%) are enrolled. Concern over these statistics prompted Provost Timothy O'Meara to establish a Committee on Minority Students to advise the administration "on strategies for enhancing all aspects of the· pres­ence of the minority students at the University. The three primary conclusions that the committee arrived at are: "that the problems to be addressed are s}'Stematic to the institution and require a comprehensive plan; that sys­tematic progress can be made given support from the top of the University, sustained committ­ment over time, and significant allocation of resources; and that it is an appropriate moment for Notre Dame to address these issues;" 
The report makes a detailed analysis of topics which range from the residence life of minori­ties to minority alumni. This assessment resulted in twelve recommendations (see box). 
With regard to the recommen­dations, Provost Timothy O'Meara

respond to the Notre Dame Report on Minorities. 
said, "ultimately, the report will be considered by the officers and the president of the University. The PAC, Provost Advisory Com­mittee, has already had two long meetings and will have a third to vary this one (recommendation) and that one, and discuss imple­menting them." He continued, saying the PAC "will prepare a report on the various recommen­dations." The PAC's report may be slightly different from the report prepared by the Committee on Minority Students, but O'Meara stressed that he agrees "with the general direction (of the Commit­tee on Minority Students' Report)." 
In terms of recruiting, O'Meara suggested that the solu­tion will be the result of a con­certed effort in two aspects of the process. "First and foremost, I place a lot of confidence in the individual in charge, Kevin Roo­ney," stated O'Meara. O'Meara described the situation as "greatly improved." We have seen a "signi­ficant increase in blacks and Hispanics even before the report 
was implicated." 
The second aspect of recruit­ing which O'Meara foresees as an asset towards increasing the numbers of minorities in the University involves finding "addi­tional resources so that students won't be left with such a debt when they leave." With additional resources, O'Meara hopes that the University will place emphasis on "more scholarships and less stu­dent loan and work study pro­grams." Based on these two areas, O'Meara envisions "something sig­nificant definitely happening." The goal, "in essence, is a dou­bling of the numbers (of minori­
ties)  over  the  next  five years.  I  
think  that's  feasible,"  stated  
O'Meara.  

O'Meara attributes the high dropout rate of minorities in the Science and Engineering programs to a nationwide trend. He feels that this trend is the result of the quality of Science and Mathemat­ics in the high schools as well as the role of the media in shaping our views. "The press," according to O'Meara, "makes the other things (courses of study) out to be more exciting." Notre Dame com­bats this trend by "inviting minor­ity students during the summer before freshman year for some extra courses." Extra attention is given· to these students by Dr. Emil Hoffman, Dean of the Fresh­man Year of Studies and O'Meara sees this "concept growing into the sophomore year." 

There is an adjustment for minorities that extends beyond the difficulties that are created by leaving home. Freshman Leroy McIntosh touched on this when he sai_d, "most black students didn't come from a predominantly white situation." 
Junior Maria Fuentes, president of the Hispanic Club on campus,· views some other things as primary pressures. She thinks that "people see minorities as not as smart." She stresses that they are all "well-rounded individuals

,,· 

; I --definitely not tokens." The 
'' 
minorities feel pressure to excel in a situation even though aperforming less is expected." 
With regard to the report, Fuentes said, I "basically agree with the view of the Hispanic side." She said "it (the minority situation) is probably more diffi­cult for blacks than Hispanics. I felt that the report was receptive and that the ideas of the minorities were well represented." More specifically, she thinks that the 
financial aid." 
Fuentes, working alongside Marty Rogers, has a job in the admissions office that entails much of the recruiting of minority students. She complimented her employer, stating "Kevin Rooney is very supportive and a great help." She feels that her job is important because "having a student's point of view is very helpful." She often calls upon other students to write letters or call prospective students and she said, "response from volunteers is tremendous." She went on to say, "The report speaks of multicultur­alism which reinforces our jobs." 
Fuentes is optimistic with regard to the potential of the report to be carried out. "I do 

think it is going to happen. President Malloy definitely helps a lot. He has explained his interest (in the minority situation)," Fuentes said. She justifies her optimism by pointing out that this year's freshmen class is a high water mark for minorities --10%. She realizes "Notre Dame is tradi­tionally a white, Catholic school and it is going to take a while before we have a multicultural community." In the meantime, Fuentes feels that "minority stu­
dents are responsible for educating the majority about their culture." 
Rochelle Holder, president of the Black Cultural Arts Council, maintains a much more skeptical view of the report. "I agree with what is said but whether or not it will be followed up on is what I question," Holder stressed. She continued, "The Minority Con­cerns Committee has been saying the same things for the past three years. I see changes being made 
but the University drags them out." Summing up her perspective of the report Holder said, "The University constantly pacifies peo­ple with talk of their plans." 
While Holder found the report to be quite thorough, she felt the manner in which information was compiled could have been handled in a better manner. While the report "talked about all the issues," Holder felt that the Com­mittee should have "talked directly to the students more and not only the leaders of organiza­tions." In doing this, Holder feels that the committee would have gotten a clearer picture of some of the problems that arise during everyday life. Student/faculty relations is an example of one area in which the report may have been deficient, she added. 

Holder cited three reasons as to why minorities are faced with added pressures. First, "they are adapting to a new environment." She said it "is a culture sh.ock to be thrown into Notre Dame --a white, Irish, Catholic institution." Second, "the social life is not geared toward everyone." Some minorities are willing to adapt while others feel it is important to "maintain their identity and keep their heritage." The third pressure lies within the fact that they are often treated as if "they were meeting a quota. This is certainly a psychological stress," she said. 
The policy toward minority Science and Engineering students is viewed by Holder as a "very positive step." As well as "open­ing up opportunities they might not have had in high school, for example a Calculus course. It gives the students a grasp of whether or not the particular field is for them." 
Fuente5 indicated, "a multi­cultural society is the ultimate goal." Some, such as Fuentes, are quite optimistic about the authen­ticity of the University's claims toward such a communitity, while others, like Holder, view the University as "constantly passify-· ing people with idle talk of their plans."

Investment or 
Divestment? 
BY TONY LANG 

E 
very Friday at 12:15, a group of students gath­ers on the steps of the Administration Build­ing. This small demonstration, sponsored by the Anti-Apartheid Network of Notre Dame, tries to draw attention to the apatheid situation in South Africa. Lately, as Notre Dame's Board of Trustees' bi-annual meeting approaches, the group has tried to encourage Notre Dame's divest­ment from companies who have holdings in South Africa The debate has existed on and off throughout the l 980's on campus and around the country. 
Understanding the two sides of the issue necessitates an under­standing of the issue itself. At a recent workshop held by the Anti-Apartheid Network, A. Peter Walshe, a professor in the govern­ment department, gave a short his­tory of the system. 
Demographically, blacks dom­inate South Africa There are 25 million blacks, 5 million whites, 
3.4 million coloreds ~mixed race), and 1 million Indians. However, the blacks are allowed to live on only about 13% of the land, due to the Native's Land Act of 1913 and the Group Area's Act of the 1950's. 
During South Africa's indus­trial revolution, this system of 
apartheid lost some of its founda­tion. "South Africa became economically integrated, but polit­ically and socially segregated," said Walshe. "The majority of Africans did not live in their so called homelands. They were born and lived in white South Africa, where, paradoxically, the majority of people were black... As a result of the industrial revolution, there was a black majority in every great city of South Africa." 
In the past ten years, the white regime has come under increasing attack from both South African blacks and the interna­tional community. The black cons­ciousness movements sponsered by men like Steven Biko and Nelson Mandela. along with the 
crumbling of other white regimes in Africa, have intensified this conflict. 
"For these reasons and many others, the white regime began to rethink its position on apartheid," said Walshe. "They merely adapted the apartheid system, they did not dismantle apartheid.... They began to remove petty apartheid (integrating movie theatres and post offices)." At the same time, the regime reentrenched its power through a series of political moves. 
Most leaders in the United States agree that apatheid abuses human rights. The problem, according to Walshe, is how can the U.S. help alleviate the situa­
__t_io_n_._S_o_u_th__A_f_r_ic_a_i_s_a_w_e_a_lt_h_Y 

nation, and for the last 50 years or so, multinational corporations have invested large sums of money there. Recently, they have been forced to look carefully at their involvement in South Africa. 
In 1977, Reverend Leon Sol­livan, a black pastor from Phi­ladelphia and board member of the General Motors Corporation, came up with the Sullivan Princi­ples for companies with holdings in South Africa. This is a list of policies with which companies should comply if they remain in South Africa The codes stipulate a completely integrated work place, equal pay scales, and equal opportunity for advancement for all races. 
According to Father Richard Zang, investment officer for Notre Dame, any company which Notre Dame owns stock in must comply with these principles. This deci­sion came as a result of Notre Dame's official policy statement on South African investments written in October 1985. 
However, in June, 1987, Sul­livan officially changed his posi­tion. In a recent paper, Father Oliver F. Williams, an associate provost and professor of business ethics at Notre Dame, . stated, "(Sullivan) called for all U.S. com­panies to withdraw from South Africa by March 1988. He also asked the U.S. to initiate a total economic embargo 'until statutory a.:.p_a_rt_h_e_id_is_e_n_de~ and blacks.have 
17

L__ 
a clear commitment for equal .rights.' While Sullivan ack­nowledged that the Principles had 
·be.en 'a tremendous force for change,' [Sullivan] stated that much remains to be done and that more pressure is needed to force the Royal South African govern­ment to negotiate with blacks." 
Despite the change in the Sul­livan principles, Notre Dame may not change its position on divest­ment. Walshe, who was a dissent­
. ing member of the ad hoc commit­tee which recomended continuing investment in South Africa, is one of · the leading proponents on campus for divestment. 

Of the upcoming board meet­ing, he said, "Year after year since . 1978, we have heard the argu­: ments for divestment which have . convinced both faculty and stu­. dents. They voted for divestment in tempus referendum. Now, in .· the November meeting of the . board, we will undoubtedly have . another pro forma performance.I Once again we will be told that it ! is not time to pull out of South Africa, in spite of the apartheid regime and· demonic repression of 
. black protests. The truth is, it is convenient and profitable to remain in South Africa." 
Notre Dame doe~ not own · anything in South Africa. Rather, 
it invests in companies who have · holdings there. According to · Father Zang, "As of September · 30, 1987, Notre Dame owned $21 
million worth of stock in com­panies with operations in South Africa. That amounts to 17 com­panies." 

Father Williams pointed out in his paper the small impact of U.S. investments in South Africa. He I• writes, "At its height, U.S. cor­: porate · presence included over 280 companies with direct investments . totaling some $2 billion. What is often overlooked, however, is that South Afi:ica is a relatively 
~ealthy country, and that only 4 percent of all direct investment is from foreign multinational com­panies." 
The long term economic 
effect could also be important. 
"Most often you divest in hopes 
that the company will disinvest. 
In other words, the company will 
have enough people sending these 
messages through divestment, that 
they will finally close their opera­
tions in South Africa," writes Wil­
liams. Gregory Maggetti, co­
chairperson of the Anti-Apartheid 
Network on campus, said, "We 
want to tell them (the companies) 
that it does not pay to stay in 
South Africa." 
The board will make a deci­
sion based on information from 
many sources. One is the voice of 
the African people. In its policy

statement, Notre Dame states, ."It is a moral imperative that the University of Notre Dame, as a Catholic university, use whatever influence it has to pressure the South African government to abandon apartheid and to nego­tiate with legitimate black leaders." 
The problem of a united South African protest movement has plagued blacks throughout their struggle. The African National Council and the United Democratic Front have the largest followings, each of which demands divestment. Other prom­inent black leaders, such as Gatsha 

Buthelezi, the Chief Minister of 
K wazulu, believe that pulling out 
will harm the blacks more than it 
will help them. 
Both the Anti-Apartheid Net­

work and the campus chapter of 
the NAACP feel that Notre Dame 
must pull out its investments. 
Lionel Coleman, president of the 
NAACP at Notre Dame, said, 
"Contructive engagement, as used 
in today's context, is wrong. The 
only way to constuctivley engage 
is to totally disengage. The 
involvement in South Africa is, 
for the most part, sinful." 
However, others at Notre 

Dame feel that constuctive 
engagement is possible. By 
remammg in South Africa, they 
feel that American companies pro­
vide blacks with important job 
opportunities and needed civil 
rights. By pulling out, any positive 
effect that the U.S. could have 
would be lost, said Father Zang . 
So the questions remain. Sould 

Notre Dame divest and take a 
stance, perhaps forcing companies 
out and giving an important mes­
sage to the world? Or, should they 
remain in those companies, creat­
ing important job opportunities 
for blacks, and, by demanding 
compliance to certain principles in 
the work place, help to change 
South Africa from the inside? 

A few weeks before he decided to change his principles, Leon Sullivan met with Father Williams. Sullivan informed Father Williams that he was con~ sidering changing his principles to complete divestment. Father Wil­liams said, "I told him I thought it was a mistake. He said that he had to follow his conscience, and that ·he hoped I would follow mine." As long as these men of good con­science continue to disagree, the ·question of divestment will con­tinue to be an issue of heated 
debate.

R.E.M Dozing Off 
Document, REM's latest release, uncharacteristically too "popish" 
'"'I  ,...  ast  week,  R.E.M.  
played two shows  
at the UIC Pavil­ 
lion  that  were  
~  well  attended  by  
----­ ND  students.  

Since South Bend only seems to be able to attract the likes of Whitesnake and Def Leppard, many people, myself included, often make the trek to Chicago to see groups such as the Hoodoo Gurus, Pink. Floyd, U2, and, of course, R.E.M. However, although I heard a fairly decent bootleg recording of Thursday's show, I was not there in person. 
Two years ago I willingly traveled hours, skipped school, and failed tests to see them play. My current indifference toward the foursome from Athens, GA, 
, reflects the change that the group has undergone, and the reaction of many of their fans. 
Two years ago, R.E.M. was the most critically acclaimed "campus" band. They had just released Fables of the Recon­struction, which had the same 
. mysterious quality as their previ­ous two albums. Then in 1986 they released Lifes Rich Pageant. Although it was not a complete departure from their earlier releases, this album had a more direct and staightforward style. Lead singer Michael Stipe's lyrics were actually comprehensible for the first time, and the music had a slightly harder edge to it. And 
for the first time, fans came out 
of their concerts disappointed. Their latest release, Docu­ment, completes this change. A few songs do retain the jangly guitar style that characterized their early music, but most of the songs on the album are direct rockers, complete with power chords and all. "Strange," which is a cover of an old song by Wire, sounds as if it was done by the Rolling Stones on 'shrooms. Not only is the music more direct, but so are the lyrics. Stipe's 
voice is brought out more in the mix, and he is articulating his words. And the words are actu­
ally communicating logical mes­sages now! Lines such as "Wrap your heel in bones of steel/Turn away the twister" are things of the past. 
"The Finest Hour," "Wel­come to the Occupation," and especially "Exhuming McCarthy" all address political and social issues. "We're address­ing realpolitik/Look who bought the myth/Buy jingo, buy Ameri­can." It doesn't take much to realize what they're talking about now. 
When I listen to Document and Murmur, which came out in 1983, I tend to wonder whether R.E.M.'s development is positive growth. Don't get me wrong; I think that Document is a great album, and, as the bootleg tape showed, they can still put on a great show. And although their mu~ic is more accessible now, it can hardly be considered main­stream (even though I shuddered when I learned that "The One I Love," which was released as a single last month, was getting airplay on pop stations). They still approach their music with unconventionality. Personally, though, I miss· their old murky sound. Who cared if you didn't understand the words. There was a certain excitement to their music which doesn't seem as pre­valent today. I saw them in '84 and '85, and those were two of the best concerts I've been to. 

Today that type of atmo­sphere is impossible, and I couldn't muster up enough enthusiasm to drive·to Chicago to see them. I worry that R.E.M. has become too big. I love the fact that more people are digging their sound, but my selfish side misses when no one knew who they were, and their music was newer and fresher. A friend of mine recently summed it up when he said, "I liked them better when I coudn't tell what the hell they were talking about!" 
R.E.M. is still a great group. They are still one of the few groups whose albums I would buy simply because they did it, and I could be sure that I'd like it. I am only expressing a certain ambivalence I have toward them now. I can only hope that my fears that R.E.M. is going downhill will be erased with their next release.

Rome Studies Program 

rancesco Montana established the Rome Studies program in 1969 as a unique opportunity for the junior year architec­ture students of the University of Notre Dame to pursue intensive studies in a foreign context. When the School of 
Architecture formed its Master Degree Program two years ago the Rome program was extended to include those students. It is the only overseas program that is exclusively for the students of one discipline within the University, and is not administered by the Foreign Studies Program. It is the only such program that is required curriculum in any school of architec­ture in the nation. 
The Program is now administered by Professor Gloria Sama who has been with the program for 
·more than ten years. Her faculty of six is from three nations, offers diverse talents, and typically includes one professor on loan from the home campus. Sama oversees a demanding curriculum of fifteen credit hours of course work, mandatory group field trips throughout Italy (and when budget allows to Paris, France), and encourages independent study through travels during Christmas and Spring breaks. The academic courses include an architectural design stu­dio, an urban studies course featuring guided walk­ing tours throughout Rome, and a sketching course. Many say architects cannot speak without a pen in their hands. For us, sketching is like studying a language. While in Rome, the students are introduced to the use of a sketchbook and are required to pro­duce analyses in that book. Later, the students use this sketch book for their independent discoveries. 
Through the Cultural Arts Fund of $ 1000 donated by a generous alumnus of the Program, the students can take advantage of any cultural event they wish. Last year, I attended events which included a Rus­sian opera performed in Sicily by the troupe ori­ginating the piece many years ago , exhibits, sym­phonic and chamber concerts, and even a few Amer­ican jazz (pronounced 'jatz' in Italy) performers, but unfortunately Eric Clapton was a nonreimburseable event. 
The students live in the Albergo Lunetta in the heart of the historic center and a few blocks from the University-owned studio building. The facilities of the Saint Mary's College Rome Study Program (which is open to Notre Dame students) are located nearby, and the students frequently live and work as a community. There is no food service for the archi­tecture students, nor a periodic stipend or a kitchen facility. This produces an annual challenge to the students who would enjoy eating in restaurants three meals a day but simply cannot afford to do so. As a result some students find themselves opening their own impromptu restaurants in their rooms. In addi­tion Italy does not have coin-operated laundry facili­ties, so the. students had to work out appropr_iate individual solutions to the problem. Some solut10ns 

were less than appropriate not to mention hygienic. 
The Rome Studies Program of the School of Architecture is an excellent opportunity to learn on various levels and most students take the opportunity to do so. The education received is not simply about architecture or art history, it is much more than that It is concerned with the sociology of the urban environment, of foreign cultures, and most impor­tantly· it is learning about American culture. As in all things the goal is for each student to find his or her particular niche. For myself, I learned as much through the adversity as through the academics. 
If you have read this article you know what the students do in Rome, if you want the opportunity to see what they saw come to the Expo Roma. The Expo is an exhibit conceived and produced by the students each year to display their sketches, paintings, photo­graphs and formal projects produced in the previous year. The exhibit finishes tomorrow at the Architec­ture building and then moves to the West Point room in the LaFortune Student Center. Next semester, the exhibit will appear in the main lobby of the Hes­burgh Library. The Architecture students will appre­ciate your interest and input and also invite you to attend the Beaux Arts Ball on November 20. The• stag event is sponsored by the architecture students each semester for the enjoyment of the student body. This semester the theme will be 'Elements of Style' and will feature both a live band and disc jockeys. 

SOCCER 
The Irish needed to win their remain­

ing three games at home for a shot at an 
NCAA tournament bid. The team accom­
plished just that, knocking off. Valparaiso, 
Marquette, and Ohio State over the past 
week. However, the NCAA overlooked the 
Irish (17-3-1) in its tournament selections. 
The Irish defeated Marquette 3-1 on Friday 
and Ohio State 2-1 on Sunday. 
Friday's game saw the Irish and the Warriors trade goals early on, with JOE STERNBERG scoring for Notre Dame. RANDY MORRIS and BRUCE McCOURT then put the game away with two more goals. Sunday's game against Ohio State started off with DANNY STEBBINS scor­ing at the 35:28 mark. JOHN GUIGNON added a second goal before Ohio State finally got on the board with :18 left to make the final 2-1. 
VOLLEYBALL 

The volleyball team finished the week at 3-1, raising its overall record to 23-8. The Irish now take on Valparaiso tomorrow night and Michigan State Saturday to close out their home season before travelling to Western Michigan on November 17 for the regular-ileason finale. 
Against Wes tern Michigan, the Irish fell to a Top~20 team for the sixth·time this year. Notre Dame came back from a 11-4 deficit in game one to win, 15-13, but the Broncos dominated after that by holding the team to just seven points in the last three games. ZANETTE BENNETT and MAUREEN SHEA led the Irish in the match with 18 and 12 kills respectively. 
The team rebounded from the loss by winning three in a row against Eastern Michigan, Dayton and Louisville. Eastern Michigan stayed close for the first four games, before the Irish pulled away with 12 unanswered points in the fifth game. Ben­nett and Shea again led the team, with B~nnP.tt recordinit 25 kills and Shea 21. 
Shea then-recorded 13 kills with MARY KAY WALLER adding eight blocks as the Irish cruised to a 3-0 win over Day­ton. The team finished off the week with another 3-0 win over Louisville. 
HOCKEY 
The hockey ·team skated to two ties against Kent State this week. The two teams finished deadlocked at 5-5 on Friday night, with MIKE McNEILL and BRUCE GUAY each scoring two goals. In Saturday's matchup, the Irish took an early 4-2 lead but couldn't hang on. Kent State scored two goals in the second period to tie the game, and both teams scored two in the third period as the game ended in a 6-6 tie. KEVIN MARKOVITZ and TOM MOO·· NEY both scored twice for the Irish. 
Notre Dame takes on Lake Forest tomorrow and Saturday night. Friday's game will be at home at the JACC at 7:30 p.m, and Saturday's will be at Lake Forest. 
WOMEN'S CROSS COUNTRY 
The women's cross country team, idle last week, will also compete in the NCAA District IV meet at Bowlin1r Green. 
MEN'S CROSS COUNTRY 
The men's cross country team com­petes in the NCAA District IV meet at Bowling Green, OH., on Saturday. Junior 
RON MARKEZICH and senior captain 
DAN GARRETT hope to bring the Irish 
back to the NCAA Championships for the 
first time since 1984. The Irish need to fin­
ish in the top three of a 40-team field to 
advance to the NCAA's. 
WOMEN'S SWIMMING 
The women's swimming team started its season last weekend at the Notre Dame relays by tying Illinois-Chicago. The women set six of eight meet records and won eight of the 18 events, but a disqualifi­cation in the 400-yard breaststroke relay forced the tie. The Irish set records in the 1000-yard freestyle relay, the 400-yard medley relay and the 200-yard free relay, among others. They will take on Alabama in the Rolfs Aquatic Center tomorrow at 4 p.m. 


MEN'S SWIMMING 

The men's swimming team took first place at the Notre Dame Invitational, tak­ing first-place finishe ¦ in 10 of the 13 events. Wayne State, Illinois-Chicago, Wabash, Valparaiso, Marquette and Butler all fell to the Irish. The team take ¦ on 5th-ranked Alabama tomorrow in the Rolfs Aquatic Center at 4 p.m.

And playing on Janu­

Bama's Heisman-hopeful Humphrey has already passed the 1000-yard mark in '87. 
But what the Alabama game means really just may be the oppo­site. The Irish may be able to sur­vive a split in their next two games and play on New Year's Day, but there's no way a team with two 
losses will be able to grab the national championship this year [see story, page 24]. So if the Irish want to be Number One, they've got to beat 'Barna. Unlike last year, however, the scheduling gods have conspired in Notre Dame's favor this season. 
Last week, Alabama took a big step on its own comeback trail, keeping its Southeast Conference championship hopes alive with a solid 22-10 upset of fifth-ranked LSU. The win means 'Barna still could be chosen to represent the SEC in this year's Sugar Bowl. Currently, the Tide stands at 4-1 in the. SEC, with the conference now wide open. Auburn (3-0-1) plays at 4-1 Georgia on Saturday, and then travels to Alabama on November 27. Both Alabama and Auburn get a week off to prepare for what could be a showdown for the Sugar Bowl. And even though the Auburn game is two weeks away, the Tide will come in a little distracted, listening Saturday for updates on the Auburn-Georgia game. 

Still, one can never count the Tide out. They have reeled off some impressive road wins at Penn State (24-13) and LSU this year, and always seem to rise to the occasion of a big game. Yet, this year at least, some of the buildup could be considered myth. Penn State, while always good, has not played nearly up to last year's form. And while LSU remains a tough place to play for many teams, it's easy for Alabama. In the last nine matchups in Baton Rouge, Alabama has rolled home with an 8-0-1 record. 
Then there is the matter of Alabama's two losses --one to Florida · (23-14) at home, and a shocking 13-10 loss at Memphis State. In both losses, one statistic stands out clearly --Alabama's Mr. Excitement, Bobby Hum­phrey, was held to less than 100 yard~. The 6-1, 195-pound junior tailback has already surpassed the 1,000 yard-mark on the season and has broken two long touchdown runs of 73 and 83 yards. The Tide also considers Humphrey its top receiver, as he has hauled in 18 balls for 159 yards and two touch­downs. But if the Irish defense can contain Humphrey just as they have similar runners such as Lorenzo White, it can derail the Tide offense. ·

Holtz. "Like so many of the SEC teams you see, Alabama has tremendous team speed. . They've got great athletes on both sides of the ball." 
Junior outside linebacker Der­rick Thomas (6-4, 222) has made Cornelius Bennett's departure easier, recording twice as many sacks as any other Alabama defender. Even with the sacks, the Tide has allowed their opponents to outgain them through 
· the air at a 172.7 to 127.8 yards­per-game clip. Alabama red-shirt freshman Jeff Dunn, who replaced junior David Smith in the Tennessee game after Smith broke his collar­bone, leads the Tide offense at quarterback. While Dunn's . numbers (29-of-60 for 429 yards, three TDs, four interceptions) don't particularly stand out, he has shown improvement in guiding his club to three straight victories. When Dunn goes to the air, he looks for split ends Clay Whi­tehurst (16 receptions for 266 yards) and Angelo Stafford (12 for

186, 1 TD) as well as Humphrey. Alabama's freshman placekicker Philip Doyle, meanwhile, kicked field goals of 45, 29 and 32 _yards last week against LSU, improving his season stats to l l-of-17. And with punter Chris Mohr averaging 
40.4 yards a kick, it will be interesting to see what Alabama head coach Bill Curry does · to counter the threat of Tim Brown's returns. 
Alabama represents the toughest team Notre Dame has faced this year. With Tony Rice apparently taking over at quarter­back, the Irish offense seems to be in gear with an unstoppable run­ning attack. The defense, how­ever, had its problems with Boston College, especially in the secon­dary. But if the Irish can control the Tide's offense, they can go a long way in controlling their own destinies.

The COLLEGE BOWL Question 
With less than ten days left before bids get extended, our institutions of higher learning are finding the bowl question as abstruse as ever. 

1 • 
BY 
MARTY BURNS 

i; 
All right, College Bowl teams. For the College Bowl win and a grand prize trip to the New Year's Day bowl of your choice, answer the following question: 
Who goes to the Orange Bowl this year if Notre Dame loses one of its two upcoming games but beats Miami. while Georgia upsets Auburn and forces a three-way tie for the Southeastern Conference cham­pionship between itself, LSU, and Alabama? Your choices are a. Miami, b. Notre Dame, c. Florida State, d. Syracuse, e. LSU, or f. Saint Mary's. 
Can anybody venture a guess? How about you, Miami team? You haven't answered a question all day.... Time is running out, con­testants ... 
WE'RE SORRY BUT THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN CAN­CELLED BECAUSE MIAMI COACH JIMMY JOHNSON, THE LITTLE TROLL, HAS STRUCK A SECRET DEAL WITH THE ORANGE BOWL AND RUN OFF WITH THE GRAND PRIZE TRIP, VANNA WHITE, AND THE YEAR'S SUPPLY OF STYLING MOUSSE WE WERE GOING TO GIVE THE LOSER.

extended when, according to Irish Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal, the faculty board in charge of ath­letics meets to review its options. 
"If we have a choice we'll 

pick the bowl that will be best for Notre Dame, our football pro­gram, and our constituency," said Rosenthal. "The team we play will be a factor, the fee, the opportun­ity to play before our fans, the prestige of the bowl, these will all be factors. We will meet prior to the Penn State game and analyze our options then. Naturally we'll ask Coach Holtz for his input since he's the finest football mind we've -got" 
One thing appears certain, however. Notre Dame will not get the opportunity to play in the Orange Bowl for the national championship unless it wins all three of its remaining games. In the event the Irish beat Alabama this weekend and Penn State the following weekend, it seems likely the Orange Bowl committee would extend a conditional bid to Notre Dame and Miami, with the winner going to the Orange Bowl. In order to make this plan work, either the Cotton Bowl, the Sugar Bowl, or the Fiesta Bowl committees will assure the losing school a bid to their game. 
And what happens if Notre Dame loses once before bids go out? Although the possibilities are endless, an 8-2 Irish team most likely would rate only behind the losing Big Eight team, the Southeast Conference also-ran, and independents Florida State and Syracuse --provided they don't get upset in the next week -­in the eyes of the Cotton, Fiesta, and Citrus Bowl committees. If this scenario develops, one possi­bility would place the Irish in Dal­las to face Holtz' former school and Southwest Conference champ Arkansas in the Cotton Bowl.

Perhaps the cruelest possibil­ity to Irish fans, meanwhile, might materialize within the next week if rumors regarding Hurricane coach Jimmy Johnson's deal with the Orange Bowl committee prove true. Johnson reportedly has asked the committee for an uncondi­tional bid --in other words, regardless of whether his 'Canes lose to Notre Dame --with the threat that he will refuse their later bid if they don't. If the Orange Bowl folks cave in, Notre Dame could go 10-1 and still not get the chance to play top-ranked Oklahoma or Nebraska for the national title. This ploy appears unlikely, however, since Johnson has sworn never to allow another team's bowl game to decide his squad's title chances on New Year's Day.

Still the threat remains, leaving Rosenthal and the Irish more than a bit interested in the committee's decision. In this season of pleasant surprises, the last thing Notre Dame wants is for Johnson to manipulate its title hopes. "It's certainly the Orange Bowl's prero­gative (to work out a deal)," stated Rosenthal. "It would be inap­propriate for me to comment any further than that" Rosenthal, however, will comment on a thought that all Irish fans certainly would be wise to keep in mind. "The opportunity to play for a national championship certainly would be our hope," he said. "But I think all of our players and coaches would agree, we still have a very high hill to climb. They're smart enough to know we have to beat Alabama first." flf

Final Word 
Anger and Apartheid 



wo years ago, when I entered the University of Notre Dame as a freshman, Du Lac informed me that "Notre Dame is a professedly Catholic place... 
We do not try to relativize our beliefs by believing nothing, but rather we concretize them by commitment to God, to one another, and to the human family in love and service"(Du Lac,. 1). At the time, I had hoped that one of the beliefs that. Notre Dame would "concretize" was that the best way to serve the human family is by actively promoting good and vehemently opposing evil in accordance with the mes­sage of Chdst. I soon realized, however, that while Notre Dame refuses to believe in nothing, its record of combatting Apartheid in South Africa demonstrates that Notre Dame promotes a Christianity that stands for noth­ing. 
The essential failure of Notre Dame's South African policy can best be described in reference to a passage from the Book of Revelations which reads: "These are the words of the [Christ] ... 
·'I know all your ways; you are neither hot nor cold. How I wish you were either hot or cold! But ·because you are lukewarm . . . I will spit you out of my mouth." "Lukewarm" is the only proper description of Notre Dame's moral stand. · 
Bishop Desmond Tutu, when speaking against constructive engagement --the investment 
policy that Notre Dame embraces raised a very important ques-
BY JOHN-PAUL CHECKETT 
tion. He asked "Where is the anger in this policy?" I don't believe he was speaking of a violent anger, one born of hatred or malice, but rather a holy anger. An anger that every fol­lower of Christ should feel when confronted with injustice and despair. Why does Apartheid merit our anger?· 
In late September, a conference in Harare, Zimbabwe heard the testimony of children tortured by the South African military and police. One eleven­year-old boy had lost his teeth as a result of being beaten and sub­jected to electric shock, another child had been left naked in a refrigerator for an unspecified length of time, and another young child had sufferect per­manent damage to his eyes after being tied to a p_ole and forced to stare into bright spot lights for a prolonged period. Many chil­dren, however, are simply shot in the streets. The "crimes" for which these children are tortured and murdered include throwing a rock at an armored police car, breaking a curfew, and wearing a banned T-shirt. In ·the face of such vile cruelty, such utter disregard for the lives of children, can Notre 
Dame really call constructive engagement --a policy which helps maintain Apartheid through South Africa's taxation of. U. S. buisinesses --a state­ment of moral outrage? No, for more anger has been expressed toward the students' and faculty's call for divestment than toward Apartheid system and the oppression of blacks in that country. As the death toll rises 

and the blood of children stains the ground, the Notre Dame administration clings to outdated policy with a fervor that makes the British Flat Earth Society seeni progressive by comparison. In spite of the cries for divest­ment issued by the legitimate black leaders of South Africa, the U.S. Catholic Bishops, and Rev. Leon Sullivan --formally the prime supporter of construc­tive engagement, the Board. of Trustees has only postponed decisions. This lukewarm atti­tude is particularly frightening, because Apartheid is not simply a repugnant political ideology, but a systematized oppression and slaughter that we as Chris­tians, we as human beings, must 
deem intolerable. 
It is not enough for Notre 

Dame to simply sit back and per­
mit the affairs in South Africa to 
play themselves out. Some state­
ment must be made, some action 
must be taken, some anger must 
be shown. Tomorrow, the Board 
of Trustees will meet and make 
some decision concerning Notre 
Dame's future investments in 
South Africa. Each member of 
the Notre Dame community must 
take the decision very seriously, 
for it will determine whether we 
are really fulfilling our commit­
ment to the human family and to 
the message of Christ, or if our 
lack of action and our lack of 
anger will cause us to be spat out 
of His mouth. II
