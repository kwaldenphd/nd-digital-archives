donations from 2:30 p.m. until 8 p.m. that day. However, to make matters 
worse -and despite calls for student assistance from student government 
-the same small group ofstudents has continued to work the fundraising 
table every day since . 
Student body vice president and point person of the Katrina Collection, Lizzi Shappell, sent an e-mail out to a core group of student leaders, urg­ing them to "facilitate a unified student response" to the tragic events in the Southeast. However, student-leader response-has been minimal, and members of student government are finding themselves scrounging for just six volunteers a day to work the collection table. A broader call to the Notre Dame student body has been launched but has posted similar results, and 
the Katrina Collection continues to lack an adequate amount of student 
volunteers at LaFortune. 
This is not to say thatNotre Dame has accomplished nothing in its efforts 
to provide aid to those suffering from the aftermath ofHurricane Katrina. 
In fact, the opposite is perhaps more true, with individual residence halls 
and their staffs doing their part to collect clothing and money for the relief 
effort. In addition, the amount ofmoney raised via the Katrina Collection is 
sizable, with students comprising the majority ofthose individuals who have 
donated. However, at a university that prides itself on its Catholic nature, 
certain questions must be raised. Is it enough to simply pull out a few one­
dollar bills from a wallet and walk on,_ thinking one has done one's part? 
Is it the Catholic mission to prohibit students from donating to a worthy 
cause oftheir choice (like the Red Cross) or to delay the sending ofaid to 
needy individuals? Or has it really become acceptable for good Catholics 
to stand in the face of a national crisis and do the bare minimum, just to 
be able to say, "I helped"?

STAFF EDITORIAL 
Calling all Catholics 
Have you lent a hand? 
s the floodwaters of Hurricane Katrina continued to overwhelm southeastern America onFriday, Sept. 2, a small group ofNotre Dame students decided to take action. With the goal ofsetting up a table 
in the LaFortune Student Center to collect money for the hurricane relief effort, this group spoke with student government, who then approached the administration with their proposal at approximately 
9:30 a.m. Butitwas not until 2:30 p.m. that their request finally was approved. 
Five hours had passed, during which time the group of students could have been raising much-needed donations. In addition, the group found itself answering procedural questions ("How big will your posters be?" and "In what kind of container will you put the collected money?") before being able to set up shop, so to speak. 
Instead of asking the questions one would hope the administra­tion at a Catholic university would raise -such as a simple "How can we help?" -the university may have unintentionally impeded the process. Strict guidelines were set as to what organizations would receive the donations and when they would receive them. To be spe­cific, money could be donated only to Catholic-affiliated organiza­tions, with the donations not being sent until after two weeks from the starting date ofthe student fundraising effort -at the same time as the money collected during the Michigan State game. What's more, the table would have to be closed down prior to the first home game, so as to not create "competition" with the charitable effort that will take 
place in the stadium . 
Undeterred, this group ofstudents set up the Katrina Collection, raising

Time at a Standstill 
Indiana Legislature disagrees on the correct time zone for its residents 
• Erik Rocca
Thursday, April 28, 2005, was a time~changing event in Indiana's 
history-literally. On this day, theindianaLegislature voted to 
approve Daylight Savings Time for Indiana, but the state can't seem to decide which time zone it wants to be.a·part of. 
Federal lawmakers, who ultimately have the·power to make the Hoo­sier state spring ahead and fall back, have.instructed Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels to recommend the time zone that best reflects the wishes of the'Indiana public. 
Rather than make a decision on his own, Daniels has left the question oftime in the hands oflndiana's 92 counties (77 ofwhich never reset their clocks). But the counties can't agree on whether to change to Central Daylight Time (CDT) or Eastern Daylight Time (EDT). 
Indiana businesses with ties to Chicago favor a move to CDT, while businesses tied to New York favor ED'DFor example, because it is home to many large, international companies, Indianapolis and the southern part ·of the state are leaning toward EDT. But that move might not be best for South Bend and the rest of northwestern Indiana. 
"They thinkwe're connected to New York. It's true that international businesses may be connected to New York, but the majority of South Bend local businesses are linked to Chicago," says Indiana House Minor­ity Leader Patrick Bauer, D-South Bend_ "Most residents in St. Joseph County are in favor of Central (Daylight) Time, or no change at all." 
While some South Bend businessespeople -including those at 1st Source Bank, who say a time change would have "no effect" upon the success or failure. oftheir business_---are unconcerned about which time zone is ultimately chosen, many locals and politicians remain steeped in debate. 
At this time, it is unknown when the counties will reach an agreement and when Daniels will make his recommendation. "Everythingis uncertain,'~Bauer says. "The whole situation is a mess_" @

Gold and Blue Collar 
Students, faculty and staff unite 
in support of a living wage for all 
campus workers 
o Mike Laskey 
ShawnJackson has been a custofan at Notre Dame since 2001. He works the 4 
a.m. to 12:30 p.m. shift five days a week at LaFortune Student Center, and makes b<:!tween_ $_9 -$JO an hour. With two young daughters at home and a wife pur­suing a degree in elementary education, Jackson has to rely on financial support from his extended family to afford day­to-day living. "It's a struggle," Jackson says. "From a father's perspective, you want to be able to take care ofyour fam­ily the best way that you can, without so much help from your [relatives]." 
Before coming to Notre Dame, Jack-­son held several positions at Memorial Hospital in South Bend, Ind., including a job in housekeeping similar to his current one at the university. When what Jackson describes as a political situation arose at Memorial, he left the hospital and found a job at Notre Dame, hoping his new posi­tion would give him the opportunity to "impact a generation." 
However, Jackson's improvement in location didn't lead to an improvement in pay; in fact, it led to a decline. "The jobs [atMemorial and Notre Dame] don't really compare in pay," he says. "When I was in housekeeping at Memorial seven or eight years ago, I was making over 10 dollars an hour." 
Jackson's story is notthe only one ofits kind, and a new student-led campaign, the Campus Labor Action Project (CLAP), has been seeking out campus employees' stories like Jackson's since last spring. Based on their findings, these concerned. students are now ready to act. 
Senior Kamada Porter -one ofNotre __ 
Dame's most prominent student activists ~ -~egan to examine campus labor condi­~ tions last spring after the national Taco ~ Bell Boycott campaign she had been in­~ valved in ended victoriously. "We knew 
o all about the work conditions of [Taco ~ell's.tomato pickers] in South Florida, 
I ~~ If....... 6 

. but we didn't know anything about work­
ing at South Dining Hall," Porter says. 
"For me, that just felt wrong." 
So Porter and several other students 
started to talk to employees all over 
campus, from the dining halls to the 
dorms. "We asked employees what it's 
like to work here, live here, and if they 
were able to make it on Notre Dame's 
wages," Porter says. 

In their dialogue the students found 
that a number of employees hold two 
jobs, some while raising a family. They 
learned about an understaffing problem 
in the library that prohibits one employ­
ee they spoke to -from being able to take 
pride in his rushed work, Porter says. 
The students metJackson in LaFortune, 
and he has been involved in the cam ­
paign ever since. "Hearing these stories 
impelled us to start organizing people 
around living wage and "labor issues on 
campus," Porter says. 
Central to CLAP's mission is achiev­ing the creation of a living wage policy at Notre Dame. A living wage is "a calculation of the total compensation required by a family in a given location to adequately meet its basic needs without public or private assistance," according to the Georgetown University Living Wage Campaign's Web site. 
CLAP has drafted a preliminary living wage proposal to present to the admin­istration,which stipulates that all Notre Dame employees receive atleast $11.50 an hour with health insurance, or $13.50 an hour without health insurance. 
With their basic goals identified, the approximately 30 students and 15 staff and faculty members who are currently active members of CLAP are preparing for the campaign's first big event, sched­uled for later this month. "The biggest thing we're looking forward to is our fall assembly on Wednesday Sept. 28,

_and snatches ,away that closely guarded sel).se of certajnty. Sometimes it so hap­pens that the mighty burden of leading a proud, successful community falls on a person who would rather observe the action than control it. •· 
Although as yet the Rev.John Ignatius Jenkins, C.S.C., may be too young and too new-to his position as the 17th presi­dent of the University of Notre Dame to be displaying prominent signs of aging, 
, something that he does share with the late President Truman is a strong apprecia ­tion for scholarship and a'longing to be in a classroom full of eager, young minds. Prior. to holding various administrative positions at the university during the second.half of the '90s, Jenkins' primary profession was teaching ancient and me­dieval:philosophy to Notre Dame under­graduates. Aft.er talking with -a number of Jenkins' .former colleagues in the Department of Philosqphy, their shared sentimenf.becomes .clear: Jenkins is, first and foremos~1.a•m{ln ofthe academy. 
. While worlci:qgtoward his Ph.D. at Ox­ford University duri~g the 1980s, Jenkins became acquaintei:l ,with Kenneth ·Sayre, a Notre Dame philosqp~y_pr.ofessor, :w:ho was also at Oxford at t:heitime on:a•visit­ing fellowship. ''He's shown ·n01obvJ0us reluctance to take on administratiiv_e · responsibilities, but I think he's more of a natural born scholar," Sayre says. Paul Weithman, current chair of the Depart­ment of Philosophy, first met Jenkins when the latter served as a teaching assis­tant for Weithman's freshman philosophy 101 class in 1977. Weithman again came into contact with Jenkins when the two served as junior faculty together during the early 1990s. "He's a very studious guy and, had circumstances been different, I'm sure he would have been commit­ted to a life of scholarship," Weithman says. Jenkins embraces these sentiments from1his • ..Ci:olle~gues. Indeed, at the very

by h~s favorite philosopher, St. Thomas Aqumas, a text that forms the basis for both Jenkins' doctoral dissertation and his book, "Knowledge and Faith in Thomas Aquinas." All of these scholarly works have contributed to the continual search for moral truths and religious wis­dom that has dominatedJenkins' life. For 
.Jenkins, there is something special about ,ilie,rigorous process of in-depth analysis, arrd ;he ;ties it inexorably to his spiritual development. 
This spiritma.l development can b_e traced back to Oma:h~, Neb;, where Jen­kins was born and raised in-whatm~y.be best described as the typical Midwestern Catholic family. Jenkins was the third child born to Harry and Helen Jenkins and assumed the role of big brother in a family that eventually swelled to a total of 12 children. After spending his entire childhood in Omaha and attend­ing Creighton Preparatory High School, Jenkins enrolled at Creighton University for his freshman year of college. He ended upspendingonlythatfirstyearofcollege at Creighton, however, and finally left Omaha to settle in South Bend, Ind., for his sophomore year at Notre Dame. Dur­ing his undergraduate ,studies at Notre Dame, Jenkins' attraction to philosophy began to flourish. Professor of phi10 sophy Neil Delaney made a first assessment of Jenkinswhenhetaughthimover30years ago, and his impression has remained the same: "John was a great undergraduate philosophy student.

Immediately after receiving a B.A. in philosophy in 1976, Jenkins started graduate school at Notre Dame and earned his master's degree in philosophy two years later. Following the comple­tion of his master's, Jenkins entered a marked period of uncertainty in his life as he tried to discern what to do with the rest of his life. Ironically enough; while reflecting ,on this period in his life and trying to capture the essence of what he experienced, Jenkins is reminded of a quote by the notoriously anti-religious philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche that he believes captures the importance ofhav­ing a clear purpose in life: "Ifyou have a 'why' to life, you can get by anyhow." In the course of searching for the meaning of his own life, Jenkins kept coming back to one very critical question: "If! was to do something, what work would I do which would be such that, if I had to give my life for it, I could do it? What would be that important to me? For some reason

Hesburgh; nor does he display the more domineering stage presence of the regal Malloy. In comparison, Jenkins assumes the stature of the tempered sage who is old enough to make wise decisions but still young enough to serve as a poster boy for the oetimism of youth. And perhaps herein lies his appeal. Although an intellectual heavyweight and now a man of great power, Jenkins still comes across as the quintessential Midwestern boy from Omaha who seems wholesome and trustworthy--" two qualities that are essential for any effective leader. 
In listening to Jenkins describe his transition from the private realm of 
--scholarship and leisurely activities to the position of power that he now finds himselfin, one cannot help but detect a man who is fairly torn be­tween his naturaf tendencies toward intellectual, academic work and his

·The overwhelming consensus among Notre Dame faculty members regarding Jenkins is that he is a man ofunquestion­able integrity. According to Weithman, "He just radiates moral credibility."

-we could say, 'I hope we're twice as good in 10 years.' The way we stand now, I hope in 10 years we're 10 per­cent better. Thatwould be a tremen­dous success," Delaney says. 
Now only two weeks away, Jen­kins' forthcoming inauguration is guaranteed to be an epochal event for the university.

said, 'You're it.' And that was it," Hes­burgh recalls. 
For its entire history prior to Hes­burgh, Notre Dame often was viewed as a finishing school for Catholic men and boys. According to Arthur Hope's authoritative book, "Notre Dame: The First 100 Years," several ofNotre Dame's early presidents had a defeatist attitude toward making Notre Dame a serious academic force on a national level. The Rev. Edward Sorin, C.S.C., never took the idea of being an intellectually rigor­ous university seriously, and this idea is reflected in his successors. Hope's book cites Notre Dame's eighth president, the Rev. Andrew Morrissey, C.S.C., as saying, "We can never compete with those colleges that have such tremen­dous endowments! Our very existence depends on giving Catholic boys a good preparatory foundation.'' The paradigm shiftin thinking about Catholic education came with the revolutionary Hesburgh. While studying toward his doctorate at Catholic University of America in VVashington, D.C., Hesburgh's wrote his thesis on the role of laymen in the Church. "I said, 'The time has come in a rather clerically dominated Church to give laypeople responsibility consonant with their integrity and their intelligence and their confidence"' Hesburgh remem­bers. His genius vision came to fruition in January 1967, whenitwas decided during a weeklong meeting that the governance ofthe university would be turned over to a lay board of trustees. Prior to 1967, the rule of the university-including selec­tion of the president -lay solely in the hands of the local Holy Cross provincial council, which consisted of no more than five priests. "This is not to say that the selection of the president was done cavalierly. But it would be, the decision of a small group, and ultimately the deci­sion would be made by the provincial at the top," says Mike Garvey, the assistant director of the Office of News and In­formation. Encouraged by the eventual success of Hesburgh's new management model between clerics and laymen, today virtually every large, Catholic organiza­

V1 more than ever, part ofthe job of being 
university president. Jenkins inherits a campus that is socially volatile, despite the fact that the student body remains 85 percent Catholic. Near the beginning of the school year, Jenkins met with the minority affairs committee of student government to discuss the sensitive issue of diversity, which became all the more explosive last year following the abrupt firing of former Head Football Coach Tyrone Willingham. Jenkins sounds optimistic about introducing issues of diversity in the curriculum and hopes that better networks can be established between different minority groups. "I hope we can accomplish a richer discus­sion and discover what we can learn from it," Jenkins says. 
While optimistic, however, Jenkins is also extremely frank about what he be­lieves the university can do in the area of being a completely inclusive community. Each year Notre Dame ranks either dead last or very close to it in the Princeton Re­view category, "Alternative lifestyles not an alternative," which most interpret as a negative university attitude toward the gay community. "A bunch ofpeople from the Princeton Review writing their little rankings doesn't really move me one way or another. So I find that [the low rank­ings] are somewhat arrogant, to use a mild term," he says. Jenkins pledges to make all those who come to the university feel welcomed: "We are more Catholic insofar as every student feels a part of this place. I don't care ifthat person is gay, lesbian or straight. We need to work as hard as we can to make everybody feel included." However, Jenkins doesn't believe that Notre Dame can ac­commodate every lifestyle that might be termed "al­ternative." "Obviously, there are some lifestyles that this isn't the place for. That's just the way it is. Anybody with a few brain cells will see that," Jenkins says with a tone of strong conviction. 
The story of Jenkins' first few years will be an exhibition of what hap­pens when a philosopher assumes the role ofphi­losopher king amidst a. group of non-academic administrative figures, some of whom do not share his good.,. natured disposition. He is not entirely new to this role. "He has gradually been getting familiar with the environment. Since he has done well at all the other [administrative] levels, there's no reason for me to think that it won't continue," Delaney says. And while nobody will deny Jenkins' personable nature, one can't help but wonder how this genial, soft-spoken man will make his mark. Sayre, perhaps, says it best: "[ ... ] He is a man of great personal integrity, and such people are very rare to find these days. The way this works out in the first few years of his presidency will be very exciting.'' @

cpaper time. We've all been there. Your contacts are shellacked to your eyes because you've slept in them for five days straight; you can't remember the last time you ate a meal that didn't consist ofbulk candy from the Huddle or free Coke from Coleman­Morse Center; the stress oflife has driven you to a borderline unhealthy relationship with the fermented grain; and you are the smell that everyone is talking about. But it was right around paper time that Robert Pazornik (ND '02) came up with an idea _that would get his post-graduation career rolling. Pazornik and some friends had just :fin­ished a group paper when they discovered that their printer was out of ink. They drew straws and Pazornik lost, sending him out into the city of South Bend on a quest for ink. The ink cartridge proved to be elusive. Pazornikrealizedhewasted two full hours driving to various stores that either didn't carry the ink he was looking for or did~'t have it in stock.. His experience set the wheels in his head turning. He wondered why, ifhe and his friends could get a pizza delivered in 30 minutes, he couldn't do the same with the ink cartridge. As a result, Pazornik, one ofthe found­ers ofNDToday.com, developed a busi­ness plan with some other students that eventually became LicketyShip.com, an . online shipping community. The creation ofLicketyShip.com·involved establishing relationships with retailers within 20 miles ofwhere users place their orders, as opposed to the large, distant warel?,ouses from which Web sites like Amazon.com ship their products. Using local couriers, LicketyShip.com is able to get products to consumers remarkably efficiently -within two to four hours and for a cost ofaround $23. Currently, LicketyShip.com operates out ofCushing Hall on the Notre Dame campus. The :company.~s comprised of both recent Notre Dame graduates and

MBAs under the guidance ofmentorTim Connors (ND '89). It currently provides service to St. Joseph County and the Michiana-area, and there are plans for a nationwide expansion. 
Pazorniksays the education he received at Notre Dame prepared him for success in the business world. He mentions in particular a piece of wisdom from busi­ness professor JeffBernel's entrepreneur­ship class. Bernel told his class that in order to thrive they would need to "beg, borrow and steal," and Pazornik feels that this has proven to be true. Because they feel that Notre Dame has given them so much, the founders of LicketyShip.com have made it their priority to give back what they can to the university. Theyhave established the Four Horseman Fund for young entrepreneurs coming out ofNotre Dame. The company also plans to begin an internship program for computer sci­ence_and possibly marketing majors at the university. 
When asked if he had any advice he felt important to share with current students at Notre Dame, Pazornik again found himself quoting one ofhis former professors. Though the name escaped him, he clearly remembered the advice:· "Don't let Notre Dame get in the way of

And don't spend too much time drjving around looking for ink. 0

There's nothing like seeing the ocean after looking at the strip malls ofGrape Road all year, and though Fun Tan serves its pur­pose in the winter, everyone should make the effort to bask in the New Jersey sun during the summer. 0 June with one goal in mind: to have the time of their lives. Featuring artists from numerous genres, including blue grass, jam band, hip-hop and modern rock, there was something for everyone at Bonnaroo 2005. 

After a Homeric 17-hour car ride, we arrived in Manchester as the sun began to set on Thursday, June 9. As we drove through the entry gates into an inter­minable sea of campers and tents heavy with coolers, luggage and mind-altering substances, we were bombarded by the sights, sounds and unforgettable smell of the festival grounds. For the next three days, Bonnaroo would be our home. 
We had an itinerary for the weekend, but such a schedule was impossible to follow amidst the tie-dyed hemp haze and general chaos that is Bonnaroo. Pac­ing ourselves was essential at an outdoor festival held in 95-degree heat, especially when bands we just couldn't miss played through the early morning hours. After a long Friday of stage hopping in the blazing sun to catch Jurassic 5, Herbie Hancock, the Allman Brothers and the Benevento Russo Duo, we retired briefly to our campsite to collect ourselves for the acts that would start at midnight. Then, after a S~und Tribe Sector 9 show that lasted until 7 a.rri., we slept through most

When we finally woke up that after­noon, our only concerns were finding food, a hose and a port-a-potty that had been cleaned within the past five hours. After these basic needs were met, we returned to the main fairground just in time to catch Particle. Saturday night

Light rains on Saturday provided welcome relief, and Bonnaroo roared on through Sunday morning. While many people headed for home on Sunday, Bonnaroo continued for an­. other afternoon and evening packed with incredible sets from the likes ofBob Weir and Ratdog, The Word, Earl Scruggs and the Notre Dame alumni of Umphrey's McGee. vVidespread Panic played a sec­ond show featuring Robert Randolph to cap off the weekend, and we returned to our tents exhausted. We took to the highway through the rolling Tennessee hills on Monday morning. Despite our aching backs and ringing ears, we drove away from the campgrounds satisfied.

The usual pepperoni or barbeque chicken pizza is replaced with topping options like "lamb pep­peroni," "chicken tikka" and some­thing that looks like corn on the cob. Somewhere between my "piz­za" and having to use holes in the ground they call "toilets," I realized that I am American, as well as to what extent this is true. 
This summer, while many other students were working in a restaurant or in a law office, I was in the state of Kerala in southern India. Since my mom's extended family still resides in India, I was looking forward to seeing relatives I hadn't seen in years. But from the moment I stepped off the plane, I realized that I am a foreigner, despite my physical resemblance to the billion chocolate-,skinned people who call India home. English is spoken only to for­eigners, and -somehow -my brother and I were always identified as such. 
Experiencing a different culture changed my perspective on life. During the time that I was at my cousins' home, spending each day doing little other than watching TV and having my cousins

The traditions that many Indians hold can create the illusion of an exceedingly back­ward environment to many Western people. For example, my cousins' town has an annual church fes­tival to celebrate the · patron saint of their church. During the day, the people of the town shop at rum­mage sales the church sponsors, which seems normal enough. But at night, it is tradition for all the families to bring live chick­ens, spices, pots and pans to the church grounds.

rA/swimming Gets~u owhere 
Whab Notre Dame should really teach its freshmen 
• Erik Powers 
cSome guys enjoy getting half­naked and spending the early hours of the morning with 
bikini-clad girls. I'm not telling any­one else how to live their lives, b11t :['ye hit that up, and honestly, the situation never did anything for me. 
There's nothing sexy about swim ­ming lessons. 
Failing the freshman swim test could've been a beautiful thing. But it wasn't. I don't have memories of meet­ing a future wife, girlfriend, friend or person-I'd-awkwardly-nod-at-while­walking-by-in-the-dining-hall in that class. Come to think of it, I can't re­member either the form for swimming the elementary backstroke or the.length oftime I should wait after eating before entering the water. It seems that my only recollections from two rotations of swimming are ofthe instructor, Brother Louis, and his large nipples, which are roughly the size of half-dollars. 
I'm not certain that I should have been taking the course to begin with. Admittedly, I can't swim, but that doesn't mean that I should learn how. I don't know how to balance a chair on my chin, either, so I generally avoid situations that necessitate either float­ing in water or steadying recliners on my mandible. 
Sidestepping the former has require'd a little effort. I scrapped this summer's plans to ice-skate the length ofthe Mis­sissippi. As a standard practice, I wait hours for puddles to evaporate before even thinking of crossing by them. When I've wanted to play in sand, I've

skills, like leaping frqm second-story 
windows without breaking bon!;!s. I 
know that the new freshman class is 
the smartest,.,most athletic, best look­
ing and, of course, filled with the most 
all-powerful super heroes that we've 
ever1-had. But there's no spot on the 
admission application that screens 
for un2-break-a-fall-:-ability. We need 
a separate process1 that;:w:eeds out 
frail freshmenrand,places·them in an 
environment where::they will be able 
to learn the proper "jump, tuck-and­
roll" technique. In this more perfect 
ND scenario, DeBartolo would only 
have "up" staircases and would empty 
three floors at a time, with students 
catapulting out of windows right and 
left. What's more, students at the top 
of the stadium would be on their ways 
to post-game naps quicker than you can 
say "9.8 m/s02." 
Students might be better off taking a physical education rotation of three­card monte. Some.times work-study only leaves you with enough money for ·either a keg or a philosophy book • -and hustling would finance a sec­ond keg. But a course in interpersonal communication might be even more 
beneficial. 
The University of Notre Dame (and 

especially its business school) prides it­
selfon its network ofalumni. But what 
good is this source ifits undergraduates 
can't even network with one another? 
Too often students meet one another 
on weekends before they go away on 
vacations and/or black out, only to 
forget each other's names when they 
return to campus and/or conscious­
ness. A course that focuses on devices to remember these potential contacts ,._w;ould be a boon for Notre Dame's ,social. relations. The course could 
teach stm.dents to focus on pairing an interesting trait with the name ofa new contact, establishing a "buddy system" of memory. "Chris" would be much more memorable when paired with his ability to perfectly match the mating call of the North American seagull, and "Mike" would be unforgettable for his skill of recreating the floor plan ( complete with traps) ofthe McCallister household from "Home Alone." 
Such a class could teach fallback plans for when you still can'tremember some­one's name. Instructors would· provide tips on how to ask another pers0n to "compare driver's license holograms" 
, (and to check the picture,. in case you start to call them by the name on their fake ID). Or, in a worst-case.scenario, when to give -qp,on the short term and go fem the future: facebooking her so you'lrknow,her.name next time. It's tricky, but'thmugkthe right combina­tion of pronouns and questions, you can find out a girl's dorm, hometown, favorite book, favorite quote and sum­mer plans. Advanced classes will learn how to make a nickname up for her on the spot, one good enough to still call her by weeks later, after you know her real name. 
The point of higher education is to prepare you with skills for life. Learning how to grapple with forgotten names, playing three-card monte and falling from great heights are life-affirming abilities. I don't see how the swimming test, much less Brother Louis' nipples, are compatible with Notre Dame.'.s code of ethics. @

It seems as though Notre Dame has un­dergone some changes as of late, but one aspect of Notre Dame that will 
never change is our mascot-the Fight­ing Irish. It is a staple of our university's identity and brings pride to all our loyal students and fans. Mascots are symbols that unite fans and help them rally their team on to victory. However, a number of mascots recently have come under fire because they are seen by some as horribly offensive. 
About 100 colleges and universities have been singled out for their use of Native American names and likenesses. Many of these mascots have been around since the various schools' infancies, like the Fight­ing Sioux of the Un1versity ofNorth Da­kota. It is not unprecedented for a school to change its name in an effort to achieve political correctness -Dartmouth changed its mascotfrom the Indians to the Big Green, and Marquette switched from the Warriors to the Golden Eagles. Still, certain schools continue to fight against the change to non-Native American mas­cots, including the University of Illinois and Florida State University. 
The Seminole of FSU and Chief Il­liniwek of Illinois are seen by some as highly racist. In 2004, a documen­tary titled "In Whose Honor?" followed Charlene Teters, founder ofthe National Coalition on Racism in Sports and the Media, and her campaign against Native American mascots, with a focus on Chief Illiniwek. 
Hostility toward the. Seminole is also prevalent throughout the film, with one interviewed student feeling as though "[FSU] disrespects the Seminoles' war chants and [...] turns them into Holly­wood-style sing-alongs." 
On the other side, many say Native American mascots are meant to bring pride to those ofNative American descent. As the board of trustees at the Univer­sity of Illinois stated, "Chief Illiniwek [...] keeps the memory of a great Native American tribe alive for thousands." Many others feel as though these Native American icons are used to honor those ofNative American heritage. One student from FSU echoes this sentiment in the film, saying, "The Seminole embodies the fighting spirit ofFSU and brings pride and honor to those of the Seminole tribe." 
I just have one question: Why is hav­ing an ethnic mascot such a taboo? Take the Fighting Irish. I'm part Irish; am I throwing a fit saying that I don't like how the Irish are portrayed as beard-toting leprechauns? No! I'm proud to say I be­long to the Fighting Irish. This mascot is a part of my school, and -in turn -a part of me. 
Who knows? This trend for a politi­cally correct world could lead to animal rights activists wanting to get rid of ani­mal mascots because they "falsifythe true essence of [insert animal mascot]." In the future, perhaps the all-too-easy-to-hate

Girls with a Goooooooooa,I,! 
Women1ssoccer hopes to defend its spot as No. 1 

• Nicole Dorner
It ·has been an amazing year for the Notre Dame women's soccer team, and it's doubtful they will be heading downhill anytime soon. Head Coach Randy Waldrum, having earned his fourth Big East Conference Coach ofthe Year award last year, looks forward to the upcoming season. "On paper, this team actually might be better than the 2004 championship team," Waldrum says. And judging by the team's stats thus far, Waldrum may be right. With two exhibition and four regular season games under their belt for the 2005-2006 season, the Irish remain undefeated and eager to play. After the first weekofseason play, Notre Dame already has had three games broadcast onnational television (with one more coming up), setting new team records along the way. Numerous players are breaking away from the com­petition with ease, and the team as a whole seems to be gaining momentum as the season progresses. Leading the Irish is senior forward Katie Thor­lakson. As 2004's National Player of the Year, Thor­lakson has had a tremendous college career, ranking in Notre Dame's top 10 for career points, points per ,game, assists and game-winning goals. Thorlakson also recently joined five otherND women that tallied at least 40goals and 40 assists in their careers. Wal­drum could notiliink any more.highly ofher. "She is a tremendous model for the· other kids to see, to play with her and see how she handles different situations," he says. "You rarely find a player with those stats on 
both sides, with goals and assists." 
Also impac;ting the Irish this year is freshman 
forward Kerri Hanks, who is out to prove her ability 
on the college scene. Aside from already earning the 
title ofSoccer America's National Player ofthe Week, 
this aggressive power-scorer was also named Big 
East Player ofthe Week and made Soccer Buzz's Elite 
Team of the Week. At the beginning of the season, 
she became only the fourth Irish woman to score four 
goals in one game (with Thorlakson also making that 
list), and she is the third to score a hat trick in two 
consecutive games. 
This year also has seen break-out performances by 
sophomore forward/midfielder Amanda Cinalli and 
junior midfielder Jill Krivacek, who had two game­
winning goals last season. 
The team, which went 2-0-0 during the preseason 
and is currently 4-Q-0 for-the regular season, has out­
scored the opposition 37-3 in the first six games of 
this year. The Irish also enter the 2005 season with a

bit of history behind them; over the past seven seasons, the team has amassed an .846 winning percentage and a 58-0-1 unbeaten streak at home which dates back to 1995. 
In the season opener against the New Hampshire University Wildcats, the Irish showed their dominance with an 11-1 win. The Irish followed that with a 6-0 win over the Catamounts of Vermont University. This past week, Notre Dame returned home for the first time this sea­son and took a 4-1 win over No. 11 Flor­ida University in the Inn at Saint Mary's Notre Dame Classic. They continued at home with a 6-0 win over the Terrapins of

the University ofMaryland to finish up the Notre Dame Classic. The Irish next travel to the SCU Adidas Classic in Santa Clara, Calif., where they will go up against Santa Clara and Gonzaga. 
Coming into the 2005 season as the defending NCAA champions and the No. I-ranked team in the NSCAACoaches' Poll, the women's soccer team has a lot to live up to. But with the strength, versatility and spirit that the team possesses, they are in serious contention for another title. @

Who should be the next Supreme Court Justice? 
bortion_ -;-th~ issue that, overruns the neurons of every conservative s mmd . . . Don t be fooled -two vacancies on our highest court leave in question a far greater issue. At stake is our collective national understanding of government's role. In recent years, under the tutelage ofChiefJustice William H. Rehnquist, the court has sent minor, yet potent tremors through the legal community on an issue dubbed "New Federalism." Want an issue thatwill remake society? Forget abortion -con­sider, instead, the thought oflimited federal power. 
Abbreviated history lesson: From the days ofFDR until 1995 the limits of Congressional power were the focus oflittle scru~ 

since my mival at Washington, D.C., this fall, no issue has been as talked about as much as the current nomination process for the Supreme Court and th~ consequent strategies ofliberal and conservative action groups. Progressive thinkers fit within the Courtin the sense that they provide a balance on the bench that has ushered in landmark rulings that have extended cher­ished civil rights over the last three quarters ofa century. Yet, rather than having the opportunity to discuss at length· an "ideal" Supreme Court Justice, progressive policy makers have to settle for discussing the prevailing conservative notions of the "ideal." The question that is absent in the discussion in Washington, however, is what makes an ideal liberal Justice? First, a: model Supreme CourtJustice within the progressive ideology would be an individual that holds the intellectual and academic qualifications for the bench. The ability to deliberate and interpret law comes from having a comprehensive knowledge of jurisprudence and the intellectual tenacity to arrive at the toughest of decisions. 
A nominee to the Supreme Court must also be a strict interpreter of the spirit and letter of the Constitution. The debate ofconstitutional­ity in our time and.in the future will center on the rights of the individual and the license that the state has to intrude on individual liberties. A Supreme CourtJustice who is to serve the American people must uphold civil. liberties within the framework of the ~onstitution and Bill of Rights, specifically re-· · . gardmg recent Court cases involving national security 
and affirmative action. 
While much of the debate has centered on whether or not a Justice should legislate from the bench, an ideal Justice in the Supreme Court recognizes the absolute necessity to interpret the Constitution contextually, so as to adjust for dramatic changes in the normative nature ofsociety. Above all, this is how a liberal]ustice would govern -not demeaning or sacrificing the hallmarks of the Constitution, but also not being wedded to antiquated institutions and rules. '@. 


tiny. We witnessed a vast growth in the scope and breadth of federal oversight, influence and spending. In 1995, how­ever, "New Federalism" resurrected the Constitutional precept of enumerated powers. The Supreme Court reasoned that the Gun Free School Zone Act had nothing to do with regulating "interstate com­merce" and struck down parts of the law. Dormant for 60 years; the revived idea of separate spheres of control for state 
· and federal governments is the Rehnquist . . . Court's true legacy. · · . ··.. ·..· . Let us not be hasty; despite this triumph,. .·. it was limited in scope. Former Supreme Court · • • Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in her now-worshiped role ofswing voter, often stood in the way ofa return to guarantees of our beloved 10th Amendment. 

Now, what are a republican president and Senate to do? Nominee John G. Roberts, for one, earns a checkmark. He wrot~ in a recent dissent about the federal use cifthe Endangered. · · Species Act to protect a toad, "The arroyo toad is not a channel• ofcommerce, nbr is it in one. !tis not an instrumentality ofcom­merce, nor is it a person or thing in interstate commerce." 
. One seatleft-I'm calling it now: Edith Hollan]ones of the 
5th Circuit Court. She, too, has upheld the principles of"New. .Federalism." Plus, her nomination will ensure women still have a significant influence on the court. 
· President George W. Bush has long ~spoused the pri~ciple that the federal gov:errtment has a propei-place. He, no doubt, will ap~oint a Justice who doesn't mind slapping Congress' in­trusive hand when it tries to control issues that are "reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." Guess what -that might in_clude a.bortion too! 0
