STAFF EDITORIAL 



A President Under Fire 
Minority opposition to Fr. Jenkins' "Cl9sing Statement"troubling 
All is not well at Notre Dame. In the three weeks since the an­
nouncement ofwhat was meant to be the closing statement that would temper the intense 10-week campus debate on academic freedom and Catholic character, a vocal minority of strong opposition has risen up to challenge both the intellectual soundness of the statement and 
the leadership ability of the man who composed it. Members of this minority have made their presence known primarily in the Viewpoint pages of the Observer -including one editorial by philosophy profes­sor David Solomon in the April 18 edition of the Wall Street Journal -in order to let Fr. Jenkins know that his statement was not received with universal praise. 
As irony would have it, it now seems that Fr. Jenkins' April 5th state­ment closed only the mouths of those who feared he would take a step toward abridging free expression by prohibiting alternative-lifestyle events like the Vagina Monologues and the gay and lesbian film event. Instead, Fr.Jenkins' decision to refrain from banning these productions has given fuel to the fire ofthose who see his statement as representative of Notre Dame's alleged downward spiral toward secularization and an 
ethos of moral relativism. It is difficult to find an opinion piece arguing against Fr.Jenkins' position that does not alert the reader ofthe perceived moral decay present in popular culture and why we should fear it. 
It is difficult to disagree entirely with the minority's negative estimation ofsecular culture. Without a doubt, the world is filled with negative influ­ences that constantly threaten one's ability to faithfully abide by religious principles. Yet the very suggestion that the outside world's less than Catholic nature somehow justifies the banishment of certain controversial issues from examination by the Catholic intellectual tradition is woefully myopic and could easily put Notre Dame on the road to blissful naivete. Whatever your opinion of the wisdom in using vaginas to raise awareness about violence against women or the value of discussing movies with homosexual kissing, it is impossible to deny that such circumstances exist in the world and will continue to affect the 
ways we think about it. To say that the best Catholic minds in the co~ntry are ill-equipped _to engage truth wherever it may be found trivializes the strength of a tradition whose very name -Catholic -connotes universality. It would behoove those who challenge Fr. Jenkins' position on theological grounds to remember that the mission ofNotre Dame derives from the spirit of Jesus Christ-a man who never shied away from society's rejects or the things that He could learn from them. Notre Dame's community possesses the tools to engage, analyze and by all means ruthlessly criticize those morally suspect fruits of secularization that make their presence known on campus in an ap­propriate manner. Notre Dame's mission statement encourages a community "where various lines of Catholic thought may intersect with all forms of knowledge." Hopefully Fr.Jenkins' statement will solidify the Catholic mis­sion in the coming years and help to emphasize that Notre Dame will never abandon her intellectual tradition. God forbid that messy confrontations with controversial yet relevant social topics become taboo subjects that are thought of as detrimental to the strength of Notre Dame's intellectual mission and 
its relevancy for Catholics, Americans and the world at large.

Something in the W9ter South Bend water may be causing your acne 
• Amy Meyers 
here's something lurking in the water in South Bend, and it 
'[
could be a dangerous enemy to your skin and hair. 
The water that serves Sc;mth Bend and Notre Dame comes 
from 32 deep wells in the surrounding area. As a result of this ground­
water supply, the water is very clean and safe but also very hard. Hard 
water contains a high mineral content that often consists of high levels 
of metal ions like magnesium, calcium and, in the case of South Bend, 
iron. Faculty and students who are originally from areas with soft water 
or consistently drink bottled or filtered water have probably noticed the 
ways these minerals can affect the water's taste. 
These metal ions can be an even bigger nuisance when mixed with 
soaps. Magnesium and calcium in hard water make forming a lather while 
bathing more difficult. To compensate, people often use more soap on 
their skin. But mixing hard water with laurel sulfate-a mainingredient 
in most soaps and shampoos -also has consequences. According to Dr. 
Marya Liberman, a chemistry professor here at Notre Dame, "Laurel 
sulfate is a detergent -a long hydrocarbon chain attached to a sufate 
head group. It forms insoluble precipitates with divalent cations like 
calcium, magnesium or iron, and that can make your hair look and feel 
dull and might clog pores in the skin." 
Thewaxy, gland-blocking substance formed from the insoluble precipi­
tates, more commonly known as "soap scum" or "soap curd," may result 
in acne, blackheads, stretched-out pores, redness, irritation and dryness. 
The "squeaky" feel or sound many people associate with washing with 
hard water is actually their skin sticking because of this residue. Those 
wl;io are used to bathi~g in hard water may think that soft water leaves 
their skin with an oily feel. This feeling is simply the body's natural oils ·that had been hidden by soap and mineral scum. 
Fortunately, according to a Proctor and Gamble study, "Under a more 
exaggerated wash condition the relationship between water hardness and 
irritation breaks.down." So itseems as ifthoroughly rinsing the insoluble 
salts offyour skin and only using a necessary amount of soap can keep 
your skin from becoming too dryorirritated. Using a clarifying shampoo 
once or twice a week can also help remove the residue from your hair.0

Internet gambling only agitated James' habits, he claims, as wagering in online casinos and sports betting sites followed his real-life gambling. James soon found gambling negatively 
affecting his life. "Playing for a lot of money with friends causes problems," he says. "You don't want to take all your friends' money but you can't just letit go

"Ben," another student whose name_ has been cl:iangedto'protect anonymity, told of similar woes: Instead of playing with friends/most ofhis gambling hap­pened onlirte. like James, Ben started gambling with friends for petty amounts, but started gambling for more when he discovered online ga,mbling. "I watched a friend make $300 1·n 30 minutes, and I knew I wanted apar{of that."

"My dad told me not to 
gamble and didn't have a clue as to what was happening," Ben says. Despite the pain caused by gambling, Ben, like many others, finds it difficult to walk away. "I've tried to quit, two, three times, but each time I've come back," he says. "I've been free ofit for a couple months now, but I'll probably get help ifit starts again." 
James and Ben both acknowledge an extra danger in illegal online gambling. "I've quit playing online poker," says James. "I can't trust it." Ben, who did most of his gambling online, explains, "You don't physically see the money, just a number on the screen. It's not like when you play in person and have to run to the ATM, thinking it's maybe time to quit." 
With the troubling experiences of students like James and Ben in mind, the·· university recently established a task force on gambling. Started this previous fall,

of gambling, particularly online betting,

says Associate Vice President Bill Kirk, 
one of the administrators that leads the 
group. Kirk explains that the task force 
is currently in the process of collecting 
information on student gambling. 
Kirksays that the task force has listened to accounts of students struggling with gambling addictions. "We've talked to students who've had to withdraw from · the university," says Kirk: ·In· addition, the task force created an email address . (gambling@nd.edu) to accept stories and

sity policies. "Right now, duLac states that

Why do Notre Dame's library resources lag behind those of other prominent research universities? 
G Pet:er Hadley
W:en the word broke to the Notre Dame community 
hat the university had been given a $14.5 million payout for playing in the 2006 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, questions immediately rose as to how the money would be spent. The university quickly responded that the university was among those projects slated to receive a portion of the earnings. The money comes at a good time, as the library and some of its collections are in desperate need of updating. With the costs ofjournal prices outpacing allocated funds, some are be­ginning to question whether Notre Dame is committed to improving its library, which is lagging behind those of compa­rable institutions. Certain subject areas claim that they are so underfunded that they quickly run out of money before they have had the opportunity to provide basic research materials to faculty and students. With a large sum of money awaiting distribution to the library, larger issues are facing the university library system that may affect Notre Dame's status as a budding research institution. 
Unlike other elite institutions, Notre Dame is a newcomer to the research scene. The university library began to place greater emphasis on research, in ad­dition to undergraduate teaching, only in the past four decades. The universitywas immediately at a disadvantage compared to libraries that have been collecting research materials for a longer period 
~ 
z of time. According to Kathryn Ryan­~ Zeugner, the subject librarian in anthro­~ pology, "The problem with this library ~ is its history. We are competing with ~choolswho had been seriously collecting 

-~·········B 
books and other research materials for about 100 years before we even started. Columbia University's library in the mid­1960s had 11 million volumes. Today, we have barely three million. We cannot expect to bridge that gap." Notre Dame is thus forced to play "catch up" with other leading educational institutions. 
Jennifer Younger, director of the university libraries, acknowledges this problem. "Notre Dame faces a challenge in developing collections and access to information because we have started from a smaller base and didn't make the deci­sion to become a teaching and research university until comparatively late. We are fast developing our position as an elite research university although we do face challenges in growing library collections and developing access to information resources. We must buy retroactively as well as currently to develop sufficient col­lections and access," Younger says. 
Yet some think that the profound effect technology has had on libraries will eventually allow schools like Notre Dame to reach the depth ofresources that the older research schools already have. Associate Director for Resources and Collection Services Gay Dannelly says, "some ofthese other schools like Harvard and Yale have spent years collecting their huge paper collections; but now technol­ogy has made it such that a lot of these same sources are available electronically to anybody willing to pay. Technology is going to allow Notre Dame to catch up to schools like Harvard and Yale." 
Regardless ofwhat format the resources take, money is still needed to acquire them. The library collections receive this money from two different sources -uni­versity allocations and endowments. University allocations are funds set aside for each department every year. With this money from the university, the subject librarians, in close collaboration with the faculty and graduate schools, purchase materials for research. The different amounts of money given to each depart­ment are based on levels set 30 years ago. Endowments come from outside donors and are usually reserved for a particular field of study determined by the donor. This means that those departments that do not have an endowment supporting them must rely solely on allocations from the university. Some, however, question whether these allocations provide enough money to those departments not fortu­nate enough to have endowments, such as many of the social sciences. 
Recently, the main cause of financial 
_struggles in libraries around the coun­try has been the rising cost of journal subscriptions, primarily in electronic form. The price for journals in nearly all 
· disciplines has risen dramatically-about eight percent ayear -and has made its presence felt especially here at Notre Dame. Because research, depending on the subject, is primarily focused in jour­nals, departments are encouraged to buy subscriptions, even though the prices are sometimes inordinately expensive. One science journal that the Notre Dame library subscribes to -Brain Research -costs $24,000 per year. 
Wii:h no endowments to fund their purchasing, many of the social science departments a_re suffering as a result. Michael Lutes, the subject librarian for 
27 APRIL 2006 
• I ; 
political science and sociology, discussed the ramifications of the low funds. "We are really down to the bone," Lutes says. "We are at the point where you can't cut anymore." 
Library departments run out ofthe allocation money within the first couple weeks of the academic year and are left with a wish-list of materials they need but are unable to buy. "Some departments have trouble trying to spend all their money," Ryan-Zeugner says. "The gap is growing between those departments that have and those that have not." 
Due to inflating journal prices, librar­ians are sometimes forced to cancel their subscriptions to valuable electronic and paper journals. "We have faculty requests for materials that we just don't have the money to pay for," Lutes says. "We are simply unable to help them out. At this point, it would be like robbing Peter to pay Paul." While undergraduates may not be as noticeably affected by this, it is the faculty and the graduate students who are at a significant disadvantage if basic research materials are not available. Ryan­Zeugner agrees, saying, "I think that the library owes it to the departments, the faculty and the students to support them with basic research materials." 
But as journal prices continue to rise, the university has been slow to increase the amount of money allocated to the library. According to Ryan-Zeugner, a few years ago, the anthropology depart­ment wrote a report on the state of the department with information about its growth and need for increased support. They sent the report to the Department of Development, hoping to entice donors for endowments, but with no success. "Until recently, the university kept us on a flat budget for four years which meant that we were cannibalizing ourselves," Ryan-Zeugner says. 
In spite of this setback, library and university officials say that measures are being undertaken to increase library funding. Between 1996 and 2001, the university doubled the Library Acquisi­tion Fund. Since then, the provost's office provided one-time supplemental funds for two years to maintain access to journals and increase book purchases. While this relief is helpful, it does not truly address the annual problem of journal price in­flation. But it is also true that in the last three years allocations have been steadily increasing, especially to the social sci­
27 APRIL 2006 
ences, to help alleviate the problem ofin­flation. Addressing the funding, Younger also referenced a university campaign that started in 2004 and is scheduled to end in 2011. Its goal is to raise more money for the library in general and to increase the number of programs sustained by endowments. 
With these financial questions looming overhead; many people saw the Fiesta Bowl's $14.5 million payout as an impor­tant source of relief. The actual dollar amount going to the library is yet to be determined, but whatever money that does come is going straight to library collections, not to renovations on the library's physical structure. The funds, however, will only act as temporary relief. "The money will be very helpful, especially for one-time purchases that fill up gaps in certain collections/' Younger says. For annual additions, this money does little .to nothing to aid the library's expansion efforts. 
This lack of university concern and response is something that still causes distress for many. "I think the university tends to view the library as a landmark sight or building and not as a landmark source of research," Lutes says. "There needs to be a better understanding ofwhat it means to be a real research library and what is needed to sustain one." 0

once they've received their commissions and go to their active duty posts, they will probably shortly thereafter deploy." He also speculated that this mindset may have impacted the bigger picture for ROTC programs. "I'm sure the war is on people's minds today, and I'm sure that some ROTC participa­tion has decreased because We'll fund some, but will not fund all."' Along with this reformed scholarship policy, Jordan notes, "Notre Dame has developed a significant financial aid package and the endowment has matured," factors that allow students to get substantial aid from the university without having to depend on an ROTC scholarship. 
While the war has apparently done little to affect overall ROTC enroll­ment numbers at Notre Dame, there is still a question regarding the war's effect on the retention rate of officers after their required time of service has elapsed. Most ROTC officers are obli­gated to serve four years of active duty after graduation, at which point they can decide whether or not they wish to remain on active duty. Some officers, like Christopher Welch, choose to leave the service, while others remain in the military. On April 10, 2006, an article in the New York Times suggested that the war in Iraq has affected these deci­sions for Army officers, as more than a third of the United States Military Academy at West Point's class of 2000 left active duty at the earliest possible moment, the lowest retention rate in the past 16 years. The article also reported that there is a similarly decreasing rate among former ROTC students. Notre Dame does not have access to the reten­tion rates ofits ROTC alumni because the records are kept by the individual military branches. But the Times article suggests that wartime experience has moved young military officers across the board to seriously consider their commitment. 
'Theresa Welch, the youngest 
of the Welch siblings, has 
yet to see active duty, but she has already undergone a serious , examination of her own commitment to the United States military. "I was hesitant for a while to be in ROTC, because I tossed around for a while the devout Catholic, recognizes and approves of the peacekeeping and humanitarian aid efforts that the military undertakes, but she still remained unsure of her own participation in ROTC because of a deep-seated opposition to "unnecessary violence," which she feared she might have to participate in ifshe continued on the path to becoming a naval officer. 
This uneasiness led Theresa to pt1rsue entrance into the Navy Nurse Corps after graduation. "I feel like by going into the Nurse Corps, I'm finally doing something within ROTC that I believe in, whereas before, I was really unsure about what I was doing and why I was doing it. I really didn't want to be doing it just for the money, but I wasn't really sure why I was doing it otherwise," she says. "I feel like I would be making sacrifices ifl got deployed to Iraq, but for such a good cause -to help people who are wounded, whether they are our wounded soldiers or enemy combatants or civilians. So that's sort ofhow I'm coming to peace with my moral dilemma." 
Theresa admits that she is unlike many other ROTC students, as she has struggled with her participation in the program more than most. She is thank­ful for her doubts, h9wever. "There is a certain amount of struggle that goes on with how you feel about what's going on politically, how you feel about what will go on ethically and what your role in that should be," Theresa says. "I think it's good that people get-upset and don't know what they're supposed to do. It's like struggling with your faith. It's good to have a faith crisis, because you have to work your way through it and then you understand better where you're going." 
-The faith-based nature of Theresa's contemplations is reminiscent of a ques­tion that has floated around this Catholic campus for years, one that has become all the more relevant against the backdrop of the war in Iraq: Should ROTC even be at Notre Dame?

the war in Iraq in early 2003, Catholic Church leaders in the . t1can and the U.S. spoke out loudly and clearly against the imminent invasion.

"unjust" without authorization from the United Nations. In February, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) issued a statement opposing the 
possible war, saying that it did not qualify as a "just war" under the Catholic criteria. 
Just War theory is an estab­lished Christian tradition that dates back in its earliest form to St. Augustine, who died in the early 5th century. It includes a set of criteria that are meant to discern whether the use ofmili­tary force is justified in a given situation. The USCCB stated that the proposed war in Iraq violated several key require­
ments ofJust War theory. First among those violated was "just cause," which prohibits the use ofpreventative force to overthrow a "threatening regime" that is not imminently poised to launch an offensive. The USCCB also said that the United States did not have "legitimate authority" to begin the war on its own, as force was not deemed appropriate by the United Nations. Another key criterion that the USCCB was concerned about in the possible war was the probability of success. The bishops wrote that the invasion "might provoke the very kind of attacks that it is intended to prevent, could impose terrible new burdens on an already long-suffering civilian population and could lead to wider conflict and instability in the region." Despite the Church's vocal

opposition to the war, it began on March 19, 2003, forcing Catholics, both soldiers and civilians, to grapple with conflicting messages from Church and state. With a war deemed unjust by many Church officials, could Notre Dame ROTC students remain in the program in good conscience? 
Nick Matich, a senior Navy ROTC student set to board the U.S.S. Mahan in Norfolk, Va., after graduation, says that for him, the Church did not have the information it needed to make a practical assessment ofthe threat that Iraq posed. While the Church lays out the "theologi­

cal and theoretical" requirements for a just war, he says, intelligence thatonlythe government had was necessary for evalu­ating the potential war practically. "The 
requirements to make the war just could only be evaluated in light of intelligence that the Church didn't have access to," Matich says. "The only people who really did have ac­cess to all of that information to make those evaluations of how grave a threat Iraq was were President Bush and his advisors. Maybe you like Bush and maybe you don't, but you have to admit he had more information on this than you 
did, and you're left with no choice but to trust his evaluations ofit." 
A statement by Catholic Archbishop for Military Services Edwin O'Brien echoes Matich's sentiments. "Given the complex­ity of.factors involved, many of which understandably remain confidential, it is altogether appropriate for members of our armed forces to presume the integrity of our leadership and its judgments and therefore to carry out their military du­ties in good conscience," O'Brien wrote, in reference to Catholics' participation in the war in Iraq. 
Nevertheless, some members of the andl'mjustveryuncomfortablewiththis Catholic university training people to serve in the military when the decisions of the military could be against what we, stand for." 


Jordan emphasizes that ROTC at Notre Dame is not specifically related to any war, but is aboutleadership training and service first and foremost. "Training someone to lead soldiers ethically and morally and with character is very dif-. ferent than ordering them to serve in the Iraq war, which is something that ROTC to earn a commission, but there's nothing implicit in there about ordering them to 
· service. Most will have to face that situ­ation; I've had to face it five times in my life as aCatholic. And every time I have to go through the same decision-making process. 'Can I reconcile this with my faith?' It is an intensely personal decision for anyone."

Notre Dame community remain con-:­cerned that ROTC is inconsistent with Notre Dame's Catholic character, espe­cially in light of the Iraq war. Michael Rossmann, a junior theology and eco­nomics major, is the rising president of Notre Dame Peace Fellowship (NDPF), a campus group that meets weekly to pray for peace and to discuss world issues dealing with war and peace. "I feel very uncomfortable when we as a Catholic institution are in some ways· training students to go to war and even participate in what, in my mind, ~9_vld be blatantly unjust wars, wars that h'i{ie·oeeri.criticized­by many church· officials," Rossmann

government, Notre Dame is-not allowed to form its ROTCstudents in the Catho­licJust War tradition as well as it c;uld. Pfeil and Jordan team-taught a course last semester titled "War, Law and Eth­ics," a course designed to expose students to the theological and practical natures ofJust War theory. Pfeil said that the course used to be required for all ROTG students, but the government deemed· the policy inappropriate because ofthe class' specifically Catholic nature. While.. Jordan continues to instruct all ROTC members on the history and underlying philosophy ofJust War theory in other forums, Pfeil believes that something important is lost without the theologi­cal element of the tradition that "War, Law and Ethics" includes. "Uordan] can teach Just War, but what's missing is the theological dimension ofJust War. Unless · you can address the theological aspect ofJust War theory, I think it's a pretty diminished version of Just War theory. For Catholics, it's imperative that they're exposed at least once in their lives to the theologicalgrounding ofthat theory be­cause it.has everything to do with being. in right relationship. with God. It's not justa question oflegal theory or military·. regulation; but it's also a question ofbeing . in a relationship with God." 
Pfeil is also concerned with the priori­ties that an ROTCprogram at a Catholic .. university suggest. "We have people liv­ing on the streets/' she says. "Whatwould happen ifwe were to divert the billions of dollars we spend on the military into the 
· infrastructur~ ofour own country? In my mind, a Catholic university ought to be serving those ends, precisely because of its Catholic identity. We need to be more prophetic in raising that as a moral issue facing us in our times." 
Jordan repeatedly stressed the service and leadership aspects of ROTC, ideals 
· that fall squarely in line with. Catholic teaching. "We'vereally gone out of our waytoeducate.thecommunityaboutwhat 
·. we do. It's about developing leadership, character and intellect,'~ he says. "It's not about teaching people to kill." 
These issues are only a few among many surrounding ROTC at Notre Dame, but a student-led effort has sought to get both sides talking together, hop­ing to create a sustainable dialogue that 
. examines ROTC at the university fully and.clearly. 
0 n a Tuesday night last Novem­ber, about 30 students met in the coffeehouse of the Center for Social Concerns. The group would not have seemed unusual to anyone passing by, but the gathering had.brought togeth­er students who would have rarely found themselves in the same place at once~ About 20 ROTC cadets and midshipmen sat down with about 10 NDPF members for one ofa series offive dialogue sessions, organized by sophomore Clare Feeney, an NDPF member who acts as a liaison between the groups. During the meeting, both groups of students were instructed to write down 
'.. --'.:: -.·-; -· ... •,,:. 
stereotypes they held about the students of the other organization. Among the list created by ROTC students were the words• "vicious," "ungrateful," "hippies" and "Communists." NDPF students seemed to think that ROTC cadets and midshipmen were "Republicans," "hawk­ish" and "pointless." After listing the ste­reotypes, the two sides began to discuss their world views, attempting to bridge the gap that clearly existed. "It seems to me that both sides want to accomplish the same things, but with different ap­proaches," Feeney says. "There is a lot ofcommon ground that neither side saw. People were surprised to see that they weren't on totally different sides, and that they could work together." 
While some participants of the dia­logue sessions said that too often the talks devolved into the spouting of opinions without intellectual rigor nor a real care to understand the other side, ROTC and NDPF students and Jordan agreed that the concept is a good one that should be continued and expanded. "The dialogues are wonderful," Jordan says. "We're all devoted to peace. We're all devoted to taking care of our soldiers, to enhancing our Catholic faith. Once we get over the rhetoric and get to the substance of the issues, we end up. finding that we have a lot of common ground." 0

he scene on Friday,
'[

April 7 atNotreDame's 
Stepan Center was quite different from what students typically expect from the usually quiet building. As country music star Pat Green and his band took the stage, the crowd erupted into applause, waving Texas flags and sporting cowboy hats. Bright lights and Green's energetic country rock filled the building while fog floated in the air and an intricately built stage sat before the capcity crowd. But 14 hours before, Ste­pan was bare. So just how does a concert of this magnitude come to be? 
When the Notre Dame community learned that the Student Union Board (SUB) was bringing Green to campus, it seemed like every public or closeted country fan instantly came out of the woodwork. In spite of the tremendous hype, there was some hesitation about Stepan as a location for the concert. Ste­pan, often viewed as a campus eyesore and a questionable venue, can deter some students from taking a concert seriously. Luckily, the Pat Green concert dispelled these negative views and Stepan felt like a premier sold-out arena. 
The Pat Green show was SUB's second concert of the school year; the first was the successful Better Than Ezra show during the fall semester. Jenny Rager, the SUB advisor, said that the Better Than Ezra show went smoothly and prepared SUB to host another well-attended show. The performances, however, would not have been as successful without the help of the university and performer's crews, as well as the student volunteers that brought a great night of music to fruition. 
For this show, SUB was able to utilize the Texas Club, which provided both financial assistance and volunteers to SUB's efforts. "The Texas Club's ability to send us more volunteers [made] set­up and the show run more efficiently," Rager says. 
Senior Chrissy Williford, the presi­dent of the Texas Club, discussed the club's eagerness to get involved with a Texas-rooted performer. "We jumped at the opportunity when we were contacted by SUB," Williford says. "We've been trying to get PatGreen to come for years but never had the money." Williford add­ed that, along with the money the club was able to contribute, they advertised by word of mouth, sending out emails to the club's 400 members and plugging the show at other events. 
In addition to the Texas Club's efforts, Jimmy Flaherty, former board manager of SUB, and Chris Lund, the SUB con­cert programmer, contributed 65 vol­unteers of their own to put together an impressive group of dedicated students. "My concert committee of SUB mem­hers, as well as the other SlJ;~ volunteers, has been great in assisting ~,'\J?11R1 says.

One major complaint ofthe st~dent bo~ritr Notre Dame's lack ofan established conc~r.H fund to attract big name bands. Luckily,.; SUB's Concert Committee does receive! a budget from the·Financial Management· Board "as a. result of the annual allocation process of student activities fees and The Shirt proceeds," says Flaherty. This allows SUB to make sizeable offers. Moreover, it is always easy to find a venue since Stepan belongs to and is controlled by the Student Activities Office. 
The actual day of the concert, however, is SUB's true test. The day began at 7 a.m., with volunteers arriving throughout the day and staying until the early morning hours to break-down the set. At 8:45 a.m., the university-hired production. crew, Group Built Concert Production, arrived in the first of two tractor-trailers full of equip­ment. One trailer is reserved specifically for

his ·hit "Wave on Wave," a fantastic cover of Bruce Springsteen's "Glory Days" and many more songs in a set that kept every­one entertained from the first chord to the final bow. Although Scholastic was unable to get an interview with Green, Brendan Anthony, Green's fiddler, commented about the show after the concert. "This [was] the third show of our tour and it was a great night," Anthony says. "We play small and large shows, from rodeos to arenas, but we always love coming to colleges." 
The end-product of the Pat Green con­cert was quite impressive. "Attendance at the event was 1,100 people, which was a sell­out," Flaherty says. "We were very happy with the attendance." Although the show was a huge success, Schmall reinforced the· hope that students realize just how much time it takes to put on a show in Stepan. "People don't realize how much work goes into this," she says. "People interested in concerts or those who want other bands to perform here should really try to get involved." 
After witnessing the dedication that goes into a SUB concert, Schmall's comments should be heeded by the student body-ap­preciate the hard work ofStudent Activities and student organizations to bring projects like this to life. SUB's unique ability to make large projects like this happen with student leadership and hard work is perhaps one ofthe best parts of Notre Dame's social scene. 0

w.en the phrase "men's la­
~osse" appears in th~ me­
ia, what IS the first Image that pops into your head? A game going back centuries to the time of the Native Americans? A beloved east-coast pastime making inroads across the nation? Or perhaps the utter desperation of ESPN2 in showing Major League Lacrosse in the afternoon? 
Odds are, at this point, most people would inextricably link men's lacrosse to its worst images -partying frat boys with money to burn and testosterone to spare. As much as many who play the sport would like to deny it, the recent Duke scandal did not create this stereotype, but merely brought it to the forefront of national attention. It's unfortunate for the majority of players -both at Duke and nationwide -who did nothing wrong, who now think that playing lacrosse is something that they should hide, lest it reflect poorly on their character. 
More than just hurting lacrosse players, the scandal raises significant questions about the tension ofwealthy private insti­tutions existing in blue-collar communi­ties, the "town versus gown" issues. How can students at an institution like Duke, or Notre Dame for that matter, react and recover from this fallout? 
For a number of former high school athletes currently attending Notre Dame, the answer lies in reaching out to mentor the future generation of lacrosse players in the South Bend community. Earlier this spring, a call went out in the Observer for Notre Dame students inter­ested in volunteering their time to aid an understaffed middle school-aged lacrosse program, the Saint Joe Junior Lacrosse Club, currently in its second year. Eight young men responded and took on the responsibilities of not only teaching the game, but becoming mentors as well. 
"Since they are just starting, we are just working on the fundamentals, and we try to let them have as much fun as possible. They aren't good enough to work on strategy, so we get to play a lot of games, which is furi," says Peter McCor­mick, one of the volunteer head coaches. Fun equates to light-hearted drills and games, teaching more about the love of the game 'than the thrill of victory. For a sport commonly thought to be one of the most injury-plagued and dangerous, aside from football and hockey, this is a welcome change in perspective. 

Even Notre Dame varsity men's la­crosse players get in on the action, serving as referees for many ofthe middle school matches. Professor Karen Heisler, whose son Tim plays goalie for one ofthe teams, states that "the kids love [the coaches]." It doesn't matter to the kids that their coaches came from "gown" into the "town," all that matters is the spirit and fun ofwhat they do. 
While it may be difficult to influence the sentiments of those adults who have their minds made up about the state of lacrosse, or the state of community rela­tions, it is possible to set a great example for those who have not yet made up their minds -those children who still need to be led. Recovery from the fallout of this scandal will be a long road, but judging by the work in our own community, it is not an impossible one. 0

The Irish are on a roll, and this series is one through which they should have few problem navigating, if any. The Cardinals are 17-22 as of April 23, and are only 8-6 in the Big East. Compare this to the Irish record of31-8, including a 21-game win streak, and a 13-1 Big East mark, and Louisville's odds look slim. The Cards, however, could look to exploit an Irish team weary with its lengthy home stand, South Florida and St. John's. Fighting to keep their Big East win percentage 
above .500 could provide the Cards significant motivation but not enough to overcome the Irish in their last home series of the regular sea­son. The team will send· its seniors out on a high· note, sweeping the three-game 
senes. 
Christopher Meskill, Editor-in-Chief

Sophomore Jake Teitgen, one of the top eightrnwers on the team, knows that his teammates have improved by leaps and bounds, but many of his frie11ds and classmates remain in the dark. 
"There's a lack ofknowledge on campus about what crew is," Teitgen says. When students ask him ifhe is on the row­ing team, he quickly responds, "That's all ldo!I'm rowing every day." The majority ofindividuals also believe that the team is a varsity sport untilTeitgen corrects them. "We just bite the bullet and do it ourselves [as a club sport].

0 ne ofthe worst par.ts aboutgoi.ng · to a school as homogenous as Notre Dame is how quickly jokes get old. I had only been a Notre Dame student for about three hours before I officially became sick ofhearing people say, "It's so cold once it hits your lips! It's so good!" (if no one knows what I'm talking about, then this is officially the worst humor column ever), and I don't know a woman at this school who . hasn't had the delight of being referred to in a terrible Ron Burgundy voice as a "pirate hooker." So, ifyou're ·anything like me, you've gotten really, really, really sick of those Chuck Norris vignettes thatare everywhere. While lots ofthe statements were pretty funny and clever at first, the bit has been done fl" to death, and it's really just a knock-off of those genius \ "Bill Brasky" segments from 
"Saturday Night Live." This Chuck Norris-mania has lessened the funniness of ridiculous exaggeration, which saddens me. 
As a means of correcting this, I've decided to replace these ChuckNorris-isms with something much better. Below, I will tell you about Ken Izzo. Ken Izzo is a tall (6'9") friend ofmine from home who is a walk-on for the Georgetown University basketball team and served as my heterosexual lifemate for large parts of last summer. I feel confident these Izzo-isms will adequately replace the overused canon of Chuck Norris statements because, unlike the silly and frivolous tales of Chuck Norris, everything I'm about to tell you about Ken Izzo is totally, 100 percent true. Without further ado, the Book oflzzo· ...

.Ken

~OIX'f/COUNTERPOINT 
Do you feel that the ROTC program is justified at Notre Dame? 
0 ur university has one of the largest for­scholarship ROTC programs in the United States. As a Catholic student interested in 
the moral issues ofwar and peace, I must voice my opposition to the ROTC program. Its presence conflicts with the mission of our school as both a Catholic institution and a university. 
The structure of the ROTC program at Notre Dame represents a daunting moral conundrum, especially for Catholics. The ROTC program is currentlytrainingsoldiers to potentially participate in a war that has been consistently denounced as unjust or, as Pope John Paul II called it, "a defeat 
· for humanity."· Even on our campus, the ROTC program is a branch of the United States Depart­ment of Defense. Thus, our university gives the military access to our faculty, our students and _. · · ourfacilities. Yes, we getaccess to their money, _.­but at what cost? · 
As a university, Notre Dame is com-_ mitted to higher education and intel-· lectual excellence. Yet the presence . ofROTC sends thewrong message, that learning the skills of soldier­ing is comparable to education in the liberal arts or architecture. They are not comparable. __ 
I am not trying to say that soldiers are bad people. Indeed my criticism ofROTC is aimed at the program, not the participants. But should stu­dents be offered the choice of military training on our campus? I thinkthe contradictionwith Catholic teaching is too strong. 
When Fr. Malloy became president of the uni­versity, he appointed a group to review the ROTC program on campus. The group finally suggested _ that courses on the mora:l aspects ofwar and peace be part of the ROTC program of study. No such changes have been made. · 
With the curriculum of ROTC programs stan­dardized across the country, can the teachings ofthe Catholic Church ever trulybeincorporated into the list of courses required of all ROTC members? If the answer is "no," as I thinkit is, we must consider the appropriateness of an ROTC program on our campus. Indeed, I believe it is time that we make .Our Lady's university, at long last, a demilitarized· -~~one. _ 0
