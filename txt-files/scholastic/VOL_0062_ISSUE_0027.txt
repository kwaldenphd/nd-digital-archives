Portrait of Miss V. R. D. bll McElroy.
Pantomime
Before the whiteness of this mask Goes on the agonizing task
Of Harlequin’s old pantomime Unfaded by the hands of time;
The old, old gestures of the quaint
Avowal and the sad complaint
Repeat themselves forever there— Intalgio cut upon the air.
Yet still the eyes are exquisite And stun the pressure of his wit, And still the contour of the cheeks Prevents the accents when he speaks, And all the mouths converging lines Intoxicate him more than ivines.
But if the mouth inclines to laugh The laughter is his epitaph.
—M. Y.

It is again the night before press time, and the Week is no further than the first sentence. Ordinarily this lateness » is to be overlooked, but tonight I am both late and indisposed. V While we were downtown Jimmie Walsh bought some cigars, and an impulse of the sort that Father Carroll calls communal led me to buy the biggest nickel cigar in the store. Smoking is not a vice, if it were it would be. more prevalent, but smoking five cent cigars is no preparation for anything but another and better cigar. Thinkers never smoke cigars, '* they eat them. The Fulton Fish market would never have lost Al Smith if he had not learned to chew cigars as a youth. Aggressiveness, big business, and executive ability r are evidenced by the peculiarly American custom of eating cigars. If a man maintains sufficient interest in a cigar to keep it lit, he is not concentrating on his directors’ meeting, and is not truly a business man.
At the Hotel Plaza in New York last Sunday night the Honorable Alfred E. Smith was presented with the Laetare * Medal. It was not the first, though it was the greatest and most timely distinction that the ex-governor received from a Catholic university. Coming to him when it did, the Laetare Medal was not only an honor, but also a recognition. It ► was the cheer given a defeated but honest knight as he retired from the field with shattered lance and bloody armour.
» Friday night means just another fish dinner to most of us. Campus chronic gripers would be at a loss without s Fridays, though when they complain over the meal they make the superficial mistake of blaming the fish. If you, by an , oversight of what the Scribblers call predestination, were to have been born in salt water, and the cod in question were an epicurean sophomore, you would be as distasteful to him 7 as he is to you. And the cod, being a Bostonian, and the pride of his rich aunt Bertha, would enter into his meal without any murmurings. Our religion makes a meatless day, the war made wheatless days, Volstead tried to make drinkless nights, and the Christian Scientists will eventually try to make foodless lives. Consider all that, and be thankful for the cod, even reverting to the custom of the first Ameri-r can, who apologized to a rarebit before sending it down to aggravate his indigestion. Today the Seniors will eat anything without complaint. Their thoughts are on a plane above the necessities of life, and are more concerned with
• ideas relative to the entertainment of week-end guests. This dance is the criterion of the judgment of each Senior. If after four years of dating and dancing the graduate evidences no better taste than to neglect smuggling in an imported girl then his taste and his selection must be of extraordinary merit if criticism is to be withheld. And after all that discussion we had about white vests, an advertiser in the Scholastic obstinately insisted that a white vest was preferable. All of which may be good advertisement, though dictatorial prescriptions of the sort usually take better with freshmen than with seniors. The musical favors for the Ball have converted Sorin into something like a “Tin Pan Alley.”
The only difference being that the alley has a little variety in the selections it offers.
A saloon, a postoffice, a grocery store, and a church were once considered as the beginning of any town. These institutions are listed in climatic order, and I hope no one does me the injustice of thinking that I have named them in the order of their importance. In a town such as the one - we have pictured a barber would be about the last tradesman to bask under’ his shingle. Early settlers are too busy to’ grow hair, or too poor to get shaved, and if they become annoyed by a superfluous growth they start a free for all and pull hair. A little town in Ohio needed a barber so bad that they promised the tonsorial artist to name the town after him if he would but settle among them. Barberton got shaved and trimmed last Saturday to welcome the Notre Dame bandmen. And from the minute the busses drove into town until they drove out, our musicians were either entertaining or entertained. Encore followed encore, and the band stopped only when exhausted. Even as Joe dropped his baton the Barberton bells flocked about the fellows, nosily picking their particular preference for the dance of the evening. The people in that town will never forget the Notre Dame band, nor will the girls ever forget that all bandmen are long-winded. The drummer was a bit handicapped, but he compensated for his lack of wind by indulging in that winsome, far-away look characteristic of the aesthetic drummers.
A week ago last night the Faculty Board of Publications gave a dinner to the men who like to see their names in the various campus publications. These men have a delusion that anyone who writes is a writer. This logically follows from their premise that anyone who rides a horse is horsey. Considered as a dinner it was the fulfillment of the real and of the ideal. The asparagus was the best I ever had, and, as I sat next to Harry Sylvester, the conversation maintained itself. The speakers were all wet; they discussed nothing but kegs, voyages, captains, and bottles. Joe MacNamara and Harley McDevitt wandered from dampness long enough to discuss the relatives merits of various tobaccos and cigarettes, and Professor Phillips made a nice distinction between breeches and brooches as gifts to lady friends.’ Each member of the Board of Publications tried to persuade us that he had done more work than both of the other two, until Father Burke decided that the matter really should be relegated to the bucket. Ley, Nanovic, and Pendergast were named as the unfortunates who must endure our censure next year, and each of them made an apologetic little speech for accepting his particular office. The Board has my appreciation for their dramatic instinct in announcing editors before unsuspecting audiences and unwarned contestants. There was just one thing about that wet dinner that annoyed me; I have had the same disappointment at other banquets. Where do the trays full of cigarettes go the minute the chairs are pushed back? Ponder over that and you may well be a raving maniac by the time I write another of these.

Tonight the indefinite takes on definite form. The magic land of Once-Upon-A-Time, a riot of striking hues, of charm, of grace, of gayety, plays hcst again to Youth and Beauty. Tonight, all of the splendor of the Thousand Nights, all the romance of a thousand romances, the music of as many poems will be crystalized into one short span of hours that will never end. For tonight is dedicated to the anual Senior Ball. . . . the Ball of Once-Upon-A-Time.
There is something that suggests Youth in those cryptic words; but you will have missed the spirit of the Ball if you do not recognize that Youth suggests glamour, and glamour gaiety. This, the premier social event of the scholastic year, is essentially Youth’s. And so it is that the new spirit of the age has been borrowed to lend atmosphere, to’ furnish romance on this Night of Romantists
The decorative scheme of the Ball is being carried out in its entirety in the modernistic! spirit. It may be said to interpret the age in which we live,—with just a suggestion perhaps, of Tomorrow. It is the art of the men and women the day to come, and so, is peculiarly pertinent to the occasion. The Ball then, carries out the new spirit of the age, a spirit of going forward and to do this it adopts the newest in expression which in a manner is never old, in that it progresses by going back;—back to fundamentals.
For the whole scheme of modem art has been one of simplicity of thoroughness,—of arriving at the fundamentals. Primitive man was a better art critic than our broadclothed, - tailored brother because he knew that art was not a namby-pamby, sentimental attempt to cover up something that was pretty. He knew that art was magic; a lifting of the spirit to meet the cosmic mysteries about him. Hence in the decorations for this event that there will be more attempt at

rhythm than at complying with formal rules oi- rigid schemes of combinations of color and design.
It is true that the Land of Once-Upon-A-Time is quite usually thought of as a country jutted with round towers, with dragons and knights clanging sword on sword. But may it not just as well be a glorious Tomorrow? Might it not quite as easily be the Day after Next as the century before last?—Perhaps it might better be so, for sorrow has always been; while joy comes with the morrow.
This has been the stand taken by the Committee in charge of the decorations for the Ball. So you may remember that the Ball of 1929 was the Ball of the Men and Women of the Future. Remembering that,’ the Key to the explanation of its decorative scheme is yours.
PATRONS AND PATRONESSES
Patrons and Patronesses for the affair are Dean and Mrs. William Konop, Dean and Mrs. James E. McCarthy, Mr. and Mrs. Knute K. Rockne, Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Mills, Professor Charles J. Phillips, Professor- James Hines, Professor Paul Fenlon, and Mr. Paul Byrne.
Miss Natalie L. Wiss of Morristown, New Jersey, a student at Smith College, will be the guest of Mr. John Reilly, general chairman of the Ball. Mr. Anthony Kopecky, president of the Senior Class, will have as his partner, Miss Dorothy Stevenson, of Chicago, Illinois.
Mr. Joseph P. MacNamara, Editor of the Juggler, will have as his guest Miss Helen Holthouse of Decatur, Indiana, a student at St. Mary’s, Notre Dame, while Miss Virginia R. Dean, of Chicago, Illinois, a student at the University of Wisconsin, will be the guest of Mr. John V. Hinkel, editor of the Scholastic. Miss Patricia Ragen of Chicago, Illi
nois, a student at St. Mary’s College, Notre Dame, will attend ■with Mr. Robert Hellrung, president of the Junior Class.
MUSIC
Johnny Johnson and his Hotel Pennsylvania Orchestra of New York City has been selected by Chairman Thomas Casey and his music committee to supply the music for the affair. The band is especially noted for the varying combinations employed during the playing of slow tempo “blues” pieces.
As exponents of symphonic “Jazz” rhythm, Johnny Johnson’s Band is unexcelled. The personnel of this orchestra has remained intact for the last seven years. During the last two seasons it has been playing at the Hotel Pennsylvania, where it was preceded by Vincent Lopez and his band. It has enjoyed a prolonged engagement at the Club Mirador, famous New York night club noted for its exclusiveness. Before starting its New York engagements this orchestra played for several seasons at Palm Beach and Miami. It is one of the Victor Company’s best known recording orchestras and is a popular favorite among Eastern radio fans.
The orchestra has had considerable experience playing for university and college dances. Besides playing for the Ball it is at present under contract to play at four other Western university class dances and at three Eastern university formals.
Several versatile soloists are numbered among its personnel who will aid in enlivening the evening for the seniors and their guests. It also boasts of a nationally prominent vocal quartet which will sing special numbers, the feature of which will be a farewell rendition of the “Victory March.”

CAMPUS PERSONALITIES
GERALD EDWARD ROACH
‘•'Campus politics,” says Gerald Edward Roach, 192 pounds, six foot two, “are at their lowest ebb. I sincerely hope that student organizations will soon take measures to better this condition.”. This remark coming from Mr. Roach is as authoritative as a statement from Webster on how to spell “dictionary,” or Mussolini’s opinion of revolutions. For this genial giant is head of Notre Dame’s austere body of campus Solons—the Law Club.
Mr. Roach continues irrelevantly, that Notre Dame has the best law school in the country; then he endorses the Scholastic and other campus publications (advt.). When the interview was over, he had en
dorsed everything from brunettes to the need of a car station and campus drainage system.
Jerry lives at Grand Rapids, Michigan. There he is a fourth degree Knight of Columbus. Here he is a third degree man, but makes up the deficiency by being president of the Grand Rapids Club, president of the Senior Law Class, chairman of the Club Presidents’ Charter committee (a doubtful honor, in his opinion), and one of those personalities who will do the reception work at the Senior Ball tonight.
A man of this type—executive and six foot two—would make an ideal fullback for’ some team. Walsh happened to be the team and for two years Jerry was its Joesting. He smokes pipes and cigars, is active in the K. C. and also the Booste/s of Sorin Hall. He intends to redeem the legal profession this summer by his entrance therein.
“Drop,” says Mr. Roach and his crowd of admirers (among whom is his room-mate, Joe Sullivan, freshman baseball coach), “around to 130 Sorin any time for advice or aid.”
PROFESSOR ROEMER’S BOOK TO BE RELEASED SOON
The Loyola University Press of Chicago will soon announce the publication of a new book, “The Ethical Basis of International Law,” written by Dr. William F. Roemer of the department of philosophy at Notre Dame.
Professor Roemer came to Notre Dame from Campion College in 1922. He received the degree of doctor of philosophy in 1927.
The book is expected to be placed in circulation by June 1st and will be a notable addition to Notre Dame’s famous collection of literature.

ment of pharmacy, with offices in
PROF. ROBERT LEE GREENE
Certainly one of the most interesting men on the campus is Professor Robert Lee Greene, who is head of the departChemistry Hall. Perhaps his being off the beaten path is what accounts for our apparent lack of knowledge about him.
Professor Greene was born near the home of General Sheridan in St. Joseph’s Parish, Somerset, Ohio. St. Joseph’s Parish was once the headquarters of the Dominican Fathers. He attended a local country school until he was eighteen and then went to Columbus, Ohio, for his high school education. From high school he went into Ohio State University at Columbus, graduating in pharmacy in 1893. In
cidentally, Ohio State is conceded to have the best pharmacy school in the nation.
After his departure from the state university, Mr. Greene, for a few years owned and operated a drug store in Columbus. Still later he became a traveling salesman.
In 1897 came his first contact with Notre Dame. That year he drafted a course in pharmacy for the University. In 1902 he became director of the department and has held that position since.
Nineteen hundred twenty-four is a noteworthy date in Professor Greene’s life. It was in that .year Mr. Greene organized the first Notre Dajne Glee Club which was composed largely of pharmacy students. In the same year he began the collection of data for his book, "The Chemistry of Health,” which was published in 1928. After fourteen years of application his book was an apt and fitting climax. It has, of course, been included with the other items in the traveling collection of Notre Dame. Perhaps it deserves a higher place than some, since it is the only book of its kind. Its treatment of the chemistry of health is said to be unique. It is hardly necessary to say that Professor Greene’s life is devoted to the fine service of mankind. In educating young men in pharmacy, Professor Greene is teaching them to minister to the physical side of man. And it is only when the physical is efficient that the mental side of man is at its best. We cannot imagine a fuller life than Professor Greene’s.
Mr. Greene is tall and slender; his head is crowned with silver. In the summer he rests on his farm in Northern Michigan. His hobbies there are gardening, fishing, and sailing. In toto, Professor Greene is a true Waltonian, and— implicit in this last—a gentleman.	—M. H. L.

“DOMES” EXPECTED TO BE READY FOR DISTRIBUTION BY MAY 15

INDIANA RESERVE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION TO VISIT UNIVERSITY TOMORROW
Notre Dame will be host tomorrow afternoon to sixty officers of the United States Reserve Officers Association of Indiana. The group which is meeting in South Bend on one of the four annual contact camps held by the organization, will inspect the plants of the Studebaker Corporation in the morning, and in the afternoon will visit Notre Dame.
The Blue Circle has made plans to show the officers the points of interest about the campus. A dinner will be tendered the men in the Florentine Room of the Hotel LaSalle, Saturday evening.
The invitation to visit Notre Dame was extended to the association by the Very Reverend Charles L. O’Donnell, C.S.C., president of the University. Father O’Donnell, himself a reserve officer, was head chaplain of the American Expeditionary Forces in Italy during the World War. The following members of the faculty will entertain the Reserve Officers while in South Bend: the Reverend Joseph Heiser, C.S.C., director of the off-campus department of the University, and a captain in the Field Artillery chaplain reserve; Professor Clarence Manion, of the Law College, a reserve captain of Field Artillery, and Dr. Leslie Clough, of the physical training department of Notre Dame, a major in the Medical Corps reserve.

FATHER CAVANAUGH FEATURED SPEAKER AT FRESHMAN HALL BANQUET
“Save your faith as you would save your honor.” With those words as his subject, the Reverend John W. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., former president of the University, addressed the students at the Freshman Hall Banquet, held in the Faculty Dining Hall Monday night, May 6. Father Cavanaugh, who has no peer as an after-dinner speaker, warned against the reading of harmful books about life, written by authors who let their imagination and not their experience guide their pen.
This affair, the first of its kind at Notre Dame, was attended by one hundred and twenty-six men of Freshman Hall. It was purely a student movement and the enthusiasm shown is evidence of the unusually good spirit existing in Freshman Hall.
The Reverend Frank Cavanaugh, C.S.C., of Sophomore Hall, was toastmaster for the occasion. Short talks were also given by the guests, the Reverends John F. O’Hara, C.S.C.; Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C.; Raymond Murch, C.S.C., and James J. Connerton, C.S.C.

SMITH RECEIVES LAETARE MEDAL IN NEW YORK CEREMONY
Alfred E. Smith received the Laetare Medal at an impressive ceremony last Sunday night in the Plaza Hotel, New York City. His Eminence, Patrick Cardinal Hayes, archbishop of New York and a noted figure in the Catholic hierarchy of this country presented the Medal to the distinguished American, after the Very Reverend Charles L. O’Donnell, C.S.C., president of the University had made the formal announcement of the award in the name of the University.
Immediately following the presentation of the formal document and the coveted medal, a burst of applause and congratulations greeted the former state executive. Chief among the messages of congratulations which poured in from all over the country was one from President Herbert C. Hoover, who defeated Mr. Smith in the 1928 presidential race. The congratulatory letter, which was addressed to Father O’Donnell is as follows:	•
My dear Doctor O’Donnell:
I have your letter of the 22nd, informing me that the Laetare Medal from the University of Notre Dame will on the 5th of May be awarded to Governor Alfred E. Smith.
I am glad you have thus given me the opportunity to join in congratulations to Governor Smith for the honor which you confer upon so distinguished an American .and to the University for its public spirit in honoring so great a public servant.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) HERBERT HOOVER.
Following the bestowal, the Honorable Frank Pierce Pont Graves, commissioner of education of the State of New York, delivered the chief address of the evening.
The ceremonies at the Plaza hotel, which were broadcast by the National Broadcasting company’s chain hookup, were sponsored by the Notre Dame Alumni Club of New York City, headed by Ambrose O’Connell, ’07. More than .100 alumni and their guests, including a large delegation of friends and associates of former governor Smith, were num' bered anong the gathering.
Mr. Smith was the ninth man associated with public affairs in this country to receive the Laetare medal in the 46 years that it has been bestowed by Notre Dame.
In receiving this medal, Mr. Smith, four times governor of the state of New York, and the Democratic nominee for President in 1928, is admitted to the select group of America’s highest exponents of Roman Catholicism; to the ranks of the men and women, whose contributions to the moral and educational standards of American life have chiseled their names on the cold marble of time. Since 1883, the year the award was instituted by the Very Reverend Edward Sorin, founder and first president of the university, the list of Medallists includes such names as: Edward Doug-ias White, Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court; Henry F. Brownson, philosopher and author; Maurice Francis Egan, diplomat and author; James J. Walsh, author and physician; William Shepard Benson, Admiral and Chief of Naval Operations; Albert Francis Zahm, scientist and intimate friend of Theodore Roosevelt; Charles Bonaparte, lawyer; Charles D. Maginnis, architect; Margaret Anglin, actress; and Patrick Donohue, founder of the “Boston Pilot.”
Numbered among the other medallists are lawyers, engineers, philanthropists, physicians, economists, editors, artists and historians all of world-wide fame. The list of names is very cosmopolitan in its scope. The award is recognized as the outstanding award to some Catholic lay person for distinguished and meritorious service rendered during the year in his particular field of endeavor as reflects glory upon the Catholic Church.

On the first day of January in 1965 a student at the University of North Carolina will open a sealed tin box in the vault of the university library. He will extract a Montgomery Ward and Company catalog issued in 1915 and compare the articles listed therein with those in the 1965 edition, if any, issued by the same company. He will then write a thesis on the changes represented, and place a copy of the thesis with the two catalogs which will then be sealed up to remain for another half century.

At the University of Utah an edict was recently passed which prohibited smoking on the campus. Resourceful students are getting around the ban by smoking on stilts. Length of the stilts is left to the discretion of the individual smoker, but twelve inches is considered the average safe distance from the campus.

If you can stand a few black and blue spots, you might practice the following method of maintaining alertness in class during these days when spring fever is the chief campus ailment. The story is told by The Daily Texan, University of Texas paper:
“You have all heard of people pinching themselves to see if they were awake, but have you ever heard of one doing it to keep from going to sleep?
“This is how a promising young University student solved the problem of keeping up.
“As he sits and listens to an endless lecture, he feels a flood of irresistible drowsiness coming over him. Something must be done. So just as he feels himself going under, he gives himself a terrific pinch and awakens with a start. By repeating this process continually, he manages to stay awake.”

“Senior Prom association places 200 tickets on sale.
“ ‘Nearly 260 couples will dance at Senior Prom to-night.’ (News item.)
“My, my; what a lot of chaperons and patrons it takes to hold down a good all-University formal.”

College students are not so dumb as judges of human nature, according to a test made at Syracuse University. The story, as told by the Syracuse Daily Orange, is this:
“That the average Hill student is less gullible than the trained men who are employed to test the veracity of others
was demonstrated by Prof. Harold W. Hepper of the Syracuse university psychology department in an exhaustive experiment conducted recently.	.
“Twenty-five Syracuse business men whose professions consist in questioning applicants for positions, or for credit were matched in the tests with an equal number of students who had had no previous experience in the art of interviewing and who acted as a control group, the object being to discover whether the trained specialist could discover a falsehood in a greater percentage of cases than could the inexperienced scholars.
“In the experiment each interviewer asked six questions of each of ten students selected at random from a class of 100.
“Results which were tabulated from a total of 3205 answers showed that the credit men detected 52 per cent of the falsehoods, the employment men 42 per cent, while the male students detected 55 per cent of the untruths.”

From the Notre Dame News of Notre Dame College, South Euclid, Ohio:
"Whoopee! all the excitement of basketball has died away and now all the girls are down in the park running and jumping. Oh, no, dear readers, they haven’t lost control of their senses, they’re just practicing for track. I think they ought to charge for on-looking; they certainly would make money.”

The newest fad at the University of Georgia is Onion Parties. On every hand, and with every breath, students hear of them. White onions, red onions, and fresh green onions. They eat them raw, with bread, or salt—or what have you?
It is said that spectators are barred from being present at these parties, only participants being present because of the trouble non-participants cause by being overcome, fainting and having to be revived.
A campus editor makes this testimonial: “I owe everything to Bermuda onions. I was weak and run down before eating them. Now I am run down every day, but the onions have given me strength enough to pick myself up and hurl myself to safety. I can truthfully say I am glad I know my onions.”

Dear Mr. Hinkel:	'
I fear your kind letter with its multi-colored compliments and high-powered adjectives was calculated to trick me into straining a lot of silly advice through my long gray whiskers.
j. p. m’evoy
You have no idea how much advice to the young lad can be drooled by an old man of 34, especially when you massage his vanity with velvety tributes.
I can remember away back when I was a student on the Notre Dame Campus; every once in a while a brave tarantara rang out and we would all scamper over to Washington Hall and park expectantly on our haunches while some wise old bavil from the outside world scattered a lot of those pearls of wisdom for us to snout about. Well, I can remember a lot of those pearls; I used to bite ’em to see if they were real, and invariably they turned out to be shoe buttons, beer tops and glass eyes out of bear rugs. I saved a large collection of them with which I am going to endow a chair of advice some day in some university I don’t like—and it won’t be Notre Dame.
May I quote one paragraph of your letter as my text for the following remarks:
“We would desire, if possible, an article of some seven or eight hundred words or more in length on some subject pertaining to the particular field of endeavor in which you have achieved success, and the possibilities it offers to college graduates.”
The particular field of endeavor in which I have achieved the greatest success is that of loafing; I hold all the standing and running records, in and outdoors, with and without weights as well as free style, back stroke and the 2-1-2 and full twister. I can sleep upright like a horse or a movie usher; I can loaf vertically, horizontally or on the bias; but even with my mature experience and ripe knowledge on the subject, I doubt if I could add anything to the sum total of wisdom possessed instinctively by college boys. The only advice I can give them on that subject is to remember that the ability to loaf beautifully and enjoy it without any twinges of conscience is a gift which one should never lose —more, it is a treasure which one should never surrender to the vulgar seductions offered by the world in the form of fame or riches or the perverted desire to do something for a problematical posterity. As Dooley used to say, “Why the hell should we do anything for posterity? What did posterity ever do for us?”
It is true I have punctuated luxuriant periods of quiescence with revues, plays, greeting cards, novels, tomato can labels, moving pictures, vaudeville acts, obituaries, and letters of advice to young men; but I regret all those excursions; I look upon them in their true light as evidences of weakness and sad exhibits of what temptation can do to lure a good Notre Dame boy from the right path. To all young men studying with the desire of becoming writers eventually, I can only say “Oh, the pity of it!” Writing is a silly occupation, consisting as it does of putting a lot or words together which are better off by themselves. I take this opportunity to apologize publicly to the ’ audience who have been tricked into attending my plays—to my readers (pardon the plural—pure meglomania)—and especially to you students of Notre Dame who may have read thus far.
You can see what writing over a long period of years will do for a man. Here I started out with the firm intention of not writing anything, and look at the result. Or if you will take my advice, don’t look at it.
An old man’s blessing on- you all; eat, drink and be merry; increase and multiply; watch your hats and coats and be good and you will be happy. That’s my story and I’m stuck with it.
Joseph P. M’Evoy, noted dramatist, novelist, humorist, and scenario writer is one of America’s most popular authors. His first published work, “Slams of Life,” was a collection of verse; next came “The Bam Bam Clock.” “The Potters,” a comedy, was produced in 1924 and the following year Mr. M’Evoy’s talent was broadened by the addition of music in his revues, “The Comic Supplement” and “Americana.”
“God Loves Us,” a satirical tragedy, brought a favorable . wave of publicity; in his work, Mr. M’Evoy showed that comedy and satire were not only subjective; they could be
made the carriers of significant drama. His latest productions were “Allez Oop,” a musical revue of 1927, and “Show Girl,” published in book form and serial, and later filmed.
M’Evoy’s college years were spent here on our own campus and in this article he recalls humorously some of the ’ thoughts that came to him then, and offers advice to the present students. Since he left Notre Dame in 1912, his career in writing has been remarkable. He now lives in Woodstock, N. Y.

THE NEW CAMPLI CLUB CEARTERT
If the present plans of the Students Activities Council materializes, the campus clubs will really give justification for their existence in the future. They will work for the good of themselves in that their activities and functions will be increased and enhanced. When the new charters go into effect next year it is expected and hoped that the different state and city organizations will undergo a rebirth that will inculcate new life and vigor. At least, that was one of the motives that moved the S. A. C. to undertake the work of reorganization.
>	The University, too, will also benefit by the new plan and the way it will react to the benefit of the
*	'	University cannot but be an indirect benefit to the student body. Provisions have been made to assist
in the quicker orientation of the freshmen members of the different clubs by appointing an upperclassman in each club to watch over the destinies of the first-year men. Also, the state and city organizations will be afforded an opportunity to take an active part in the activities participated, in by the whole student body.
*	At present the clubs are somewhat lax in discharging their duties, their functions being more or
less desultory and sporadic. But accusations of this type will be groundless if the several organizations show the proper spirit in accepting and heeding the suggestions included in the new charters. The S. A. C. was motivated only by a desire to better the con ditions which have existed heretofore. The Council had no wish to appear autocratic or despotic.	.
,	The S. A. C. and the committee of presidents have done their part as well as it could possibly be
done. Now, the burden falls upon the several clubs to accept the charter with an open mind and to do all in their power to cooperate with the S. A. C. whenever and however possible. Particularly is this ’ true of the newly-elected club officers who are all tacidly delegated to give the charters a fail- and hon-■ est trial. If they do this and find the document satis factory, well and good. If, after a fair trial, the ■ charter shows that it cannot fulfill the purpose for which it was created the clubs will find the S. A. C.
» more than ready to make any changes or amendments that seem expedient.
•	TEE NEW EEAB MANACERT
The Scholastic congratulates Coach Rockne and the Athletic Association on the appointment of Mr. John J. Quinn and Mr. Bernard Conroy as hea d football managers, Mr. Cornelius J. Carey as head B manager of basketball, Mr. Robert Hellrung as head baseball manager, and Mr. Anthony Kegowicz as head manager of track, for next year. The men s o honored have completed almost three years of meritorious services in the interests of the University. They have labored hard, deserved much, and have at 1 last received their reward. It is altogether fitting a nd proper that they should be so honored.
The average student is but little acquainted with the managerial system at Notre Dame. It is one of the finest and most well-organized systems of its type at any college or university in the country.
•	Inaugurated about six years ago, the system has been coordinated and welded together gradually, and made more efficient with the passing of the years until now it is second to none.
i The aid rendered by the managers to the va rious athletic teams of the University cannot be adequately evaluated. It has made itself indispensible. A number of students have the impression that the Notre Dame managerial system exists primarily an d almost solely to act as a sort of “valet system” to athletes. This impression is so erroneous that it i s ridiculous. It is true that the managers handle all ‘ athletic equiment. But it is also true that they handle ticket and seating arrangements at every athletic contest, assist in the handling of the athletic fi nancial accounts, arrange for all trips and handle all details on these trips, and assist the Athletic Association in numerous other ways.
The managers are the unsung heroes of the a thletic teams and deservedly more than merit the • recognition and the honors which are their just du e.	—J- V. H.

Senior Balls of Other Years
CLINTON
The annual Senior Ball at Notre Dame is an institution which dates back, we suppose, to the days when the first Blue and Gold football elevens were struggling to keep one full team intact. Our doubt as to the time the first event took place arises out of the fact that we were compelled to stop our search through old records by the unreadableness of the yellow printed matter before we came to a record of the first Ball in Notre Dame history. It is not at all impossible that Senior Ball chairmen took their troubles to Father Sorin as far back as the days when students lived in log cabins and read philosophy by candle light.
Browsing through the files of the Scholastic we found that Senior Ball write-ups make interesting reading matter. They tell us, for example, that each Ball, up to and including the one to take place tonight, surpassed by far, all proceeding performances of its kind. That Mr. and Mrs. Knute K. Rockne have been the most frequently martyred couple to be selected as patron and patroness. That the Palais Royale, with no exceptions for the past seven years, has received a part of the Senior Ball fund as just and legitimate rent. That but one, and that in 1923, has the reporter of the dance failed to feature the Grand March led by the President of the class with “his charming partner clinging to his arm.” The Grand March was omitted from the program that year.
The Notre Dame Daily for May 20th, 1923, carried four columns of descriptive matter pertaining to the Senior Ball. Seniors, apparently, were dancers that year. The week-end program consisted of a dance Wednesday night at the Oliver Hotel, the Ball itself Thursday night at the Palais, a Glee Club entertainment with a dance following at the Oliver on Friday night, and a track meet Saturday. As a final climax to the whole affair the Seniors and their guests were invited to attend the marriage of one of their members, Cyril W. Neff, in Sacred Heart Church. Reading through the three thousand word article we find the descriptive sentence of the final moments of the dance: “The dawn as it crept over the horizon to inform tired-eyed, but blissfully happy young folks that they had danced through night into another day, trembled fearfully in a manner that even Oscar Wilde could not have conceived.”
H. FAILLE
The Class of ’24, however/ was determined not to be outpointed in the matter of providing dances, banquets, receptions, concerts, and athletic contests. In addition to scheduling an equal numbei- of events, they issued a special Senior Ball program telling each senior where he was to be at each hour of the week-end, how he was to dress, and what he was to do, leaving to his own discretion only, what he was to say. Their celebration came within but one performance of equaling the program of the class of the year before. No member of the class, even though the prestige of the class was at stake, could be persuaded to marry.
Don Miller, as Senior Class President in 1925 was given opportunity to display his powers as a promoter of merriment. Judging from the reporter’s awe-inspiring news article which appeared in the May 16th issue of the Scholastic of 1925 his success is unquestioned. The story begins: “Swayed by the melodious syncopation of the Kansas City Nighthawks, entranced by the Aroma of delicate perfumes, and betwitched by the fascinating charms of their dancing partners, the Notre Dame senior classmen celebrated last evening, in the Palais Royale, the Senior Ball—the social event of their college career.” And later in the same story we find:—“the organization which functioned so effectively in making the Senior Ball the most elaborate and the most magnificent ever.”
In the same year, and several days prior to the opening of the Senior festivities, several halls were decorated with a fresh coat of paint. The Week in the May 16th issue of the Scholastic, tells of one fellow writing to his girl of the occasion as follows: “We are getting all painted up for the Ball.” And she, answering, wrote, “Great, so are we.”
Throughout our search we could find no instance where ticket committees were successful in persuading Seniors to buy tickets on time. We could find no statement purporting to show that all final payments were made on the day due. Nor could we justly conclude from what we read that the “morning-after headaches” were more severe in 1926 than they were in 1921. As a final .word of advice to the Chairman of the Ball of the Class of ’30: if you would be the outstanding figure for all time among Senior Ball chairmen, smother your desire to promise “the biggest and best Ball ever.”

EDWARD BRENNAN
I FIRST learned of Stephen Crane in high school. His book. “The Red Badge of Courage,” was on the reading list in freshman English because, as the teacher explained, it contained no difficult words! Such is the fate of many American writers of merit who happen not to be blessed with an efficient press agent. America reads the writers who pamper public taste or create it. Crane did neither, so he occupies the fifth place on the freshman reading list, and he is likely to remain there unless some learned critic can blow hard enough to turn the weather-vane of public opinion in his direction.
The man who is rated by competent critics slightly below de Muppassant and considerably superior to the popular Kipling has so far had no collection of his works or the honor , of a biography. Some, it is true, praise his “Maggie,” “The Red Badge of Courage,” “The Open Book” and “War Is Kind” with sincerity and a subdued admiration which only indicates that they have not fully comprehended the extent of his power. For it seems that understanding of him does not come immediately, but steals upon one slowly like sleep. The public is almost wholly unaware of his existence. Yet » should someone push away the stone in the path, like the old king in the story, and find the pearl beneath, there will be quite a scramble for the honor of discovery.
Stephen Crane is best known for his “Red Badge of Courage.” It is the story of a young soldier in the Civil War and it is significant to note that Crane had no actual experience in warfare when it was undertaken. However, ’ Joseph Conrad reports that when Crane returned from a Balkan campaign, he said, “My picture of war- was all right! I have found it as I imagined.” Certainly he imagined it more clearly than most men see it, he wrote it better than any man has.
“The Red Badge of Courage” has the uneven brilliance of a fire that burns with leaping and falling flames. The sentences are short and nervous and there is a singular bareness of ordinary details and a subtle use of strong emotion that produces an impression of wild, almost startling vividness. Though this impression is solely and always present in the story there is a flashing quality in it just as the light of a fire is of the same texture, yet the fire dies or flames up, changing the intensity of the light.
All the material is gathered with one object into a single vivid theme just as the light under a burning glass is concentrated into one white intense point. The story continues over the three days of the youth’s first experience in battle. It is the story of his cowardice in the first action, his mental reaction to that decisive act, his stumbling return to trust in himself, and his final attainment of honor among men. In the austere development of this theme the youth is scarcely given a name, seldom called by it. The story is concerned with him alone. Always it is “he,” the subject of the story, the subject of almost every verb. Others enter- the story not as characters existing for themselves, but only as they speak with him or act with him; they do not exist except when he sees them, they form images, backgrounds, impressions. Nature is put as he sees it, or feels it, as it agrees . with his mood or contrasts with it. This treatment of the theme wears a deep impression into the mind of the reader and leaves him awakened.
By his peculiar method, Crane presented details in a
manner most effective for the final vivid realistic impression. Instead of producing a distorted and unnatural effect, the use of unrelieved details obtains a vigour and unusual vividness. The detail is introduced suddenly, or at least where a fuller description is expected. That detail is not enlarged upon, neither is it much painted or moulded, but nevertheless, it as as artistic as it is realistic. It stands as the most natural, the most striking detail of the scene, it gathers within itself the whole impressive strength of the scene; it is stronger- by being alone, with all attention focussed on it, with no other details near it to weaken it or pale its color by comparison. The author, speaking of a camping at night, says merely that the campfires bloomed redly all about like some strange flower. Such a detail is not the epitome of a scene as many of Shakespeare’s are, but simply the strongest one. Such details produce images none the less imaginative and accurate by being sharply brief.
In minute or even ordinary details the story is meager and sparse. They are picked as you pick tall men from a crowd— by their prominence. Whatever stands out, whatever is most easily seen, that is the detail you find. The story is strong because it is built of strong material; such a handling cannot but make it strongly impressive, since it casts out all that is weak.
Crane uses short words that are, of themselves, commonplace and ordinary, but, when brought together in sentences, begin to glow strangely. He speaks in one place of a veteran who told about troops to the south horribly starved and emaciated. The youth was so impressed by the report that in his mind he could see those soldiers hideously thin so that the raw red bones stuck through the flesh. These sentences are the coals that glow in the texture of the story. They make the story feverish and intensely vital.	•
Active emotion has its own important part in the vividness of the story. Crane deliberately arouses antipathy toward his hero and by the force of that keeps the reader distinctly impressed throughout the story. He might easily have used sympathy in dealing with, his character’s failure, explaining how he was the victim of unhappy circumstance instead of a rather despicable weakling trying to excuse his faults. Any such treatment would have made a feeble story indeed. It would have made the youth’s final salvation of himself strained and insincere. Neither strong details nor the powerful concentration on the theme could then have saved this story from being impossible and uninteresting.
When the story is read, therefore, this vividness, this product of many things is easily recognized and appreciated. It has a quality of nervous excitement which is the very lure of the story—one must see the burning out of the fire of it, the fading of its glow, one must feel the cooling of its heat. There are defects, of course, some ineffectual words and overdrawn comparisons. But these do not impair the strength, rather the yare the natural defects of it; they are hardly noticed. Few things are noticed but the red vividness.
“The Red Badge of Courage” is not, however, without honor. It has certainly influenced Conrad (probably very definitely in his “Lord Jim”) as well as Kipling. Yet, I do not believe that the works of Stephen Crane will ever be •widely popular. They are too fine, too subtle for' that. Crane’s appeal is not for the emotional reader, and his method is not for the dabbler.

My
Dramatic Debut
D
. 1
ROGER GLENDINNING
SEVERAL y„ars ago I made my dramatic debut. I had appeared in several plays and operettas before, but few people ever patronize high school dramatic productions. However, when I made my debut it was before nearly a whole city—not all at once of course, but divided up into seven or eight audiences. The thing which inspired the production was a centennial celebration, and 1 believe that even now communities are not adverse to celebrating centennials with pageants, mardi gras, punch with plenty of punch and patriotic speeches. The bird and animal clubs and lodges, put this gigantic extravaganca of riot and color over with a “bang.” But I started to tell you about the parent in which I made my debut, so—
The pageant itself was very good—literary and written in blank verse. My reader probably recalls a like bit of dramatization, because I believe it is a weakness now-a-days for pageants to be written thus. I was just entering into that adolescent period, commonly called the voice-cracking-age. Scraping every second together, I suppose that I was not on the stage over three minutes, though it took about four hours to go through the whole thing. Everyone of importance in the town was in the pageant and each had a suitable number of lines to squeak or bellow out.
I played the part of a school boy who ran away to join the Northern troops. The scene was laid at Betty Snipsnap’s corner, where history has it that a huge military rally took place. Those still living say that there were at least thirty there to see off the home town regiment of fifteen, .lust as the drum corps, one drum, was lending the troops off, I was supposed to run out and say, “I’ve just run away from school and I want to join the army.” How I had practiced on that line! It was all they would give me to say. The director complained that I didn’t speak loudly enough and even “bawled me out” because I said that I was doing the best I could. On the, opening night I decided that I would make an impression. I ran out onto the stage, keyed up to fever pitch, and ready to put into my voice all the excitement and virility that I felt. I did, and my voice cracked on the word “want” . . . Let me rest at that. Every time I think of my embarrassment, I become more embarrassed.
Other historical events were portrayed in that pageant, but not one of them was carried through with the zest of the voice-cracking scene. For thereafter I was compelled to do it nightly for the sake of realism and art. You see then
why it.was my debut. The house was packed for every performance to hear me crack my voice.	*
The last scene of the pageant of the acting of the dramt- •••' ic personae. The lighting effects were gorgeous; the drops, curtains and sets were well made and grouped to perfection. Someone played a melody on a muted violin throughout this last part. It was a scene to send delightful vibrations up the backs of the aesthetically inclined.
I have hinted that the cast was poorly chosen, but on second thought I will go so far as to say that it was incongruous. In it were a sculptor, a statue and an architect. The sculptor was a sylph-like thing who measured at least ninety-eight around the bust and who taught voice culture. She was enveloped in a maze of chimeric material that hung from her arms and more prominent parts of her body in long streams and trails. When the curtain went up she was * posed in a striking attitude, and executed her lines in a deep 5 throaty voice that dampened any latent dramatic ability that might have been present Her accomplice, the statue, was a yearling—all legs. She also was planted before the curtain arose. Arms and legs were everywhere—for she was a statue.
The sculptor’s speech ran something like this, “I am the 4 sculptor—formless mass—my hands and tools—statue, ahd lo a miracle is performed!” Whereupon the statue came to life with a leap and started flying about the stage like an eagle preparing to attack. After this contortionist had her ' fling, the stage was vacated and the architect pranced oUt as self-conscious as a five-year-old. He said his say by Uttering gutterals in a stereotyped mile-a-minute clip, ahd ’ then pranced off the stage. Even those behind the scenes were at a loss to know just what it was that the architect had built. I don’t reemmber, but I think that after this they	j
sang, “My Country ’tis of Thee,” or “John Brown’s Body.”	t
It didn’t matter much, because by then the audience was too	,
exhausted to sing. So ended the pageant in which I made	!
my debut.
All of this happened several years ago and as a result there might be a few discrepencies in my narrative. At the f time I swore never to tell a soul, but, as you see, I’ve broken down and confessed. My only and lasting hope is, that someday I may be permitted to act in another pageant. May it please Fate to grant that I may never be another adolescent school boy who ran away from home to join the Army.	!

N.D. Beats Iowa and Drake; Loses to Wisconsin
Errors Costly At Madison—Millsmen Play Brilliantly Against Hawkeyes and Bulldogs
AT MADISON, WISCONSIN, MAY 1 Wisconsin 4, Notre Dame 3 (11 innings).
Joe Jachym dropped a heart-breaking pitching duel to Ellerman, Badger slab artist, in the first game of the trip. The game was exceptionally close at all times and went into two extra innings before the Big Ten outfit made the winning run. But for the ragged support given Jachym by his supporting cast, the tide of victory might have swung the other way. Seven miscues, a number of which occurred at critical , times, was the direct cause of Notre Dame’s defeat.
- After battling practically on even terms for ten innings, Mittermeyer won the game for the Badgers in the eleventh, when his timely double scored Mansfield who had previously singled.
Captain Colrick with three safe blows to his. credit led 1 both teams in batting. He also scored two of the markers registered by the Blue and Gold. Griffin drove in all three Notre Dame runs with a pair of hits. The longest drive of the afternoon was made by Cuisinier, Cardinal football star, who pounded out a long home-run to deep center in the sixth frame with the sacks empty.

AT IOWA CITY, IOWA, MAY 3 Notre Dame 7, Iowa 2.
Smarting under the effects of the beating administered to them on Cartier Field several weeks ago by the Hawkeyes, the Millsmen achieved sweet revenge for their setback by decisively trimming Iowa, 7-2. The Blue and Gold players supported Rust, Notre Dame pitcher, in almost faultless style, and outplayed their hosts in every department of the game.
Oskar Rust is the man to whom a great deal of the credit for the victory must be given. The big pitcher held the lowans scoreless, and for all practical purposes, hitless, for eight innings. In the last stanza he weakened slightly, but enough to allow two Hawkeyes to cross the plate before the side was retired.
Notre Dame got off to an early lead in the first few innings and was never headed. Bray and Lordi, with two bingles apiece, led the Blue and Gold batting attack.

Taking kindly to the offerings of King and Seiberling, Drake hurlers, to the extent of seventeen base hits, the Mills-men had little trouble defeating the Bulldogs in the last engagement of their jaunt. The final score was 13 to 7 in the visitor’s favor. The attraction inaugurated baseball relations between the two schools.
“Tank” Donohue, who was selected for the Notre Dame pitching assignment, conducted himself creditably although he allowed the Bulldogs thirteen hits, Lisicki, Sophomore southpaw, replaced Donohue in the ninth and struck out two batters.
Palermo, Moran and Bray each collected a trio of hits, while Colrick, Hart and Law secured two apiece. Two of Palermo’s drives were doubles.

RACQUETMEN VANQUISH ARMOUR TECH AFTER HARD STRUGGLE, 4-3
The Notre Dame tennis team vanquished Armour Tech of Chicago on the Armour Tech courts last Friday in the hardest fought contest that the Gold and Blue have encountered so far this season. The score was 4 to 3.
The meet was featured by the remarkable showing made by Bud Markey, number 1 man, against George Jennings, rated as seventh in intercollegiate rankings. The first set was captured easily by Markey, who had his opponent running all over the court in an effort to return his hard and well placed drives. The second set was a replica of the first for the first seven games with Markey leading by the score of 5 to 2. With only two points to go for set and match game Jennings suddenly tightened and quickly ran off six games, taking the set 8 to 6. The final set went to Jennings after both players had alternated in winning for eight games.
Ted Griffin, Irish captain, also lost his singles match with Stellar after a stubborn battle, but Burns and O’Brien won their singles matches in easy fashion. Both matches in the doubles went to the Gold and Blue to give them the winning edge. Scores:

‘OLD-TIMERS’ REGISTER WIN IN IMPORTANT FOOTBALL SCRIMMAGE
Two groups of the varsity football squad, dubbed respectively “old-timers” and new-timers,” took part in a long afternoon of scrimmages last Saturday, May 4. These gridiron activities~marked the last appearances in Notre Dame uniforms of such stars as Fred Miller, captain of last year’s team; Jim Brady, regular quarterback; Jack Chevigny, brilliant right halfback, and Fred Collins, stellar fullback.
The “old-timers” registered three touchdowns against their less experienced opponents during the four quarters of the opening session of scrimmages. ' However, the veterans encountered no end of trouble in doing this. Upon several occasions, they found themselves fighting in the vicinity of their own twenty yard line to withstand the determined attack of the “new-timers.”
Scintillating halfback play was the outstanding part of the afternoon’s performance. Chevigny and Leahy led the attack for the “old-timers”, while a number of promising backs were uncovered among the “new-timers” in the persons of Swartz, Koken, Kaplan and Brill. At fullback it was difficult to choose between the play of O’Connor, Mullins, Shay, Collins and Savoldi. Carideo, Brady, Kenneally and Christman stood out at quarterback.
Of the guards, Jack Cannon did the best work, while Twomey, Miller, Donoghue and Frank Leahy were the bestlooking tackles, with McManmon starring for the “new-timers.” Moynihan and Yarr did some fine work at center, the former also demonstrating his talent for punting. The end-play of Ed Collins, Vezie, Murphy, Conley and Host were commendable.

WALSH WINS SHOT-PUT; ELDER THIRD IN 100 AT OHIO STATE RELAYS
Showing surprising all-around strength, Coach Nicholson’s track men proved to be one of the strongest teams at the Ohio State Relays despite the fact that the flying feet of Captain Elder again met one of his rare defeats. This time the Notre Dame captain trailed Simpson of Ohio State and Bowen of Pittsburgh, as the former shattered the world’s record for the 100-yard dash.
Led by Bill Brown, the four-mile team competed in the mile team race and finished second to Butler. The sprint relay garnered a third and a fourth and Bob Walsh took the shot-put from a strong field with a heave of well over 45 feet. The distance medley team took fifth in that event.
