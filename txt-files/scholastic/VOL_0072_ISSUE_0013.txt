WELSH SINGERS OPEN CONCERT SEASON
The Welsh Imperial Singers open the concert and lecture season in Washington Hall, this evening at 8 o’clock. This male ensemble under the able direction of Mr. R. Festyn Davies has the reputation of being one of the foremost male choral groups in the world. It has several times appeared in this country and in Canada, most recently at the International Exposition in Toronto in 1938, and has each time been enthusiastically received.
The program will open with the “March of the Men of Harlech,” a traditional Welsh air, and the rest of the songs will be chosen from a repertoire of over 100 numbers, including such familiar American tunes as “Carry Me Back to Old Virginny,” the “Going Home” Largo from Dvorak’s New World Symphony, and “Deep River.”
On Feb. 8, Mrs. Maisie Ward Sheed, wife of Francis Sheed and vice-president of the Sheed-Ward publishing company will lecture on “The World We Are Living In.” Mrs. Sheed is a recognized authority on the Catholic viewpoint on the problems of the modern world. She lectured from the outdoor platforms of the Catholic Evidence Guild for 20 years. Her family has been prominent in English Catholic literature for three generations and her grandfather was one of the first members of the Oxford movement.
Friday, Feb. 10, Miss Ruby Spencer Lyon will bring her Continental Singers to Washington Hall. This group has appeared on several nation-wide radio programs. Their repertoire includes songs from light operas, operatic arias, and folk songs.
They will be followed on Feb. 14 and 15 by Mr. Gerhart Lardner who will lecture on the Iconography of the Medieval Popes.
Feb. 24 will bring a unique attraction to Notre Dame, the Continental Gypsy Ensemble, who, in full costume, will present program of Gypsy songs.
Mr. F. J. Sheed will appear here sometime in March, the date being tentatively set for March 1. Mr. Sheed will lecture on Mob Psychology.

DEBATE SQUAD OPENS AGAINST MARQUETTE
THE WEEK
By BILL DONNELLY
The varsity debaters mount the rostrum the first week in February to settle the opening arguments of the ’39 season with Marquette University. The same question that was booted about in the recent interhall championships will be discussed — Resolved: The United States should
Frank Parks
A holdover moves up.
cease using public funds for the purpose of stimulating business.
Frank Fitch, Al Funk and Frank Parks, holdovers from last season, give Coach William J. Coyne an experienced trio for “A” squad competition; and Milton Williams, sophomore from Elkhart, Ind., has been added to the first team. John Winter-meyer, Jerry Flynn, William Meiers and Tom Grady make up the “B” team.
After the Marquette fracas the Irish will rest until Feb. 24 when they go to Manchester College, North Manchester, for the state tournament. The next stop is the University of Iowa, March 3-4, and then the Irish wind up their road activities at Wisconsin, March 24.
The debaters from St. Ambrose, of Davenport, Iowa, invade the campus Feb. 26. William and Mary follows on March 9, and Dartmouth will be met in the final match, April 23.
Dates for additional matches with Florida and Cornell have not been announced. All home debates will be held in the auditorium of the Law Building.
"Scrip" Next Week
Scrip, campus literary quarterly, makes its second appearance of the schoolyear Jan. 20. “Freshmen sketches” will be used for the first time as an incentive for aspiring first year men.
Subtle Slap
It was one of the first practices after Christmas vacation and the track men weren’t in shape yet. However, Nick had some of his half milers running three quarters of a mile against the watch and the pace that a few of the laggards were setting didn’t suit him at all. But instead of using that shiny new horse whip he got for Christmas, he just spoke to them gently and pleadingly as they came past him—“Take it easy, boys, and give the moss a change to grow.”
82 days until Easter vacation.
Bad Timing
The feeling of frustration in the story of Evangeline is far less poignant than that caused by the missed connections in this tragic tale. A close friend of ours received word from his St. Mary’s heart stimulant that she was to arrive at Niles on the Michigan Central at 7:30 last Sunday and that she -would be able to see him for a short while in South Bend at 8 o’clock that night. But when one is that way every minute away from the one is that way about seems approximately like 5000 years. (From all we’ve been hearing since we got back, there’s hardly a senior who wouldn’t be able to inform you on that subject). Our friend decided to save 150,000 years or so and he contrived the bright idea of meeting her at Niles at 7:30. He left school somewhere around 5:30 to make sure of catching the 6:30 bus from South Bend to Niles. He arrived at Niles at 7:05 and, as he proceeded to the station, he noticed a few shadowy female forms slip into a taxi and drive away. Qualms gripped him! When he rushed inside and asked what time the train was due, he knew his fears had been right for he was told that it had already arrived.
There were only two things he could do—take a taxi the ten miles or so to South Bend or wait 55 minutes for the 8 o’clock bus. He decided to wait for the bus and meanwhile he dabbled unsuccessfully in hitchhiking. At 8 o’clock he got the thought of asking a native if he were standing on the right comer to catch the bus, and he discovered that the bus takes a different road out of town on every alternate hour. He didn’t have time to get to the right corner and he had to take a taxi after all. There he sat muttering-incoherently to him-self about trains and busses and the misinformation his girl had given him and watching the meter click off dol
lars and cents. He arrived for his date twenty minutes — or rather 100,000 years—late and just as the girl was about to leave. He was all set to bawl her out for being early at Niles, but she beat him to the draw and began bawling him out for being late at South Bend. But soon true love had things patched up and now everything is serene and harmonious once again.
Top of the Week
The elimination of a serious culture lag in the dining hall—but unfortunately this is so good that we can’t be merely pithy or epigrammatic about it. All week fellows have been coming up to us and saying, “Of course you will give a big blow to the extra fork and spoon in the dining hall.” And all week we have been hearing the growing rumors about the table cloths, the finger bowls, and free cigars that are coming soon. It won’t be long they say, until we will come into the dining hall and request a table for twelve from the kowtowing head waiter, give our order, and then sit back and listen to the dinner music while we wait. Some day soon, we even hear, we actually are goiing to be served a really good meal.

Odds and Ends
A neighbor of ours in Walsh who had been awaiting the return of a St. Mary’s girl from the Christmas holidays found the following note slipped under his door—“Your girl will arrive at 5:15 New York Central tonight. Meet her and be good to her.” The note was signed by the hall custodian. ... We hear that the Kansas City club lost exactly 43 cents on . their Christmas dance__ What mad genius stole the lock right out of the front door of Walsh Hall and why did he do it?.... The Periscope, that radio colunmist who tries (unsuccessfully, of course) to scoop our best stories, changed his broadcast from 7:30 to 9 o’clock Wednesday nights because the competintion he was getting from the Tommy Dorsey program was making him 'waste his voice on the desert air. Now he discovers that he is competing with Kay Kyser’s “College of Musical Knowledge”.................... Those caps the football players are wearing were given to them by a firm supposedly interested in re-creating a cap-wearing fad among college students. But after seeing the fellows in the caps, we think that the whole thing is just an insidious plot to create the impression that Notre Dame football players look like gangsters.

WRANGLERS DISCUSS FREE SPEECH
•
Problems of free speech were discussed in great detail and with varying opinions by the Wranglers last Monday night after President Mahoney had finished with his talk on the subject. Said Mr. Mahoney, “The suppression of the right of free speech of any one faction would have dangerous possibilities, for it might lead to the suppression of all free speech.”
First giving the legal decisions on the free speech cases which have been

His opinions contested.
brought before the Supreme Court, Mahoney proceeded into a discussion of the church’s stand on the question. Not satisfied with merely covering the ground completely he then took up the activities of the Civil Liberties League (of which he approved) and of the Dies Committee (of which he approved partly).
But when the Wranglers took the floor to agree or disagree with the speaker the excitement really broke loose. Walt Johnson, Tom Grady, and Dave Withey, who were attending their first meeting as members of the club, -ran the gamut from complete suppression of free speech to absolute freedom. Opinion of most of the members present was that speech should be free in all phases, even though it was likely to lead to violence. Mayor Hague came in for due censure, as also did Mr. Dies, Father Coughlin, the Federal Radio Commission, Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin.
William McVay announced that at the next meeting of the club, next Tuesday night, he would attempt to show why the Standard Oil companies need more regulation.

COLLEGE PARADE
By FRED E. SISK
i_______________________________/
Third
According to a recent survey compiled by Dr. Raymond Walters, president of the University of Cincinnati, the Ball State Nezos informs us that Notre Dame has the third largest enrollment of Indiana colleges and universities. Dr. Walters’ figures include resident full-time, part-time and summer session students. In the survey Indiana University ranks first with 7,758 students, Purdue in second place with 7,590, Notre Dame third with 4,063, followed by Butler, Indiana State Teachers, and Ball State. On Nov. 1, 1938, when the survey was completed, 25,109 full-time students were under the influence of college education in Indiana.
One Seed, One Handful of Dirt, and One Cup of Water
Floriculturists. That’s what you might call the 300 students at Ohio State University who have recently enrolled in a florists’ course. A partial list of the subjects in the procedure is something like this: “Soil Sterilization,” “Gravel and Cinder Culture,” “Soil Testing,” and “Breeding of Lilies.”
If you believe that you would like to save money and grow your own corsages, register with the Ohio correspondence school, get a bucket of dirt, and the best of luck—but still think about buying a corsage.
To the Tune of “Trees”
I think that I shall never see A girl refuse a meal that’s free. A girl with hungry eyes not fixed Upon the drink that’s being mixed; A girl who doesn’t like to wear A lot of junk to match her hair; Girls are loved by guys like me— For who on earth zuould kiss a tree.
—West Point Pointer.
Hits and Misses in the “Parade”
At the University of Minnesota they have placed their golf links on an all year paying basis.... During the winter they have a ski course and toboggan slide over the eighteen holes .... A junior at the University of Nebraska has composed a vocabulary of bus drivers’ jargon.... Some of the terms include “gearjammer” which is a beginning bus driver, “laying the air” which refers to excessive blowing of the loud air horns, and “Cigaret special” which is a bus without passengers and thus gives the driver a chance to smoke while on duty.... Now translate: “A bewhiskered gear-jammer driving a cigaret special ventilated his motor while passing a wildcat.”

“Our readers will be happy to have news of Jacques Maritain. At the end of September, our eminent contributor left for an extended lecture tour in North America. He will return soon. Need it be said that the Americans and Canadians welcome him with the honors which they reserve for the most genuine representatives of France.
“But Maritain is not unknown to them. This is the fourth year that he has been invited to the University of Chicago, where Thomism is in great favor, due especially—it is just to note—to the distinguished professor, Mortimer Adler. This year, our friend went back to the New World accompanied by his wife and collaborator, Raissa Maritain. '
“He gave seven conferences in philosophy at Chicago before going to the University of Notre Dame, where he delivered a series of seven new conferences and presided at a two-day session of social studies.

This year the period after the Epiphany has four Sundays. The prevailing thought of the time is the divinity and the kingship of Christ. Three miraculous events, the coming of the Kings, the baptism of Christ, and the wedding at Cana, mark this Epiphany theme.
On the 18th comes the feast of St. Peter’s Chair at Rome recalling the supremacy of the chief of Apostles and, on the 25th is the Conversion of St. Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles. St. Paul the Hermit (15th) and St. Gregory, Abbot, (17th) lived a life of penance in the desert to the age of 112 and 105, respectively. St. Marcellus I (16th), Pope and Martyr, suffered in the last of the persecutions. St. Agnes, virgin and martyr (at the age of thirteen) has two feasts, (21st and 28th). Finally on Feb. 2nd we accompany Mary for the Presentation in the Temple; the feast is also called Candlemas.
Mass Calendar: January 15 to 21
According to an order by the Most Reverend Bishop the Collect Against Persecutors and Evil Doers from the section of the Missal Various Collects will be recited in the last place each day the rubrics permits.
Sunday 15 — Second after Epiphany. Semi-double. 2d prayer St. Paul the Hermit. 3d St. Maurus and against Persecutors and Evil Doers. Paul died 343, age 112. Maurus brought the rule of St. Benedict to Gaul, died 584.
J. J. O'Brien Gives Fellowship in Metallurgy; Provides Facilities for Post-Graduate Research
Metallurgical research at Notre Dame gains impetus with the announcement of the establishment of a fellowship in metallurgy and allied sciences through the generous gift of §15,000 from Mr. J. J. O’Brien, South Bend industrialist and civic leader, president of the South Bend Lathe Co.
In announcing the new foundation, Rev. J. Hugh O’Donnell, C.S.C., T6, vice-president and acting president of the University, said that Mr. O’Brien’s gift is in the form of a joint benefaction which will be designated as “The Miles and John J. O’Brien Fellowship in Metallurgy and Allied Sciences.”
Both Interested in N.D.
In addition to his own interest of long standing in Notre Dame, Mr. O’Brien’s gift commemorates his twin brother, the late Miles O’Brien, charter member of the Board of Lay Trustees of the University, and treasurer of that group at the time of his death in 1936. The O’Brien brothers have long been civic leaders. They developed the South Bend Lathe Co. into one of the city’s outstanding industries. Their close physical resemblance was shared in a common interest in the business they founded, in the city in which they lived, and in broad cultural interests which drew
them in to the inner circle of friends of Notre Dame.
The Fellowship provides funds for the pursuit of post-graduate study and research by men who intend to devote themselves to a life of teaching. Scholarship recipients, to be named annually, will be selected on the basis of proven ability, character, and financial need.
Father O’Donnell’s announcement said: “The University acknowledges this gift with pleasure and gratitiude. The late Miles O’Brien was a charter member of our Board of Lay Trustees and served as treasurer of the Board until his death in 1936. His brother John has been a devoted and loyal friend for many years and has cooperated with the various administrations in the furtherance of plans for the greater Notre Dame.
“This benefaction will help materially in the promotion of research work now being conducted under the supervision of Dr. E. G. Mahin, head of the Department of Metallurgy.”
In view of this long record of friendship and service, the benefac- ' tion now given and acknowledged appears even more proper as a continuation and a perpetuation of the relations between the O’Brien brothers and the University of Notre Dame.
Monday 16—St. Marcellus I. Pope. Martyr. Semi - double. 2d prayer Blessed Virgin (after Christmas). 3d Church or Pope. 4th Against Persecutors and Evil Doers. Marcellus (died 309) defended the divinity of Christ against Arians.

"NEWS-TIMES” LOSES CIRCULATION FIGHT
The South Bend News-Times is dead! It happened on Dec. 27, 1938 after 85 years of continuous publication. Mr. Joseph Stephenson, editor and publisher, stated in a signed editorial that the paper had been losing money for seven years, and that 1938 circulation was about half of that of 1928.
The paper was ready to fold last summer, but Mr. Stephenson hoped that fall advertising would keep its head above water. Winter played a nasty trick, however, and didn’t come around till late. By that time further publication was impossible.
One hundred and fifty employees lost their jobs with the demise of the Neivs-Times, and efforts are being made to place them with Indianapolis and Chicago papers. The South Bend Tribune engaged several.
James Costin, sports editor, is not losing a trick and has made engagements “all over the country” to lecture on the 1938 Notre Dame football season. He came to South Bend from Pittsburgh four years ago.
The South Bend News-Times was the aftermath of the St. Joseph County Forum, started in 1853 by a man named Ariel Draper, and the merger in 1913 of the Neivs and the Times. Until 1932 the paper published both morning and evening editions, but since that time concentrated on three afternoon editions.
Mr. Stephenson plans to get the News-Times off his hands as quickly as possible and return to his job as president of the Conservative Life Insurance Company. The South Bend Tribune bought only the paper and metal of the dead News-Times.
Father O’Hara Seeks Exchange Students
The Rev. John F. O’Hara, C.S.C., president of the University, a member of the United States delegation to the recent Inter-American conference at Lima, Peru, is now visiting South American countries on a good will tour to stimulate student exchanges with the United States. Opening on Dec. 9, 1938, the Inter-American conferences closed on Dec. 26.
According to an article by Captain M. M. Corpening, Chicago Tribune South American correspondent who covered the Inter-American conference, Father O’Hara announced that Alfred M. Landon, Republican candidate for President in 1936, has become interested in the student exchange problem. Mr. Landon is planning to raise funds from private sources for encouraging this project.
Man About the Campus
By GRAHAM STARR
This man is literally “about the campus.” In fact he spent Christmas vacation here. Daniel Crysdale Sheedy, Snyder, N. Y., is senior manager of basketball, and so had to remain for the Northwestern and Cornell games. However, he seems to have enjoyed the vacation here, according to a picture run in the South Bend Tribune. Christmas eve
he was shown hanging up Yule decorations in his room for consolation.
Incidentally the photograph of the St. Mary’s girl about whom he is very serious was also in the picture. Paradoxically this enterprising young man is looking forward with much interest to a date in Detroit, Mich., March 7, when he will accompany the basketball team there.
One summer this Irishman with the wonderlust worked on a molasses •tanker en route to the tropics. Not to be outdone by gobs, he has a heart interest in almost every city from coast to coast.
Prominent in the Buffalo Club, Dan is classed as a “guy with a heart of gold” by many of his associates. Always looking for precedents to break or to establish, the collegian with the Fifth Avenue clothes wants to dwell in a “quadruple” next semester.
Very versatile, he made the “B” golf team last year, is author of last year’s “under the bed story,” imitated a screeching and wailing cat the greater part of his sophomore year in Morrissey, and is a bridge fanatic.
WALTON TAKES TAME DUCK SINGLE HANDED
By Ed Huston
Dillon Hall has always been a haven for strange folk. There is something about the Junior year that seems to bring out the worst in a man, and Dillon usually has a corner on freaks. Last year it was the man in the gold shirt, and the pet fancier who brought in a pig and a duck much to Father Ryan’s discomfiture. This year among others there is present one Walton J. Wuebbold, who has revived the old duck incident in all its traditional glory.
Now Walton is fond of guns and hunting. Pistols hang in clusters on the walls of his room, a shotgun is stacked in a corner, and shells of all sizes and shapes clutter his desk. One cold winter day, just before Christmas, Walton was tramping up and down the woods and vales looking for something to shoot. Just as he was ready to give up his quest, he spied a duck. He was so excited that he forgot to shoot. He started toward the duck expecting it to fly at any moment.
Tame or Wild Duck?
But the duck was a brave duck and held his ground firmly, giving Walton stare for stare. Finally, Walton got close enough to pick the duck up; he tucked it under his arm and trotted nonchalantly back to Dillon Hall claiming that he was the only hunter in America able to capture a duck without firing a shot.
Walton claimed that the duck was sick or frozen or something. We looked at the duck, and he didn’t look sick; he merely looked mad. He was mad because he bit our finger when we poked at him. He was just a nasty-tempered old duck.
The next day an Indian descended on the University claiming that some student had stolen his duck. Walton claimed that the duck was wild and belonged to him; the Indian claimed that the duck was tame and belonged to him. But the Indian waved a tomahawk and threatened a massacre, and so he won the argument. The last we saw of the duck Walton was supposedly carrying it back to the Indian, but we personally think that he sent it home and that the Wueb-bolds had duck for Christmas.
The “man who gets around” nearly lost an ankle last year when he was caught in a swinging door. Notwithstanding his defeat for the presidency of the junior class, the socialite often has a smile on his pleasant face.
His footseps may be filled by his brother Kenneth, of Cavanaugh.

ORCHESTRA CHOSEN FOR LAW BALL
VINCENTIANS
By RICHARD LEO FALLON. Jr.
Princeton and Mars
Although several months have passed since Wisconsin - bred Orson Welles played Frankenstein -with the American public over CBS wires, his Mercury Theatre adaptation of H. G. Welles’ book, “The War of the Worlds,” still seems to have a para-tytic grip on some individuals.
Reeently Princeton University announced that the General Education Board of New York City had granted S3,000 for a university radio project to study Welles’ ether scare. President Harold W. Dodds said the investigation will be confined to the educational aspect of the situation, leading to “first, a determination of the general extent and nature of the public reaction to the broadcast; second, the social-psychological reasons for this reaction in various types of individuals.”
That Shakespearean stream - liner Welles sponsored a swell invasion from Mars is obvious. To date he has effected the following: Analyses of his work by sociologists, psychologists, political commentators, Army and Navy officials, diplomats, radio and munitions experts, Winchell, and fathers and mothers; an investigation by the Federal Communications Commission; a commercial program sponsored by a soup company; and a permanent mast-head in all papers as the man from Mars.
These overwhelming results should answer the “extent and nature of the public reaction” for Princeton’s project. As for the social-psychological reasons for the reaction to the broadcast, it seems a very final confirmation of the rumor that the average listener has an adolescent intellect!! Or, he doesn’t listen to his radio . . . it’s just a handy gadget in the house! But it scares him at times.
“Encyclopedias” for Announcers
Municipally owned Station WNYC of New York now demands that prospective announcers pass its own civil service exam prefaced with the foreboding quote, “A WNYC announcer must be more than a voice.” According to the New York Times, the questions he must answer are evidence that he must be a “walking encyclopedia.” We concur unanimously with the gentlement from WNYC that announcers must be more than voices, but why demand of them an encyclopedic mind when no announcer can say anything on an important program that hasn’t been composed by continuity writers, checked by stenographers, and okayed by some very illiterate sponsors!
Bill Fryar and his popular musical organization will supply the music for the annual Law Ball which is to be held in the Palais Royale, Friday evening, Feb. 10, Theodore “Ted” Prekowitz, general chairman, announced this week.
Now filling a Chicago engagement for M.C.A., Fryar’s band entertains a high ranking among the dance orchestras of the Middle West, Prekowitz declared.
The Law Ball, the traditional event on the social calendar of the College of Law, will mark the opening of the Notre Dame 1939 social season as well as the first time in history that sophomores were accorded the same privileges as juniors, seniors, graduate students, and law students to attend.

The old manager is back.
As is customary the lawyers’ formal will be held between the hours of 9 and 12 o’clock, with permissions till 1 a.m. Bids are $2.50, Prekowitz announced.
Committees appointed for the Ball by Stewart Roche, president of the Law club, are as follows:
Ticket committee: Samuel C. Bor-zilleri, chairman; Patrons committee: John A. Cain, chairman.

You must have felt it at Christmas, particularly you who gave so generously in the clothes drive. There’s a certain joy in giving that we all know, but, aside from this, we like to have our gift appreciated. In the St. Vincent de Paul work, which is carried on secretly to a great extent, it is often impossible to derive direct response from the one helped. However, there is a story of a youngster who was aided in one of the South Bend parishes that gives us some idea of the good we can do and of the gratitude of the recipient in this work.
Johnny Kept the Promise
The little fellow wanted a wagon very much this Christmas. He asked his parents to please have Santa Claus bring him one, but they said that Santa was poor this year and that a wagon was too much to expect. Young Johnny had heard from the Sisters in school that if we ask God for anything that is good for our souls, He will give it to us. So Johnny trotted off to church and up to the crib where he prayed for his wagon. It did come, and Johnny was very, very grateful.
On Christmas Day a young married couple visited the crib and were shocked to find that the Infant was missing. They hastened to tell the pastor, who thinking that they had some problem of their new married state to talk over, smiled as they came into the rectory. But when he heard that the Infant was gone, he dashed out into the street, and what should he see but Johnny pulling his wagon around with the Infant in it! The poor boy was asked if he didn’t know that it was a sacrilege to take things from church, and his simple reply was that he had made a promise at the Crib that if he got the wagon, he would ride God around the block — twice!
Of interest to local coneference members is the news that volunteers are to speak in South Bend’s Central Catholic High School in an attempt to stir up interest and bring younger groups into parish work.
Old clothes collected from now on will be kept for distribution in a house owned by St. Patrick’s parish. Previously, they were handled through the Salvation Army. It was able to offer repair facilities, and to extend credit to the Society so that a man might go down and pick out what he needed. Now needy persons will be taken to the house to be outfitted.

CHICAGO CONCLAVE HEARS FLYNN PAPER
WHAT GOES ON WHEN WE GET OFF?
On Dec. 26, 1938, the American Catholic Sociological Association held its first general convention in Chicago. The convention lasted three days, and was attended by Mr. Frank T. Flynn and Rev. Raymond D. Murray, C.S.C., of the department of sociology. Father Murray was elected president of the society. Mr. Flynn presented a paper on “Aspects in the Evolution of the Social Problems Course.”
Mr. Flynn distinguished between “Catholic and secular attitudes toward social problems.” The secular
Mk. Frank T. Flynn Sociology for Sociologists
sociologist considers that “what is done is good simply because it is done. The pragmatic sociologist concludes that there are no objective standards of morality; conscience, free will, and the soul are not objectively apparent to the senses and, therefore, they deserve no consideration from the social scientist. Utilizing these concepts, the breakdown of monogamy, the myopic programs of sterilization, and the propaganda for euthanasia are called reforms, rath-ther than violations of fixed ethical principles. Since true reform presumes goals, and goals cannot exist without values, the denial of moral criteria represents an evasive philosophy.”
But Mr. Flynn also had praise for some of the work of the secular sociologist, especially those who “viewed many problems objectively, examined component elements of social relations, tore away the fabric of deceit designed by predatory interests as a concealment of many abuses, and obtained valuable data through competent surveys and exhaustive observation.” These secularists wrote textbooks recently which groped for objective standards, segregated social problems into different categories, and

Theatres, Stores Feel Vacation Effects
•
What happens to campus and South Bend business when 2,500 students leave for vacation? Downtown theatre managers estimated their total attendance dropped by a thousand the first week-end of the holidays; soft drink sales at the corner drugstores were off 50%; and the Notre Dame trolley car bounced down the long stretch by the parking-lot, empty. At “Rosie’s” 2,000 yards of spaghetti went to waste the first Friday night.
On campus, the Brothers stood idle behind the Bookstore counter; the Dining Halls were shut tight; there was no huddle in “The Huddle.” Only the Cafeteria maintained a businesslike atmosphere. A skeleton force kept the steam tables warm for the few professors and students that remained. ... but there was no lineup at the hamburger-stand in the evenings.
It was room-cleaning time in the residence halls. Maids and janitors dusted neglected corners, checked screens, plumbing, heating and electric wiring. Watchmen put their sign-in books away and forgot the cold tramps from hall to hall.
The postoffice worked full time. There was the flow of faculty cards to be delivered, and stray student cards were re-directed to home addresses. Daily newspapers—two weeks of them—were sorted and held for after-holiday delivery.
Jim MacAlis'ter stayed on the job in the gym, checking equipment for the basketball team, and sorting shoulder-pads, pants, jerseys, socks and shoes for spring football practice. Don’t tell him there was a vacation!
RESOLUTION
“The medals and money prizes listed in the University ‘BULLETIN’ may be won only by undergraduate students during the eight semesters of their undergraduate work, unless the University ‘BULLETIN1 in the description of any award specifically states otherwise. Students of any graduate department of the University and of the College of Law who have completed eight semesters of undergraduate courses at Notre Dame or elsewhere, whether a bachelor’s degree has been conferred or not, are ineligible to receive these awards.”
Students Scattered Bv Holidav Season
At precisely 4:15 o’clock Wednesday afternoon, Dec. 21, Joe Miller opened the front door at 828 East Sorin Street, tossed his books under the sofa and sat down. A few minutes later in Detroit Jim Cleary was getting out of a car at 2484 Boston Blvd. Both were home for Christmas vacation. Joe walked; Jim took the 2 o’clock plane from the airport.

got out of a taxi at 2730 S. 54th St., Tacoma, Washington — the last man home for Christmas after a transcontinental trip via South Shore electric, streamliner, and taxi.
A few seniors managed to get home ahead of Joe Miller, by cutting the last week of classes, i.e., John Gregory Shortall of Dallas, Texas. John got home Dec. 16, made a few social calls, and promptly acquired a mild attack of diphtheria. Moral: Cheaters never win.
What happens? Fred Digby lolled in the Sugar Bowl sunshine on New Year’s Day and watched Texas Christiaan strafe Carnegie Tech; George Neumann listened to the proceeding in Chicago while his aunt gave him a whipping at Chinese Checkers. Bob Hoag was skiing on a fine crust of Toronto snow, and Vince Mead was diving into the warm waters at Ponte Vide Beach, Florida. Later that night Jack McGovern was directing Tommy Tucker’s band and guests of the Pittsburgh Club assembled at the Field Club through an energetic rendition of the “Victory March.” Our spies report that President McGovern’s rah-rah-rah between the intro duction and the chorus was heard on the top of the Gulf Building in downtown Pittsburgh.
The Metropolitan Club captured all honors for group travel. Four special cars of the Commodore Vanderbilt carried the New Yorkers.

NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC
AGED NUN DIES ON CHRISTMAS EVE
Biology Building Modern in Design & Equipment;
Botany, Biology Libraries, Machine Shop Feature
By Jim O’Donohoe
Sister Mary Bernadette, C.S.C., died at Holy Cross Convent Christmas eve. Notre Dame lost one of her most devout workers for God. A member of the Congregation of Holy Cross for over 60 years, Sister Bernadette became almost a tradition among the religious of the campus before she passed into eternity in her 77th year.
Catherine Franciscus was born in Minnesota in 1862. Youngest member of a large family, she lived in a strong Catholic influence, and learned to love her relatives with unusually deep tenderness.
In 1878 she received the holy habit and was professed to the order in 1882 with the religous name, Mary Bernadette. Two other members of her family also entered the religious life, a cousin, Father Peter Franciscus, C.S.C., and a sister, also a member of the Congregation of Holy Cross, both deceased.
After coming to the Notre Dame campus, it was the duty of Sister Bernadette to bake the altar breads for the various chapels of the campus, a position she devoutly held for 50 years.
Besides her baking task, she was connected with the Ave Maria staff, in the folding room. During her last year, she also folded handkerchiefs in the laundry at her own insistence.
According to the Sister General of the local community house, a close friend of the deceased, Sister Bernadette never asked for permission to visit her family whom she loved so well, and never seemed to show any emotion if any of them came to see her. The Jan. 6 issue of the Religious Bulletin revealed that the cause for this was a vow she made in her early life never to re-visit her home hoping it would please God to grant her brothers and sisters whom she left behind the favor of dying in the state of grace.
In recent years one of her greatest concerns was the fear of becoming blind. She repeatedly told the sisters of the order of this fear, saying that she prayed daily that God would grant her the grace of her sight until her death so she could continue to work for him. Even to her last days on earth, she painted stoles and burses and presented them to different priests for use on the altar.
She died, fortified by the Holy Sacraments, on the eve of the Nativity of Our Lord, for whom she spent her entire life, a great reward for her untiring work.
In the northeast corner of the campus stands one of the most modern of the University buildings — Biology. Built of light tan brick, the liberal use of glass in its front gives it a strikingly different appearance. And this difference is not only superficial, for it has been especially designed for the work carried on in it.
All pipes, save those used for ventilation, are run through a tunnel, the floors, and the outer walls. Thus when it becomes necessary to enlarge a room there is no need to cut and reroute water, heat, and gas pipes. Access to this tunnel in case of repairs is gained through well-placed trapdoors.
Laboratories Specially Designed
The beams in the ceiling are placed at ten foot intervals so that if it is desired to divide a room it is only necessary to put up a brick partition. This facility has already been used in making separate labs for the graduate students.
The Photomicrographic and Mi-crological laboratory is located in a vibration-proof room. All switches and lights in this room are waterproof. The table used for experiments is set on a 20 ton concrete block which runs about 18 feet into the earth and is entirely independent of the rest of the foundation. Micro
Biology Building’s Pet Shop Cages for living test-tubes.
scopes used in experiments on this table are mounted on rubber pads.
Many of the features of the laboratories have been especially designed for this building. Table tops on which experiments are conducted are made of pressed wood which are screwed on and when stained may be taken out and replaced at very low cost. Tables in laboratories where dissection is carried on are built with drains so that they may be washed by merely turning a hose on them.
Practicality in Construction
There are rooms devoted entirely to incubators for the care of cultures of bacteria. These incubators at first glance appear to be ordinary refrigerators but they have a special unit for heating built into them. The Building has its own Biology and Botany libraries and even has a complete machine-shop for the manufacture of simple instruments.
To such an extent has the theme of practicality of construction been carried that even the cornerstone has its scientific purpose. Instead of filling it with the usual documents and newspaper clippings several tubes of bacteria have been placed in it along with a sheet of instruction. Some day a scientist of the distant future will open that block and complete the experiment by finding whether the bac--teria have survived the test of time.

MUSIC NOTES
By WILLIAM MOONEY
>
As young countries struggle for an economic foothold, very little attention is given to the cultural aspects as compared to industrial and agricultural interests. Such has been the case in America. There was a time when we lagged far behind Europe both in the creation and presentation of good music. But America is no longer an infant nation, and the question arises, “Have we established ourselves musically on a par with other nations?” Patriotic authorities are united in answering “Yes.”
European composition has been largely based on folk-music. America, we are told, is also rich in folkmusic, and proof is shown in Indian, Negro, cowboy, and hillbilly music. But can this type of music be honestly classed as folk-music? This is a debatable question which, for the present, I will deny.
Genuine folk-music has no definitely traceable origin. It is legendary — passed from generation to generation, changed, increased, strengthened. This cannot be said of Indian music, which bears none of the necessary immortal tunefulness, and which is based merely on savage, unstabilized rhythms. It is true that we recognize certain melodies as being Indian tunes, but this style has been evolved by composers and not by the Indians themselves.
Likewise, the Negroes have no music of their own. Their rhythms and dances appealed to such men as Stephen Foster and R. Nathaniel Dett who added melodies and words appropriate to the Negro mode of living.
This is not folk-music and will never serve as a basis for symphonic development. The attempts which have been made have been mostly unsuccessful. Powell’s “Negro Rhapsody” is an exception.
Yet, in one sense, this music must be considered definitely American. From these melodies have come new rhythms and harmonies which can be found nowhere outside of America. But even so, is this music typical of America as it is today? I think swing does a much better job.
We then begin to wonder how contemporary American composers compare with composers now living in Europe. We have no composers as great as Richard Strauss or Sibelius. Yet no European opera of recent years surpasses Deems Taylor’s “Peter Ibbetson.” And what modern European composition is more truly national than George Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue”
Leonard Liebling, writing in Radio Guide, has this to say: “Ragtime, jazz, blues, and even swing made the world listen and like, and not only did our
better composers utilize the novel idiom in their serious opuses, but European borrowed it and tried — most unsuccessfully to incorporate it into their own writings.”
America no longer merely reflects Europe in its musical thinking. We have composers of our own. If you are offended by Cole Porter (I don’t see how you truthfully can be) you will find comfort in other Americans such as Copeland, Taylor, Sowerby, and John Phillip Sousa.

Professor Stanley S. Sessler, director of the Department of Fine Arts, is exhibiting a number of paintings and portrait drawings in the west room on the top floor of the University Library. The exhibition will continue through January 24th.

of still life settings. Professor Sessler is particularly impressive in tins type of work. The very first painting to greet the eye will be familiar to anyone who has visited the Wightman Memorial Galleries, for it has a permanent place there at the head of the stairs.
It is a beautifully rendered flower group with a large blue vase the most impressive feature in the foreground. This painting is one of Prof. Sessler’s finest. achievements. The other still life paintings are all excellent pieces but, in our opinion they are overshadowed by the quiet impressiveness of this particularly fine work.
Professor Sessler’s portrait drawing are the outstanding attraction of his exhibition. Each drawing is so very life-like, so skillfully executed that the observer is able to find new enjoyment as he progresses from drawing to drawing. Among these portraits one will find the familiar faces of Professors Francis S. Ackermann, Earl F. Langwell, John A. Scannell and Henry Staunton, all of the University faculty.

THEATRE
By R. J. SADDER
\_____________________________>
We have always had an ambition to write a column on the “legitimate theatah” and now when the opportunity arises we don’t know where to begin. As a start, we will set down our impressions of several plays currently enjoying success on Broadway.
A word about “Hellzapoppin,” the screamlined hit that has all New York laughing: nothing but an elongated vaudevillerevue, it is the nuttiest show ever to be presented on Broadway. “Hellzapoppin” runs the gamut of laughter from a grin to a roar.
Opening up with a newsreel which contains boosts for the show by Hitler in Yiddish, Mussolini in Ethiopian, and F. D. R. in his own inimitable way, every act that ever was a • holdover at the Palace is presented. Using black-outs, stooges in the audience, fair skits and fair ensemble numbers, the show runs its merry way. We give you our word that when the curtain came down after the grand finale, we knew that if we did nothing else for the rest of our vacation, we DID have a MERRY Christmas.
From the ridiculous to the sublime, (we know that’s trite) the following night we had the extreme pleasure of sitting through five hours of Maurice Evans’ uncut version of “Hamlet.” We had read all the rave notices and we expected a great deal. Our expectations were fulfilled. The acting was superb. The settings by Jo Miel-ziner were excellent. The supper (Mr. E. gives the audience 40 minutes between the second and third acts for dinner) was darn good, too.
The third show we saw was “What a Life.” Ezra Stone plays the lead of a misunderstood and highly victimized high school student. Not having too much comedy appeal of itself, Mr. Stone brightens the show by overplaying his part and “reaching” for his laughs. The whole company catches this spirit and make a hilarious laugh fest out of what might have been just a passable night’s entertainment.
About the University Theatre: The players are just a little proud today. Remember during the holidays how many “names” played Scrooge via the airwaves. Orson Welles and Lionel Barrymore were two outstanding personages of the theatre who created • the roles. Notre Dame had its Scrooge, too. Out of station W8XWJ from Detroit, Vernon Witkowski brought to life the old miser for many Mid-west listeners. Congratulations Vern, although we did not have a chance to hear the broadcast, we know you did a swell job of it.

Catholic Spirit
WE CATHOLICS are always insisting upon a revival of the Catholic spirit. We can see the solution to many of the great problems of our time in a return to the Catholic tradition. Catholics write many books on the vital effects the Catholic spirit would have on the social and political diseases of our time. These are important and good books, and the revival of a truly Catholic spirit is necessary in all fields. But, as Catholics, we should become increasingly conscious that the central problem is—to use a phrase of Romano Guardini’s—to bring the Church “to life in the souls of men.”
Above all, we must not plead for a return to the Catholic spirit merely as a social cure-all, as a solution to the problems of nationalism or industrialism, materialism or individualism. Surely, most of our problems would vanish in a really Catholic culture; but, the Catholic knows that his destiny is not in the Kingdom of this World. Contrariwisely, we know that the things of this world are to be given their proper place in our hierarchy of values. But we must insist that the Kingdom of this
 NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC
World be subordinated to the Kingdom of God. We must not go to God for the sake of the World; we must go to Him for His own sake. We should not adopt that community spirit which flows from the Mystical Body merely because such a spirit would bring about social justice, but because such a spirit is a true manifestation of the Divine Will. We must not turn to the Church merely because so many of the great intellectuals of our time have found eternal truth in her; we must not return to the Church just because she has a beautiful liturgy which appeals to our aesthetic sense; we must not turn to the Church for any other reason than that She is the expression of the Father’s Will through the Incarnation. The Church is more than a basis for a just social structure, more than a philosophy of life.
The truth will surely make us free: not truth for the sake of our aesthetic sense or our sense of social justice, but truth because it is God’s truth and the way to the Beatific Vision. From Him all things flow.
—Robert B. Heywood.
A Mass Gesture
OME ten years ago, the Student Activities Council sponsored the first University Boxing tournament. It grew out of the need for organized indoor athletics
during the long winter months. And it helped supply something that was to a certain extent lacking in those days.
Two years later, the Scholastic assumed the sponsorship of the tournament, and officially designated it as the Bengal Bouts, a name which has remained to the present time. Thus this tourney came to have a double function, that of providing an organized indoor sport, as well as that of helping support the Holy Cross missions in Bengal. No longer is there the lack of indoor sports for the boxing tournament to fill. But, in spite of this, the Bouts are still functional. For they still provide much needed support for the Bengal Missions.
Soon the Scholastic will announce the eighth annual Bengal Bouts. We hope that they will surpass last year’s Bouts just as each succeeding tourney has surpassed its predecessors since the series began.
But we need help—help that you should be willing to give. Naturally, without fighters there would be no fights. So those of you who are interested in the Bouts from that point of view will be most welcome.
For the great mass of you, however, the biggest thing you can give will be support. And you should be more than willing to give that because the Bouts provide excellent entertainment, worth every cent you pay. But further, they function as a mass gesture of the student body of the University in recognition of the labor and sacrifice of those members of the Congregation of Holy Cross who are giving their lives to spread the Faith in far-off India.
We have no reason to fear that you will fail us this year. But you may get tired of hearing about the Bengal Bouts before they are over. If you begin to feel that way, please bear with us, because we are trying to reach every student, so that this may truly be regarded as a mass gesture.
Watch the Scholastic in the near future for specific details of the eighth annual Bengal Bouts.

Among the Magazines
By JOHN J. DEANE
The upper-bracket magazines are all aflutter. Of course, some magazines, e.g., The New Republic, are always aflutter, but that is usual for them. It is when staid vehicles such as Harpers, Atlantic Monthly, and The Forum begin to “view with alarm” that we know something is in the wind. It is, course, the European situation. Apparently, there wasn’t much else to discuss for we found little else but discussions of the situation in these magazines. It is good to know of these political peccadilloes, but, frankly, after three or four like articles, we found the reading a little tiresome.
The January issue of Harpers with Eliot Janeway’s “England Moves Toward Fascism,” sounds the characteristic tocsin to the democracies of the New and Old World, though, we think, it is somewhat overblown. Mr. Janeway accuses the British of having let us (the democracies) down when he says, “The front of France and Russia against Hitler, the only force in Europe which could effectively oppose him, has been blasted open, to the immense detriment of both agreeing parties, but to the comfort of Hitler — by England.” Furthermore, he sees England herself undergoing a change, if not in sentiment, at least in policy. New forces are building a new’ England, and are, according to Mr. Janeway, directly traceable to the British program of rearmament.
Thus it is that the British people, some at least, will, through the increased burden of taxation because of rearmament and resultant national economic decline, look to a philosophy which will increase the national income, i.e., productivity, and at the same time divert a substantially larger proportion of it to the coffers of the state. That philosophy, -written large across the face of many a Euro- pean nation, is totalitarianism. Indeed some have thought of it already, and are quite eager to drop “the England of our dreams” in favor of Fascism.
But, says Mr. Janeway, let the English gentlemen who have set Britain on this totalitarian course ask themselves two questions: First, if economic Fascism really wins in England, can the political trappings of
Fascism fail to follow? And second, can the present holders of political power hope to control such an England -without going under themselves before the gangsters and fanatics who would spring up in such a setting? Whatever the best people may think and say at their week-end parties, Fascism is not an affair of the best people. Mr. Janeway presents a well-written argument and a plausible one until we remember the English people, their traditions, and their great love for that tight little island. Ultimately, it is what the people want done that is done, not what the leaders decree. The English could hardly reconcile themselves to a thing that they think is totally lacking in culture, and, to the English, Fascism is the philosophy of the “poor benighted heathen.”
In the same issue of Harpers we ran across the style of Edgar Allen Poe in a rather incongruous setting, “The Blackest Night,” by Eugene and Arline Lohrke. The piece was intended to be dismal; it succeeeded in form, but failed in tone. The time was Sept. 27 to 30, 1938 when England and Germany were so very near war. The authors were in a Sussex village, sitting around the fire of the farmhouse and talking with friends on indifferent topics. “Every once in a while a silence would come over the conversation, a silence that seemed to plumb the depths of the gathering tension and horror, that was marked by a slight nervous gesture, a flutter of the hands, a sudden movement of the head.” Always, it seemed, rain was falling (it is a neat psychological trick to cast the setting in gray clouds and rain because these things of themselves are depressing, so at the outset the author doesn’t have to work quite so hard) and everyone was just on the verge of hysteria. We thought the article was written for effect and not sincerity; we were certain, reading the lines, “The trenches, blocked-out, orderly, deep-set, strong, that had crowded across the whole of Flanders and Picardy, had come to London.” However, it did strike a note of humor saying, “most of the soldiers—territorials—looked as military as a box of brown lead pencils.”
Harpers, in “The Bacons and the Hazards,” by Leonard Bacon, offers
a case in point for those sociological protagonists of heredity and environment. These families, of whose conjunction the author is a fruition, were, to put it mildly, amazing. He says with greatest sincerity (and complete braggadocio) that he has never known a man of greater interest and variety than his father, and he has a right to judge having known a tremendous number of the most interesting men of his time. His mother (Oh, multiplication of wonders) vras beautiful in her person but still more so in her nature and mind.
And thus the story goes, a lucubration on the virtues of the Bacon and Hazard families, and in all the long telling there pops out not once the tale of a vice. Though we are as staunch a supporter of family pride as the next, it seems rather bad taste to shout openly about one’s forebears. Membership in a good family is, per se, a poor pass-key to recognition, let alone achievement, in this individualistic world of today. In short, Boston’s Back Bay and Shantytown start from scratch in the ultimate analysis.
“From Dream to Fiction” by Bernard de Voto, in Harpers for January, entertainingly explodes the popular conception of a novelist. He is not one who is much more observant than we, he is not one who is exquisitely sensitive to human relationships. On the contrary, says Mr. de Voto, the novelist is a slender and hypochondriac man, who lives quite apart from the realities of his books. But in each novel the author projects his ideal, doom earned or avoided, desire fulfilled or unfilled. Many go no further than that, but the mature novelist breaks away from a mere literary realization of his dream and makes it conform to the realities revealed and tempered by experience. Then it is that the novel becomes an achievement of maturity, a place where its writer can be altogether grown up, a place where a reader may put away childish things altogether and be what he will never be outside of fiction, a whole man.

NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC
We offer you the better ones, though some may think it too great an extension of distinction to choose the better from the best.
“Symphony,” by Louis J. Sanker, has no equal among the poems presented for the beauty of its sound. The lines run smoothly, surging and
resurging in a cadence that is very pleasant.
“Rain in the Woods,” by Mrs. Grace Noll Crowell is rich in imagery and sensient phrases, and in these has its chief appeal. We can feel and smell the picture of the woods as the poem paints it.
“Ordination,” by Sister Mary Immaculate, C.S.C. appeals more to the-intellect than to the emotions chiefly because it deals with a serious sub-■ ject. Although it scorns the use of imagery and the usual emotionarousing implements it succeeds very-well because the ideas carry of themselves a great deal of emotion.
From Berlin . . ..
Berlin-Schmargendorf Borkumerstr. 16
Dec. 3, 1938
Dear Father,
It has taken me all this time to completely adjust and orientate myself to Berlin. I didn’t dare write you before I was my normal self. My second and third weeks were something of a nightmare. I was sick, running a fever, sore throat and the like.
God in His kindness has provided the means for me to continue the noblest and grandest of Notre Dame traditions and customs — daily Mass and Communion. St. Hedwig’s, Berlin’s largest Catholic Church, adjoins the University and almost every morning I attend Mass and receive Holy Communion. Though I have often been away from home, never before did I experience such lonesomeness and homesickness. My one consolation was Mass and Communion — I came through the trying period and now am really plunged deeply in my work.
Whether I will be able to receive my Doctor’s degree by June, 1940 still remains undecided. By that time I will have the necessary semesters — six — but the subject of my thesis is a real problem. To find a thesis concerning which no one, as yet, has written anything is not so easy. Fortunately I have met several professors who have helped and will help me immensely. Do you recall the German architect, Paul Linder, who visited Notre Dame early last spring? I met him then, and since arriving here in Berlin he has invited me to his home for supper several times. He is certainly enthusiastic about Notre Dame, having felt that peculiar “spirit” which hovers over our lovely campus. He wishes to be remembered to you, and to thank you again for the kindness and hospitality extended him. He introduced me to several other prominent and influential men, one of them a professor under whom I
am now studying. All have invited me to their homes, where I have spent several absorbing evenings. To meet such men is a pleasure, because all have travelled abroad and know that there are two sides to every story.
At the moment I am preparing myself for my “referat” to be given immediately after Christmas. When one is a member of a “seminar,” sometime during the course of the semester he must give a 45 minute talk on some detailed subject, which usually requires a good deal of research. My referat concerns the influence of Donatello’s trip to Rome on his art (1430). I find the work intensiely interesting. You may recall that one of my reasons for coming to Berlin is to study under Dr. Pinder. He is all and more than I had expected. When he lectures the classroom is literally packed. This semester he is lecturing on “German Art in the Days of Durer.” I am also a member of his seminar, but as yet I have not been assigned a “referat.” Other classes are “Donatello” and the above mentioned seminar; the “Hellenistic Art” and a seminar concerning the “Parthenon,” a lecture on the “Music of Bach’s Time,” and a seminar on “The General Development of Music.” Since I will really need my Latin I have arranged with a German student to take “exchange lessons” with him. He will help me brush up my Latin; I will help him with English. Evenings at home I continue with my French. •
Socially I do very little, using my pocket money for opera, concerts and the theatre. To date I have heard two magnificent concerts, one directed by “the director of German’s Furtwangler”; operas •— Lohengrin, Tristan and Isolde, Rheingold; theatre— the German classic comedy by Lessing, “Minna von Barnhelm.” Another fascinating sideline is the official student choir. Here we devote
all our time to the works of the old masters, mostly those who lived before Bach. Tonight at 8 o’clock we are giving our first public concert. All in all you can see that I am kept busy every moment of the day.
My living quarters are excellent — located in one of the finer suburbs. I have a commutation ticket for the “Stadtbahn” — comparable to the-I. C. of Chicago. I make a few sandwiches at home, take them with, me for my breakfast and afternoon lunch. In general Berlin is much more expensive than I had planned.
Well, Father, this completes the news for the time being. You can well understand how busy I am writing letters home. I would appreciate it very much then, Father, if you would sort of “round robin” this letter. It is almost impossible to write to each individual and I know you well understand how busy I am writ-a letter to each of my friends at N.D.
Congratulations to the team — 8; straight. Tuesday I will get the Paris edition of the Herald-Tribune for the score of the S. Cal-N.D. game. How I hope we win!
My aunt sends me every month the Religious Bulletins. I can’t tell you how I cherish that contact -with N.D. She also sends me the Alumnus. It sure feels good to know what the other fellows are doing and just where they are doing it. Notre Dame means everything to me, and every little contact means a lot to me. I am sincerely trying to live up to the standards of a real Notre Dame man, and I always say with a quiet pride that I am a graduate of Our Lady’s University.
Let me thank you again, Father, sincerely and deeply for all that you have done for me. Your confidence in me gives me much strength to plug on and on — ahead.
Gratefully,
Bob Mullen.

THE WEEK IN SPORTS
NICKMEN PREP FOR INDIANA MEET
IRISH PLAY AT KENTUCKY TOMORROW NIGHT; HOST TO WESTERN RESERVE ON MONDAY
By Pete Sheehan
It may have been the weather or he might not have felt good but Coach Nicholson spoke gloomily about his prospects for this year’s track season. “We’ve lost 45% of last year’s points and unless Joe Obrys’ leg improves there won’t be one point added to the remainder of last year’s squad.”
Nick began to consider each event separately and each one revealed a little more sunshine to brighten his apparent hopelessness. The sprints are problematical but will be handled by four dashmen, headed by last year’s star, Steve Coughlin, who as yet has not found his stride indoors. Hank Halpin is developing in the 440 and Hestor brings a gleam into Nick’s eye when he steps out in the half. When he mentioned the distance runs, Nick’s chest expanded and a look of relief came over his face. Captain Greg Rice, Steve Szuma-chowski, John Martin, and Bill Donnelly make the mile and two mile the team’s strongest events. Coach Nicholson has hopes that Bob Lawrence and Dave Reddy will continue their improvement in the hurdles. In contrast to last year’s “flock of vault flyers” Dean will be N.D.’s lone hope. Ted Leonas promises great things if he can pick up at his 6' 5" high jumping of last year. The weight events will be handled by Ed Beinor and Bill Faymonville, who will be back for next semester’s meets. All semblance of hope faded when Nick mentioned relays. “We just don’t have any,” he said.
The first meet, Jan. 30, with Indiana is giving Nick his worries. “We beat them last year and they won the year before. I guess it’s the team that’s in shape earliest, and they are always in shape.” Indiana will come up here headed by two Big Ten stars in Trutt, a middle distance champ, and Harris, a weight man who showed real ability in his events last year.
At present Nick is trying to work the team into condition. With a number of the team losing out on practice due to “sun-down” classes, evening work-outs for those who miss regular sessions are being tried. Most of the practice conditioning but once a week the boys shoot the works with hopes for a place on the track when “the gun goes off.”
Gym busy again as Interhall League opens.
Inter hall Cage League Opens Sunday Morning
•
The Interhall Basketball League, organized into two divisions of eight teams each, gets under way Sunday morning at 9 o’clock.
The first group consists of Zahm, the Old Infirmary, Carroll, St. Edward’s, Cavanaugh, Brownson, Freshman, and Off-Campus. In the second group are Badin, Sorin, Dillon, Morrissey, Walsh, Lyons, Alumni, and Howard.
The curtain-raiser Sunday morning at 9 o’clock will see Freshman and Off-Campus in the first tilt. The rest of Sunday’s schedule follows: Cavanaugh vs. Brownson, 9:15; Carroll vs. St. Edward’s, 10:00; Zahm vs. Old Infirmary, 10:15. In Group II, Sorin vs. Morrissey, 1:30; Walsh vs. Morrissey, 1:30; Walsh vs. Howard, 1:45; Alumni vs. Lyons, 2:30; Dillon vs. Badin, 2:45.
The two groups will alternate in the time of play, one playing on Sunday morning one week and on Sunday afternoon, the next.
All teams have been practicing, and most of the players have "found their eye”; hence, a hot race is looked for in both groups.
The championship games will take place on March 5.
The Irish eagers will get a taste of that well known Southern hospitality tomorrow night when they invade the hills of Kentucky to meet the University of Kentucky Wildcats before a capacity crowd at Louisville. Monday night the boys will be back home to entertain Western Reserve University, the team which usually dominates Cleveland’s “Big Four,” and which will be seeking their initial win over a Keogan - coached team. A double victory for the Blue and Gold will mean their fourth consecutive victories over both of these foes.
Coach Adolph Rupp, who learned his basketball from one of the game’s masters — Phog Allen — is in his ninth season at the Southern institution and boasts of one of the most remarkable records in collegiate basketball circles. Prior to this campaign his teams had won 129 games while losing 27 which gives him an average of .827. Throughout his district the Wildcats have dominated the Southeastern Conference. Seven times they have won the conference crown and during six of these seasons they were undefeated in league competition.
This year Rupp is depending upon Captain Bernie Opper, all-conference guard, who comes from the neighborhood of the Yankee Stadium — the Bronx — and Marion Cluggish, giant genter who stands 6 feet 8 inches above the hardwood. The former will be expected to halt Eddie Riska who was so effective on offensive for the Irish early in the season. Stan Cluggish, little brother of Marion, who is six feet four inches tall, is also a star defensive player. During the past five seasons the Wildcats have dropped but four contests on their home court.
Western Reserve has not as yet tasted defeat from an Ohio foe, but has had little luck outside of the Buckeye State. Indiana, Duquesne, and Penn State defeated the ’Cats rather handily by taking early leads and remaining out in front throughout the remainder of the contest.
The Clevelanders are a fast, rangy quintet with Joe “Great” Scott as their high point man aided by such stars as Johnny Andrews, “Iggy” Blair and Johnny Reis. Scott holds the A.A.U. Decathlon championship.

NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC
DE LANDERO SKEPTICAL OF FENCERS' CHANCES GOPHERS, ILLINI SEEK
AGAINST BOILERMAKERS HERE TOMORROW TO REPEAT '38 WINS
By Joe Palmer
As it approached the beginning of the 1939 intercollegiate season, the Notre Dame varsity fencing team remained a distinct question mark today. The opening match will be held with the swordsmen from Purdue in the local gymnasium at 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 14, and after much head-scratching and trying to figure out what his varsity will have to offer, Coach de Landero has finally decided to sit back and wait for Saturday to bring the answer. The results of the mach should be quite indicative of what the team will be able to put forth since Purdue looms as one of the hardest foes on the Irish schedule.
The tournament for varsity men (to determine the “starting team”) was completed last Monday night and, judging from performances, it appears that the following will carry the Blue and Gold into the match on Saturday: Foil — McEnearney (senior), Gaither (sophomore), and Leis-ing (senior); Sabre: — Captain Scar-lata (senior), and Gavan (junior); Epee: — Colgan (senior), and Graham (senior).
Starters Tentative
According to Coach de Landero, he will attempt to use as many others as possible. He has indicated that Schlafly, Sayia, Smedley, Donovan, and O’Donnell will see action if any kind of opportunity presents itself. In other words, the starting line-up named is only tentative, and, if any substitute shows that he is capable, he will see action regularly.
In the course of the season, the Irish will take to the road four times. On Jan. 21, they meet Lawrence Tech, at Detroit. On Feb. 4, they will be the guests of the University of Detroit. Matches are scheduled on Feb. 17 and 18 with Ohio State and Cincinnati, respectively, at the schools named. Finally, on Feb. 25, the squad travels to Lafayette, Ind., to clash once more with Purdue.
The complete schedule for the 1939 season: Jan. 14 — Purdue at Notre Dame; Jan. 21 — Lawrence Tech at Detroit; Jan. 28 — Chicago at Notre Dame; Feb. 4 — Deroit at Detroit; Feb. 17—-Ohio State at Columbus; Feb. 18 — Cincinnati at Cincinnati; Feb. 25 — Purdue at Lafayette; Mar. 4 — Wisconsin at Notre Dame; Mar. 11 — Washington (St.Louis) at Notre Dame.

Saturday tells the tale.
N. D, Puckmen Tangle With lllini Friday
Winter sports at Notre Dame will swing into play on next Friday when the Irish hockey team, defying the unusually mild weather and a revenge-mad Illinois sextet, will take to the road for Champaign - Urbana, where they are scheduled to meet the lllini in the second annual hockey game between the two schools. The Irish will no doubt be at a disadvantage this year, because of a lack of practice, and because of the fact that Illinois already has the experience gained from a couple of losses at the hands of Minnesota and Southern California.
• It is expected that, among others, veterans Jack Frost, Jim Brown, Joe Sullivan, Dick Leahy, Jack McIntyre, and Don Stapleton will make the trip.
Last year the Irish trimmed the Illinois team, 2-1, in a fast and rough contest.
Both the Minnesota and Illinois basketball teams are undefeated to date. Both schools boast all-veteran teams. And both teams meet Notre Dame here, on January 28 and February 3, respectively.
Four men from last year’s Gopher starting lineup which beat the Irish 37 to 25 will be on the floor this year. Only three men of the 16 on the squad are over six feet tall, but the current squad is fast and experienced. Two veteran forwards, Gordon Addington and John Kundla, make a great combination. Addington is a deceptive short-shot artist, and Kundla is an unerring shot from any point in the court.
Gopher Center Is Good
Elongated Gordon Spear, who brought Madison Square Garden spectators to their feet last year, when he dropped 6 of 8 shots from the center of the floor, will play center. Gordon came to Minnesota to be a baseball player. He played basketball to keep in shape. John Dick, a deft ball-handler and an excellent set shot, will team with Paul Maki at guard. Maki was high scorer on the Gopher squad last year.
No less potent is the current lllini team. Coach Douglas R. Mills has not lost one letterman through graduation. In an overtime thriller, the lllini nosed out the Irish last year, 33-32.
The guard position is the strongest section of the Illinois team. Captain Tom Nisbet leads the list. Tall and rangy, Tom is the key passer. Other leading candidates at guard include Colin Handion, Howard Cronk, Bob Richmond, Harold Shapiro and George (Jay) Wardlay. Wardlay, a varsity halfback, will probably be a starter with Nisbet. Hanlon, a key man on reverses, has had two years’ experience and will certainly see action.
Strong lllini Reserves
Lewis (Pick) Dehner, the center who set the scoring record at Illinois last year with 226 points, should play the whole game. Bill Hart and Bob O’Neill, sophomores, will be in reserve.
Bill Hapec, who was second to Dehner as a sophomore last year, has been shifted to a forward post. Bill will start with Joe Drish, another letterman. With Ed Hart, Cecil Reehl, and Charlie Phillips in reserve, the forward position is a strong as any the Irish has met this year.

VINES TRIMS BUDGE IN CHICAGO MATCH
A few jots between dots about the Vines-Budge tennis match in Chicago last Saturday night. . . . Vines won 3-6, 2-6, 6-0, 6-3, 6-3 under conditions that were not in the best Davis Cup tradition . . . vendors, vendors, everywhere . . . peeeanuts — popcorn — cigarettes — seeeeegars — ice cold beer . . . while the organist boomed “California, here I come” for the redhead’s entrance . . . both players requested the umpire to quiet the gallery from time to time . . . which makes pro tennis the only business in which the paid help can tell the customers — some of whom paid $5.50 per box seat — to shut up. . . .
Budge was a good but not great player . . . despite Mr. Husing’s repetitious and inaccurate eulogies from Forest Hills last September — the redhead falls as far below Tilden as have all the other champions before and since ... his backhand drive has the speed of Tilden’s, but not the delicate variations of spin . . . his volleys and overhead are destructive . . . but his forehand is faulty on short balls . . . and his service, while effective, hasn’t the fluent power of Vines’ . . . there is a jerk and a hitch akin to a plump Rotarian climbing into a dress shirt. . . .
In the final three sets, Vines played as severely offensive tennis as has been played anywhere, anytime.
Both Players Gentlemen
Towards the end Budge was exhausted ... he took his beating, and it was merciless, without a whimper ... he ran miles of baseline . . . but had no answer for Vines’ speed . . . his court manners were impeccable — as were Vines’ . . . none of the swagger and prance of the second-raters on the white-pants circuit — who fathered the remark that tennis players wear V-neck sweaters because they can pull them down over their - heads. ...
At 5-2 in the final set Vines chucked Budge’s last service to conserve his strength for his own service ... he quickly fouled off four backhands . . . then he served an ace . . . volleyed a placement . . . served another ace . . . and then followed in a high twist service to slam home another volley for the match. . . .
In retrospect . . . Budge is good enough to make Vines work ... his steadiness and tenacity will win matches when Vines is missing . . . but Vines has too much all around power . . . when he is hitting his forehand and service Budge might just as well knock off for lunch.
I INTRODUCING
I	By EDDIE HUFF
X_____________________>
It is almost axiomatic in Notre Dame basketball that the men in the guard positions are not high scorers. Johnny Baldwin, Chicago product of the early ’30’s, was a fast shifty defensive ball player with an offensive wallop. Tommy Wukovits, present frosh tutor, tallied more than his quota before he was graduated last June.
And now comes Paul Edmund Du-Charme to blossom into full bloom
on the hard maple during his senior year. “Duke” enrolled at Notre Dame under the influence of Baldwin, his neighbor, from Mt. Carmel High on Chicago’s Southside. And like every true Southsider, the Duke cheers lustily for the White Sox.
A weight of only 135 pounds during his prey school days somewhat handicapped Duke, but he played regular halfback as a senior gridder and he served double time in basketball as he played a regular floor game for both the lightweight quintet and the varsity five. In one match, Duke rolled 25 points through the hoop to set a Chicago Catholic League record in lightweight competition.
Playing against Duke in those days was one Eddie Riska, de La Salle forward and a current teammate of the Duke. “Eddie has the best eye I’ve seen in college ball for some years,” Duke attests. “Paul Nowak,

KEOGANMEN GO EAST NEXT SATURDAY
A week from tomorrow night George Keogan will take his Notre Dame basketball team on its first 1939 invasion of the East. For on that night the Irish eagers are due to battle the Canisius College Griffins in Buffalo’s well - known Broadway Auditorium. Coach Al Seelbach, of the Buffalo school, has done none too well thus far this season, principally because of a disastrous start, in which the Griffs lost three out of four tilts. Though they took the Alumni team into camp, they were defeated in turn by Western Ontario, Cornell, and Oregon; this is the same Cornell team that was trimmed by the Keog-anment a short time ago, 48-18.
This year’s Canisius five is led by Captain Arno Meyer, one of the finest forwards seen at Canisius in years, and an especially good long shot artist. Clint Small, one of the shortest men in intercollegiate basketball, sophomore Wes Grunditsch, Jack Scholl, and Bill Chapple round out the starting five. For reserves Seelbach has a number of fine men, including Al Ball, Joe Manganello, and Hank Cavanaugh.
Upset a Possibility .
Last year the Irish soundly trounced the Griffs, 57-33, but the year before was quite different; everyone remembers the 40-36 thriller that Notre Dame pulled out of the fire in the waning moments of the game. Coach Seelbach, incidentally, informs us that Canisius is just about due to upset somebody and it may be Notre Dame.
From Buffalo the Keoganmen go to Cleveland to meet the John Carroll team, coached by Tom Conley, former Notre Dame star. Out of five games so far the Blue Streaks have won three. They opened the season against Dyke School and won, 41-27. Then they lost successively to Niagara, 43-28, and Western Reserve, 29-26. Following this, however, the Streaks returned to form to beat “Moose” Krause’s St. Mary’s (Minn.) team, 52-39, and Mt. Union, 34-24.
Conley’s most potent combination seems to be the quintet he is using at present. Veteran Johnny Domo holds down one forward position, while the other is held at present by a sophomore star, Johnny Freedman. At the guards are Jack Spallino and Roy McGarry. Center on the team is lanky Morgan Rudick, who was first string center last year. It looks as though the man to watch will be Domo, described as a fine experienced floorman, a good shot, and the sparkplug of the team.

SPLINTERS FROM THE PRESS BOX By ANDY WILSON
IRISH QUINTET BEATS BUTLER, CORNELL
This basketball team of ours, in its first eight games has lost as many times as the last three Notre Dame teams lost all season. The 1936 outfit won 22, lost 2, tied 1, while the last two clubs, both captained by Ray Meyer, won 20 and lost 3. But at this point in the schedule only the 1936 quintet had a better scoring average than the present squad. Back in 1936, Ford, Moir, Nowak, Wade and Ireland were averaging 52 points at the end of eight contests; Riska, Ertel, Sadowski, DuCharme and Brown are now averaging 48 points a game. The teams of ’37 and ’38 were making only 32 and 41 points a game, respectively.
There can be no complaining about an offense that is clicking off more than a point a minute. Its consistency is impressive; for not counting the two opening “warmup” games with Kalamazoo and Ball State, the Irish have hit 48 twice and have gone no lower than 37 — a variation of only 11 points from highest to lowest scoring achievement. Unfortunately the Notre Dame defense has not been so consistent; for although the Irish opponents are only averaging 32 points a game, three have scored 40 points or better.
We can offer no explanation for the vulnerability of the defense; the most logical theory advanced so far is that the younger players on the squad are still not used to Coach Keo-gan’s admirable shifting man-to-man defensive system. Yet the fact that it is erratic—working perfectly one night and very defectively the next — seems to indicate that guarding as well as shooting can be “on” or “off,” “hot” or “cold.”
However, we do not believe this defensive eccentricity should be a cause for alarm. The team as a whole lacks the poise and the spectacular flair of last year’s veterans, but seems to possess instead more verve and fresh, driving energy.
Tomorrow night Kentucky should be extremely troublesome, with. Thompson, one of the most aggressive players in the country, as their star. He may carry them through to victory; we hope for the best. But Monday night at least, against Western Reserve, we look for a sizeable victory string to start. There will be trouble with Canisius at Buffalo, but not too much; John Carroll at Cleveland should not be too tough. Then Minnesota and Illinois — best in the Big Ten — at home; and we firmly believe the men in blue and gold can
take both of them. Syracuse at Syracuse may be a bit too strong, but once past the Orangemen, the Irish should split the home and home series with Marquette and win the rest. According to the law of averages, Notre Dame should have a bad night in New York this year — but N.Y.U. with an erratic sophomore team does not seem to be capable of stopping the Irish as yet.
•
The End of Football
We see that the pros are still playing football, but the various Bowl games signalized the end of the col- . lege season — though there was a quickly - squelched move begun to match T.C.U. and Tennessee in a “National Championship” game sometime later this month. Also they necessitated a revision of national rankings, which to our mind should now go something like this:
1.	Texas Christian
2.	Tennessee
3.	Notre Dame
4.	Southern California
5.	Carnegie Tech
6.	Duke
7.	Pittsburgh
8.	All in a group — Alabama, California, Holy Cross, Oklahoma, Villanova — then the hoi polloi.
We ourselves were among the foremost scorners of the Christians’ regular schedule — but we listened to their game with Tech and talked with observers, and we are convinced that O’Brien’s arm makes them the Number One team in the country. Tennessee, a rough and tough outfit, by the very fact that it is the only other undefeated big time team, deserves second place, and Notre Dame, best of the once - defeated teams, rates third, ahead of the Trojans of Southern California, the season’s finest opportunists.
•
We are generally not hypercritical in judging college bands, but in our opinion the T.C.U. “swing band” was one of the worst things we heard all year. It is beyond us how dance-hall drumming and tooting in a football stadium — and very “corny” tooting at that — can seem anything but cheap and sensational, Hollywoodish and absurd. A football crowd no doubt looks for colorful antics and lively music at football games — but certainly color and music that is in harmony with the game-atmosphere itself. Hideho that starts you jittering in your seat hardly seems properly atmospheric.
Notre Dame handed Cornell its worst defeat of a midwestern tour and posted a two-point triumph over Butler to continue its winning play, both victories being registered on the home floor.
Expert free-throw shooting by Paul Ducharme, guard and Ed Riska, forward, provided the margin of victory for Coach George Keogan’s team in the Butler contest, 37-35. Ducharme, high scorer of the evening with 12 points, tallied four points via the foul route while Riska, held basketless, came through with another quartet of foul offerings. Mark Ertel, lanky center, slapped in three buckets and two gift shots to strengthen his hold on the pivot post for Notre Dame. Each team made 13 baskets.
Captain Earl Brown had seven points to help the cause, his basket putting the Irish in the lead in the last few minutes of play. A successful stalling game halted Butler’s efforts to score. Steiner, diminutive forward of the invaders, chalked up nine points to take scoring laurels for Butler. Butler had previously beaten Wisconsin, conquerors of Notre Dame, by three points.
A pair of regulars, Ducharme and Riska, marked up seven points apiece while Reserves Ken Oberbrunner and Yezerski tallied six apiece as Notre Dame handed Cornell’s barnstorming quintet a 48-18 walloping.
Coach Keogan used his second and third teams during most of the first half and during the entire second half. Bob Smith and Ziegenhom also came in for spurts of outstanding play for the Irish with five points each.
The play of Ducharme, reserve at the beginning of the season, has been the highlight of the 1939 play for the Irish. Ducharme has performed at forward, center and guard—grabbing a regular berth at the latter spot beside Captain Brown.
Tennisfs at Pro Match
Olen Parks, runnerup for the Fall University tennis championships last fall, was a lineman at the tennis match in the Chicago Stadium last Saturday evening when Ellsworth Vines defeated J. Donald Budge in a sensational five-set match, 2-6, 3-6, 6-0, 6-3, 6-3. Other Notre Dame ten-nists who were guests at the match include: Captain Fred Simon; Dan Canale, University Fall champion; and Tom Mills, Jr.

N. D. SPLITS SERIES WITH WILDCATS
MEMORIAL TO OPEN BEFORE EASTER
FROSH LINNETS BACK AFTER FIVE YEARS
On the night of Dec. 22, an aggressive Notre Dame basketball team met and defeated Northwestern’s well-balanced Wildcats. The score was 48 to 30. The Irish victory was a much-needed one, not only from the viewpoint of an improvement in the season’s standing, but in winning for the first time in three tries from a Big 10 opponent. Previously the Irish dropped hard-fought games to Wisconsin and Michigan.
This victory was an impressive one for the Fighting Irish. Their all-around playing ability showed improvement and the outcome of the contest was never in doubt. Sophomore Eddie Riska swished the nets for 15 points to lead the Irish scorers, with Ertel, Sadowski, Brown and Ducharme all gettin gtheir share of the points. Northwestern’s scoring was well divided with Voights, Vance and Davis outstanding on defense.
The Wildcats that night went home for their Christmas vacation 18 points behind the eight-ball, a downcast bunch. But, like elephants, they never forget.
On Dec. 31, Notre Dame played a return game at Patten Gymnasium, Evanston. Everything was in readiness for New Year’s Eve festivities. Even a good portion of the holiday crowd attended in full dress.
The first half was a free scoring affair, with both teams apparently “feeling” each other out. The Irish led at half-time and up to this stage of the game the brunt of Notre Dame’s offensive power was bn the shoulders of forward Ed Sadowski and center Mark Ertel. Then came the second half. Riska, who went scoreless the first period “got hot” scoring 15 points. Gene Klier, husky guard also was “on” with five points.
But all this scoring wasn’t enough. With five minutes to play, and Notre Dame having a seven point advantage, Northwestern pulled the trigger. Within two minutes the lead was decreased to one point. During the remaining three minutes Butherus, substitute Wildcat forward, came into the game and calmly scored three “buckets” to clinch a revenge victory for Northwestern. The score was 43 to 39.
Pittsburgh Dance
The Hon. John P. Egan was general chairman of the Rockne Memorial Dance - which the Pittsburgh Alumni Club, assisted by the Campus club, sponsored at the Pittsburgh Field Club, Jan. 2. “Jock” Sutherland, Pitt football coach, was an honor guest.
“The Rockne Memorial will be open for partial use about the first of March, said Rev. John J. Reddington, C.S.C., superintendent of maintenance, and the building will be completed some time before Easter.”
It seems that there is much to be
Rev. John J. Reddington, C.S.C. “Don’t be impatient.”
done yet in the Memorial. The plastering, although in its last stages, has yet to be finished, the pool is only just beginning to be tiled, and the special Mankato stone for the foyer has not yet arrived.
“You students are in too much of a hurry,” continued Father Reddington, “you must realize that a building is only one-third finished when the outside is completed.”
Father Reddington revealed that there would be ample locker space for all students. Each student will have a permanent locker 12 by 15 in which he may keep his personal articles. In addition he will have the use of a full size dress locker while he is using the facilities of the Memorial.

After a five year absence the scholastic year of ’38 saw the return of the Linnets to the campus. Reorganized by freshmen, under the capable direction of Mr. Orville Foster, a former Iowa “networker,” the group reached the 100 mark for enrollment and offered all sorts of musical and. vocal talent, so....
On Oct. 13 the Linnets made their first appearance when they contributed to the Founder’s Day program. With the encouraging words of Rev.
• J. Hugh O’Donnell, C.S.C., and Elmer Layden, the men left the studio excited and anxious to start work on. their first Washington Hall appearance on Oct. 26. Unusual stage effects marked the showmanship of Mr. Foster. A vocal treasure was uncovered in the tenor voices of Tony Donadio, and Larry Weideman and the Linnet orchestra showed versatility in their-delivery of the “Bolero” and a catchy arrangement of “Posin’.” Resting on their laurels the Linnets took time out to enter the social limelight with .... a victory dance for freshmen only. The affair was presented at the Progress Club and the “insignificant frosh” came into his own as he swung the light fantastic to the tunes of Larry Kent and his band. Back to work again, they next offered.... a visual broadcast the following Tuesday in the auditorium of the engineer’s building. The novelty captured the interest of spectators and listeners and similar shows were planned for the future; The following Saturday morning the entire Linnet organization sang at the first of a.... series of weekly masses which were to continue throughout the scholastic year. Rehearsals for a new campus presentation followed and resulted in.... “Memories of ’38,” a tribute to the varsity team. The first performance resulted in a “poor dress rehearsal” and the Linnets “laid their first egg.”
The next night, however, they turned out a better show. Dialogue showed a new trend in the organization and a new baritone star was found in the person of John Walior. The Linnet Glee men showed a notable improvement, added confidence. Perhaps, the orchestra made the most definite strides by blending into a solid outfit in such a short period of time. They have done much in interpreting “sensible swing” . and their prospects look more than favorable under the student direction of drummer, John Kelley. And so it can be undoubtedly said that the Linnets.... have gained solid footing.

CLUB HONORS TEAM BY BANQUET
•
The Buffalo Council of the Knights of Columbus cooperated with the campus Buffalo club, on Thursday evening, Dec. 22, in giving a banquet
Frank Reppenhagen Hopes it’s an annual.
in honor of three outstanding players of the 1938 season.
The honored guests at the football banquet were: James J. McGoldrick, 1938 captain; E. Joseph Beinor, AllAmerican tackle; and John F. Kelly, 1939 captain. The dinner was held in the Hotel Buffalo and the Notre Dame Club was host to about 400 guests.
Upon the request of George Kennedy, toastmaster for the occasion, each guest of honor said a few words. Those present at the banquet were especially appreciative of the sense of humor and speaking ability of Capt. McGoldrick. Joe Boland briefly review the past season and John Kelly expressed his hopes for the success of next season. Rev. H. B. Laud-enbach gave the invocation for the banquet.
With the aid of Carl J. Nagel and Joseph F. Ryan, Frank Reppenhagen planned this highlight of Buffalo’s Christmas season. In previous years the club has honored leading football players at an annual luncheon. President Reppenhagen expressed the hope, not only of himself but of the other members of the club, that this banquet, so successful in its first presentation, would become an annual and outstanding event of the Buffalo Club.
REMEMBER THE TWO JIMMIES FOR:
Aileen O'Brien Lecture
Miss Aileen O’Brien lectured on the Spanish Civil War in Washington Hall on December 15. Miss O’Brien, who received an honorary captaincy from General Franco, gave an account of her personal experiences, of the important people she met, and of the way the Spanish dictator is running his government.
She frankly admitted that the insurgent government is fascist and dictatorial in form and contended that the temper of the Spanish people will not permit a democracy. She explained that the Spanish cabinet consists of heads of different groups or unions representing agriculture and industry. Any question relating to a particular group is settled by a vote of that group, subject to the approval of Franco and the heads of the other departments, who must see that the motion does not conflict with their interest.
The Roman Catholic religion is the official state religion in Spain today and is taught in all of Franco’s schools as a compulsory course. The population of Spain is 98% Catholic.

"Jitney Players" Want Play For 17th Tour
•
The Jitney Players are preparing four native American plays for their 17th annual tour. Three of these plays will be selected by a vote of the various organizations and colleges where the Jitney Players have appeared. The fourth is to be a college competition play.
They are sponsoring a contest in the American colleges. The announcement states that “the contest is open to all and the requirements are few; a full length play of an American scene, either past or contemporary. The contest closes March 31, 1939, and all manuscripts should be submitted to the Jitney Players, 114 E. 40th St., New York City. The winning play is to be produced by the Jitney Players this summer, and toured extensively throughout the United States during the season of 1939-40.”

the United States. This Catholic university is directed by the priests of the Congregation of Holy Cross, who provide excellent residential and dining hall facilities as well as scholarly opportunities. Three thousand students work there under the very best conditions — both intellectual and physical.
“But in order to show how closely this university reflects the spirit of the Temps Present, it will suflice to say that there Jacques Maritain met several French faculty members whose names are familiar to our readers: Charles Du Bos, the incomparable critic and essayist so appreciated in foreign lands; and our collaborator, Yves Simon, who apologizes for not sending in more copy to the editors during his months in America. Yves Simon is translating his articles from Temps Present into English to be published over there.... an excellent idea and a means of drawing still closer the bonds which unite us to the Americans.
“At that university we also have another friend who is not French but thinks with Temps Present—the German writer, Waldemar Gurian, who has proved in a great book on contemporary French Catholicism that his information is irreproachable. And many others, English and American.
“It was a joy for Maritain to feel so much at home so far from Paris and even beyond the city of New York.”
FLYNN LECTURE
(Continued from Page 9)
created new, relevant terminologies for their work.
The Catholic tendency to know the true measuring rods for personal conduct, yet to leave application of them to others, was deplored by Mr. Flynn. For American Catholics heard Monsignor John A. Ryan emphasize the teaching of Pope Leo XIII’s encyclical on labor, and they called him a “radical” and a “socialist,” with the result that Communists are gaining ground in this country by pointing to abuses which should long ago have been pointed out by Catholics who were dozing.
“The persecution of the Jews, the discrimination against Negroes, the soulless materialism of some of those in high places must not be ignored .... for they affect the eternal destiny of all men’s lives,” according to Mr. Flynn. “It is not sufficient,” he continued, “to point out that artificial birth control violates the natural law; Catholics have an obligation to look into the economic system that makes child bearing a financial liability.” Mr. Flynn insisted that “this does not intimate a weakening of the principle, but when conditions make it difficult to apply the principles, we must change conditions.” He suggested maternity guilds, social insurance and the like as a practical attack on unethical birth control, for Catholics must “vitalize social justice by practical application or be identified as hypocrites.”
He concluded that Catholic teaching of social problems has one major responsibility: “The integration of spiritual and ethical value with the working hypothesis and experimental procedures of secular sociology.”

RECORD REVIEW
Victor ’ Decca Brunswick
Bluebird	Vocation
Attention you seekers of “solid senders” there are a host of exceptional new waxings that have to be added to your “must get list.” Headlining the current VICTOR releases are Larry Clinton’s “My Heart Belongs To Daddy” which features Bea Wain on the vocal, and it is a tune that is destined to lead anybody’s hit parade. The reverse, “Most Gentlemen Don’t Like Love” is equally as refreshing. Another A-1 disc rendered by Larry (Dipsy Doodle) Clinton is, “Variety Is The Spice of Life”; the vocalizing is done by Bea Wain, and it really swings up the ladder. On the reverse is a swing version of "Temptation.” The most recent offering of Benny Goodman is “Farewell Blues,” which is plenty torrid and features some terrific brass work. The reverse, “My Honey's Lovin’ Arms” is typically Goodman, but in a sweeter vein. Tommy Dorsey, that sentimental gentleman of swing has come to the fore once more with a swell platter “Angels With Dirty Faces” with Edythe Wright handling the vocal honors. On the reverse is “Between A Kiss And A Sigh.”
DECCA: i
Ella Fitzgerald, And Her Savoy Eight issued a new release “Strictly From Dixie” which is more than worthy of mention, and Ella does her usual inimitable warbling. “Woe Is Me” on the reverse, is also a well impression in wax. Chick Webb offers a new disc which is destined to be every bit as popular as last season’s, “A Tisket A Tasket.” The new release is “F.D.R. Jones” and really rocks from start to finish, with the added attraction of Ella Fitzgerald, vocalizing. “I Love Each Move You Make,” the reverse is a very appealing ballad. Bing Crosby has crashed through once again with “You’re A Sweet Little Headache” from his new Paramount Cinema, “Paris Honeymoon.” Crosby does a super job on the vocal, and it is truly soothing to the ears. The reverse, “Joobalai” is a novelty number excellently warbled by Bing. Another member of the Crosby family appears under the Decca label, and that is Bob Crosby. His most recent contribution is: “Wait Until My Heart Finds Out,” a delightful tune in the gold old Dixieland fashion. “Two Sleepy People,” on the reverse, features Marion Mann, who does a grand job. The Andrew Sisters have a new platter, “Billy Boy,” which swings lightly and politely. The reverse, “Hold Tight, Hold Tight.” is one of the top novelty hits of the season. BRUNSWICK:
Under the Brunswick Label we have Ray Noble, for you who desire sweet swing. His latest release is: “You’re So Desirable,” with Howard Phillips, doing the vocal honors. “You That I Loved,” is also a splendid number, on the reverse side. Kay Kyser, the band with the singing song titles has waxed: “Deep In A Dream,” which features the superb vocalizing of Ginny Simms. The reverse, “When Paw Was Courtin’ Ma,” is a clever novelty, uniquely handled by Kyser. “We’ll Get A Bang Out Of Life.” VOCALION:
The top Vocalion release of the month is: “Have You Forgotten So Soon,” featuring Mildred Bailey and her band. The reverse: “Old Folks,” is a pecularly sweet ballad with Mildred Bailey on the vocal.
Bluebird: Artie Shaw, the outstanding artist on Bluebird, offers “Thanks For Everything,” which is some real suave swing, featuring Artie on the “Hot Stick.” The reverse: “Between A Kiss And A Sigh,” is another exceptional disc, with Helen Forrest, on the vocal. (adv.)	—W. J. Mullins.
INTRODUCING
(Continued from Page 17)
Notre Dame ’38, was the best all-round and certainly the best defensive man under the hoop that any coach could wish for.”
DuCharme has had the distinction of playing every position this season, though he feels that guard is his natural and favorite spot in the lineup. With only five feet, ten inches, he shifted to center against Wisconsin early in the year, and sparked the Irish to everything but victory.
Duke was a freshman sensation, but bigger defensive men forced him into the background during his sophomore and junior seasons although he won a monogram.
At Pittsburgh, a year ago, he forced the play against the Panthers and cashed in on a half dozen free throws plus one field basket. He remained a valuable substitute during the remainder of the year.
But when Coach George Keogan discovered a shortage of offensive weapons as this season produced a double defeat in the first big tests against Wisconsin and Michigan he drew Duke from his varsity bag and has started him in every game since.
DuCharme opened the center lane
