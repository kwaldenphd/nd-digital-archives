Two Different Worlds  
The new staffs first issue of Scholastic is supposed to be light-hearted. It's been a tradition each spring for it to present Sarcastic, a less-than-serious, not­ 
quite-true account about the goings-on at Notre Dame. But then last Wednesday  
happened. Like anyone else, I was glued to my television as our nation went to war.  
Suddenly, our little adventure in collegiate satire seemed somewhat insignificant  
compared to the "shock and awe" of warfare.  
There's that delicate balance to be struck between covering world-changing  
events and moving on with business as usual, and few people know where that  
balance lies ­ least ofall me. But here goes.  
Scholastic has asked students, faculty and administrators around campus to take  
some time and personally reflect on the situation in which the world finds itself.  
Many have been kind enough to share their thoughts. On page 4, Christopher Kelly  
presents the results of this endeavor.  
At the same time, we proudly present the tradition that is Sarcastic. These are  
the stories so shocking, so secret, so utterly and completely false that the powers  
look for  that be will deny their truth, even centuries after this issue's publication. But by  
ISSUE 12 on APR 10  then, our brains will be floating in jars of formaldehyde, attached to elaborate machinery. So life will be pretty sweet.  
Until then, I shall leave this issue as proofthat, beyond a doubt, our staff should  
all be fired immediately.  


A Note of Thanks 
For the first time in many-a-moon, Sarah Childress was (probably) sleeping soundly when this magazine was finished early Wednesday morning. Scho­lastic thanks Sarah and all ofthe seniors who have selflessly devoted their time to this publication over the past few years. Farewell and good luck. 

Correction 
In the previous issue ofScholastic, the article titled "Admitting Success" quoted from a document written by Dan Saracino, assistant provost for enrollment. The document was an op-ed piece, not an amicus brief. Scholastic regrets the error.

·. Looking Inward Reflections onthe war in Iraq 
Scholastic asked various students and faculty members to provide us with personalreflections on the current situation in Iraq. We asked them three questions in light the developing events: How has this affected you personally? Do you feel safe? How do you feel that Notre Dame (as a community) should respond? Below is a sampling of the responses. To view the complete collection ofresponses, please visit www.nd.edu/~scholastlreflections.htm ·

it's not really publicized," says Bill Kirk, assistant vice president of Residence Life and Housing and the administrator of the 
Fine Fund. He adds that some students prefer to pay back what is donated, seeing the money as a temporary loan. 
The Fine Fund can also subsidize transportation to and from campus ifa student demonstrates significant financial need. Recently, the fund paid for the university-owned plane to fly the parents ofChad Sharon to Notre Dame, and for the hosting of the Sharon family. 
Previous uses ofthe fund, which included sending flowers and gift baskets to the faculty and staff, have been discontinued because they .do 
not benefit students. 
"We're very conscientious about having ap­propriate reasons to use the fund," says Kirk. "Wealwayswanttomakesurethatitflowsback to the students;' . it covers some of the financial needs of campus sexual assault victims and their family members. Also, the fund is used ifa 


student cannot afford a diagnostic test, such · as a learning-disability assessment. In most cases, a student pays what he or she can, and the fund absorbs the difference. 
"Because the fund aids students in need,

At 12, you were the youngest inductee into the Society of American Magicians. 

Was magic simply a hobby to you? 
It was my hobby, what I had a knack for ... As a kid, I went to the library and took out all the books on magic. I was teaching magic at NYU when I was 16. I auditioned and they picked me. It was quite an honor! 
How long does it typically take to formulate and perfect a routine for performance? 
About two years, but flying took seven. 
What inspired some of your recent illusions? 
Lately, I've found that my inspirations are people's dreams. No 0IJ.e dreams of disap­pearing, so I do things like make a car appear on stage, or traveling to a desert island.

Has anything ever backfired or put you in danger? Every night I'm doing stuff that's extremely dangerous ... Right now I'm doing sleight ofhand with a black African scorpion. Mis­takes happen all the time, but I have to cover it and make sure no one can see it. 
David Copperfield's Tales of the Impossible draws upon your magic profession in fictional form. What inspired you to capture this in writing? 
I was a big fan of Rod Sterling and Alfred Hitchcock in the '50s and '60s ... They both got writers to write about their passion. I got the best writers, like Joyce Carol Oates and Dean Koontz, to contribute. I also wrote a story, which was pretty scary for me. 
Project Magic is a program that you have started for the rehabilitation of the disabled. How does sleight of hand 
movement help? 
It helps dexterity; it's a therapeutic goal. It started when I got a letter from a young magician who was also disabled ... and the program has been going now for 20 years. 
Do you find it more difficult performing on television or in person? 
TV is actually harder for me because it's going to last longer. I enjoy the process ofworking in front ofan audience. I'm always develop-· ing new things little by little, and when it becomes good enough, I put it in the show. 
If you could influence something in the world today through magic, what would you do? 
Make people get along with each other. 
As the first person to escape from Alcatraz, have you ever been solicited by prisoners for the secret? 
No one has contacted me as of yet .. : I thought I'd get more calls. 
What is it about magic that transcends cultural and language differences? 
We really need it. We need to dream, es­pecially in times like this. We need to be transported, and magic, in a very profound way, does that.

The men's basketball team has advanced to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1987. Although the Irish have never made it to the championship game, there is a lot in Notre Dame men's basketball history to be proud of. For example, only six teams have more top ten finishes in the AP rankings than Notre Dame: Kentucky, North Carolina, Duke, UCLA, Kansas and Indiana. Here are some other interesting Irish stats (win-loss 
records are pre-Arizona 3/27/03 game):  
Number of trips to the NCAA tournament: 27 (including this year)  Number of trips to the Final Four: 2

The golden age ofcomics may be long gone, but Marvel Comics' characters like The X-Men, Spider-Man and Daredevil are as popular as ever, as comic book films have taken theatergoers and crit­ics by storm in the last few years. Fantastic ticket sales and mild critical acclaim have been enough to whip Hol­lywood into a comic book feeding frenzy. With two comics films nearing release and at least another seven in the works or under serious consideration,

the release of Blade.  These projects include  

Based on the little-known Marvel Comics character, it featured Wesley Snipes as a half-man, half-vampire dedicated to annihilating a worldwide sub­culture ofblood-sucking fiends. 
Blade's success, despite its gore and sexual content, helped pave the way for the lighter fare ofMarvel's two biggest hits, X-Men and Spider-Man. Both films embody what one would expect of a comic book film: young men and women in silly costumes fighting bad guys with the aid ofspectacular powers. And fans couldn't get enough ofit. 
BenAffleck's stint as a blind, crime-fight­ing lawyer in Daredevil generated a fairly impressive gross and varied critical success, despite leaving a rumored 30 minutes ofrun­time on the cutting room floor. 
While the comics film renaissance is a welcome turn of events -after director Joel

Schumacher single-handedly ruined the Batman franchise in the atrocious Batman and Robin -the concept oftoo much of a good thing is one idea Marvel seems happy to ignore. fustead, much like the reality-show boom, the folks in charge seem intent on milking their success for all it's worth, despite the danger it poses to the long-term popularity ofcomics films. 
To wit: X-Men 2 hits theaters May 2, with The Hulk, the Ang Lee-directed flick about the savage green behemoth, slated for 
release in August. While 
several films ranging from the web-slinger's sequel, The Amaz­ing Spider-Man, to X-Men spin-offs featur­ing Hugh Jackman's character, Wolverine, and Halle Berry's character, Storm. . 
This already is a lot for fans to chew on without Warner Bros. trying to get in on the action. The company has been trying for years to revive their once-popular Batman and Super­man franchises, and seems on the cusp offinally doing so. Films about both characters are in the works, as is one featuring the well-known villain Catwoman (starring Halle Berry). 
Sooner or later, studios will let quality suf­fer in favor of excessive visuals and action -picture what George Lucas did to Yoda, and you're halfway there. The public will tire of the weaker fare in a flash, leaving loyal comics fans wondering where all their favorite heroes have gone.

"[The de­partments] are scheduling their classes for their instructors to meet the specific needs in that de­partment at the times that they think are best." The departments commonly schedule classes in the middle ofthe day based on convenience, without considering that the other departments are doing likewise, Pace explains. 
An increasing popularity in the two-day-a­week MW and TH courses has exacerbated scheduling issues. Says Ava Preacher, associ­ate dean of the College of Arts and Letters: "There's a push to become a research institu­tion, so faculty don't want to teach three days a week when they can teach two. Therefore [the two-day-a-week time slots] are becom­ing more and more in demand." Faculty members prefer to teach fewer days a week "so that they have more options for giving lectures elsewhere and for concentrated work on their own projects;' explained Roche in a later Academic Council meeting.

all the courses with their specific needs. "We 
physically have the technology to meet all 
student and faculty needs, it's just a matter of 
using it efficiently." 
These inefficiencies are very pervasive on 
Tuesday and Thursday, again at the 9:30 a.m., 
11 :00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. timeslots. At 11 :00 a.m., for example, the College ofArts and Let­ters holds 166 classes -the most taught by any college at the university during a single time slot, putting a serious strain on available classroom space. In comparison, the college holds only 68 classes during the 10:40 slot on Wednesday. As a result, specific classrooms and technologies are unavailable at some times while sitting unused at others. 
Pace, however, does not see resource allo­cationastherealproblemsincewhenneeded classrooms or technologies are not available, classes are simply forced to meet at another time. "The problem, as we see it, is making sure that students are able to schedule the courses they need to get through the institu­tion in four years. " 

The concerns of the Academic Council, went beyond both course conflicts and resource ,allocation, however: In a proposal submitted 
sible policy changes aimed at both resolv­scheduling and resource i~sues and at tering Thursday night drinking . 
Th~ first proposal called for a regulation . owmg no department to offer more than 65 percent of its courses during prime time and 
27 MARCH 2003 



EXIT AT YOUR OWN RISK Although often packed, DeBartolo Hall is relatively empty on Friday afternoons. 
requiring that 20 percent be taught on Fridays. The proposal further recommended that MF and WF schedules be instituted in addition to the pre-existing MW one. 
The committee's second proposal was geared specifically at increasing the number of two-day-a-week courses. This model, developed by Sam Gaglio of the College of Business, recommended that a new calendar be implemented including75-minute MH and TF courses, and the offering ofMWF courses at only four time slots spread throughout the day. This proposal does not intrude on the fac­ulty and department's substantial scheduling freedom; unlike the first. 
At the April 2001 Academic Council meet­ing, Roche and other members ofthe Under­graduate Studies committee presented these proposals to the Council members. Ofthe 32 members present, 10 said they favored the first proposal, 21 the second, and one abstained. A year later, the committee returned with a different solution. 
The April 30, 2002 meeting revisited the scheduling issue. There, Roche and the Undergraduate Studies committee presented another proposal to resolve concerns includ­ing the "Friday Problem." In the "Proposed Resolution to the Academic Council on Course Scheduling" prepared by Pace, it was recom­mended that the current MW schedule be re­placed by a WF one. The plan was approved by the council with only one opposing vote and 
27 MARCH 2003 
was scheduled to take effect this semester. 
The issue was far from resolved. "After the proposal was approved ... we got a lot ofreac­tion about how it really wouldn't work because ofvarious things that we hadn't really thought about;' Preacher says. Among the major criti­cisms were the arguments that Friday is used as a traveling day by professors and athletes. 
Further, trying to schedule tutorials, which require many small classrooms, along with 50-minute and 75-minute courses would cause a glut on Friday. Pace amended to the proposal the moving oftutorials from Friday to Monday. According to Preacher, however, this change did not make sense for many faculty members who felt that having a Friday tuto­rial after Monday and Wednesday lectures was most practical. 
For many, though, the idea just seemed inef­fective. The main problem with the proposal, Preacher says, is that it "wasn't really solving the problem that [ the subcommittee] thought it was solving." The change would transport the problem from Friday to Monday more than it would resolve scheduling concerns. Melissa Rauch, a student member of the Academic Council, believed that given the proposal's ineffectiveness in solving issues ofhigh course concentration at certain times, the real goal was to curb Thursday-night d1inking. 
Ther:e was also some concern as well over how well the proposal actually addressed the "Friday Problem." According to the 2002 minutes, some asked if Thursday-night drinking would simply be shifted to Sun­day night drinking. Roche doubted that it would, given the current use of Sunday as a day for studying and attending Mass. Rauch argued that students would continue to drink on Thursday despite the change. Fellow stu­dent member Sam_antha Schmid, however, argued that the change would in fact address the "Friday Problem," as students who had assignments due on Friday would be un­likely to go out on Thursday night. 

In the face of such heavy criticism, the Council officially reversed its decision at its December 3, 2002 meeting. Says Preacher: "We realized that you can't solve both [scheduling and allocative problems] and the 'Friday Problem' with one proposal." The Un­dergraduate Studies committee will explore alternative options "to address the issues that gave rise to the original proposal." 
Although these issues are still being ad­dressed, Pace does not foresee any large changes in the near future. "The fact is, stu­dents aren't yet having that much difficulty in getting the classes they need to graduate and many would rather deal with these con­flicts than go to class at 8:00 on Monday or 5 :00 on Friday." So while it may not be any easier during the upcoming registration period for students to get the classes they want, many will be thankful in light of the alternative. D

Happy spring, Gipplings. The Gipp hopes y'all had a memorable St. Paddy's Day -of which you re­member nothing. As long as you didn't jump off any balconies and ruin the fun for the rest ofus, you're in good favor with Uncle Gipp. We've got a full plate of tips this week, so let's dig in. 
Let Me See That 

Near the end of February, one of South Quad's palaces experienced a flood in its basement. To clear the pipes, ND Mainte­nance Services brought in a machine with some serious giddy-up. However, this machine, which the workers supposedly claimed could "blow the guts out of any­thing," popped out something that you don't find in our dorm pipes everyday -a red thong from Victoria's Secret. According to our tipster, he and the rest ofthe amused hall staff are curiously looking for the culprit of this heinous crime, which, by the way, would only be newsworthy at two places -Notre Dame and a retirement home for priests. The Gipp is left to ask one simple favor: The next time you Zahmbies bring your "Boys' Night Out" activities to other dorms' bathrooms, please remember to take all of your party supplies home with you. 
Please Burn My Eyes 

Here's some advice for the investigators of the hanky-panky described above: The owner of this undergarment in question is not a certain dorm's rectress. This sista' still owns her unmentionables, and proudly displays them to anyone who happens to live in or visit her dorm. The Gipp has been informed that many eyes have pain­fully witnessed this naughty nun walking around wearing nothing more than a green Notre Dame shirt and white cotton Hanes. And we're not talking about walking aroun4 the room with the door open. This sight can supposedly be seen all hours of the night in all parts of the dorm. Like most of you readers, the Gipp is still very confused as to the reason behind this display. However, the Gipp is very thankful that no photograhic evidence was included with this tip. 
I Guess You Had to Be There 
A few weeks ago, some Irish students de­cided to celebrate Fat Tuesday by-gasp! -drinking on a weekday. According to these party animals, "after a few drinks, (Gipp's translation: two) my friends, with their Mardi Gras masks on, proceeded to go to Coleman Morse Center with beads around their necks." Two ofthe rebels then tossed beads out to those studying in the lounge. The End. 
Still waiting for the funny part? So is the Gipp. Boys and girls, this is embar­rassing. The combination ofcollege girls, alcohol and beads whose sole function is to make people do tip-worthy deeds should lead to much, much more than non-stories such as this one. Fortunately for the Gipp, any depression brought on by reading this last tale was easily overcome by tips from God's gift to debauchery, a.k.a. spring break. But, please, don't read on ifyou're currently consuming food. Seriously. 
. Three's Company 
Our next adventure concerns a fairly high-profile ND student vacationing on a sunny island. Our friend and his drunken cronies were socializing in a nightclub (hopefully not past 2 a.m.), when he de­cided he needed to use the establishment's men's room. The bathroom was momen­tarily empty, because, says our tipster, most males were busy watching some sort of"wet T-shirt contest." (Not being able to locate these key words in the index of DuLac, the Gipp hopes all Irish students closed their eyes for the duration of this heathen display.) Alone in the bathroom, this fine exemplar ofNotre Dame was us­ing the facilities for their designed purpose when his dinner started to come back up. 

So, with the southern river still flowing, he leaned over and let it out into the urinal. 
As ifsimultaneously emitting two bodily fluids wasn't enough, this Gipp ling then felt something knocking at the back door. And then it happened: Standing in the middle of the restroom, he let the snake creep out of the hole, thus completing the trifecta of human byproducts. If this illustration didn't rile you up enough, reread this story the next time you're consuming oatmeal, chocolate and lemonade at the same time. 
Some tips make the Gipp laugh. Others, like the previous narrative, make the Gipp cringe. And then some tips, well, just read on for yourself ... 
Bottoms Up 

During his break from academia, one Domer decided that he could not com­pletely leave his biochemical knowledge behind. This student reasoned that his mouth was not the most efficient in-hole when one desires rapid intoxication. So the sailor grabbed a bottle of a local brew and decided to follow a simple five step process: 1.) Lay naked on your back. 2.) Pull legs back over head. 3.) Apply lubrication to both the battleship and the port. 4.) Insert gently. 5.) Repeat steps one through four the following night, using vodka instead of beer. The catcher was supposedly on record saying "It was not ribbed for my pleasure -I'll tell you that." Have fun explaining that one to your future wife. Wait, sorry ... future life partner. 
The Gipp knows it's hard to follow a story like that, but don't be discour­aged. You have two weeks to top our pal, Penetration I>ete, so get cracking on finding foreign objects to place in under­utilized parts of your body. Some words for motivation: It may hurt going in, but the glory the Gipp will thrust upon you is well worth it. .

Student Smells Alcohol on

~ 

:) Roommate's Breath 
,i 
.,,llJ II NDSP in breathalyzing frenzy, university officials "deeply disappointed" 
i. II 
ROYCETHIBIDEAUX 
Knott Hall freshman Andrew Granger reported smelling alcohol on the breath of his roommate, Michael 
McAtee, an incident in apparent violation of both the university's alcohol policy and Indiana law regarding underage consump­tion, sources told Sarcastic Tuesday. 
NDSP is cun-ently investigating the inci­dent, and there are no suspects. 
"It was really weird," said Granger, a prospective theology/philosophy major from St. Charles high school in Columbus, Ohio. "At the beginning of the semester, our rector gave us these big lectures about drinking-how to recognize signs ofalco­
_hol poisoning, what you can and can't bring into the dorms and so on ~ but i always assumed they were just getting it out ofthe way so they didn't have to bother talking to us individually when we turned 21. Which is, of course, when we'll finally be able to 
drink." . 
Granger reportedly questioned McAtee regarding his whereabouts when McAtee arrived back at their room at approximately 3 a.m. Sunday morning. McAtee allegedly responded by mumbling something about "Reckers with some friends" before collaps­
. ing on Granger's futon. Granger claimed that McAtee's movements were somewhat uncoordinated, and that his breath smelled vaguely of Jim Beam, a brand of bourbon whiskey popular among those oflegal drink­ing age. 
"I know my dad likes to drink it some­times, so I remembered smelling it before, but it was really odd that Mike would have eaten something at Reckers that smelled so much like bourbon," Granger remarked. "Maybe they marinate their sandwiches in it or something. I mean, we can't even buy alcohol anywhere, let alone manage to get it onto campus supposing we somehow found a half-empty bottle or something." 
Added Granger, "It's not like the kids here would break the law or anything." 
When reached for comment, Shill Smirk, assistant vice president of Residence Life, called the incident "disappointing and cer­tainly atypical ofthe traditional student ex­

perience within the Notre Dame family." 
"Certainly we're upset if somehow this impressionable student was able to procure alcohol -perhaps from a disgruntled T.A. or drunken vagrant -but the fact remains · that this is just not the sort ofthing that nor­mally occurs. I'mnot sure ifyou were aware, but 7 5percent ofthe alcohol here on campus is drunk by only 28 percent of the student body. Or, wait, maybe it was 28 percent of the alcohol is drunk by 75 percent ofthe stu­dent body.

His portion ofthe room is also adorned with various posters advertising orproviding mixing recipes for-alcoholic beverages-a strange temptation, considering he must wait

Smirk, be­fore hav­ing media members escorted from the premises. 
If the smell is indeed confirmed as bourbon, the incident would mark approxi­mately the 23,512th time that a student has somehow violated the Notre Dame alcohol policy . .The number has risen dramatically in the past year, presumably in response to the university's recent ban on hard alcohol, in-hall dances and fun. 
"They're basically good kids," said the Rev. Gin Scuzzy on a routine hall inspection, sidestepping the body of an unconscious student lying in· the hallway. "Every now and then you have a few bad apples come through, but most are justup for a quiet game of euchre or some TV-watching most Sat­urday nights. And Flipside is always doing something fun, like hayrides or potholder making. Honestly, I don't even know why kids would want to drink." 
He then suggested the hall staff clean up residual vomit from section 3A's ongoing influenza epidemic. 
Most puzzling in the incident is the reac­over two years before he can finally imbibe any such beverages. 

McAtee claims he had no idea why his breath would smell of alcohol, adding that it had nothing to do with a "monster-ass blowout" over in College Park with Pete, JJ, and Sully. 
Commenting on his roommate's inquisi­tive nature, McAtee remarked, "Well, you know, it's sort oflike the nature ofthe beast when you get a freshman year roommate, you know?

Stepan bums newer, prettier expansion to grour 
ByTROGDOR 
Staff Buminator 
A concentrated effort to beautify the north end of campus went up in flames Thursday after the Notre Dame Fire Depaitment discovered that Glorious Hall, the gleaming new Stepan Center expansion, had been reduced to ashes overnight. The hall, which would have housed the new Center for Sanity inArchitecture, was barely a day old. 
Officials immediately suspected foul play, but had no leads until they found a giant, gaudy, hexagonal print in the mud, west of the bum site. Their suspicions were confirmed when they approached Stepan Center for questioning ai1d it tried, in vain, to bum itself down. 
Stepan declined to comment at the advice of its lawyer, Lee Gallegal, a member of the Association for the Ethical Treatment of Buildings, who plans to incorporate Stepan's 
history of psychological trauma into its defense. "It's far more than just the constant verbal abuse from students, faculty and staff," Gallegal says. "Stepan also had a difficult childhood." Stepan's creators were · unable to comment in a phone interview with The Obscurer because they were high on crack. Gallegal remains committed to his defense strategy, however, and hopes that after all this is over, Stepan will be able to relocate to Orlando, where the makers ofEpcot Center run a refuge for misunderstood geodesic domes. 
But not eve1yone agrees that Stepan should be let offjust because it's had it rough. Experts in building law cite, for example, the measured calm with which Flanner Hall endures the gigantic, illuminated "#1" sign atop its neighbor, Grace Hall, as evidence that buildings can shoulder jealousy with remarkable resolve. Many campus buildings agree. "We've been having an identity crisis since

God Confesses: Tyrone Willingham, head football coach ofthe Notre Dame Fighting Irish, ended widespread speculation yesterday when he announced in a press conference that he is, in fact, God. Long-held suspicions came to a head last week when a Notre Dame student on a run around St. Mary's Lake reported seeing Willingham standing on top of Holy Cross Hill, "transfigured." . 
As she later told the The Obscurer, Nina Joyboy was making the circuit around the lakes at about 3:00 p.m. on March 19 when she spotted the popular coach. "He was just kinda standing there," said Joyboy, "but his face was shining like the sun." Word of the sighting spread quickly and the football office was inundated with calls, prompting the announcement ofyesterday's press conference. 
Willingham appeared before university officials and members ofthe press in a white robe and his trademark sunglasses. Witnesses later remarked that he looked human, but somehow divine. His remarks were characteristically measured and brief. He offered no proof or demonstration ofhis omnipotence, but students interviewed for this article expressed complete faith in Ty. 
"Iknew it," junior Ginger Littlejohn said, when told the news. J uniorAgatha Runcible concurred, "This confirms what I have believed for a long time. Once, when I was having a really rough week, I prayed to Ty that Saturday would come, and sure enough, a few days later, it did!"

Master ofHeadline Masterfulness 
Yesterday, a Notre Dame professor gave a lecture to a class in DeBartolo Hall. The lecture, given by Professor Matthew Ellis, lasted for 50 minutes and was attended by about 60 students. The material covered in the lecture was related to electrical and magnetic fields. Obscurer investigations revealed that the lecture topic, coincidentally, is also the name of the class that contained yesterday's talk. 
"I felt like I had a strong ·performance in class today, although it was certainly no transductive radio-magnetism lecture," remarked Ellis, who has been at Notre Dame for 15 years. 
Ellis said that this lecture almost exactly followed his "course syllabus," the typed document he distributed to every student who attends his class. The Obscurer obtained a copy ofsaid syllabus, and was able to confim1 t11at 
this course is indeed con1.pron1ised o:f'a series of"Jectures related t:o electricity 
and magnetism. •--"--" 
Students, however, noted that this lecture was a slight deviation from the course syllabus. "Today was supposed to be the last part of chapter 18 and the first half of 19, but we only did the first third," says junior engineer Hans Sti.ibenson. 
The syllabus also outlines a policy which requires attendance at all lectures, including yesterday's showstopper. According to an exit poll taken bY(The Obscurer, 87 percent of students, or 21 of 60, said they only attended yesterday's lecture because they were required to do so. 
Ellis scoffed at the suggestion that students attend his class only because of his policy. "My lectures ·are as exciting as quantum electrodynamics! I feel that yesterday's lecture was one of my most interesting of the year," Ellis said after the lecture. 
Sophomore major Patrick McMichael disagrees: "Professor Ellis sucks . . . and so do you guys." Mc Michael also commented on Ellis' use of diagrams to illustrate points in his lecture. "Did you guys really need to use • all those nautical references?" he said. "And why do you run that comic that blows?" 
Concerning the future of this lecture series, Ellis is very optimistic. "I structure my lectures so that every one builds off ofprevious lectures." 
Yesterday's lecture was the 9th in a 37-pait series. The next lecture is scheduled for tomorrow in the same_ location and at the same time as yesterday's. The Obscurer will provide continued coverage.

Marksman Proposes Mass 



Destruction of Activities 
Students "shocked and awed" 
DANRATHEROne year after a coalition led by the Rev. Poor Marksman decided to ban in-hall dances and the possession of hard alcohol on campus, the board oftrustees is expected to vote against a plan that would prohibit all campus activities, reports a top administrative official on the condition of anonymity. The proposal, titled "Operation No More Freedom," cites the strong positive correlation between many student activities and physical injuries and the equally strong negative rela­tionship between activities and free time as the major reasons for the resolution. "The coalition believes very strongly that activities on campus lead to injurious behav­ior and take away from potential studying time," said Marksman. "It is the belief of this partnership of freedom-loving members that students come to a university to study, not to have fun." The proposal, reportedly an 833-page docu­ment, targets a number offamiliar activities on campus. Most notably, it calls for the dissolu­tion ofthe varsity football team. The board of trustees insists that insufficient proof exists to warrant such a drastic measure, but Marksman insists _that no further evaluation is necessaiy. "Football is a mindless game that prevents students from doing the work that they came to this university to do," he said. "One percent of the student population suffers 78 percent ofthis campus's blunt-force collision injuries, and it is the one percent who play football here. This is a significant statistic. What's even worse, the football team's combined GPA is significantly lower than the general student population's." Marksman continued: 'These students came to this university for free so that they could get the best education possible. It is unfair to use the threat ofmaking these students pay for their educations to force them to engage in an activity that both injures their bodies and obvi­ously costs them so much free time that they have lower GPAs than the rest ofthe students. Waiting any longer will only further damage the minds and bodies ofthese young men." Sources close to the administration speculate that ifthe coalition is reasonably sure that the resolution is doomed to be vetoed, it might be withdrawn before the board of trustees can 
20 SARCASTICNEWS 
vote on it. 

In discussions leading up to the formal drafting of the proposal, several members of the board recommended that representatives inspect the daily proceedings of activities like football practice before committing to Marksman's hard-line stai1ce against all cam­pus activities. However, it is suspected that the coalition is seeking a way to circumvent the authority ofthe board oftrnstees altogether. 
"This coalition recognizes the evils ofactivi­ties designed to inhibit higher learning, and the only way to inl1ibit these evils is to remove them at the source," said Marksman. "If that protests are for dirty hippies." 
Asked about how quickly the proposal would be put into action should the coalition decide to act independently of the board of trustees, the president refused to give a quantitative an­swer, saying, "It depends on how quickly we can assemble and position an organization of rogue police officers willing to inflict severe and continual violence upon students who violate the policy, for the benefit ofall. I can't say how long that would take, but considering how corrnpt and wicked ghetto the neighboring community is, Iwould guess it won'ttake more than 90 minutes."

means we'll have to force the issue without the consent ofthe board oftrustees, then so be it. It's not like any of us value their opinion, anyway." 
Students organized protests at several sites on campus to voice their disapproval of the measure. University President Drunk Lovetoy dismissed the demonstration as further evi­dence ofthe need for immediate action. 
"Look at these cretins marching around with signs and megaphones like it's going to change anything," he said. "Ifit were illegal to conduct an activity like this on our campus, these morons would be studying in their rooms, and then they'd be smart enough to know that 
Lovetoy denied a report that he labeled every member of the board of trustees "dirty Frenchmen," but added, "Whoever did make that remark about those filthy Frenchmen is a wise gentleman." 
Fearing that the proposal could become a reality, virtually every student moved off campus in an effort to :flee the radius of the university's control. . 
"Hey, that's fine, We'restillgoingtoproceed as planned," said Marksman. "We don't care if they get hurt or don't study when they're off campus. As far as we're concerned, we're only responsible for the111 when they're on our land." 0

28-Meal Plan Finally Approved 
Students plan hunger strike in retaliation; university administrat9rs say, "Flex this!" 
ITZALOT 
Today the university announced sweep­ing changes to students' meal plan that officials believe will effectively placate 
students and further line the pockets of Food Services.• 
The plan, which will replace the Flex 14 and Premium 2 lmeal plans, does away with Flex points entirely. Instead, all students will have the single choice of a 28-meal plan, which allows for 28 meals per week per student. 
The Rev. Poor Marksman unveiled the plan today at a ceremony in front ofNorth Dining Hall, after which attendees were allowed one piece offruit or pastry as a refreshment. 
Marksman said the plan is the culmination oftwo years ofserious research involving national statistics and focus groups composed of professors and members of the South Bend community, as well as a few students fromIUSB and Bethel College. 
Under the new plan, Notre Dame students would be al­lowed to consume up to three meals every day, but only during the current dining-hall hours. When Sarcastic asked how students would be able to use all 28 meals when they were only allowed to eat 21, Marks­man replied calmly that the administration had spent two years resear6hing extensively 
. to come up with the best plan 'for all involved. 
He also noted that Food Ser­vices would implement some serious improvements to make the dining hall a "happier, hip­per" environment., Marksman said plans are already under way 
can you go to see almost the entire student body, talking, laughing and enjoying them­selves over a bowl of vegetarian vegetable soup? It will be like the watering hole ofthe olden days." · 
While he claims that students are largely optimistic about the new plan, junior Mo Boote, best known for his effective protests against last year's ban on in-hall dances and hard alcohol, expressed his frustration with the administration by burning a basket of paper napkins in front of the Main Building. "We want our Flex points back!" he shouted at no one in particular. "I'll fight the administration to the death!" 
Booto says he and a small band of rebel students are planning a hunger strike to protest disappointed. But those students who just want good, clean, dining-hall food are going to be happy." 

StudentBody President Kibby Mishap's ad­ministration had worked tirelessly to design an appropriate meal plan as an alternative to the current Flex 14 and Premium 21 meal plans this year. Mishap and Vice President Skip Bowley presented their proposal to Marks­man yesterday. After lining his birdcage with the report, Marksman patted them each on the head, handed each of them a cookie and announced that, after careful consideration, the final plan would be revealed today. 
Nevertheless, Mishap broke from Bowley, the Student Senate and the Hall Presidents' Council to personally thank Marksman for 

to have monitors in both dining halls to wear 
backwards Adidas baseball caps. Circus Day 
also will be offered twice a year, and Spicy 
Sea Nuggets will be served daily. Marksman 
believes the changes will get students excited 
about going to the dining halls to meet friends .. and interact, under supervision, with members ofthe opposite sex. "South and North will become the new LaForturie," Mar~sman says. "Where else

what he calls a "grave injustice." "We're in the middle ofa war, here, people, and I don't mean in the Middle East. It's time to stop this oppression." 
Marksman dismissed the students' pro­tests out of hand. "I know some students aren't going to like this plan;' he said. "You can't please everybody. Those students who think that eating whenever they want is part of the college experience are going to be his excellent work and applaud the focus groups for their intelligent contributions to the research effort. 
"I am the student body president," Mis­hap said proudly. "That means I know what students want without talking to them, and I know they want 28 meals." 
The 28-meal plan is scheduled to go into effect tomorrow. .

Innovate or die! So goes the battle cry for businesses today. Now, more than ever, firms must find novel solutions to everyday needs in order to stay ahead of the pack. With the initiation of a new program called the Student Business Incubator, Notre Dame students who have caught the entrepreneurial bug can try their hands at operating their own businesses on cam­pus. The purpose of the Student Business Incubator is "to encourage the entrepre­neurial spirit within the undergraduate student body," Entrepreneurs Club Vice President Willa Qian says. The Incubator is modeled after the $20 Challenge project, part of the Introduction to Entrepreneur­ship course taught in the Mendoza College of Business, in which students are graded on the amount ofprofit generated from an initial $20. "The exp~rience for the students in­cludes identifying markets, taking risks, . experiencing stress, building networks, dealing with outside imposed constraints and feeling the 'thrill' of success," Profes­sor David Hayes of the Gigot Center for 
Entrepreneurial Studies explains. 
According to university policy, students are not allowed to run for-profit organiza­tions using any ofNotre Dame's resources, such as phone lines, e-mail addresses, bulletin boards and dorm rooms. The Entrepreneurs Club, in conjunction with Student Activities and the Gigot Center, has created the.Incubator as an opportunity for students to apply their business skills in a real-life setting on campus. 
According to Hayes, each of the teams or individuals generates product or service 
27 MARCH 2003 
ideas, chooses the most feasible, develops marketing and operational plans, creates timelines and contingency plans and then implements them. While the Entrepreneurs Club encourages the groups to operate nonprofit businesses, they can choose to retain 100 percent of the profits. 
The teams must receive the approval of· Student Activities before beginning bu:{i­ness and are not allowed to invest more than $500 out-of-pocket. These constraints are representative of the restrictions real world entrepreneurs face while working within the laws and regulations of their environments, Hayes explains. 

At the end of the 10-week competi­tion, the officers of the Entrepreneurs Club, professors and local entrepreneurs judge each student business not solely on profit, but also on how its owners operated the endeavor and how feasible it would be to continue the business. The best nonprofit entrepreneur and the best for-profit team will receive awards at the McCloskey Notre Dame Business Plan Competition's final event, which hosts successful alumni, venture capital rep­resentatives and other entrepreneurs. 
In this, the program's first year, 12 teams have enrolled in the competition. "[The Student Business Incubator] is an oppor­tunity to experiment with those great busi­ness ideas students throw around the dorm all the time, but never do anything about," sophomore English major Judah Wilson says. Wilson has begun a trivia game called RiddleMelrish in which two-person teams compete to answer a series ofNotre Dame riddles via e-mail. The first five teams to respond correctly receive prizes, such as gift certificates to campus restaurants, and the winning team will receive a grand prize ofa $1,000 shopping spree at the Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore. Participants pay a $5 ~ntry fee, and a portion of the profits goes to charity. 
Marketing/psychology major Stephen Dick and accounting major Mike Is­elin (a Scholastic staff member) have opened a nonprofit SYR gift shop called The Hook-Up, which operates out of the Dooley Room in Lafortune on Friday evenings. The idea has been lurking in Dick's mind since last year. "I had this drawer full of random items ... so my crazy drawer became a hot spot for gifts on dance nights," he says. They took a survey before opening up shop to see what kinds of items students wanted, and they keep an ongoing product sug­gestion list. "We view our product sug­gestion list as an integral aspect of our store because we always want to be of­fering gifts that students demand," Dick says. "Our service directly satisfies the needs of our market." The two Keenan sophomores feel this unique approach to their market is what distinguishes them from the competition. 
Accounting major Beth Androski and marketing major Diana Laquinta decided to create Wollabee Pie Company after An­droski fell in love with Australian meat pies while studying in Fremantle last semester. The snacks, which the team makes in the test kitchen ofNorth Dining Hall, have :fillings ranging from breakfast food to Mexican food to vegetables to dessert. Selling their goods from 12:00 
a.m. to 3:30 a.m. on Sundays at Main Circle, the Farley juniors hope to catch students returning from their nights out with the $2 pies. 
"The goal [ of the Student Business In­cubator] is to learn about yourself," An­droski says. "You learn about your limits and you learn what you can accomplish if you put your mind to it." 
Many ofthe student entrepreneurs plan to pursue their own businesses upon graduation and see the incubator as an opportunity to learn what entrepreneur­ship involves. "ND is a safe environment to start out in," Entrepreneurs Club Presi­dent Fran Larkin says. 
Dick already knows he wants to be an entrepreneur. "The possibilities truly are endless, though. I have some plans already in mind for next year's competition." D

nee upon a time, in a house on 18312 Bulla Road, there •· states of dress-up. / 
1------•lived three seniors by the names ofTim Bradley, Je'sse Fa and Max Wallhausser. A foosball table, a dinner table and a life-size Freddy Krueger cut­out fill the spacious welcoming area near the house's back door, the only usable entrance. Just beyond the dinner table is the living room, complete with an impressive stereo system, B& W speakers, about 18 different video game systems and an extensive DVD collection. The world's most comfortable IO-dollar chair, patterned with flowers, is the perfect complement to the wall-to-wall teal carpeting. The house's main attraction is a wood-burning stove which has the ability to heat most of the house as well as complement some of its residents' risky fetishes. "I'm a class-A pyro, so it allows me to vent all my frustrations," Fa says. The living room is now the size of a large Notre Dame dorm room, but it once was twice as big. The trio used foam insulation to separate the living room from the fonner foyer space, which now serves as Fa's shag-rug bedroom, complete with his own artwork adorning the walls. Fa blocked offhis bedroom door to shut out the draft and discourage unwanted solicitors. The other bedrooms don't suffer much from an identity crisis. Bradley was labeled "the poster king" by Fa because his room is home to multiple NAZZ battle ofthe bands insignia, an autographed Elle McPherson poster, and a calendar that depicts ferrets in various

In the hall between the bedrooms is stunning piece of art ere­ated by the early-' 90s fifteen-minutes-f-famer Wesley Willis. "I 
like my Wesley Willis artwork," Brad!  says about the original  
pen drawing of the Dan Ryan Expressw  in Chicago. He bought  
the piece from the artist for about $35.  

Through a waist-high black metal gate a d down majestic (read: "ratty") red-carpeted stairs is the basement. Spis bleak 1mderground lair gives Bradley and Fa, along with seniornon\residents Dan Schmid ­and John Fanning, a place to create house mus~.Their band, Com­pleting the Square, uses the basement as practice ace. Outside, the garage is large and well-heated enough to hold co certs, even in the winter. "It's an awesome place to be in a band and t6 live in a house where you can play," Fa says. 
The house rocks so much that it may not be available an me soon. This is the first year the crib has been leased to undergrads or a full term, and the owner already has had rental requests for the ne t two to three years. So while it may not be music to their ears, parie al­hating, shower-shoe-loathing students across campus must search f~ cribworthiness elsewhere. .-~

The NCAA selection committee snubbed the Big East, which is now 8-0 in the tourney 
IThe Rant 

by Gerard Meskill -respond to the king of sports at gmeskill@nd.edu 
With the first two rounds ofthe NCAA tournament under our belts, the time has come once again to evaluate the selection committee's decisions regarding placement and seeding. And by "evaluate," I mean "criticize harshly." Let's put aside the fact that they put Kentucky and Arizona on the same side of the bracket. Let's also forget that they put Brigham Young in a region where they would be scheduled to play a third-round game on Sunday, which is a forbidden practice for Mormons. These mistakes have already been noted, and we certainly didn't need to wait until the end ofthe second round to address them. Instead, let's turn our focus to the commit­tee's treatment of the Big East. This year's committee deemed the conference worthy of just four NCAA bids, denying Boston College (18-11, 10-6) and Seton Hall (17-12, 10-6) trips to The Dance. Those Big East teams who were invited to the tournament were also slighted. Pitts­burgh (26-4, 13-3) was seeded at No. 2 in the Midwest region, despite winning both the Big East regular season title and the conference tournament. Meanwhile Texas (22-6, 13-3), who won neither title in the Big XII, was given the top seed in the South and pitted against play-in winner UNCAshe­ville, a decision that essentially deemed the Longhorns the best team in the tournament. Connecticut (21-9, 10-6) was disrespected even more, when it was given the fifth seed in the South region despite finishing in a first-place tie with Boston College in the Big East's East division and advancing to the conference tournament's final. Notre Dame and Syracuse were given fair seeds, although one could also make a case for the Orangemen to be a second seed. It has been suggested by experts, such as ESPN's Joe Lunardi, that the committee seeded BigEast teams lower to punish them for tackling weak non-conference opponents. 
Ironically, the lower seeds gave the Big East teams the opportunity to send a mes­sage back to the committee by compiling impressive victories over better opponents. Indeed, each Big East team responded to the disrespect shown bythecommittee, going 8-0 
An upset victory for either Notre Dame or Connecticut ( will likely ensure that the Big East sends at least two 
teams to the Elite Eight. 

in the first two rounds ofthe event. The feat gives the conference four teams in the Sweet 
16. The Big XII is next, with three teams (Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas), while the ACC (Duke and Maryland), SEC (Kentucky and Auburn) and Big Ten (Wisconsin and Michigan State) each advanced two teams into the third round. With the Orangemen fac­ingNo.-10Aubumand the Panthers squaring offagainst No. 3 Marquette, an upset victory for either Notre Dame or Connecticut will likely ensure that the Big East sends at least two teams to the Elite Eight. 
Although I believe the Big East was the most victimized this year, unfair seeding oc­curred throughout the bracketing. The greatest benefactors ofthese errors were Auburn and Indiana. Speculation by experts contends that Auburn (20-11, 8-8) was the last team to be selected into the field of65. Ifthis indeed is true, then it is impossible to explain how the Tigers earned a ten seed and the right to play a shaky St. Joseph's squad. Upon defeating the Hawks, Auburn drew Wake Forest, who despite winning the ACC regular-season title can be considered the weakest ofthe second­seeded teams. How does the last team into the tournament get put in such a weak pool of teams, while a team like Notre Dame draws a field that includes Arizona, Kansas, Duke, Illinois and Gonzaga? 
If the Auburn Tigers were the last team to receive an at-large bid, then Indiana and 

·, 
Alabama could not have been far behind. But by the whim of the committee, these two struggling teams had the good fortune of · meeting each other in the opening round. In other words, one ofthem had to advance to the next round. The fact that Indiana, Alabama 
. andAubum all got tenth seeds orbetter while Butler (25-5, 14-2) received a 12 seed and an unfavorable match-up against Mississippi State shows that the committee is still far from being experts at evaluating a team's talent level, especially ifthe team does not play in one ofthe six major conferences. 
Yet the talent almost always wins out inthe end. And so, the Sweet 16 field includes two mid-major conference teams and four from the Big East. With any luck, come Thursday the Pac-IO will be the first major conference to be eliminated from The Dance, and the Big East

Sweet Springtime Success 
Victory over Illinois sends Irish to Sweet Sixteen for the first time in over 15 years 
MIKEISEUN 

The Notre Dame men's basketball team suffered through a late-season drought heading into the Big Dance. They lost four oftheir last five games com­ing into the tournament, including an open­ing-round loss to St. John's in the Big East tournament. This late-season skid, coupled with the fact that the team's leading scorer, Matt Carroll, who averaged over 20 points per game during the season, has been play­ing on a bad ankle, might have led many to believe the Irish would once again make an early exit from the NCAA Championship. But, as the hish have proven, history wasn't going to repeat itself this year. The hish set a team goal at the beginning of the year: advance to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA tourna­ment for the first time since 1987. Last weekend in India­napolis, the hish accomplished their goal together. With an injured Carroll not able to . perform up to his norm, head coach Mike Brey looked to his other players to step up. Fortu­nately for the hish, sophomore point guard Chris Thomas and freshman forward Torin Fran­cis answered the call. In their first-round victory over the University of Wisconsin-Mil­waukee, Thomas came ready to play and scored 27 points, and Francis put 23 points on the board and pulled down 14 rebounds. Nobody should have been surprised by the fact that Thomas shined in his hometown ofIndianapolis -throughout his entire bas­ketball career, he has never lost a game at the RCA Dome, in­cluding the 1998 Indiana State Championship game his fresh­man year ofhigh school. On Saturday, Notre Dame had a chance against the No. 4 seed Fighting Illini to accomplish their goal and move on to the Sweet Sixteen. Carroll was only able to contribute 11 points. However, on Brey's 44th birthday, the hish coach received an unforgettable present from senior transfer Dan Miller. Miller, who boasts Final Four expetience with his former team, the Maryland Terrapins, let the hish ride his hot hand. Miller finished with a career-high 23 points and gave coach Brey a spot in the Sweet Sixteen after only three years as the Notre Dame head coach. 
The hish next travel to Anaheim, California to take on the No. 1 seed Arizona Wildcats in 

the hunt for their third winin the NCAA Tourna­
ment, a feat they have not accomplished since 
the 1977-78 season under head coach Digger 
Phelps. Arizona was ranked number one in the 
nation for most ofthis season, until they faced 
defeat at the hands of the UCLA Bruins in a 
Pac-IO Tournament first round loss. The Wildcats will definitely provide the hish with a tough test, but they are not unbeat­able. In their second-round game against the Gonzaga Bulldogs, the Wildcats needed two overtimes and a last-second missed-shot by Bulldog Blake Stepp in order to squeak past 
the West Region's ninth seed. 
The Irish are still alive in the tournament, chiefly due to an increase in the quality of their de­fense. During their last five games ofthe regular season, Notre Dame was not able to hold a single team under 80 points. The Irish stepped up to the pressure of the single­elimination NCAA tournament and played outstanding defense against UW-Milwaukee, holding them to a meager 34.8 percent field-goal percentage. Notre Dame backed that performance up by holding the Illini squad to 34.9 percent from the field. Ifthelrish want to stay alive in the tournament they are going to have to keep up their tremendous defensive efforts against a powerful Wildcat offense. 
Arizona is led by seniors Jason Gardner and Luke Walton and is one of few teams with five players who have averaged more than ten points per game over the course of the season. As a team, the Wildcats shoot 46.1 percent from the field and average over 85 points per game. Most ofArizona's points are scored in transition and on second-chance opportunities. 
IfNotre Dame's shooters come to play, and if they can force the Cats to play a half-court game, they have a great chance to con­tinue their season and move on to the Elite Eight. D

SMILE FOR THE CAMERAS Irish fencers celebrate the end to a spectacular season. 
GERARDMESKILL 
Notre Dame returned to the pinnacle of collegiate fencing last weekend, winning the national championship in a 182-179 victory overdefending champion Penn State. First-yearheadcoach Janusz Bednarski has started his tenure atNotre Dame extremely well, to say the least. The victory gave the Irish their sixth national.title and their first since 1994. The championship was especially sweet for the team after a decade ofcoming up just short. Over the past eight years, the Irish have finished second five times (1996-2000) and third twice (2001-2002). With the exception of 2001, Notre Dame saw archrival Penn State hoist the championship trophy each of those years, and the outcome was often decided by only a few bouts. The competition was tight again in 2003, but this year it was the Nittany Lions who found themselves finishing a few points short. "It is the sweetest possible outcome because they did it to us so many times;' says seniorfoilist Ozren Debic. "It's especially great since many of our NCAA participants will be graduating this year, and our careers couldn't have ended in a better way." The victory was a total team effort, with equal contributions from men and women, un­derclassmen and seniors. Success was not evenly distributed across weapons, though, as the foil squad did the best in the tournament. Sopho­more Alicja Kryczalo posted a 19-4 mark in the round-robin portion of the foil competition and successfully defended hernational title, defeating 2001 NCAA champion Iris Zimmerman 15-12. 
. Meanwhile, teammate Andrea Ament, also a sophomore, matched Kryczalo's 19-4 mark in foil competition, but placed third nationally in the individual competition. The two combinedto score 38 points for the Irish, the highest total for any ofNotre Dame's six weapon classes. 
"Last year ... we didn't lose any bouts to any other teams, so we felt pressure to perform as well this year;' says Ament. "Both of us were very focused andvery determinednotto drop any bouts this year. Ofcourse, we dropped some here and there, but we're a good pair and we support each other really well." 
While the women foilists shinedthe brightest, theirmale counterparts followed closely behind. Debic competed in the national tournament for the fourth consecutive year, winning 18 ofhis 23 bmits, placing fourth in the nation and earning first-team All-America honors for the third time in his career. Sophomore Derek Snyder finished 17-6, good for fifth place and second-team All­America honors. The efforts of the two foilists tallied 35 more points for the Irish, meaning the two foil squads combined to provide 40 percent ofNotre Dame's 183 points. 
"We knew that our women's [foil] team was strong from the results last year, and me and [Debic] worked hard all year to keep up with them," says Snyder. ''We won a lot ofbouts [at the NCAA championship] that could have been much closerifwe hadn't practiced as much. But moral support was a huge factor. We supported the women, and the women supported us." 
As strong as the foilists were this year, Notre Dame could not have returned to the peak of fencing without strong efforts from its two other weapons. Senior Matt Fabricant made a big statement in his second appearance in the NCAA saber competition, winning 15 bouts to finish sixth and earn second-team All-America 

. honors. In epee, sophomore Michal Sobieraj (20-3) fell one touch shy ofthe NCAA title, losing in overtime 8-7 to Air Force's Weston Kelly. What made the epee match even more heartbreaking for the Irish was that he scored a touch on Kelly during a period when the two closed in on each other, but the director discounted it, ruling that she had called halt before the touch was com­
pleted. Had the touch counted, Sobieraj would have won the match in regulation. 
In women's epee,junior KerryWalton posted impressive results in her second appearance at the championship. Although Walton failed to defend her national title, she won 15 bouts in a tough field of fencers. Senior Meagan Call also perfonned well in the field, recording 13 victories. 
Inwomen's saber,juniorDestanie Milo turned in the biggest surprise performance for the Irish in the tournament, posting 16 victories to finish sixth. Milo's strong performance helped pick up teammate Maggie Jordan, who won just six bouts in saber. However, Jordan recorded a key upset victory late in the competition, defeating Penn State's Austin O'Neill. The win gave the Irish a two-point swing, which gave them breathing room en route to their three-point win. 
"Everybody knew it was going to be a key bout," says Walton. "I was fencing while she was having her bout, and I could hear them cheering from the absolute opposite side ofthe gym. You could tell by how they were reacting how well she was doing. Itwas wonderful." 
For a proud program that had fallen pain­fully short of the title so many times· since 1994, "wonderful" might not be strong enough to describe the team's accomplish­ment. D

Bearing False Testimonv 
The writer takes a stand on puppy-eating, cannibart'sm and hating plants 
ERICDOYERSBERGEB 

My friend Lilly is vegetarian and a peculiar girl: neither suicidal nor Catholic. She believes in human­ity, and raises social consciousness at Notre Dame and the surrounding community, Monday through Thursday. But Lilly has gone too far. Her Scholastic contribution concerning puppy-kicking crosses the line ("Student activists propose new club in of­fense of animals," 02/20/03). I can . only hope it was an attempt at hu­mor. Either way, it was.in bad taste. Malicious harm to animals is never permissible, and kicking puppies is particularly evil. It only serves to bruise the meat, and the puppy's en­suing adrenaline ruins all flavor. Keep in mind at all times: A happy puppy is a tasty puppy. Owing to a lack of transportation or a desire to save money, some students bring puppy-processing into their dorm rooms. This is ill-advised. Years ofexperience go into the art of the proper puppy puree, and unless a student is well-versed, the prospective meal shall end in disaster-not even benchmarkable against the cafeteria­standard mutt taco meat. Instead, might I recommend a visit to one of the numerous friendly butchers in the South Bend area. The puppy will be overjoyed at the prospect ofa car ride and this good deed will be rewarded in lush flavoring. As I write this now, Lilly is eating a bowl of ketchup-drenched animal crackers and snarling at me from across the room. We are both activists, yet I fear her commit­ment to the calling dwindles as of late, as she indulges in too many self-help books. In my life, a single self-help book has sufficed: The Bible. The Bible, in summary, speaks ofall people as protrusions of the universal bubble wrap. There are no empiric boundar­ies separating person-from-person in much the same way a road trip reveals the triviality ofstate divisions. Thank goodness for "now entering" signs or all these false mental constructs I use to separate state-from-state and to place empiric borders on all existence would need rethinking. The central protago­nist (this guy named "Jesus") basically tells the world that maybe hurting the next person means hurting the centralized existence that is us all. Society responds by nailing him to a super-sized toothpick. As I look towards Lilly, I know The Bible tells it all: Opening 

with a couple in a garden and ending with Revelations. 'Nuff said. Lilly says I'm too tall for her anyways. 
I am also Catholic. Catholicism is about hedging one's bets; I know through sheer mathematics I've picked a winner. With birth control declared unholy, Catholicism guarantees exponential growth, making it, on a long enough timeline, everlasting in its dominance as the largest global Christian 
_ strain. Furthermore, more members mean more voices calling towards the Heavens, so whenever a member is having problems in 
life, the Church can more effectively petition 
God with prayer. Whether it's about miraculously wither­ing the weird growth on Aunt Laurel's right foot or halting Notre Dame's persistence in offering veal, petitioning is at the heart of changing the world around us. Lilly and I plan to petition hard until old age (where I expect to be rewarded with gratuitous help­ings of ca1ioons and medication, but not necessarily in that order). I want to look 
back at the world on my deathbed and know that my brief visit here has, in my own humble way, changed the world for the better. Next semester, I plan to take time off from academia and visit regions ofAfrica where I can contrib­ute to putting an end to cannibalism. With something like cannibalism, you must bring change to those affected incrementally-my group's first step in the name ofprogress is to equip them all with knives and forks. However, if financing runs thin, an investment in sporks may be necessary. 
Lilly and I recommend everyone become involved in changing the com­munity. Please, either donate funds or time. This could help the current ef­fort underway to provide free mulch for residential trees. That is merely one example though. I cannot in good faith recommend this particular activity (but there are many others), principally because I am a vegeterian. It is not that I like animals, I just hate plants. 
Cheers. D

A Cut Above the Rest 
From South Bend to Mexico for under $20 
I E'TANIASEVERE
Students looking for a little spice in their lives need not worry. Within a ten-mile radius of campus, 15 Mexican restaurants can be found to pro­vide an often much-needed break from dining hall fare. Mazatlan, located only about ten minutes from campus, at 507 E. Mckinley Ave. in Mishawaka, stands out by offering food in a family atmosphere with occasional live mariachi performances. This authentic Mexican restaurant boasts a variety of dishes, detailed in its seven­page menu. There's a little something for everyone, including vegetarian dishes, seafood, traditional Mexican cuisine, and a long list ofbeverage choices. Depending on patron needs, there are dine-in, takeout and delivery. Mazatlan's popularity is most visible on Friday and Saturday nights, but during the week, lunch and dinner bring in equally good business. Scholastic recently dined for lunch at Mazatlan and enjoyed everything from root beer to homemade chips and salsa to "Lun­cheon #3," which includes a sampling of a bean burrito and cheese enchilada with rice. For dessert, Scholastic selected the sopapilla: fried dough with several toppings or sauces that can add,to the taste. The dish can be des­sert or an appetizer, depending on the topping choices. For dessert, it is most common to top sopapilla with cinnamon, powdered sugar or chocolate. When served as an appetizer or snack, it· is Ieaten with salsa, picante or guacamole. Mazatlan also serves a variety of Mexican beers and mixed drinks. 


Lunch prices were all under $6 and dinner is around $12. The service was excellent, and the food arrives usually in 10 to 15 minutes, but the chips and salsa help to stave off hunger cravings before the meals arrive. 
Although Mazatlan is only four years old, it already has a rich history. Scholastic caught up with ownerAlberto Leon, who explained what makes his restaurant so unique. When Leon was a teenager growing up in San Jose, Guatemala, his mom took him to a beach in Mazatlan. "I always liked the name . . . it sounded so nice and friendly." The impression stayed with him, so when it came time to choose a name for his family's restaurant, Mazatlanimmediately came to mind: "I was only there one time, but it stuck in my head for a long time." · 
Leon has been in the restaurant business for about fifteen years, since he started in Colum­bus, GA working with his father. Leon credits his brother-in-law -who owns restaurants in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina -withteaching him the ropes ofthe restaurant business. Mazatlan prides itself on using family recipes, giving the restaurant its traditional and home-like atmosphere. ''Ninety percent oftl1e recipes are from my mom and me," said Leon with pride, "They come from my family and the village ofSan Jose where I grew up." 
Ifyou 're looking for an entertaining night out as well as an authentic meal, Mazatlan offers the genuine sounds of live mariachi music. "The band walks around and plays at each table," Leon described. "They ask what type of songs you like, upbeat or slow and then they play what you like." The perfor­mances are only on limited occasions, how­ever, and the next time to catch one will be on Sunday, March 30 from 6 -9 p.m. The band comes all the way from Indianapolis every couple of weeks. 
Offering authentic Mexican food and an escape to the south-of-the-border, Mazatlan is sure to cure anyone's hankering for a deli­cious off-campus meal. D

Mr. Jake and the Women 
The Farley Players branch out with a Neil Simon comedy 
HATTIUM 


pril 4 and 5 mark a slight change in he annual Farley Players production t Notre Dame. Traditionally, the play­ers perform a musical for their annual event, but this year they will put on Jakes Women, · a comedy by Neil Simon. Under the direction ofsophomore Meghann Tabor, this year's cast has dedicated countless hours ofwork bringing 
two nights ofentertainment to the stage. 

The story is a playful comedy about Jake, an overly imaginative writer who engages in . a flurry of daydreaming and treads a thin line between insanity and geajus. Jake, played by Mike Dolson, tugs the audience in and out of his delusional relationships with the women -alive and deceased -in his life. The fe­male characters that mold Jake's neurosis are equally eccentric, ranging from an obsessively unstable sister to a patronizing psychiatrist. Beneath its witty surface, the play also deals with the more profound notions of relation­ships and trust, captivating the audience with spells ofemotional highs and lows throughout the play. "There's just so much to work with," says Dolson. 
Overflowing with biting comebacks and hi­
lariousrants,it'snowonderthatthecastmem­
hers can easily connect with their characters. 
Says Elizabeth Colombo on her role as Jake's 
irrational but loving sister, "We have a lot of

turing side, but then she has a very dark side, too. It's fun to get to play with both worlds." The specific makeup of the characters in the play is reflective ofthe Players' intentions, as well. Tabor comments about choosing the right play, "I wanted to do a play with a lot ofstrong female roles, especially with so many leading male roles out there." 
With only one leading male role and seven female leads, it seems only fitting that the play­ers should choose this particular piece. Put­ting on such a production, however, comes at a high cost for many members ofthe cast. With auditions starting in February and rehearsals beginning a few short weeks later, the actor and actresses have less than two months to memorize lines and learn stage directions. The demanding rehearsal schedules require five to six practices a week that last as long as four hours. But for many of the players, arduous scheduling is nothing new. Many of the students juggle multiple theatrical projects simultaneously in addition to a full Notre Dame courseload. "Ifanything, it has been more detrimental to my sleep pattern than schoolwork ... It's just as hard as playing a sport," says Molly Topper, who stars as Jake's adulterous second wife. 
With opening night drawing near, Tabor is excited about her first large-scale directing project. "The basic rules I learned in direct-ing·cfass really helped ... Plus, we have a 
, really talented cast," she says. Despite her 

. relative inexperience, she displays a certain comfort with all the players and holds little back when guiding their gestures and pre­sentation.

This year's performance will take place in the Lafortune Ballroom instead of the. more conventional Washington Hall venue. The idea is to present a "coffee shop style" setup, creating a more intimate and modem atmosphere with tlie goal of increasing at­tendance, though the concern is not with ticket sales.

Though Now You Wear No Seacap on Your Head 
Because the phrase "You1ve got a little Captain in you11 isn1t q\iite sexual 
For the past few days I have debated about what name to as­sign the five or six people who actually look forward to and read my column when it comes out, and for some reason I came to the conclusion that "chillins" is an appropriate tenn for my reader base. Regardless ofwhether it is or not, I think "OOB!ings" is a word that goes into territory we don't want to explore, and so I say to you, chillins, that spring is in the air and the school year is :finally coming to an end. Cross-quad Frisbee is once again in full bloom, "School Daze" strips about snow are now both untimely and excruciatingly painful to read and the seniors who haven't suffice to say he is best known for providing what is perhaps the most versatile alcoholic drink in the world. There is officially no liquid that a splash ofCaptain can't improve upon, and that includes other types of rum. And whom do the non-pirates claim as their notable representatives? German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Shakira. That's really about it. 
The piratical system ofjustice also far surpasses anything we have been able to muster as of yet in the United States. While America has crooked defense attorneys, ambulance chasers like Keller & Keller, and more judges with their own television shows than any­
come up with viable post-graduate employment-are-trying-to-find-one--should-be--subjected to, pirates have the plank. That's it. The careers whose titles don't involve the words "stripper," "fry cook," plank. There are no appellate courts, no mistrials and no studying 
or "assistant to Crispin Glover." And despite my best efforts to get McDon­aids or Mr. Glover to return my calls, I have yet to firm up any secure plans about what to do with my life after Monk makes me the proud owner of a $132,000 piece of card stock. 
I actually found a potential solution to all my vocational worries after seeing a play over the weekend. One ofthe main characters advises his hypochondriac spouse that losing an eye could be an avenue to a career in the exciting world of piracy. While the audience laughed, I seriously contemplated the prospect of creating a galleon of some kind and crnising around the wanner waterways of the world, extracting booty and women arid thumbing my nose at the

for the bar exam for three weeks straight. Pirates sail out for a few miles, drop the unfortunate victim into Davy Jones' locker and head back to their secret pirate hide­aways with the kind of satisfaction that only comes from a job well done. Also, pirates get secret hideaways. That's saying something right there. 
Piracy as a career doesn't even neces­sarily seem as demanding as your average desk job. I imagine that (aside from the wench-chasing and occasional sea fight) there's quite a bit of sitting around and laughing to oneself as booty is counted out and (if Captain Morgan is any indica­tion) posing with one's foot on a barrel of spiced rum, so the-physical aspect ofthe job isn't nearly as complicated as pirates would have you believe. An expensive 
tyrannical rule of that whoreson James I. Ever since my first ride through the air-conditioned wonderof Pirates ofthe Caribbean (soon to claim the dubious _honor ofbeing the only movie that God actually hates), I harbdred dreams of hearing the roar of the cannonball and the thrill of endlessly chasing wenches around a table demanding food and sex. Scoff at my ideas and my column for being petty and inappropriate in the face ofworld events ifyou must, but the bottom line is, pirates kick ass and you know it. 
Just look at the facts. Pirates claim among their members Long John Silver, the purveyor of some ofthe tastiest batter-fried treats this side of a Midwest state fair, and Captain Charles Morgan. Actually, Charles is just the name my friends and I came up with -ifhe has any first name, I'm almost entirely sure it's Captain. For the three freshmen not familiar with the Captain's body of work, Notre Dame education would fall by the wayside, as the educa­tion required for your average pirate seems to be little more than an understanding of the etymology of "shiver me timbers" and knowledge of the complete conjugation of the word "Ee-yar." 
There are, ofcourse, more benefits to the pirate life, but space constraints are bogging me down once again. Some may call it imbecilic that I've devoted an entire column to pirates, but, as I see it, it's no worse than devoting a Viewpoint letter to the rea­sons Jesus hates people who break parietals. I probably won't end up becoming a pirate, but I can always dream. I've recently acquired a parrot and bandanna. As ofnow, the bandanna makes me look like a monkey, and all I've taught the parrot how to do is swear at Bill Kirk in three languages, but even Blackbeard had to start somewhere. D

Farewell to Family 
Eve.ryone hash. eard ofNotre Dame. That being said, it's only natural that when people find out I'm a student here they ask why I chose Notre Dame. Chances are they're thinking of some idyllic image; the grotto, touchdown Jesus, the Virgin Mary sitting atop the golden dome. But my reason has nothing to do with those cliched notions. My answer is always the same; I came to Notre Dame because of the people. Now you're probably thinking my response is a cliche in itself, but think about it for a second. Think of the friends you've made and die relationships you've cultivated. Can you imagine what your life would be like had you not come here? I can't. I don't want to. From the moment I set foot on campus as a

character of the people _here was readily apparent. With each and every person I encountered, it seemed as though they were welcoming me into their home. I thought that then, and the last four years have only served to reinforce that belief. Without a doubt, it is the people that make this place great. The scenic campus is easy on the eyes, yes, but those that oc­cupy its buildings work the same way on the soul. 
The Admissions Office may have said it best. The saying "Nowhere else but Notre Dame" adorns every guidebook handed out to the high school juniors and seniors who dream of one day enrolling. The book does well to sell the quality ofthe "typical student," with its profile noting the high percentages ofincom­ing students who were class presidents, valedictori­ans, captains of varsity athletic squads and the like, but to really see what makes the "typical student" so special, one need only visit this place for just a few hours. There is no outsider. A palpable welcoming feeling exists, something that you can't quantify in a statistic. You can't express the dedication, honesty, thoughtfulness and moral character of Notre Dame students in a guidebook. You have to be there. You

have to visit. Notre Dame has one of the highest re­tention rates in the country, perhaps because students aren't really leaving their home, just relocating it. 
Although I'm always asked the question of"why," I've only once been asked the question of "what," more specifically, what did I learn at Notre Dame. My first urge was to think of the many hours spent in the classroom. As a psychology and economics double major I was tempted to speak ofFreud or the Gross National Product of Uzbekistan, but that just wasn't it. Sure, I learned a lot about these subjects. I could probably work professionally in either field, and you'd definitely want me on your team in Trivial Pur­suit when questions of those genres arise, but when I think ofthe learning I did in college, it's the things I picked up outside the classroom that I'll carry with me the rest of my life. In my seven semesters here on campus -plus one spent in London -I learned a lot about myself what I want from life and what I value most. And as much as I learned about myself, I've learned twice as much about the amazing group ofpeople I have come to call my friends. That's the knowledge that's most important. That's what col­lege is all about. I have had most of my classes in DeBartolo Hall but the things I'll remember most were learned on the quads and in the dorms. 
One of the great fears in life is to not appreciate something until it's gone. By now we've all learned that the things we treasure can be fleeting. It's the things we didn't treasure that we don't miss. I guess I'm glad I'm thinking thatway now. I'm taking time to appreciate how lucky I am, how fortunate we all are, to be surrounded by such gifted people. All year I've been looking to the future, applying for jobs in cities I've never been to, without fully embracing the moment and living in the present. I know that in the months and years to come I'll begin to fully appreciate what a wonderful four years I've spent at Notre Dame, but it's not something that needs to wait. Now is the time to start to appreciate this place. I'll live in the moment. The "missing" can wait until after graduation. Six more weeks to make memories worth another 60 years ofremembering. 
They're two questions, the "why" and the "what," but I guess there's really just one an­swer. People. They're why I came and they're what I learned about and they're why these four years have been the mos't memorable of my life. .
