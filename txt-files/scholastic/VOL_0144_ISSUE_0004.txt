Do You Smell What I Smell? 
The stench slammed into me like a brick wall as soon as I stepped outside my room into the close, dark hallway. My nostrils recoiled, my face scrunched up. But it only took a moment for me to recover. Darting over 
to the laundry basket, I slammed down the lid, cutting off the offending odor. Taking a deep breath of fresh air, I yelled to my brother to stop dumping his sweat-soaked clothes in the open laundry hamper. 
I didn't have to see him to know he was back from track practice -his smell preceded him. 
Of course, not every smell I associate with people or events sends me reeling. I am energized by the clean, fish-flavored scent that rolls off Lake Michigan in the summertime, carried on the wind to my nose before my feet ever hit the sand. And there's the rich, saucy aroma of my mom's baked lasagna that lures me to the table long before she calls us downstairs to dinner. 
And then, there are the scents of familiarity: Neither good nor bad, I could still 
identify the source blindfolded. There's the stale odor of crushed pretzel crumbs 
look for and spilled Coke that greets me whenever I slide behind the wheel of our old 
ISSUE 05 Chevy Lumina. Or the scent of day-old sandwiches and aging fruit mingled with 
on 
OCT31 sticky tables and chairs that rushes to my nose whenever I pull open the stiff doors to South Dining Hall. 
And, the most powerful olfactory reminder that I'm back at Notre Dame: The overwhelming, yeasty smell of ethanol. It's a kind of lesser-known ND legend, passed down by word of mouth. The freshmen soon catch on: It's not beer or bread, it's the ethanol. But the association stops there, as it did for the upper­classmen. Few, if any, know more than that about the factory that sits just a few miles from campus. Scholastic's Mike Borgia has the story of the infamous smell -and the rest of the plant -on page 14. 
No Place Like Home 
Notre Dame draws students from all over the nation -and 215 from countries across the globe, many of whom speak at least one language other than English. Annie Rohrs finds out what its like to be a Domer immersed in a different lan­guage, culture and educational system for what some say ought to be the "best four years of your life" on page eight. 
And, for all those artsy students, entertainment editor Carrie Sweeney talks to Domers who graduated with something other than a business degree and still found a way to make it in the real world. Read their stories on page 32. 
This is our last issue before Fall Break. Enjoy your road-tripping and home­town visits, and we'll see you on Halloween.

NOTEBOOK 

Life guarantees one thing besides death and taxes: television cop dramas. This 
ubiquitous genre has gone through incar­
nations from Dragnet to Homicide to the Law & Order franchise, but after awhile 
the dozens of hard-boiled cops and low­
life murderers mesh together. But a new 
type of cop drama has distinguished it­self from its competitors -the forensic investigators. 
In the wake of the success of CBS's C.S.I., the networks 
like Jordan, Miami
have tried to 

[C.S./.'s]storiesaren'tsimply and Trace simply
capitalize on the concept for ratings old genre plots revisited, but use forensic science to tell the same tired

twists. They're
CBS's C.S.I. Miami 
andCBS's Without a 

Trace. All three of these shows have 
established actors at the lead, but they all 
suffer from the same problem -a lack of 
science. 

What these shows don't get is what C.S.I. 
always has understood. C.S.I. succeeds 
because it gleefully embraces the geeky­cool science of death. The show follows a · group ofLas Vegas forensic scientists who 
"follow the evidence" to discover the 
murderers committing often-bizarre crimes. 
Using flashbacks and usually gruesome 
microscopic trips inside the victim's body, 
C.S.I. 's unique method of story-telling 
underscores the fascination with science. 
The show's cast, led by William Petersen as team leader Gil Grissom, is a group of eccentric characters whose intelligence and 
obsession with their jobs amounts to an 
almost religious worship offorensic science. 
Source: Judy Kendall, Circulation Supervisor 
While a show obsessed with forensic science sounds about as exciting as Giraffe Week on the Discovery Channel, the result is exactly the opposite. The combination ofa unique location and a cast ofcomplex, original characters (not a hard-boiled detective in the bunch) gives C.S./. a transfixing quality. Its stories aren't simply old genre plots revisited, but totally new stories told in a totally new way. 
Copy-cat shows 
essentially typical cop shows from a different angle. Little new material is offered aside from a semi-interesting scientific fact here or there. 
C.S./. doesn't just use forensic science to tell stories; it's a whole new way of approaching the cop drama. C.S./. has a style and rhythm that no other show has been able to emulate. Finger prints, blood-spatter patterns and mangled bullets are given new meaning, and almost become characters in themselves. 
Television has changed since Sgt. Friday tracked down criminal low-lifes. While network television might have even fewer guarantees than life, one thing is certain ...:._ audiences always will be looking for shows with a fresh 
angle and new take on the genre. D

Recent changes in the school dance policy left many students reminisc­ing about the good old days of in-dorm dances. After all, almost everybody has a great SYR story. They range from the scan­dalous -aparietals-free St. Ed's dance-to the notorious -the tabletop antics ofthat shy freshman down the hall -and for many, compose a large part of the Notre Dame ex­perience. But this year, the administration dumped the traditional SYR for out-of-hall dances. The aim was to make students socialize without the help ofhard alcohol, on a dance floor instead of in dorm rooms. But was it successful? Seventeen dorms held SYRs on the weekend of Sept. 27. Rectors seemed enthusiastic about the effects of the new policy, but many students fear the change will erode dorm spirit, as the sound of clas­sics such as Madonna's "Like a Prayer" and Billy Joel's "Piano Man" echoed not from Farley or Siegfried, but from places like South Dining Hall and the JACC. Prior to the dances, many hall commission­ers worried that the new restrictions would decrease ticket sales. O'Neill Hall, for ex­ample, was forced to cancel its SYR due to lack of participation. "I can't say (the cancel­lation) was due entirely to the new rules, but they played a big part," says hall president Joe Muto, a junior. "We were basically given a laundry list of rules, and I think a lot of stu­dents were concerned about being busted or not having a good time. 
''A lot ofpeople don't want to go to a dance for five hours without a break, and also feel like they're being watched by hall staff. That, to me, was what scared people away," he says. 
Knott Hall, Pasquerilla Hall East and Sorin College also reported lower attendance, cit­ing lack ofinterest as a main reason. PE sopho­more Janelle Beadle, who helped organize "Hot or Knott," a dance with PE's brother dorm, Knott Hall, made an extra effort to draw in a crowd. "It was a lot harder to get people to go this year than last;' she said. ''We tried

to make it a signature event, and really talked it up." Among other publicity ploys, the women of PE hung posters all over campus and, following the true tradition ofSYRs, set up their roommates. 
On the other hand, Farley Hall dance com­missioner Katy Ryan believes that attendance at their SYR was very similar to that of their SYR last fall. Farley's problem? "It was harder to keep people there for the whole time than last year. A lot of people left early," she says. 
Fisher Hall had an increase in turnout this 
year. "Having the dance in Fisher was fun and 
I will always miss it," says sophomore Carmen 
Forte. "But the dance this year was awesome 
. . . and the place made a difference." The 
Green Wave held their '70s themed dance at 
Beacon Bowl. 

Siegfried's Caddyshack dance garnered 
about 90 couples, also an increase from the 
previous year. Hall president Matt Palmer-Ball 
says this response proves that halls recognize 
the importance of SYRs. 

Sophomore Tom Gorman, a Fisher Hall 
dance commissioner, states that the new policy 
also greatly increased the amount of work put 
into SYRs. "It really takes an extensive 
amount ofhours to do this, especially in com­
parison to last year," Gorman says. "We're 
already working on our Christmas dance." 

Most venues, even after ticket sales, were too expensive for a dorm to afford on its own. As a result, many brother and sister dorms split the cost, and the dance, between them. The higher venue prices also forced students ·to plan ahead. "People bought tickets by Tues­day instead of Thursday," says Knott rector Brother Jerome Meyer, C.S.C. "The commis­sioners have to know they can afford the place 
they want to reserve." 

And what about problems with alcohol? 
With new rules prohibiting hard liquor and 
limiting pre-dance parties to 60 minutes, the 
administration hoped to reduce the number 
of ambulance runs to campus. 

Several rectors noted a decrease in alcohol­
related incidents this year. "The stepped-up enforcement was helpful in assuring some so­briety;' says the Rev. Paul Doyle, C.S.C., rec­tor of Dillon Hall. "This is the beginning of a lot healthier tone in the community." 

Candace Carson, Welsh Family Hall's rec­tor, believes the lack ofproblems at the dorm's Western-themeddance atAlumni-SeniorClub was due to the time limit on social gatherings. 
But many students did not agree with this assessment. Knott Hall president, junior Bill Bonner, says the new p·olicy had little to do with the fact that Knott had no drinking in­cidents at their dance. "There weren't any problems by luck, not because ofthe rules," he says. The time-limit on social gathering meant that students were trying to drink as much alcohol as they usually do -in a shorter time span. "Our rector generally doesn,.t let us go back up and party anyway; this justmakes getting to the dance less con­venient." 
Many women's dorms across campus also are used to restrictions. Beadle says, "For (PE), at least, the rules were pretty much the same. We could pre~party from 8:00 p.m. to 10:45." 
But students seem more concerned· about the loss ofdorm traditions. 
"In the past, each dorm could do something special that made their dance different from all the others," says Cavanaugh Hall sopho­more Danielle Reyes. "But now with such lim­ited options, a lot of the dances end up being exactly the same." 
Jmi.ior Tom Kerestes, Alumni Hall's dance commissioner, believes the new regulations will destroy the traditional Alumni Wake. "The Wake is a huge part of our dorm and we don't want to lose it," he says. "I don't know any way to go around this (change) and save our fun and tradition." 
Ryan thinks that Pop Farley also will be significantly affected. "We've done a really good job for the past couple of years and haven't had any ·incidents," she says, add­ing that the dorm feels "gypped," and that its good behavior has been ignored. She be­lieves the new regulations corrupt the idea of Pop Farley as a traditional dorm event 
"The stepped-up enforcement was helpful in assuring some sobriety. This is the beginning of a lot healthier tone in the com­munity." 
-Rev. Paul Doyle, C.S.C., rector of Dillon Hall 
centered around Farley Hall. 
Zahm Hall's commissioner, sophomore Darren Luft, worries that their Decade Dance also will lose its flavor. "I think when you move it outside the dorm, it becomes just another dance where people dress up funny, and I think that's what will happen to this tradition," he says. 
Some commissioners are concerned that SYRs not only will lose their dorm flavor, but also feel too much like they never left home. "(Our SYR) reminded me a lot of high school, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing since we're not in high school anymore," says Welsh Family Hall fresh­man Rose Brakel-Pierce. 
As some dance commissioners worry that their signature dances will fizzle, Forte and Beadle hope that their dorms 

· have begun new traditions. Fisher now calls its fall SYR: "Fish Bowl: Fisher Funk Part Deux ...We're Takin' This One Off Campus." Beadle says, "Last year we had the (PE) Prowl for the first time ­this year we're really hoping to establish it as a dorm tradition." Sophomore Maggie Benson, a dance commissioner for Cavanaugh Hall, says that while Cavanaugh always has had stricter rules, the policy changes will have a significant impact on dorms that usually host traditional events. "I think in the guys' dorms especially though, a lot of the traditional SYRs will have to be cancelled or at least drastically changed to meet the new guidelines," she says. "That seems to be discouraging a lot of students from getting excited about and 
attending dances." 
The effect ofthe policy change on popular dorm traditions like the Wake, Pop Farley, the Decade Dance and the Lewis Crush remains to be seen. In the past, the tradition ofthe SYR truly was something that could be found no­where else but Notre Dame. Has it lost its uniqueness and appeal? It is up to the students to decide. .

The windows of room 213 in St. Edward's Hall boast an ex­quisite close-up of the Golden Dome. "It inspires me," says Sean Williams, one of the four juniors living in the massive second-floor room. St. Ed's might be a small dorm, but juniors Wil­liams, Steve Garcia, Larry Hofman and Scott Sherwin see their room as cozy and convenient and can't imagine living anywhere else. Room 213 consists of three rooms: a social room, study room and bathroom. The social room has two orange-tinted couches, a blue chair and red carpet. The set-up centers around their old-school Nintendo and a TV hooked up to a satellite. A hallway leads from the social room to the study room. A door on the left side of the hallway opens into a huge walk-in closet, equipped with a built-in shoe rack. The door on the hallway's right side leads to an enormous bathroom that is -surprisingly -very organized and clean. Not only is it the only bathroom in a St. Ed's dorm room, it also might be the only bathroom on campus that sports a 22-inch TV. "It's really convenient," Williams says. "You can take a shower or brush your teeth and watch TV at the same time." 
In their study room, four beds are loft d to make room for desks and a futon. In the corner of the room sits 'the executive desk": two desks pushed together to make an angul one that Williams and Sherwin share. Sherwin also constructed a oft, level with their beds, to hold a third TV. There is even a "priv y curtain," to separate this room from the social room. The goal? 'To make sure that ev­erything fit right," Hofman says. 
The walls in each ofthe rooms are covered · th posters and signs, all with interesting histories. Two wall decorati ns are huge Michi­gan and Purdue flags that the men of213 "obtain d" after the home football games this year. 
The four roommates agree that their spread doe not feel like a dorm room. Sherwin says many people tell him it a ually seems like an off-campus apartment. Such a comfortable, welc ·ng feel­ing is exactly what they were aiming for. Sean says: "(The oorri) is set up so well that you can accomplish anything," such as, r ex­ample, fitting four refrigerators, three TVs and three couche into a two-room quad.

When the ethanol plant moved into South Bend 18 years ago, it brought more than a funky smell. Scholastic investigates the plant's effect on the town and its residents.

Driving along West Calvert Street, one can see the smokestacks of New Energy Company's etha­nol plant looming high over the houses. But for the residents who can't view the plant from their back­yards, a pervasive odor still makes its presence known. So, why does it smell? Is it safe? How does ethanol pro­duction benefit us? These are questions the citizens of South Bend have been asking since the plant began oper­ating in 1984. With the plant a mere five-mile drive from Notre Dame's campus, perhaps these are questions that students should be asking as well. Ethanol, a gasoline additive produced by fermenting com, has risen in demand over the last 30 years for envi­ronmental and economic reasons. Because it is manufac­tured in the United States from renewable materials such as com, ethanol reduces the nation's dependency on for­eign oil supplies, thereby lowering fuel prices for consum­ers and boosting the American economy. The development of fuel supplies that can be harvested from renewable sources will become increasingly important as the earth's supply of fossil fuels dwindle. To reap these economic benefits, in 1979, Congress established a tax incentive for blending ethanol with gasoline, which recently was ex­tended until 2007. 
Also, several recent studies have greatly contributed to the growing demand for ethanol. Evidence suggests that ethanol has the ability to reduce engiiie emissions of car­bon monoxide and other toxins because it contains oxy­gen that allows the fuel to burn completely. According to the American Coalition for Ethanol, IO-percent ethanol blends reduce carbon monoxide emissions by more than 25 percent, and are an "effective tool in reducing ozone pollution." 
Ethanol also has an advantage over its competing prod­uct, MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether). Just a small amount of MBTE can rapidly and thoroughly contami­nate large bodies of water. Consistent use of the additive has led to significant levels of ground-water contamina­tion and as a result, many states are trying to reduce MTBE usage -in favor of ethanol. · 
The South Bend ethanol facility, whkh is owned by the New Energy Co. of Indiana, began production in October of 1984. Its current annual production of ethanol is about 85 million gallons, making it the nation's seventh-largest producer of the gasoline additive. 
The plant produces byproducts as well: about 265,000

;' tons of distillers dried grains (DDGS), used as a staple 
· feed on dairy and beeffarms, as well as 150,000 to 170,000 tons of carbon dioxide, a significant portion of which is used by the food industry in carbonated beverages, as dry ice, and as a protective gas against bacteria in food pack­aging. To produce these goods, New Energy uses 31 mil­lion bushels of corn each year.

Not sur­f prisingly, it has been the nature ofmost complaints against tNew Energy from the residents of South Bend. Many won­Wctered where it comes from and whether it is dangerous. ~{ According to plant president-Nathan Kimpel, it isn't. ~::/ The smell comes from the drying of the distillers grains, lfthe byproduct from leftover com after its starch has been l\fconverted into ethanol (see chart page 18).

Figure Sc. Eachyear, New Energy produces 85 million gallons

But the smell itself is perhaps the least significant con­cern related to New Energy. In recent years, a more im­portant issue has been the dangers associated with breath­ing the odor-causing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released from the feed dryers. In a September 26 press release, the Sierra Club, the nation's largest environmen­tal organization, announced plans to file lawsuits against two ethanol facilities in the Midwest for violations of the Clean Air Act: Ethanol 2000 of Bingham Lake, Minn. and New Energy Co. of South Bend, Ind. The grounds of the suits are allegedly based on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) recent findings, which are derived from data from recent emissions tests. These tests reveal that "com-based forms of ethanol production ... are far more dangerous than had been suspected." 
According to Sanjay Narayan, staff attorney for the Si­erra Club, New Energy and Ethanol 2000 were found to be releasing VOCs and other _chemicals well above per­mitted levels. Two of the chemicals emitted are classified by the EPA as probable human carcinogens. Also, VOCs combine with carbon mono_xide to form ozone, which causes serious respiratory problems, including asthma and

lung diseases. 

Based on the test results, New Energy demonstrated a "clear violation" of the Clean Air Act, Narayan says. The Sierra Club's accusation extends beyond the facilities in question, however, as the EPA warned ethanol producers in an April letter that "most, if not all, ethanol facilities" were in significant violation of the law. "By the EPA's own admission, these two plants are only the tip of the ice­berg," explained David Bookbinder, senior attorney with the Sierra Club. 
Kimpel called the lawsuit a "moot point" and says that he has "no idea" why it was being filed. The federal EPA already has reached a settlement with 12 ethanol plants in Minnesota that will create a template for the industry in solving VOC-related issues. "We've attended numerous meetings with other ethanol producers and with Region five of the EPA [on this matter];' Kimpel says. 
But the lawsuit isn't the first time that New Energy has run into problems with the Clean Air Act. On June 30, 1999, the Indiana Department ofEnvironmentalManage­ment (IDEM) issued anotice of violation to New Energy for failing to analyze and install the best technology to regulate VOC emissions. 
Kimpel attributes this notice to a 1996 change in Title V 
16 SCHOLASTIC -COVER STORY 
of the Clean Air Act that established a new set of criteria for emissions testing, thus forcing New Energy to test vir­tually every source of emissions from the plant. 
"Prior to 1996, nobody in the industry, whether it was a brewery, an ethanol plant or otherwise had ever tested the emissions from their feed dryers," Kimpel says. "New En­ergy was the first in the nation to do this testing." 
What New Energy found was a level ofVOC emissions higher than that allowed by Title V. The plant released its findings to IDEM and was slapped with the 1999 viola­tion notice, Kimpel says, comparing the plant's action to turning oneself in for exceeding the speed limit. After New Energy's violation, he explains, the EPA began scrutiniz­ing all ethanol facilities to develop new ways to solve the issue ofVOC emissions. "The type of technology needed for solving these issues wasn't even dreamt of five years ago," he says. 
Unfortunately for New Energy, this was not the plant's last run-in with IDEM. On June 19,-2000, IDEM issued a notice stating that New Energy had failed to make arrange­ments to correct the 1999 violation within the allotted 60 days and therefore was required to pay a fine of $162,500. 
Just two months later, on August 11, IDEM issued an­other notice of violation claiming that, based on documen-
JO OCTOBER 2002 

tation submitted by the plant in 1997, New Energy was believed to be exceeding the allotted 100 tons per year ofVOC emissions. No follow-up documents were released by IDEM regarding this incident, but 
·· . Kimpel says that while the violations are based on seperate documents submitted by New Energy, both address the same emissions issue. 
... · Despite the impending Sierra Club lawsuit and i:JDEM violations, New Energy stands firm in the be­lief that its production methods do not compromise fair quality. At the beginning of the plant's construc­ftion in 1982, St Joseph County was a non-attainment }.area~ an area labeled by the EPA as being danger­\ously high in air-pollutants. Because of the contami­
·1-.: 

>nation level, emissions standards were extremely strin­:gent. Since then, the county has become an attain­\Inent area, and the regulations eased because ozone (emissions (a combination of carbon monoxide and /VOCs) are significantly lower today than they were '<io years ago. J Kimpel also says that the VOCs emitted by New 
Energy are not harmful. "While most people associ­,.~te volatile organic compounds with gasoline vapors, ... )he true definition ofVOCs is any molecule contain­'ning carbon ... We do produce volatile organic corri­tpounds, but we do not believe these compounds to be ')rnrmful." He cites the findings of a testing lab that (fxamined air samples from New Energy's feed dry­.:f.ers. The voes were mixed with carbon monoxide and { it was found that the level of ozone in the testing cham­} per actually was less at the conclusion of the experi­i}ment than at the beginning. The testwas run a total of 
\three times with the results remaining the same. ·· . "Irregardless, the regulations are on the books," ;£\impel says. "And we're going to install equipment that more than likely will cost an excess of $2 mil-

In September, South Bend Tribune columnist Nancy J. Sulok reported that residents of the 1800 block ofFassnacht Street "are distressed about the stink that has plagued their homes for the past several years." According to Sulok, "[the residents) can't relax on a warm evening on their porches or in their yards, because the smell makes them nause­ated." The smell, Sulok says, comes not from the air, but from the sewers. 
New Energy is skeptical of these claims. "The complaint in question came from a section of town that our sewage doesn't even go by," says Randall Chrobot, New Energy vice president of operations. Kimpel told the Tribune he feels the ethanol plant seems to be blamed for everything. According to him, the company treats its sewage to adjust the pH levels so it doesn't have an odor. 
Ken Zmudzinski, bureau manager of city wastewater, disagrees. He says that the plant's sewage does run east along Fassnacht Street towards Leland Avenue and ex­plains that the odor is "definitely worse where New Energy's sewage runs." He describes the odor as a distinct "com-like" smell. 
The wastewater released by New Energy contains a small amount of solids and is adjusted for pH levels so that they do not degrade in the sewers, Kimpel says. While he says that some solids, as in other wastewater, do settle out in the bottoms of the sewers, "It's a common practice of vir­tually all sewage systems that at some point in time you have to clean the bottom." 
To neutralize the high pH levels of the plant's waste, the plant was required to add sulfuric acid to its wastewa: · ter from approximately 1985 to 1995, necessitating fur~ ther treatment by the city's wastewater treatment plant. In 1987, the city increased New Energy's monthly sewage bill by $6,000 to pay for the additional process. While the acid did balance the waste's pH level, it also created a potent stench in the sewer system. 
In 1995, the city finally updated its wastewater facility to handle the naturally high pH level of New Energy's sewage. As a result, the city's Common Council unani-· mously agreed to let New Energy abandon the sulfur plan, thus raising the allowable alkalinity ofits wastewater from 
9.5 to approximately 12.5. This measure killed a signifi­cant portion of the sewers' odor-causing bacteria and re­duced the smell, says Zmudzinski. In 1995, John J. Dillon,

;Lio implement a solids-removal system by 2004. 
/ ·· Air and\vater problems aren't the full extent of com­J\:plairits against the plant. In 1996, some South Bend resi­\<dents complained to New Energy about a loud "whining" {' noise. Almost immediately, the plant had crews replace /the muffler on a smokestack on the plant's coal-fired power '.\'' plant. Officials also visited residents' homes to discuss the 8; issue.Although New Energy never was certain of the ex­f\. act source ofthe noise, the problem was resolved and resi­
f. :dents expressed satisfaction with the way the matter was handled. "It makes us feel better that they came out and that [the noise] has stopped," local resident Dorothy Th­ompson told the Tribune then. 
In spite of these problems, New Energy also has brought .many benefits to the South Bend area. Local corn farming income has increased by approximately $6,200,000 as a 
result of New Energy's high demand for the produce. Na­tionally, the ethanol industry has raised the national price of com by approximately 10 cents a bushel, and in areas local to ethanol facilities by as much as 20 cents. 
The plant has significantly boosted the local economy by employing approximately 135 residents of the South Bend area and up to' 190 truck drivers daily. New Energy also pays from $600,000 to $700,000 annually in prop­erty taxes and consumes a tremendous amount of goods and services from the community, including parts and maintenance items. 
The company also has rail services into the plant, which Kimpel says likely would have been abandoned. without New Energy. "This allows other business, such as the steel warehouse located directly north of the plant,which per­haps wouldn't be able to receive their raw material by rail · if we weren't here." In a city desperate for economic stimuli, these benefits are highly valuable. 
Still, the relationship between the town and the plant is an uneasy one. "We aren't your typical residential neigh­bor, so naturally there will be problems," Kimpel says. While the ethanol plant might never be South Bend's most popular resident, the community is looking to New En­ergy to make good on its promises to resolve the issues at hand.

All was going well, and the young sci­entist completed his lab work. Unfortu­nately, by a cruel twist of nature, he knocked his glass into the toilet as he was zipping up, and the protein sample was lost forever. 
This is the culture that parietals create. The Gipper advises all his readers not to take shots in Stanford. 
The Hildbold Section 
The Gipp would like to thank one loyal tipster updating him on a particular prob­
lem in the student section of the sta­dium. It appears, to the Gipper's over­whelming shock, that Notre Dame women do not go to the games to look at the male cheerleaders. You're probably asking, they aren't willing to act like groupies for the MCs, who else will they possibly do it for?" The answer is Joey Hildbold. A gang of girls has taken to waving their arms, calling 
two items, and are saving it as a prop for their next food-related the­matic celebration, ''National What's-in­Your-Sausage-Links? Month." 
Impotent Evidence 
Every so often there comes a tip that makes even the Gipp cringe. But the Gipper has his duty, come hell or high water, to report what he hears. Mama Gipp, if you're reading this, you might want to skip to the next one. 
The "Men of Stanford Hall, Section 2NS," as they cryptically identify them­selves, have been doing a bit of research lately. It all began with a debate over the human male's ability to produce procre­ative sap. "How do we stack up against gorillas and the like?" they pondered. 
A pair of young tipsters were stumbling back from a long night of intelligent conversation at that palace of style and sophistication, Turtle Creek Apartments, when they passed a pack of South Bend cop cars apprehending other home-going intellectuals. Playing it cool, the pair sidled by one of the cars when the one behind felt a sharp pain in his gut and let out an expletive. It wasn't until a few paces later that they were able to glance furtively back and see an SBPD side-mirror lying on the ground, freshly detached from its automobile. 
Well, Gipplings, that's it for this week. Thanks for the tips, and keep 'em coming strong.

A Team of Their Own 
The women's hockey team hits the ice for its second season 
JIMMYATKINSON 
or years they played with the boys.
F
Now, women hockey players at Notre 
. Dame finally have a team oftheir own. 

The Notre Dame women's ice hockey club was founded last season by 2002 graduate Stacie Green and law student Rebecca McCurdy. Before, women could only play on men's inter-hall teams-and many did. "Girls were playing inter-hall hockey with the boys for a while, so we knew there were players out there, myself included," says senior for­ward Allison Ricci, club president. "We'd see the girls at the rink and say, 'You know, why don't we have a team of our own?' So, we finally got one together last year." 
But not everyone on the squad has played inter-hall, or even comes from schools where the sport is offered. "We have a wide range [of talent]," Ricci says. "A lot of.girls have played before .... and then we also have a lot ofgirls who have never played before but are coming out to give ita try." 
For those who have played with the boys before, jumping from the men's inter-hall teams to an all-women's team was no small transition. ''Women's hockey is a completely different game than men's hockey [because] there's no checking:' says senior team cap­tain Heather Reilly. The no-checking rule gives players more space and time with which to work, creating a game with rriore finesse and set plays than the men's version. 
Another difference is in motivational strat­egy. "With guys you can use a little bit more of an in-your-face, 'go get-em, killer' kind of thing," say§ head coach Matt Bleecher, a senior on Siegfried Hall's hockey team. "With the girls, the best way to get them motivated is to focus everything on the team. As long as I keep emphasizing the team, they play hard." 
One of the biggest obstacles that Green and Mccurdy faced in set­ting up the team was finding suf­ficient funding. Hockey equip­ment is expensive, and just renting rink time costs the team $250 per week. 
Student Activities has given $3,500 to the team. But RecSports E Vi h 
will not fund the team mmy enec u until after its third season, Ricci says. (3). 


So, the players took on many ofthe team ex­penses themselves. Each player pays $250 in team dues -and that doesn't include travel expenses. 
Another difficulty with starting any new sports club is scheduling. Last season, the team played only five games. This year, it joined two club leagues -the American College Hockey Association (ACHA) and the Central Collegiate Women's Hockey Associa­tion (CCWHA) -to help establish itself as a competi­tive team in the eyes of RecSports and to alleviate the scheduling difficulties. As mem­:t. hers of the leagues, "It makes it a whole lot easier to schedule games with other teams," says senior forward Jenny 
Stahl. 
This season, the Irish have opened up 0-2 after losing to Western Michigaq in·consecu­tive shutouts, 10-0 and 4-0. But the two set-· backs haven't discouraged the team. One of the early difficulties the team faced was a lack offamiliarity with each other's playing hab­its. "Since a lot of us are new to playing with each other, we need to start getting together and working as a team," Reilly says. 
So far, many leaders have stepped up for the team. Along with Ricci" and Reilly, junior defensemen Emmy Venechuk and Elizabeth Klimek and sophomore defenseman Nell Ryan are the team's top players this season. 
By joining the ACHA and the CCWHA, the women's ice hockey team has gained competitive status, bui: at a price. Western Michigan already proved that the level of women's teams facing the Irish has im­proved up since last season. But with games against Northern Michigan, Oakland Uni­versity, Michigan and Michigan State still to be played, the women are optimistic that they have the potential to improve and be­come more competitive. 
For women hockey players, this is a golden age. The team might be years away from being considered for varsity status, but. being able to play for the Irish always will remain special for this group of women. "I love wearing that jersey that says 'Notre Dame' across the chest," Venechuk says. "It feels great." 0

IThe Rant Money doesn't dictate success in sports as much as people might think 
by Gerard Meskill -respond to the king of sports at gmeskill@nd.edu · 
Somewhere in America, Bud Selig is kick­ing himself. And somewhere in Minne­sota, Jim Pohlad is hanging his head low ~fter seeing the team he owns and tried to terminate advance to the American League Champion­ship Series. On the heels of its first labor agreement, Major League Baseball is in full swing as the postseason begins its second round. How­ever, all is not normal, or at least not how most baseball fans expected it to be. While it's true that the usual high-spending teams did advance to the playoffs -Atlanta, St. Louis, Arizona and the Yankees -many of them did not remain there long. ''The poor man's Yankees," Anaheim's nickname, coined by Angels' shortstop David Eckstein, defeated the real Yankees 3-1. The San Fran­cisco Giants eliminated perennial baseball powerhouseAtlantainthe decidingfifth game. And of course the cost-efficient Twins, the team that Selig and Pohlad wanted to destroy, outlasted cash-strapped Oakland in baseball's battle of the have-nots. Four series, four upsets. One could claim that this postseason is a fluke. However, the truth is, while the current revenue issue in baseball is unfair, it does not inhibit the less financially endowed franchises from compet­ing. The six highest payrolls in baseball over the last few years have been the two New York teams, Boston, Arizona, Los Angeles and Texas. Of these teams, only the Yankees and Arizona have made the postseason in either of the last two seasons. In fact, Texas and the Mets both finished last in their respec­contended for playoff spots but eventually fell short of clubs with much smaller payrolls. 
This is a phenomenon not unique to base­ball. Out of the National Hockey League's top 10 payrolls, three teams missed the 16-team postseason field, including the highest-paid New York Rangers. Meanwhile, Vancouver and Ottawa, two of hockey's 10 lowest pay­rolls, advanced to the playoffs. 
This is even more true in professional soc­cer. In the Spanish League, Real Madrid cur­rently is fourth in the overall standings. Out of team. However, egos often preclude team sentiments. Conversely, there is something to be said for clubs with strong chemistry. Case in point is the New England Patriots, a team vastly inferior in talent to its Super Bowl opponent, the St. Louis Rams. Despite over­whelming odds against them, the Pats pre­vailed largely due to the club's spirit. 
There are other reasons that more money doesn't guarantee success. It's like the old saying goes: "It's not the size that counts, it's how you use it." The hapless Texas Rangers 


The truth is, while the current revenue issue in baseball is unfair, it does not inhibit the less financially endowed franchises from competing. 
20 teams, this is not bad. However, Real's roster carries arguably the three best soccer players in the world in Renaldo, Luis Figo and Zinedine Zidane. To compare: Imagine if the Yankees carried Barry Bonds, Randy Johnson and Alex Rodriguez in addition to an other­wise solid lineup. That would almostmake the Yankees' advantage over the rest of baseball reflect Real' s over the rest of the Spanish League. 
There simply are more factors than payroll that determine whether a team will succeed. In the case of the Mets, it's obvious that the team had no chemistry. Manager Bobby Valentine had little-ifany-control over his overpaid stars, ahd the result was poor play, clubhouse scuffles and marijuana smoking. The same argument can be made for Real Madrid. On paper, they easily are the world's best soccer 
MEN'S SOCCER: After suffering a 1~0 loss to Pittsburgh at home last Friday, the Irish rebounded with a 1-0 victory over non-conference opponent Akron on the road. Junior midfielder Chad Riley set up sophomore defenseman Jack Stewart for the match's only goal. Stewart's goal was the first of his career, while Riley leads the team in assists for the third straight season. 

are an excellent example. These fools offered Alex Rodriguez $100 million more than any · other club, assuring that they would have no money to bolster their pitching rotation. They fired manager Jerry Narron after their last­place finish this season, but there isn't a man­ager in baseball woo could have made a con­
tender out of that roster of misfits. 

Despite all of this evidence, I'm not try­
ing to argue that teams with larger payrolls 
don't have a competitive edge. Such an 
argument would be stupid, because they 
obviously do. Just look at the Los Angeles 
Lakers. However, money alone does not 
ensure championships. Ask any player on 
any team ranking in baseball's top nine 
payrolls. They should have pl~nty oftime to 
answer, since t~ey're watching this 
postseason on television. D

Scouting the compet1t1on 
Notre Dame's upcoming foes will each present their own challenges 
GERARDMESKILL 

For those who have bought into the media buzz that the Irish will waltz into Tallahassee 7-0, here is 
a comprehensive preview of Notre Dame's next three football contests. If you don't know it now, you soon will re­alize that Pittsburgh and Air Force might be worthy of a little more attention than you thought. 
PITTSBURGH (5-1) 
» Series Record: Notre Dame leads 41­
17-1 » Oct. 12, Notre Dame Stadium, Notre Dame, Ind. 

Notre Dame has raced out to a 5-0 start, the best opening for an Irish season since 1993. To become 6-0, the Irish will have to put forth a stronger offensive effort against Pittsburgh than they did in last week's 31-7 victory over Stanford. 
Pittsburgh is one of the NCAA's best­kept secrets this year, and it would love to have a coming-out party at Notre Dame's expense. The Panthers have amassed 173 total points over six games 
(28.8 points per game) while allowing just 94 (15.7). In their last two games, they have averaged 42.5 points. Pittsburgh's lone defeat was a heartbreaking 14-12 loss to Texas A&M; in that game, the Panthers rallied from 14-0 in the fourth quarter. A missed PAT on their first touchdown forced the Panthers to attempt an unsuc­cessful two-point conversion on their sec­ond score. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that Pittsburgh could be a kick short of being undefeated. 
The Panthers will trouble Notre Dame's 
offense. Pittsburgh boasts a defense 
ranked eighth in the NCAA, which in­
cludes top-30 listings in eight defensive 
categories. To put that statistic in perspec­
tive, the highly regarded Notre Dame de­
fense is ranked seventh, and up to this 
point, the highest-rated defense the Irish 
have faced is Purdue's, which ranks 29th. 
The Pittsburgh defense is likely to slow the run-based Irish offense to a crawl. Against Stanford, the Irish depended heavily on their running game. The result was 249 rushing yards, including 100­yard performances from Rashon Powers­Neal and Ryan Grant. However, the Pan­thers' rush defense has allowed just 3.31 yards per carry, as opposed to the Cardi­nal, who have allowed 3.86 yards per carry. Pittsburgh's rush defense is led by defensive end Brian Guzek, nose tackle Tyre Young and linebackers Lewis Moore, Gerald Hayes and Brian Beinecke. 
Nevertheless,. the Irish will need their running game to win. To be able to estab­·lish the run, Notre Dame will need enough of a passing game to be a distraction. The Irish should be able to ex-plait Pittsburgh's second­ary. In what could prove to be a key matchup, Pan­thers' cornerback Torrie Cox is three inches shorter than Irish wide receiver Omar Jenkins. However, Notre Dame needs to re­member that pass defense

However, Pittsburgh relies more on its quarterback for offense than Notre Dame does. In a contest that will be decided by defense, the Irish secondary needs to re­main as sharp as it has been all season. The Panthers like to throw to split end Lamar Slade, who has four touchdown re­

with _the two men combining for six of 
Pittsburgh's eight aerial scores. At 6 feet 
4 inches and 6 feet 3 inches, respectively, 
the Panthers' receivers will keep Notre 
Dame's secondary busy. 
On the whole, Pittsburgh should not 
fare any better on offense than the Irish. 
Coming into Saturday, its offense ranks 
77th out of 117 Division-IA schools, while 
Notre Dame's places 104th. 
The contest should be a low-scoring af­
fair, which might be determined by spe­
cial teams and intangibles. If history has 
any say in the outcome, this is a good 
thing for Irish fans. 
AIR FORCE (5-0, No. 21 

AP, No. 19 ESPN/ ~---~Coaches.)__ _.__. ___ ____ ____ __--__ • 
» ·Series Record: Notre.Dame leads 20-5-0 
» Saturday, Oct. 19, Falcon Stadium,· 
Assuming a victory against Pittsburgh (a risky assumption to make), an Irish win over the Falcons would virtually assure that Notre Dame appears in the BCS top five. 
The outcome of this contest will be determined by which squad can establish ground su­premacy. Notre Dame's status as the fourth-best rushing de­fense will be tested early and often by the Falcons, whose of­fense relies heavily on the op­tion. While Air Force ranks second-to-last in passing of­fense, they boast the best rush attack in America. Falcon run­ning backs have amassed 1649 yards, for a staggering 5.42 yards per carry. 
Sixteen Falcons already have had carries this season. Six­teen. Four of them are averag­ing better than seven yards per carry. Eleven different players have at least one rush for more than 10 yards. Quarterback Chance Harridge leads the pack, with 351 yards on 81 car­ries and seven touchdowns. Harridge only has 40 pass at­tempts, which means he has run the ball more than twice as often as he has thrown it. So it is likely the vaunted Irish sec­ondary will be a non-factor against an Air Force team that has an ironic attachment to the ground.

Every wishful Irish fan who had the slightest belief Notre Dame could return to glory this season put a red circle on the calendar around Oct. 26. This is not just a matchup between two elite football teams; it is a clash between traditions. Notre Dame's program is the most cel­ebrated in the history of college football. The Irish lead the nation with 11 national titles and 93 consensus All-Americans. Florida State is the most celebrated program of the last 15 years. From 1987 to 2000, the Seminoles finished in the top five every sea­son, with national titles in 1993 and 1999. 
Every meeting between these two teams has resulted in a memorable contest, with all games in the series being decided by no more than a touchdown. Currently, the Irish are ranked a few places ahead of the Seminoles. Nevertheless, very few ana­lysts would concede Notre Dame the fa­vorite label, or for that matter even equivalent status, against a strug­gling but potent Florida State. 
Facing the Seminoles in a hos­tile Doak Campbell Stadium is not going to help the Irish either. Un­

Then of course, there's the Semi­noles themselves. Despite some · problems this season, Florida State is by far the strongest offense on Notre Dame's schedule, ranking 12th in the nation. They average garner both by the pass and by the run. Quarterback Chris Rix ranks 34th in the NCAA in passing efficiency, completing a little over 57 percent of his passes. Tailback Greg Jones ranks 22nd in rush­ing, averaging 105.5 yards per game. 

The Seminole offense is good at spread­ing opposing defenses thin, and veteran head coach Bobby Bowden runs an effi­cient game. Bowden, who has coached Florida State to 254 of the school's 404 all-time victories,.is likely to give first­year Irish head coach Tyrone Willingham his toughest strategic battle of the year. This is an uphill battle for Willingham, who faces a more talented team while treading on hostile ground. He'll need to out-duel the NCAA's second-winningest coach, a feat that many others have tried to accomplish in vain. 
In order to survive Florida State's of­fensive onslaught, the Irish will need their secondary to step up more than ever. Un­like other pass-dependent squads Notre Dame has faced this season, such as Michigan State and Stanford, the Semi­noles have a full arsenal of capable re­ceivers from which Rix can choose. His two favorites are flankers Anquan Boldin and Talman Gardner, who have combined for 751 yards and nine touchdown recep­tions. If Rix starts having his way, which means getting these two men the ball of­ten, then the Irish are dead. Notre Dame is incapable of standing toe-to-toe with the Seminoles in an offensive slugfest. 
The Irish need huge games. from each member of the secondary, and then some. 
Early picks off Rix by Walton and Duff will 
go a long way toward rattling the embattled 
quarterback, whose confidence has been 
shaken by a loss to Louisville and Bowden's 
somewhat inexplicable benching of him in 
favor of backup Adrian McPherson. 

Should the Irish succeed in bottling the 
passing game, they still will need to find a 
way to hold Jones back. The junior tailback 
is massive and quick, weighing in at 248 
pounds while running the 40 in 4.5. When 
Rix and.company start sputtering, Bowden 
looks to his big bruiser to grind out tough 
yards on the ground. The Irish must find a 
way to trip up his forward progression, since 
his power alone is enough for the Seminoles 
to generate offense. 

IfNotre Dame manages to answer the tall 
order offully containing one of the nation's 
best offenses, it stands a fighting chance due 
to the weakness of Florida State's second­
ary. The Seminoles are rated 102nd in the 
NCAA against the pass, allowing 260 pass­
ing yards per contest. If there was ever a 
time to exhibit a true West Coast offense, 
it's against Florida State. 

All season, the Seminoles have failed to contain opposing quarterbacks, and their secondary has been burned often, for an av­erage of 14.05 yards per completion. Florida State's rush defense is strong, however, so · Notre Dame's offense must rely on the qual­
ity of Holiday's arm. 

This is not the ideal for the Irish, but 
difficult tasks usually are not. If Notre 
Dame can muster the upset, there could 
be a sea of green at the Fiesta Bowl on

Westward, Ho! 
How I single-handedly killed all the bison in Wyoming 
T:ere comes a point in every man's life when he needs to realize that a simple hobby has become an obsession. For me, it was the moment I noticed that I was playing Oregon Trail in London when I might very well have been shop­ping at Oxfam or buying a Harry Potter book. What was once merely a revival of a seventh-grade classic had become a life-consuming activity. It was no longer enough just to get to the Oregon Terri­tory: I had to humiliate everything and everybody along the way, from my fellow classmates to the shady Indians who offered to help me ford the Snake River. For those of you not familiar with the Minnesota Educational Computing Corporation's little gem, be sorry you were educated in a "legitimate educational system" and not a public school where you have a computer lab consisting of 30 Apple Il's. The game challenged you to get to the Oregon Territory before everyone in your party offive ( and I swear there's a crappy series in there some­where) died of one of those hip diseases that were all the rage on the lone prairie back in the day .. Ideally, the game was meant to instruct students about the hard­ships that came along with mani­fest destiny in an effective and exciting manner. In actuality, we learned how to incorporate school-sponsored swear words into our eighth-period typing classes. What follows is a brief overview of the game that made students laugh, history teachers weep and the people who weren't your friends suffer at the hands of slanderous tombstones. You could begin the game as a banker, a carpenter or a farmer and the choice you made dictated how much money you had at the beginning of the game. Ifyou chose to be a farmer, you got the most points -,-ifand when you finished the game -but you were wise to save all your money for headstones, because your party was damn sure gonna be paralyzed by bad water, broken wagons, sparse grass and more snakebites than the off-Broadway revival of Antony and Cleopatra. Bankers got the fewest points at the end, but you could afford enough food to make it through the entire journey, and you finished secure in the knowledge that games where points were the ultimate goal went out of vogue with leg warmers and Bel Biv Devoe, Starting out from Independence, Mo., you proceeded along a more or less predetermined route towards the Oregon Territory, stopping only for genuinely life-altering events. Rivers, much to my extreme frustration, were life altering. You had to get across them somehow, and the options were limited to fording, caulking your wagons or bribing the Indians with smallpox-laden clothing. Caulking more or less worked, but there was always that IO-sec­ond period where you held your breath as ifeverything in your sad little life depended on making it across that deep blue something. 

Fording usually resulted in the loss of half your party, clothing, and bullets, but it brought up one of the best parts ofthe game: the tombstones. Ifeveryone in your party died, you got the privilege of erecting a tombstone with your party leader's name that every­one who played the game afterwards could read and mock. Not only was it fun for personal vendettas (name your party leader after someone you hate, give them one ox and start fording), but the epitaph option assured that everyone using the computer after you would know that "Kelly Winnet is a ho." 
But the good times didn't stop at poten­tial harassment suits. Since the program as­sumed that no one would buy enough food to last them until Oregon, it foolishly gave you a gun, bullets and what appeared to be a stormtrooper uniform, and ordered you to hunt your food 'just like the real pio­neers." Following this advice to a tee, I made sure to bring down three or four 1,000­pound buffalo with every turn of hunting. My little 4-bit man was only able to carry 100 pounds offood back to the wagon, leav­ing the plains littered with rotting corpses. Still, it gave me a sort ofsatisfaction to know 

that because of me the only buffalo my grandkids would ever see would be on the helmets of a sub-par football team. 
As fun as it was to destroy an entire ecosystem, the most nail­biting aspect ofthe journey came when you slapped your party on a raft and floated down the mighty Columbia, relying on your quick reflexes to avoid rocks, capsizing and Ned Beatty. Reaching Oregon, you were rewarded with a screen shot that looked re­markably like every other locale on your God-forsaken journey, and (if you were lucky), a place in the Oregon Top 10. 
Despite the game's simplicity, though, I'd be lying ifI said we didn't learn valuable things from it. For example, whenever one of my friends starts whining about a "broken leg" or "dysentery," I tell him to suck it up. After all, when he dies, it means an extra three pounds of food a day for me.

The bawdy side of Machiavelli you've never seen 
MOLLYGRIFFIN 

The Mandrake is a wild, bawdy comedy full of crude jokes and innuendo written by Niccolo Machiavelli centuries ago. Yes, the same Machiavelli who wrote the ultimate trea­tise on totalitarian government also wrote this play about a guy just trying to get laid. The Mandrake, which opened Wednesday at Washington Hall and runs through this weekend, doesn't exactly derive its appeal from intellectual themes. "It's vulgar, immoral and blasphemous. 
It's a man's show, and it's very funny," says junior Katie Kertez, who plays Sostrata, the heroine's mother. 
The play follows the young gentleman Callimaco in his quest to sleep with the beautiful Lucrezia. The fact that Lucrezia is married to the dim-witted and much older Nicia doesn't stop Callimaco from pursuing his lust, er, love. Upon discov­ering the couple's infertility, he devises a plan involving mandrake root to obtain what he wants. The translation used in this Mainstag·e production was done by Wallace Shawn, best know for delivering the line "Inconceivable!" in The Princess Bride. Shawn did his best to ensure that every dirty joke and sexual innuendo writ-

ten by Machiavelli in 1518 comes out loud and clear today. 
The play is based loosely on another Italian story, The Rape of Madonna Lucrezia. Written while Machiavelli was exiled, The Mandrake satirizes many of the author's contemporaries. The stock characters and barely believable plot line also poke fun at other plays, politicians and stereotypes of the time. Notable ex­amples include the money-hungry clergy­man who sells forgiveness and the lusty, overbearing widow with a big voice and a bigger behind. 
Originally presented at a family wed­ding of Machiavelli's patron, the power­ful Borgia family, The Mandrake is regu­larly performed at Italian drama festivals. This Mainstage production is its first per­formance on campus. The Film, Televi­sion and Theatre department faculty chose the play to give students, performers and the audience a different kind of dramatic experience. "It's a big divergence from what I normally cio," says director Siiri Scott, also an FTT faculty member. "I tend to stick with realism. This is presenta­tional versus representational." The play's broad humor, ornate staging, and the fact that it isn't Shakespeare makes it espe­cially distinct from the other plays in the Mainstage production lineup this season. 
10 OCTOBER 2002 
In keeping with its Renaissance ori­gin and style of comedy, everything about the production is big, broad and larger than life. A $50,000 stage rented from the Summer Shakespeare pro­gramplaces the play in a world of Crayola-worthy hues and sets the tone for the rest of the production. "It's the most bombastic set Mainstage has seen," says junior Tom Conner, who plays Callimaco. 
Opulent cos­tumes created by Richard E. Don­nelly and actors chosen for their ability to play the comedy's broad charac­ters add to its overall_"bigger is better" ef­fect. "It's carried by lavishness. It's funny and lively," Scott says. 
Because the plot is so simple, the actors' understanding of.their characters becomes especially important. Sophomore T.J. McNally explains how he adapted to play­ing Siro, Callimaco's servant: "Every night one person would get.five minutes to make

me do whatever they want. One night the whole cast got one minute each." 
Junior Sean Nelson takes a somewhat more internal approach to playing the fawn­ing Lugurio: "I well up all my anger and use that to push me along." In order to portray the single-minded lust of Callimaco, junior Tom Conner says, "I picture someone gor­geous, beautiful and use that visual. I go from personal experience." 
Some roles required more physical adjust­ments than changes of character. "I put on a lisp," senior Jeff Eyerman, who portrays Nicia, states. "My character is basically an 80 year-old man. I hike up my pants, and that's basically it." Junior Katie Kertez had to warm up her "big, booming, manly voice" and learn to "stick (her) butt out" in order to play Sostrata. On playing the part of Lucrezia, Holy Cross studentAmanda Greco says: "I play the most beautiful girl in the world. My character is very naYve, imma­ture, so I spend a lot of time in hysterics, mostly whining and crying." 
Scott doesn't want the audience to take away any particular message from the pro­duction. "It does what it will," she says, "It's not hardcore about one thing and one thing only. I want people to come out en­livened and excited." · 
The cast had their own ideas about what in the play would appeal to Notre Dame stu­dents and other members of the audience. 
10 OCTOBER 2002 
MEN IN TIGHTS Actors (from left) T.J. McNally, Tom Conner, Sean Nelson and Jeff Eyerman deliver crude jokes and innuendo. 
"Sex, obviously. Kids love sex jokes," Eyerman says. "It's cheap, on campus, and you'll probably have to come for an En­glish class. It will make it seem as if you are a cultured individual." 
"It's short and funny," Nelson adds. ''There's lots of sex; you might as well call it The Penis Monologues." 
The Mandrake stands on its own as a comedy-some cast members put the hu­mor on par with an Adam Sandler movie -and should prove to be a wild departure from more mundane productions. T. J. McNally sums up the show succintly: "You get in, get your laughs, and get out. Nobody dies, and there's a statue of a na­ked man. Everybody gets what they want." . 
Pe1formances of The Mandrake will run from Wednesday, October 9 through Saturday, October 12 at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday, October 13 at 2:30 p.m. in Wash­ington Hall.

The life of an art major clearly is not typical at this profes­sionally-minded school, and often, most stu­dents' only impression of the artists in their midst is that they tend to smoke a lot on the steps of Riley. But, once inside, past the steps, a very different and refreshing lifestyle is immediately apparent. These people aren't business majors, and they have no problem with that. "I won't feel like a failure when I leave here without a job in Chicago at an account­ing firm in May," senior BFA major Annie Nagengast says. "For us, as art majors, there's no set plan -we could end up with business jobs, or we could be doing some­thing totally different. I don't set strict bound¢e~.f9r.

program for art students. BA students, on the other hand, can take advantage of the fewer requirements to double majorin a non­art subject. Regardless ofwhich degree they pursue,Jrrt._ students, as well as the writers and musicians over in O'Shaughnessy and Crowley, face·a coirunon question from rela­tives, friends and even themselves: ''What are you going to do with this?" 
The post-graduate benefits of an arts de­gree indeed are anything but certain, as grads find themselves in a variety ofsituations af­ter leaving ND. "One girl from last yearjust wanted to teach high school art, so she's doing that," Nagengast says. ''Another BFA girl is in Colorado with a regular day job and doing art after hours. Another's at grad school in San Francisco. Another's in Chi­cago and started as a photo assistant, and now gets a lot of important freelance work. A kid from a few years ago is out in NY and is the creative director for a sports maga­zine, and there are a few atWhirlpool doing advertising and product development." 
Other arts alumni have similar stories. Kara Zuaro, a 2001 grad, double majored in film and English, and was involved with the StudentFilm Festival, Scholastic magazine, the Sophomore Literary Festival, the Jug­gler and two literary radio shows. After graduation, she moved back home to New York to write and listen to music and be an artist. But that didn't exactly happen. 
''The sad part of the story is that when I graduated, even though I had all this stuff on my resume, I still couldn't get a job. I temped until November, and then landed a horrible corporate secretarial position," Zuaro says. 
Though her story might seem heartbreak­ing, Zuaro insists that it's not. In fact, she views it as almost a necessary rite of pas­sage. ''There's nothing wrong with strug­gling for a few years aftercollege," she says. "It's romantic in a way." And things do get better. Currently working at an agency that connects lecturers with organizations by day, Kara_ still writes at night, exhibiting a com­mon double-life trend among arts grads. "My job_is what makes it possible for me to live where I do and write on the side. In a

The success stories of grads like Zuaro, Lang and Mendenhall, as well as the strength of ND's art faculty and program, however small, offer continuing reassurance that the long nights are worth it. 
"I don't think there;s a professor in Riley who I don't know," Nagengast says. "You walk around barefoot, with crazy makeup on for some photo shoot, and it's all nor­mal, and everyone tningles. They do any­thing from give you awesome recommen­dations for grad school to help you assemble a portfolio and resumes and apply for grants." 

Zuaro agrees that the support system within ND's art community is key, and not necessarily common. "ND was great be­cause ofthe networking. If you went some­where else like NYU, you'll know more people in the city, but there's not the cama­raderie -it seems that they compete more with each other."

It was the first sport to have a world championship game. According to the Billiard Congress of America, billiard champions have the highest average age of any sport ­
35.6 years. And pool is one of the safest sports in the world! I think ND needs a billiards team.

What We Worked For 
Writing personal correspondence for one of the highest-ranking execs in America was fun, as were the lunch breaks when the elderly Japa­nese staff would corner me in the kitchen and ask me why hamburg­ers were so large in America. 
KaraZuaro, a fonner Scholastic editor and Gipper, graduated in 2001 with an FIT major. She is now working to live in New York City. 

Ispent much of the. last year working for corporate Japan, which nearly drove me to dive off the Brook­lyn Bridge. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't have lasted half as long in the clutches ofcorporate America. I was thankful for the language barrier. Combined with my English and film production degree, it al­lowed me to create imaginary subtitles as I gazed at my superiors, who shot Japanese back and forth like Ping-Pong. This kept me vastly entertained for months of stuffing envelopes. Plus, we had an un­limited supply of green tea in the kitchen. What more could a recent Arts & Letters grad hope for? Unfortunately, what was supposed to be an easy day job to fund my writing career quickly became the sec­retarial job from hell, or Tokyo, depending on how you look at it. It started out innocently enough. The first time I met my Japanese boss, I told him where I went to school, and he asked me if I saw the movie about the hunchback. "No, I do not mean France," I said, slowly. "I went to the Notre Dame in Indiana." He smiled and said, "Ah, Rudy!" I knew we were going to get along just fine. Despite the fact that my interaction with the higher powers of my company was generally limited to their nods and my awk­ward head-bops, the Notre Dame thing designated me as the gal who got to single-handedly run five divisions of th~ corporate communications depart­ment without a raise. Writing personal correspondence for one ofthe high­est-ranking execs in America was fun, as were the lunch breaks when the elderly Japanese staff would comer me in the kitchen and ask me why hamburgers were so large in America. ("Do you think the big ham­burger look more gorgeous?") But you know, when combined with 10-hour days ofmaking travel arrange­ments, faxing documents that I couldn't read and up­dating online calendars, these cute cultural exchanges weren't that funny. All joking aside, though, however bitter I may have been about the menial labor I was burdened witl1, I did learn a lot at this job. Long nights of sound editing in the attic of O'Shaughnessy trained me to appreciate the metered Japanese that I heard all day, spoken like percussion, without the sing­songy inflections of my native English. I spent lunch breaks with Japanese literature. I tried shrimp

shumai and sweets made with beans. At times, I hoped to find the strength to climb the corporate ladder to where no American woman has gone before. But I've always known that I wasn't cut out for a life of long hours, suits and cubicles. 
Let's face it. I was even artsier than the aver­age Arts & Letters kid. I didn't comb my hair or eat red meat. I changed my pants possibly once a week, sighed during foreign films and went to literary readings for fun. All I ever wanted was to live in New York City, but in order to afford an apartment in my favorite ·Brooklyn neighbor­hood, I needed the sort of cash that freelance writing just wasn't going to provide. 
So I work full-time and make time to write. I started small, interviewing little-known musicians for indie rock webzines, and moved up to review­ing records for magazines you can get at Barnes & Noble (if you know where to look.) Though I landed a full-time position at a well-respected speakers' bureau, I'm not making enough money to enjoy the city's finer points out of my own pocket. Thanks to creative thinking and a little luck, though, I'm pres­ently expensing checks at bars and restaurants and getting paid to write up entertainment profiles for art internet directory. 
When the going gets tough, I rush out of work into a beat-up Jeep filled with my friends. We strip off our suit jackets, crowded like quintu­plet Clark Kents in a phone booth on wheels, but we change into hooded sweatshirts instead of capes. We fly up 5th Avenue to catch an anar­chist punk-rock show at a little liberal arts col­lege in Bronxville. The.band is called Against Me! and their opener is a folk song spiked with electric guitars. It's called "What We Worked For," and it gives us something to think about on the subway the next morning. 
I do my best to measure my days in sights and smells and tastes and sounds, rather than count­ing the hours that I spend at the office. I find my Zen in pockets of air as I walk down the street, in the thick sandalwood smoke of a sidewalk in­cense vendor, the salty stench of fish near an outdoor market, the breath outside a Laundromat, the puff of air that passes with a woman in pointed shoes and reminds me of my old roommate's perfume. 
In a memory fresh as yesterday, I see her in our freshman dorm room, jumping through a cloud of her scent, into work and love and the dizziness of the future. D
