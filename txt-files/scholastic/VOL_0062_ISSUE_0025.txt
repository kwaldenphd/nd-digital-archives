orty-two years ago nation-wide telephone service was forecast in these words,
. the lines of this association... will connect... each and every city, town or place... with every other city, town or place ...in.,, the United States...”
From the American Telephone and Telegraph Company’s Charter, March, 1885
This map shows some of the more distant points in the United States actually called during a recent week by telephone users in Indiana.
Thousands of other long distance calls are placed daily to points throughout Indiana and neighboring states. Seventeen million telephones in seventy thousand cities and towns are within call of your telephone at any time.
Never was the service faster. The recent improvements in long distance service within the state and to many distant points has greatly increased the speed of the service.
The rates have been reduced and you can now call collect on Station to Station calls.

Spring
comes to
Duneland
*
Soon all the birds will be back in Duneland, Indiana Dunes State Park. The snows are gone now, and the great ice formations along the lake are likewise. If you are optimistic, you might say spring is here.
It will be spring flower time— the lupine will be on the old forest trains. If you have ever wanted to see the Dunes at their wildest, the time is on the way. The first day you have, put on your outing togs, pack a lunch or have one put up for you at Tremont station, and tramp the Park. You’ll see Mother Nature in the midst of her spring housecleaning.
It is an easy matter, by South Shore Line. Take a train at Michigan Street and LaSalle Avenue, direct to the gateway. Trains every other hour — ask Mr. Veach at 2-5764.

The Notre Dame Scholastic
Professional training is placed on trial with the appearance of this issue of the Scholastic. Dr. John M. Cooney’s embryo newspaper reporters, editors, and column conductors, to prove theii- fitness for future journalistic eminence, have gathered, written and edited every word of copy contained between the covers of this issue. They crave criticism whether it take the form of brick-bats or flowers. There may be another Horace Greeley or Charles A. Dana among them. The week’s ten-thousand-dollar reserve fund fox’ beauty prizes will be voted to the reader who can do the gypsy act and choose the next editor-in-chief of the New York Times from among them.
The Salon Royale with Texas Guinan as chief hostess and Helen Morgan as publicity agent could not have put on a more entertaining affair than did the Notre Dame Knights of Columbus a week ago to-night. Chairman George Brauti-gan, Grand Knight Edward McKeown and their assistants, should be credited with extra base hits for bringing Broadway color and Hollywood pageant queens to Notre Dame. One point pertaining to the occasion, however, bothers us. We wish to take this opportunity to make it more clear. The write-up of the dance in last week’s Scholastic reported the guests as coming from St. Mary’s College, South Bend, Chicago, Indianapolis, and other nearby places. Other nearby places, meaning to imply our neighboring^towns of Omaha and Denver to the west of us and Buffalo and New York east of us.
The annual scramble for favored rooms is about to begin. Low numbers, unlike low grades, bring the prizes. Sophomores will again try to “rate” a room in Corby, Badin, or Walsh. Juniors, recalling their own very unsuccessful efforts of a yeai- ago, will watch their attempts with more or less intelligent grins. Next year’s Seniors, knowing their social status in their last year, must depend on “Old Lady Luck,” pessimistically mutter that they never have been lucky and most likely will draw a number above four hundred,—and what chance has a number above four hundred to get a room in Sorin Subway.
Bulletins for the third quarter are about to be mailed to the folks back home. Most of them will be on just plain white paper and will bear a simple and pleasant message to a place where simple and pleasant messages of this kind are most appreciated. A smaller number will be colored, after the manner of a street car transfer, or a hand bill, and will be worth no more to the recipients. The Freshman who thought the biggest moment in history had arrived when he packed his trunk and left home to seek scholastic fame at Notre Dame will return in June with a wild tale of the strange effect Indiana weather, Indiana politics, and Indiana girls have on ones’ ability to get passing grades. Study, of course, will not be mentioned, for who can study under such irritating conditions.
Thesis due May 1, Senior Ball May 10th, invitations to be mailed, final examinations, graduation exercises, and then the dreaded search for a job; such are the major points in the program of the Senior for the coming six weeks. Wails
and groans accompany the unsteady click of a typewriter in Sorin Hall as an unfortunate procrastinator struggles to muster the required number of intelligent words from the mass of notes around him to put together a presentable thesis. Now a pause, then a few sharp clicks, followed by a low gutteral moan from the operator as he punches the wrong key. A furious erasure on an original and three carbons and finally, a scr.aping of his chair as he pushes it back and quits, silently hoping for “something to turn up.”
The brightest spot in his program is the approach of « what reports will describe as “the greatest Senior ball in Senior ball history.” The almost baccalaureates are occupying themselves with elaborate preparations, the least of which is not filling out blank checks with the carefree abandon of a California real estate operator or a Chicago bootlegger. Tuxedos must be cleaned and pressed. Shirts, studs, and . suspenders must be borrowed. The one and only girl must I be notified when to come, how to come, (Packards and Cadillacs preferred) where to register, what to wear, and when to leave.
The Knights of Columbus, planning tox dig up what remains of the Erskine golf links, have appointed Charles Hanley as chairman to arrange details for a tournament. Advance regulations for the benefit of those Knights expecting to take part are given out as follows: Each player must have a golf sack. Each sack must contain at least one club, not cracked, and at least one ball. When the club breaks or the ball is lost the player is eliminated. Players will be penalized five strokes for every square foot of turf turned up. Raymond P. Drymalski is the Week’s choice to win. He has steel shaft clubs and a score or more golf balls.	x
Marble tournaments, crochet, ping pong, and lolling about the grass, together with minor sports of football, baseball, tennis, golf, and swimming are drawing the book worms out of their rooms into the great open spaces. Knute K. Rockne, nationally known writer, former chemistry professor, and sometimes mentioned in connection with football, continues his series of noon-day lectures in the north room of , the Library, illustrating them with a pigskin on Cartier field at 3:30 p. m. daily. Extra base hits and double plays have been the objective of the baseball men in the past week. Students of Walter Hagen and Bobbie Jones are returning to the campus in the evening to tell of “going around in 86,” being careful not to mention the Studebaker golf course as the place where the score was made.	1
Editor-in-chief, John V. Hinkel, cautioned us in no uncertain terms when we were assigned to write the Week, that under no circumstances was. it to exceed twelve hundred words. Unknowingly, John was flattering us. Ere half the article was written we were convinced that the English language did not contain twelve hundred words. Our admiration, and sympathy too, go out to Mr. Archer Hurley, who is	*
the Week’s regular conductor. He is Notre Dame’s unsung	1
hero. Finding time to read his Ethics and Sociology after preparing the Week entitles him to nomination for the Scholastic Hall of Fame.	—Clinton H. Faille. i

BROTHER BARNABAS, N. D. BOY GUIDANCE DEPARTMENT FOUNDER, DIES
Brother Barnabas, F.S.C., LL.D., founder of the Knights of Columbus Foundation in Boy Guidance at the University, and recognized by all denominations as a foremost authority on boy leadership, died last Monday morning, April 22, at Albuquerque, N. Mex., of the infirmities of old age. He was seventy-five years old.	*
After forty years of persistent effort to impress upon the school faculty that men who are to deal with boys should have adequate trainnig, Brother Barnabas founded the Boy Guidance Department at Notre Dame in 1923. The Knights of Columbus of South Bend in that year came to his aid in establishing the school, now recognized as one of . the leading guidance departments in the world.
la>.Brother Barnabas established summer school courses in ongtt1' nadership, the Thirty-hour course in “Boyology,” the nan Squires and the Boy Life bureau. He had been - The
a
actively identified for the past thirty years with numerous organizations. Prominent among these are the Boy’s Club federation; Boy Scouts of America; American Recreational Association; National Big Brothers; Woodcraft League of America, and the Boy Rangers.
He has established homes for working boys in New York State and it was in one of these homes that he spent most of his time before going to Notre Dame in 1923. Brother Barnabas had lectured before men and boys of Canada and this country propounding his remarkable views on boy leadership and was recognized as an outstanding authority on “Boyology.” Until his death he was engaged in the promotion of welfare work.

INTERVIEW WITH DR. COONEY, APRIL “WRITERS’ DIGEST” FEATURE
An article featuring an interview with Dr. John M. Cooney, director of the department of Journalism at Notre Dame, in which he discussed the modern tendency to commercialize the press, appeared in the April number of the Writer’s Digest. Making the reporter serve the ends of the advertising department will “kill the goose that lays the golden egg” is Dr. Cooney’s opinion. Specializing to “produce on the basis of economic efficiency” will discourage the reporter in his effort to be creative, which is so necessary to journalistic development.
The reporter who would learn the fundamentals of journalism must today get his experience in the newspapers of the small community. Only here can he find the opportunity to study all the problems of a newspaper. Commercializing the press, as is the tendency of metropolitan papers, makes the reporter a machine, destroying the human quality which should be found in his writing.
“People want truth, human qualities and real feeling in their news .... We are working with human beings and not with raw material of a manufacturing plant,” concluded Dr. Cooney in reviewing the dangers resulting from the practice of industrializing the press.

PROF. HOYER SPEAKS AT DOWAGIAC FATHER-SON BANQUET
Professor Ray Hoyer, of the Boy Guidance Department at the University spoke at a “father and son” banquet held at the parish hall of the Holy Maternity Church in Dowagiac, Michigan, last Tuesday evening. The affair was sponsored by the Scout Troop of the Church in conjunction with the Knights of Columbus.
Professor Hoyer was accompanied by several members of the St. Joseph Council Troop Committee, including Rev. J. M. Brannigan, C.S.C., assistant pastor, who spoke about the work of the St. Joseph Boy Scouts.

MEN YOU KNOW
Alexander Wolcott once learned the whereabouts of a
DR. JOHN M. COONEY
certain bashful poet for Deems Taylor, after the latter had given up the search in desperation, by the ingenious device of looking up his name in the telephone book. But by no such simple expedient can the curious track Dr. John M. Cooney, head of the Journalism Department, to his lair, and learn to. know him as he is known to that esoteric group who gather about his rostrum in the Journalism Room of the Library. At best this sketch, like the telephone book can only report the superficial things. If you would really know Dr. Cooney take Journalism. (adv.) Dr. Cooney was born in Louisville, Kentucky. He received his A.B. from St. Mary’s College, Baltimore, in 1^5, and his A.M. from the same school in 1896. Returning to Kentucky he was owner and editor* of the Nelson Record and special correspondent for the Louisville Herald. He also helped the Reverend George M. Connor to put out the Midland Quarterly Review.
In 1905 he returned to St. Mary’s as an instructor in English. He was president of Columbian College, Owens-bmy, Kentucky, from 1906 until 1911 when he came to Notre Dame as an instructor in English and History. In 1917 he received his Ph.D. here.
When Dr. Max Pam endowed the School of Journalism in 1912, Dr. Cooney was made head of the department. He has been here in that capacity ever* since.
His activities have been many and diverse. The Scribbler’s club first saw the light of day in the Doctor’s Office, and it was he who guided it through those first awkward years so dangerous to babies and literary societies. In the face of a discouraging indifference on the part of some of the journalists (we are not mentioning any names) he has struggled to keep successive Press Clubs alive. This year the organization is doing nicely, thank you. Not only has the Press Club had a group picture taken for the Dome but it is common gossip that, its solvent members, if any, will soon be sporting watch charms.
One would think that after teaching classes at Notre Dame and the institution across the road, an ordinary mortal would be willing to call it a day and close up shop. But Dr. Cooney is no ordinary mortal. He had found time to write an excellent novel about life in Kentucky called “Hills of Rest,” and he is also a regular contributor to various magazines and newspapers.
In conclusion, with humble apologies to Vanity Fair, we would like to nominate Dr. Cooney to our Hall of Fame. Because we never once saw him lose his temper although the gods know he has been sorely tried; because for some uncanny reason he always keeps the windows of the Journalism
Room locked; because the men in his classes affectionately call him the “Doctor”; because he calls everyone “Brother”; because his office is a place where professorial condescension is laid aside and the student is treated like a human being; and because he is a typical southern gentleman in every sense of the word.	—F. M. f.

UNIVERSAL N. D. NIGHT FEATURED BY BANQUETS AND RADIO PROGRAMS
With Notre Dame men all ovex* the world and radio stations throughout the country acting in whole-hearted cooperation, the sixth annual celebration of Universal Notre Dame Night, last Monday, April 22, went off with a bang that was heard almost everywhere in the country.
According to word received by James E. Armstrong, Alumni Secretary, from the secretaries of the various clubs, more than sixty organizations joined their* hands across the United States to renew and cement the friendships of their* college days, and to “shake down the thunder” in cheering the name of their Alma Mater.
For those who were unable to take part in any club gathering, the aid of the radio stations were enlisted, and Monday night saw the air* filled with Notre Dame melodies. Tire National Broadcasting Company, the American Broadcasting Company, and fourteexr minor stations gave theii* support in the broadcast.
From the reports which have come in to Mr. Armstrong, the Night was observed by most of the clubs with banquets, speeches, moving pictures, and other entertainments. The general feeling is that “it was the biggest Night ever.”
On the campus the event was celebrated by a special meal for the students and by a banquet for the Alumni of St. Joseph Valley. At the latter, speeches were made by the Reverend Charles L. O’Donnell, C.S.C., president of Notre Dame, the Reverend John Cavanaugh, C.S.C., former president of the University and Knute K. Rockne, director* of Athletics at Notre Dame. Music fox* the banquet was furnished by the University orchestra under the direction of Professor* Joseph J. Casasanta, acting head of the department of Music.

BAND TO APPEAR IN THREE CITIES ON ANNUAL SPRING TOUR
The Notre Dame Band has completed arrangements for its annual spring tour according to an announcement made this morning by Professor Joseph J. Casasanta, director. The Band will appear* in concert in three cities on the following dates: Tiffin, Ohio, May 3; Akron, Ohio, May 4; and Barberton, Ohio, May 5. The entire personnel of 65 pieces will make the trip.
The band is also scheduled to take part in the annual Blossom Week festivities, which will be held at Benton Harbor, Mich., the first week in May. The Band will appear in that city on Saturday, May 11. A special car is being chartered to take the bandmen to the celebration on that date.

❖	SENIOR BALL NOTES	*
The Class of ’29 will be host to the largest number of guests that has ever attended a Senior Ball at Notre Dame when it will stage its Ball on the evening of Friday, May 10, in the Palais Royale ballroom. It is expected that over 400 couples will attend. William Butler, chairman of the ticket committee, announced this morning that while only a limited number of tickets are still available deposits will be taken by any of the men on the ticket committee until the allotted, number is depleted. Tire names of those Seniors planning to attend the ball must be in the hands of General Chairman Jack Reilly before May 4th, as no names will be accepted after that date.
INVITATIONS
Invitations for the affair may still be secured from Charles Meyers, Badin Hall, or Lyman Hill, Off-Campus. There is no charge for the invitations. They may be obtained even without the presentation of a ball ticket by those who are planning to attend. Over four hundred imitations have already been issued.
DECORATIONS
The decorative scheme for the affair will strike a modernistic tone, unique in originality and design. “Pete” Bryssel-bout and “Red” Lawless are directing the committee on decorations which is composed of students in the College of Architecture. The members of the Committee have been working for weeks determining the proper shadings and background to be used in the task of beautifying the Palais Royale in keeping with the finest of all class dances. It is the first time that an all-student- committee has ever attempted a plan so elaborate in color and detail without the aid of professional designers.
ORCHESTRA
Johnny Johnson and his Hotel Pennsylvania Orchestra of New York City will furnish the music. This orchestra is one of America’s foremost exponents of symphonic “Jazz” rhythm. The orchestra is especially celebrated for the various combinations employed during the playing of the slow tempo “blues.” The personnel of Johnny Johnson’s Orchestra has remained intact for the last seven years, during which time it has played several seasons at Miami and Palm Beach. The orchestra has completed an extended engagement at the Club Mirador, one of New York’s most exclusive and prominent Night Clubs. During the last two years it has been playing at the Hotel Pennsylvania. The orchestra records for The Victor Company and is also a popular Eastern radio favorite. Johnny Johnson’s orchestra is under contract at the present time to play at four Western university proms as well as three Eastern university social functions. Besides having versatile soloists in its ensemble the orchestra has a vocal quartet of national prominence which will feature special numbers at the ball, including a farewell rendition of the “Victory March.”
FAVORS
While the favors for the Ball have been decided upon, the Committee desires that they remain a complete surprise until a later date. It was first believed that sister pins of the Senior Class pins of ’29 would be given, but this idea gave way to the final choice made by the committee. It is promised that the favors selected for the Ball are so new and original that they will win the immediate approval of all.
. TEA DANCE
The Chain O’Lakes Country Club has been secured for
the Tea Dance, which will be held from 1:00 p. m. until 5:30 p. m. Saturday, May 11. The orchestra will be announced later.

FINANCIAL DETAILS ARRANGED FOR CONSTRUCTION OF NEW STADIUM
Over $100,000 has been collected so far by the finance committee towards the erection of the new $750,000 football stadium which will be constructed just south of the site of the present Cartier Field. The committee which has completely worked out the financial details for the project is composed of Knute K. Rockne, director of athletics; the Honorable G. A. Farabaugh, ’04, prominent South Bend attorney; J. Arthur Haley, business manager of University athletics, and Herbert Jones, assistant business manager.
The plan of finance is to sell a number of boxes. The person wishing one buys it for a ten year period. The price of the box will be paid in eight installments, the whole sum payable in four years. Payments are to be made on December first and June first of each year. There will be no interest payable except on defaulted payments. The new boxes will be five inches wider and five inches longer than the present boxes at Cartier Field.
A brass plate will be erected on each box with the occupant’s name thereon, and at the entrance to the stadium a tablet will be placed, listing the subscriber as one who helped to make possible the erection of the structure.
The sale of boxes has been in progress in South Bend for four days. During this time forty-five boxes have been subscribed for. Several alumni clubs over the country have wired Mr. Rockne for boxes. The financial committee hopes for at least $300,000 through the sale of these boxes.
The stadium, strictly speaking, will be for football alone. There will be no quarter-mile cinder track encircling the green turf. The seats will come as close as is advisable to the playing field and the spectators will practically be sitting on the gridiron.
The work of razing the old stadium has begun, and the workmen are in no way interfering with the sports of track and baseball on their respective fields.	.

HENRY MERALIEN, UNIVERSITY CHEF, HAS HAD VARIED CAREER
A Frenchman by birth, a German by nationality, a cook by trade, and an American by adoption, have made for Henry Meralien the title of “Chef” in the dining halls at the University. .
Due to his varied relationships in life, the “Chef” has had many experiences. Living in Alsace-Lorraine at the out- -break of the late war he served as cook in the German army. When Alsace-Lorraine was restored to France at the end of • the war he again served in his usual capacity for the French army. Receiving his release from this post after several years Henry left his native home and then sailed for America.
Now the “Chef” is doing his “bit” for Notre Dame. He speaks in German to the steward, in French to his helpers, and in English to the waiters. He has been employed by the University since the erection of the new dining halls

DAVID W. SAXON, JR.
Personality plus was found in Room 223, Walsh Hall, this week, in the person of David W. Saxon, Jr. Smiling Dave is Memphis, Tennessee’s most admired representative at Notre Dame. He still clings to the southern dialect he brought up north with him and emphatically denies his* being implicated in the composing of “Beale Street Mamma.”
At Notre Dame, Dave soon recognized his ability in journalistic work, and decided to enter the ranks of Dr. John M. Cooney’s embryonic newspapermen. Dave soon shone out as a high light in his professional studies and, consequently, his fellow journal
ists elected him to the office of President of the Press
Club. Due to his untiring efforts, the members of the club have had many opportunities to hear and converse with men prominent in the profession of journalism.
Nor was Dave’s education confined to attendance at Notre Dame. Between his junior and senior year he sojourned through western Europe, visiting England, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Belgium. Leaving New Orleans in June, 1928, he was tossed about the Atlantic ocean for eighteen days before landing in Liverpool, England. He is as familiar with Times Square, London, and Place de la Concorde, Paris, as the average Notre Dame student is with' Cartier field. He can talk equally as entertainingly about the Follies Bergere or the Invalides.
He is also managing editor of the Scholastic, and in addition president of the Tennessee Club. When the University was busy attempting to solve the club charter problem Dave was one of the men elected by the club presidents to make suggestions for drawing up the new club charters.

JUGGLER “GIRL’S NUMBER” RELEASED FOR CAMPUS SALE
The annual “Girl’s Number” of the Juggler was released for campus sale last night. This issue of the magazine is composed of the art and humor submitted by girls from every part of the country, and it rivals the work done in previous issues by campus artists and humorists.
Editor Joseph P. McNamara announces that the winners of the Juggler Key for the best art work and written material submitted are Claudine B. Cooke and Mary M. Bertram, respectively. Honorable mention was given to Catherine Haynie and Kathleen O’Sullivan.
The feature of this month’s Juggler is a poem entitled “Challenge” by Eleanore Perry. The cover, an excellent piece of collegiate art, was done in oil by Paul C. McElroy, art editor of the publication.
The next issue of the Juggler will be “The Commencement Number”, and will be the final number of the year. It will be released sometime during the latter part of May.
N.D. MEN CAPTURE THREE PRIZES IN LOCAL PLAZA DESIGN CONTEST
The first, third and fourth prizes in the South Bend7 Neivs-Times Plaza Design contest, offered for the best drawings submitted by architectural students of St. Joseph county for the development of the Plaza area north of the new Union , Station, were won by students of the Department of Archi- * tecture at the University.
The first prize of $100 was won by Charles Pahl, of Tiffin, Ohio, a junior in the Department of Architecture. Paul A. Brysselbout, of Bay City, Mich., captured the third prize of $25, while Donald B. Kreis, Mishawaka, Ind., was awarded the fourth prize of $20.	<
Twelve of thirteen, drawings submitted were designed ’ by Notre Dame students. The men who judged the drawings are six of the foremost architects in this section of the country today: Dan Burnham and Ferber I. Marshall, of Chicago, Hl.; Professor Vincent F. Fagan, of the Department of Architecture at the University; Professor Francis W. Ker-vick, head of the Department of Architecture at Notre Dame, 3 and Roy Shambleau and Ernest W. Young, of South Bend. ’ Mr. Burnham, son of the late Daniel H. Burnham, designei-of the city beautiful plan for the city of Chicago, is one of the five men who will select from 53 models and drawings a monument to the “Unknown Soldier” at Washington, D. C.
The winning design was solved by constructing a long clear plaza on the central axis, closing in the vista at the Division street end with a mass which would be reflected in " a long lagoon, extending two-thirds of the distance of the Plaza. Esplanades surround the plaza proper, shaded by a close-clipped formal box hedging similar to that lining the Champs Elysees. The rendering was presented in a pastel scheme of black and red.
Last year Mr. Pahl attended the summer session of the Fontainebleau School of Fine Arts at Fontainebleau, France, ’ where he studied under some of the best instructors in France, returning to Notre Dame in September as a junior. He also received honorable mention in the recent Beaux Arts Design contest at New York City in competition with stu- -dents of other universities.
All drawings submitted are now on display in the Rotary Club room of the Oliver Hotel. Other Notre Dame students who received much favorable comment for their efforts were: Claude H. Horning, Everett A. Jewell, Richard K. Zimmerly, Robert J. Braeckel, John P. O’Neill, Maurice A. Feldman, Thomas Gallbraith, Joseph W. Lauber and Bernard F. Losh-bough.

RARE ARTICLES EXHIBITED IN LIBRARY INDEX ROOM
On exhibition in the index room of the Library this week are four rare and interesting articles which have been presented recently to the University.
The first rarity is a cross carved out of Irish bog wood, containing the figure of Our Lord and several fantastic minor images. It was found by a laborer while digging in Boston Common. On the back the date 1776 is carved deeply into the wood.
The second article is a Roman lamp the size of a small pear, which was used to light up the catacombs in Apostolic times. It is authenticated and sealed by the Sacred Commission of Archaeology.
The third object is a Byzantine crucifix over four hundred years old. At each point of the cross there are painted images of saints and angels behind glass frames. The crucifix has evidently received some rough usage, for the right leg of the Saviour is broken off at the thigh, while the left leg is dangerously cracked in the same place. The fingers of the right hand are also missing.
The last exhibit is a Papal Decoration given to Archbishop Perche, of New Orleans, by the Pope. It is a. Cross of Jerusalem of the Order of Holy Sepulchre, originally bestowed on those crusaders who distinguished themselves in the defense of the Holy Sepulchre, and now given to deserving Catholics.

UNIVERSITY SEALS FOR MORRISSEY LOBBY BEING PAINTED BY ART CLASSES
Designs of prominent American and European university seals and coats of arms are being painted in oils by the Decorative Art classes under Professor Sessler of the Department of Fine Arts and Professor Kervick of the Department of Architecture at the University. They will be placed in the top panels of the wainscoating of Morrissey Hall lobby. The seals will be in the colors of their respective universities.
The decoration of the sixty panels in the lobby will take two years. The north wall murals, however, will have been completed by the end of May. The remaining panels will be filled by the art classes of the ensuing scholastic year. In the center of the north wall is a large panel which will be graced by the gold and blue emblem of Notre Dame.
Due to the varied shades of light in the lobby it will be necessary for the designers to retouch the work after the murals have been put in their respective positions.

GLEE CLUB BOOKED FOR BLOOMINGTON CONCERT NEXT FALL
The Civic Music Association of Bloomington, Illinois, has scheduled the Notre Dame Glee Club to give one of its series of concerts during the season of 1929-30. Professor Joseph J. Casasanta, director of the Glee Club, stated yesterday that this concert would be given sometime next fall.
The Civic Music Association in Bloomington, along with similar associations in over 200 cities make up the Civic Concert Company, which books artists to appear in each of these cities. The high standard which the Company maintains when selecting the artists for its concerts makes it an honor for the Notre Dame Glee club to be booked for a concert. It is believed that the University Glee club is the first college organization to be invited to appear before any Civic Music Association.

The annual senior class vote at Yale this year showed that the majority of the 1929 men prefer a Phi Beta Kappa key to a major “Y” earned in sports. The vote for the most admired man living resulted in a tie between Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh and “my father.” English was chosen as the most valuable subject and psychology as the least valuable. Freshman year was deemed the hardest and senior year the most pleasant.
Among the class favorites were these: character in fiction, D’Artagnan; character in history, Napoleon; author, Dumas; poet, Tennyson; poem, “If”; movie actor, Emil Tannings; movie actress, Joan Crawford; actor, Hampden; actress, Helen Hayes; magazine, “Saturday Evening Post”; political party, Republican; world figures, Hoover and Lindbergh; smoke, Lucky Strikes, y

Gentlemen may prefer blondes, but brunette gentlemen are preferred by the majority of the girls at Oglethorpe college, who were questioned recently as to what type they favored.
Among the answers were “I prefer brunettes every time,” and “They have a nonchalance, a sophistication that the blondes seem to lack.”
The blonde gentleman, however, was not without his defenders. “I prefer blondes,” stated one girl, “because they seem to embody the ideal type more than the brunette. They seem to be more honest and straightforward.” Another young lady pointed out that all heroes of fiction are blonde.
“After all we take just about what we can get,” was the final vedict. And so the battle rages merrily on.

married a girl not so good looking, and she was intellectual; so they both were happy. So he wrote a hymn to intellectual . beauty.’ ”	<

The School of Journalism at Notre Dame
JOHN R. HOOVER
In a musty i-oom in Science Hall with a skeleton, a box of bones, and colored drawings of prehistoric animals on the blackboards to serve as inspirations, the present School of ' Journalism at Notre Dame began its career. One can scarce-c .ly imagine how the nation’s livest subject could blossom forth at the University in the midst of such sordid scenes— yet, it did. The Department, as it was then, must have flourished despite these surroundings because it was later moved from Science Hall to the third floor back in the Main Building. Five years after its origin the School was established in the northwest room of the basement of the Univer’ ""sity^Library where it has since remained.
It was in May of 1912 that Dr. Max Pam, of Chicago, himself a graduate of Notre Dame, established a journalism chair at the University and smoothed the way for the present School. Dr. Pam, a non-Catholic, in making known his gift, said “the world has need of ethical journalists and I know j of no other school than Notre Dame better fitted to turn out men of such a caliber. Notre Dame teaches sound ethics, seriously imparted.”
Dr. John M. Cooney, Ph.D., as first head of the School was assisted by the Reverend Thomas A. Lahey, C.S.C., Ph.D., and Mr. F. A. Miller as instructors. The subjects taught in the earlier years were practically the same as are . being taught at the present, with one exception, advertising, which was later made into a department under Father Lahey.
The School of Journalism handled the publicity for Notre Dame before the present Publicity Department was established. A story is told about the old publicity department. It seems that Commencement night came along and there were no correspondents on hand. All of them had gone to their respective homes. Rather than have a stigma cast on his worthy fellow journalists, John Ward, a freshman, and although not one of the official correspondents, went into the press-room and worked all night getting the news out.
The first extra-curricular lecture was made by Mr. James Keely of the Chicago Tribune. Mr. Keely, also honorary dean of the School of Journalism, was considered one of the really great newspapermen of the time.
At present Dr. Cooney is ably assisted by Mr. Edward Meehan of the South Bend Tribune, former Notre Dame man, who teaches Newspaper Management and Mr. Elton Richter, down-town lawyer and professor in the Hoynes Law School, who teaches Law of the Press. In addition to the regular staff, Mr. Fred A. Miller, editor of the South Bend Tribune, and Mr. Gerald Cosgrove, associate-editor, and Mr. Sidney Whipple, editor, Mr. Mortimer Reed, business manager, and Mr. McCready Huston, managing editor of the South Bend Neivs-Times, are all prominent lecturers in the school.
Dr. Cooney has always spoken very highly on the cooperation of the South Bend newspaper with the School of Journalism. The School has not only had the pleasure of helpful - lectures but has been made to consider both the Tribune and the 'News-Times as two very willing friends. They have enabled the students to obtain practical newspaper experience
by permitting them to work on their papers. Many a graduate of the Journalism School began his newspaper career on one of these local papers.
Graduates of the Notre Dame School of Journalism are to be found in more than three-fourths of the States. Some of them are on foreign newspapers. All the graduates, however, have not gone into newspaper work. You can find some of them here at the University as teachers, some are in the magazine field, some are in the publishing business, a few are writing scenarios. One graduate is a bayonet instructor at a famous military academy. His work on bayonet defense is accepted by the United States Army as an official instruction book. You may even run across Journalism graduates in the banking business, as lawyers, or as salesmen.
Twenty credit hours are required in the School of Journalism in order to obtain a certificate or to complete a major for graduation. In the first year, the student’s Junior year at the University, three practical courses are offered: News Writing and Reporting, Editing, and Feature Writing. Students are taught the values of news and sources of news; structure and style of news stories; the. gathering and the writing of the various types of news stories, including sport, society, financial, court news, human interest stories, and interviews
The student is then instructed in copy-reading, headline writing, proof-reading, make-up, and the study of newspaper and magazine stories. At this time, too, students write articles for publication in Catholic newspapers throughout America.
In the second year of the course students are taught the technique involved in the writing of editorials, paragraphs, columns, and other editorial features found on the editorial page. The business end of a newspaper with special attention to advertising and circulation problems is taken under Newspaper Management. The balance of the course is given in a series of lectures wherein the courses Law of the Press and Ethics of Journalism are explained.
The students in the Journalism School have been organized as the Press Club, which is an outgrowth of the former Pam Club of 1912. Special lecturers from leading newspapers are brought to each meeting. One feature is the Tuesday night coffee hour. Reporters from the South Bend newspapers are guests of the club in the University Cafeteria on these occasions and recount anecdotes of their experience to interested audiences.
■ The man directly responsible for the success of the School of Journalism is Professor Cooney. • Dr. Cooney is essentially a newspaper man. Before coming to Notre Dame in 1911 he was connected with Kentucky newspapers, acting as a special correspondent for the Louisville Herald, and foi- the Owensboro Messenger. He also owned and edited the Nelson Record for a number of years. Besides this, even with the extra activities of bringing the Department of Journalism to its present status, Dr. Cooney was an active correspondent to forty leading newspapers for some years.

GONE
I left my thoughts behind me, Gave all my dreams to air, Builded my castles towering And then I left them there.
I went without my worries, To all my cares said goodbye;
Cast all the ghosts that haunt me Out in the light to die.
Only my heart brought with me, Only my hopes remained, But when I tried my dreaming, I found they too had waned.

For- like the “Garbage Man” about all I can write for this column is a lot of bunk. And another thing, I wouldn’t make you laugh by writing something funny.

Journalism and Politics
FREDERIC WILLIAM WILE, LL.D., ’24
The editors of the Scholastic cannot faintly comprehend
the thrill which the chronicler of these observations derives from writing once again in its historic columns. A news-
FREDERIC WILLIAM WILE, LL.D. ’24
paper and literary career, which now has venerable years to its credit, began on the Notre Dame campus when, as an undergraduate o f seventeen, I was privileged to see my first “piece” in print. It was the reproduction of an essay on “The Courtship of Miles Standish,” submitted in English class to Dr. Maurice Francis Egan. In a life-time of journalism, which has not been without its moments, I count the appearance of that adolescent masterpiece in the Scholastic as an
episode which has known no worthy rival in thirty years as a pursuer and chronicler of the elusive truth called news. I always like to feel that Dr. Egan’s graciousness, in securing publication of the Standish story in the Scholastic, planted in me the first seed of longing to make newspaper work a life occupation. Since leaving Notre Dame I have known no other. So in these pages I am returning to my very first journalistic love.
*	*	* v
The Editor-in-Chief has asked me to write about journalism and politics. As a Washington correspondent, I inhabit the atmosphere where journalism and politics are so closely intertwined that they are almost one and the same. They are —at any rate as far as this community of Rumor, Recrimination and Remorse known as the National Capital is concerned—interdependent. One could hardly exist without the other. Washington journalism is all politics, and Washington politics, without journalism, is inconceivable. By that I mean, first, that virtually every line produced on the Potomac by a news-writer or a correspondent—the terms are not synonomous—deals with political affairs, and, secondly, that the publicity which journalism gives to politics and politicians is vitally necessary to them both.

Politics is not, as most people think, the shady and showy scheme of office-getting and office-holding. It is exactly what Webster defines it to be, viz., the science of government. It requires to be kept in the light of day, in order that the beneficiaries of government, the citizenry, may remain incessantly informed of what is being done for them— or to them—by the practitioners of the science of government, viz., the politicians.
To turn on that stream of illumination is the function of Washington journalism. It is indeed the Fourth Estate.
It has no Constitutional recognition or authority, yet it plays as potent a part on the American scene today as the three legalized branches of the Federal system, the legislative, executive and judicial arms of the government. Although that ridiculous Prince of Bombast, Senator Heflin, ever and anon assails the press gallery as the abode of “squirrel heads,” the average of intelligence there at least takes rank with that of the pinheads who occasionally reach the Senate.
y	^4
Journalism is almost as assured a stepping-stone to eminence in American politics as the law. In both Houses of Congress editors and publishers are numerous. Kansas is now represented in the Senate by two professional newspapermen—Senators Arthur Capper and Henry J. Allen. Senator Carter Glass, of Virginia, is an active journalist in his private life. So is Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg, of Michigan. In 1920 both great parties nominated editors for the presidency—Warren G. Harding and James M. Cox. Our Presidents since time immemorial have been fond of sending scribes abroad as ambassadors and ministers. Notre Dame’s own revered Maurice Francis Egan was as accomplished an envoy as ever represented the United States at a foreign capital. The Hoover regime, now enthroned in Washington, is certain to lean conspicuously in the direction of journalism. The new President’s right-hand-man, George Akerson, his chief secretary, was until a couple of years ago a Washington correspondent and a former managing editor. As his research assistant, Mr. Hoover has installed French Strother, late associate editor of World’s Work.
*	* * *
Hereinbefore I suggested that the Washington news-writer and the Washington Correspondent are not synonomous terms. Let me explain. There are 500 or 600 men and women accredited to the Press Gallery, but not all of them are correspondents. The vast majority devote themselves to covering “spot news.” Only a handful are correspondents. Correspondents are writers who sidelight, interpret, background and illuminate the news. They comment upon, rather than, give news fact. They express opinions, in more or less editorial sense. They give the newspaper reader what is between the lines of the news. They have it in their power to make and mold public opinion on current political issues, and, I think, do so to an extent that is not equalled even by the editorial page.
The Washington correspondent puts in much of his time “cultivating” and “contracting” responsible men of affairs. We enjoy regular access to them, even to the President. We find public men at Washington, with rare exceptions, candid, cordial and communicative. Most of them have an enlightened appreciation of the value of printer’s ink for their own purposes. Nearly all of them have an equally intelligent regard for the importance of the Washington correspondent’s job and are generosity personified in helping him to accomplish its responsible duties.

•"HAIL HAY WHILE TEE JEN TEINET**
In a few short weeks graduation will terminate the scholastic year of 1928-1929. For the majority of the student body it will be a time for jubilant exclamations and thanksgivings after having successfully rounded out another year of their college career; for the minority, some four hundred, who collectively represent the class of ’29, it will not only be a time of jubilation, but also a time for meditation and introspection. This introspection will bring to mind the full realization of one’s position, whether it be a favorable or unfavorable impression. During this momentary self-analysis the obduracy of the “chronicgriper” will soften; the incompetency of the bluffer and the plagiarist will bring self-condemnation; and the individual satisfaction, which is the reward of intensive application, will come to the student who has conscientiously applied himself.
At a distance a tern and a gull flying together will resemble a mated pair; so too at a distance two college graduates, garbed according to the dictates of standardized fashion, look alike and equally proficient; but under the careful scrutiny and questioning of the mamomites of the industrial and professional word, the perspicaciousness of one, or the stupidity of the other will emerge. Be prepared for just such an examination.
In moments of spiritual effulgence, we mortals have all made solemn resolutions to improve our habits of study and to apply ourselves diligently; but through the inherent weaknesses of our natures we may have slipped into former indolent habits, and given up in despair.
There is still time to do the little things that should have been done, and have a final browse in the archives of the Library, if the worldly temptations of golf, tennis, swimming, and a May sun can be resisted. This editorial is meant primarily for the seniors, but the rest of the student body may profit by it, for a rambling observation of campus faces will not reveal many noses that are skinned by the proverbial grindstone. So let the entire student body make use of the few remaining weeks to cull the best from the social, spiritual, and intellectual life that is Notre Dame.	—w. H. B.
TEE NEW STADIUM
Notre Dame’s new stadium is at last to be a reality. Long a dream of far-sighted officials, alumni, and friends of the University—but for years an impractical dream—the long-discussed structure is soon to be a tangible fact. Actual construction work has already begun on the new athletic plant. When	•
completed it will favorably compare with the leading stadia of the country. The action of University	1
authorities in officially approving the project recently met with the enthusiastic approbation of all Notre Dame men who realize that such a structure will be an important and an integral link in the development of the Greater Notre Dame.
Agitation for a new stadium was begun shortly before 1924 when it was seen that Cartier Field was gradually becoming antedated as far as a suitable football stadium was concerned. It was brought to a head during the past two years when it was clearly demonstrated at the Minnesota and Carnegie Tech attractions that given adequate facilities over 50,000 spectators could be accommodated at each important game.	.
The only note of regret in the entire harmonious proceedings is the fact that Cartier Field has	(
witnessed its last important football contest. After serving as a gridiron arena for Notre Dame foot-	r
ball teams for over thirty years, the historic enclosure will be relegated to a back seat and a field only , ■ for track meets and practice games. Notre Dame men witness the transformation with regret because old Cartier has witnessed many, many blue-jersied athletes give their all in many, many epochal engagements during the parade of the years. Old Cartier will not be forgotten, however, and will always occupy a high and an honorable niche in Notre Dame’s athletic Valhalla.	—J. V. H. c

C LITER AIRY
Gilbert Keith Chesterton, The Poet
CLINTON H. FAILLE	'
Gilbert keith Chesterton began his career as journalist in 1900. Nothing unusual can be found in the circumstances leading to his decision to adopt a .	literary career. He was born in 1874 of a family
* of estate agents living in the city of London. In the course of his youth he attended St. Paul’s School, but left in 1891 ■* in order to pursue a course in art. It was toward the close of the period between 1891 and 1900 that he slowly began !s fitting himself for a journalistic career by writing snatches • of poetry in his spare hours. In 1900 he published his first book of poems and its reception by the public sent him on the * road to literary fame.
The book appeared under the title, “The Wild Knight.” It contained no poems of especial beauty. His work in this publication aimed at strength and forcefulness, rather than at grace; it startled and thrilled the reader but did not move him. It was not until several years after “The Wild Knight” came off the press that several poems containing the quality *	of beauty, so much sought for by the readers of poetry,
•	appeared in print. There is real beauty, for example, in the
following lines taken from a fragment of a “Ballad Epic of Alfred.”
And every English maid that walks In good thought apart
May break the guard of the three Kings ‘	And know the dear and dreadful things
I had within my heart.
The poems which followed the “Ballad Epic of Alfred” showed considerable improvement over all of its predecessors, and especially ovei‘ those found in the first publication. There is poetry and music in the Christmas poem written for the newspaper which employed the author, the “Daily News.”
Step softly under snow and rain
To find the place where men can stay, The way is all so very plain
That we may lose the way.
And later:
Step humbly; humble are the skies And very lone and fierce the star;
So very near the manger lies That we may travel' far.
The best and most original quality of Mr. Chesterton’s poetry is the skill with which he has learned to blend the severity of the epigram with his compositions. After the introduction of the poem quoted last above there follows:
We have gone round and round the hill And lost the wood among the trees, And found long names for every ill, And sewed the mad gods, naming still The furies, the Eumenides.
The gods of violence took the veil
Of vision and philosophy,
The Serpent that brought all men bale
He bites his own accrused tail, And calls himself Eternity.
Perhaps the most admirable example of this blending of the epigram and poetry will be found in a poem called “The Secret People.” It was on a very characteristic theme, the silence of the English people throughout their history:
Smile at us, pay us, pass us, but do not quite forget,
For we are the people of England and we have not spoken yet.
The foregoing is also an example of Mr. Chesterton’s success in his effort to sum up whole periods of English history in lasting lines. Further quotations from the same poem and depicting the same admirable characteristic of the author must be mentioned in order to show how successful he was in describing these epochs of English history. The lines:
And there was only a naked people under a naked Crown.
refers to the state of England after the Wars of the Roses. The change from Tudor to Stuart times in England, he expresses in the line:
The name of the King’s servants grew greater than the King.
And after a spirited description of the great French War, ' when:
We did and died like lions to keep ourselves in chains,
comes the two powerful verses in which, as it seems to me, the author reaches his high-water mark:
Our patch of glory ended, we never heard
' guns again.
But the squire seemed struck in the saddle, he foolish, as if in pain.
He leant on a chattering lawyer, he clutched at a cringing Jew.
He was stricken, maybe after all he was stricken at Waterloo:
Or perhaps the ghosts of the shaven men whose gold was in his house
Came back in shining shapes at last to spoil his last carouse.
Only we see the last sad squires ride slowly towards the sea.
And a new people takes the land. And still
it is not we.
804
The Notre Dame Scholastic
They have given us over into the hands of the new unhappy lords.
Lords without anger or honour, who dare not carry their swords.
They fight by shuffling papers; they have dead, bright alien eyes:
They look at our labour and laughter as a tired man looks at flies.
The load of their loveless pity is worse than the ancient wrongs.
Their doors are shut in the evening; and they have no songs.
It is needless to remind the reader that Mr. Chesterton’s efforts in prose writing occupied considerably more of his time than attempts to compose poetry. It is also a well known fact that the improvement of his verse between the time of the publication of the book of poems, “The Wild Knight,” and his more modern poems is more pronounced than his improvement in writing prose. It is to be regretted then, that this worthy author cannot find the time to give the readers of poetry another collection of verse in book form. As was pointed out above, there has been a great improvement in the beauty of the lines published since the first publication. The improvement, however, has not been confined merely to beauty. He has acquired a smoother style of composing since that time; smoother in the sense that his meter has become more perfect, and his rimes more musical. In these more perfect attempts it is possible to detect occasionally, an intentional irregularity of meter inserted, no doubt, to break the monotony of the rythm.
The gift for serious verse is by no means the only talent which Mr. Chesterton has allowed to lie almost unused so far as the reader of poetry is concerned. He has a rare gift for the sort of verse which may be called mild humor, or light verse. Of this light verse he pours out an enormous amount for the amusement of his personal friends, but very little for printed purposes. It has been stated that much of it has been too irresponsibly violent in personalities for publication.
a
Mr. Chesterton may almost be said to have invented a new form of light verse, though few specimens of it have been widely read . He has abundant wit and deep-seated humour, and that trick of smooth and easy rhythm which adds much to his interestingness. Many of these poems will be nearly all gorgeous fooling with a sudden and thrilling	,
note of seriousness in the last line or stanza. It is difficult	*
to give examples, because nearly all the poems concerned are unpublished. One that has found its way into print will give an example of this quality. A newspaper described Mr. Chesterton as having been born in 1856, and repudiating the report he sent the editor the following:	.
I am not fond of anthropoids as such.
I never- went to Mr. Darwin’s school.
Old Tyndall’s ether, that he liked so much Leaves me, I fear, comparatively cool. ■ I cannot say my heart with hope is full Because a donkey, by continual kicks, Turns slowly into something like a mule— .1 was not born in 1856.
Another verse in the same vein follows; then the third, i with a marked change of tone:
Age of my fathers! Truer at the touch
Than Mine! Great age of Dickens, youth and Yule!
Had your strong virtues stood without a crutch, I might have deemed man had no need of rule, But I was born when petty poets pule,
When madmen use your liberty to mix	y
Lucre and lust, bestial and beautiful,
I was not born in 1856.
A general idea of the kinds of meter employed by the author, and the number of feet in the lines is shown in the various quotations above. It will be noticed, for example, that the author prefers the rising meters; that he deliberately varies the length of the lines in the same poems for relief t from monotony; that some of his lines run to such length that they become extraordinary; that all of his efforts at lyric composition have a characteristic of grace and forcefulness.
The Origin of “30” in Joumalis:
II
JOHN E. MOTZ
■	i
Probably no one symbol of the newspaper profession is shrouded in deeper mystery than the origin of “30”, as used by many newspapers to indicate the end of every piece of news copy. The cloud of uncertainty which cloaks the first use of this symbol has given birth to varied ideas and suggestions.
One authority declares that “30” was arbitrarily adopted along with just about a dozen others, all for the sake of brevity. Its original use was said to have been at the end of a telegram, and later it served the same purpose in press dispatches. Subsequently the use of “30” at the conclusion of a telegram or news item was unnecessary, and it came to be confined wholly to the wires carrying press matter to indicate the end of the day’s or night’s service. Hence newspaper folk naturally picked it up from the telegraph service.
Another authority, writing in facetious vein, intimates -that the symbol had its origin.in the dark ages when the thirty magistrates appointed by Sparta over Athens at the termination of the Peloponnesian War were called the “thirty tyrants.” They were overthrown in 403 B. C. after only
one year’s reign. He suggests that the end of “the sway of < the tyrants” was immortalized in this ironical manner.	»■!
An old time Western Union operator rises to remark : that “30” did not originate in newspaper offices at all, but was adopted by press associations from the Western Union.	•
In those days the Western Union handled all the press dis-	;
patches, and when the last sheet was in, the operator placed	|
“30” at the end. This was a figure adopted by the company,	.
but no one knows why any other number was not chosen	L;
instead.	•
Probably one of the most convincing arguments of all	h
concerns the early days in the West. Before the newspapers	,
had special wires in their offices the telegraph operator	|
would write out the dispatches in longhand and send them	j
to the newspaper by messenger. He would close his office at three o’clock and at the bottom of the last sheet would ; « write “three o’clock” signifying “the last.”- This was cor-	||
rupted gradually into the form “3 o’clock,” shortened still	’
further to read “3o’c”, then-to “30”, and finally to “30”.	f

to have been adopted as official, showing that “the end” had been reached.
“There you are and you take your pick.” to paraphrase the stock expression of the English bookmakers. Each version is pierced by a vein of logic, but all differ in some respects, which makes the situation more intriguing. Doubt
less all are based on fact, but in the telling and retelling of the story some of the original details have been dropped and new ones substituted. After all, newspapermen have a streak of romance in them, their hard-boiled exteriors to the contrary.	—John E. Motz.
The First Newspapers
HERMAN COHEN
The desire to hear or to know the new thing is as old as , man. It may be called an instinct. When the first written '	newspaper—for letters giving the news were sold and cir-
j	culated long before the invention of the printing press—ap-
| peared is not known. Some say in Rome, others in Venice, j and recent investigators in China.
> First place in Roman journalism belongs to Julius Caesar. After he became consul in 60 B. C., he issued a decree that the Senate reports should be daily written and published. He hoped to change the crooked politics of the time by doing this. The result was the establishment of that precursor of the modern daily newspaper, Acta Diurna, or The Daily Acts.	.
The Daily Acts had a special department in which were »	recorded	all the births and deaths of the city. It included
?	financial	news and recorded the receipts of taxes. It paid
j	attention	to civil and criminal courts, and made a special
j	feature of election news. The Imperial family was chronicled
:	faithfully.	'
At first this daily was published on a whitened wooden board, called album (white). It was the bulletin-board of the •	modern newspaper. In addition to this edition there was a
•. written one for circulation in the home.' There was also a । larger written newspaper sent to subscribers outside of Rome.
Not much was done in newspaper* work or writings for the next fifteen centuries. Printing was introduced in Europe sometime between 1438-40. News was distributed by news-letters and news circulars, written in Venice, Nuremberg, Augsburg, Amsterdam, Cologne, Frankfort, Leipsic, Paris, London, and Boston. It has been claimed that the first real newspaper was printed in Venice. The Gazzetta, thus named because it sold for a piece of money called gazzetta, was printed there in 1570. Nuremberg is the logical place to have the birth of newspapers. It is said that a papei* was printed there in 1457. It is also celebrated for many mechanical inventions, and where the Reformation made great progress at a later period.
By 1872 there were less than twenty newspapers in the world that had existed over a hundred years. Of these eight were called Gazettes, four Journals, and three Mercurys.
These initial sheets were an illustration of the papers, the people, and the times, as the leading j'ournals of today are the illustration of the papers, peoples, and the times of our* epoch. Our modern organs of public opinion, some of them with over a million circulation, are the natural result and historical contrast of the Nuremburg Gazette with its circulation of less than two thousand copies.
Crown of Empress Eugenie, Notre Dame Relic
JOSEPH B. REEDY
Adorning the statue of Our Lady in a gothic niche in the Sacred Heart Church here at Notre Dame is a solid gold crown which once belonged to Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III. Emprss Eugenie presented this crown to the University, and it is believed that Father Sorin, founder of Notre Dame in 1842, received the gift during one of his visits to France, his native land.
The crown is inlaid with many precious stones and studded with pearls. The statue is placed above the main altar in the rear of the church, and can be observed from every angle of the interior. The architecture surrounding the niche is designed so that rays of light flowing through the mosaic windows illuminate the golden crown as well as the delicate beauty of the Virgin’s face.	■
The Empress Eugenie was a Spanish Princess of Montij'o before she became the wife of Napoleon III, ruler of the
second empire of France. She married Napoleon in the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Pai*is.
Often during the absence of the Emperor, the Empress Eugenie was called upon to act as regent. Her advice on such occasions was always respected by members of the royalty, and when her husband debated two lines of policy she usually urged the bolder cause. She was loved by the. people, of France and looked upon as the champion of clerical policies and as a friend of the poor.
When Napoleon III had to contend with the rising tide of revolution, which resulted in the downfall of the last empire of France, the Empress Eugenie was one of the few who showed calmness and courage. After the country had been overrun by hostile German troops and Alsace-Lorraine was captured, the Empress Eugenie fled to England and spent the remainder of her days in exile.

Western State Bows to N.D. In Close Battle; Score Four to One
Twenty players, including two pinch hitters, collected a total of eight hits in one of the best exhibitions of air-tight pitching ever witnessed on Cartier Field. The occasion was the Western State-Notre Dame game last Wednesday afternoon, in which the home nine emerged the victor by a 4 to 1 count.
Oscar Ruse hurled the entire nine innings for Notre Dame. The gentleman from Arkansas was in his usual excellent form and yielded the Michigan teachers but four- scattered hits. His mound opponent was Kimball, a southpaw pitcher whose delivery was almost equally as puzzling. Kimball, likewise held his opponents to four hits, but several of these were timely swats which accounted for runs.
The Irish lost no time in getting under way in the very first inning, and they were greatly helped by the blunders of the visitors. Moran reached second when McKay muffed his fly to left field, later going to third on a fielder’s choice. A moment later, the fleet-footed outfielder had crossed the home plate on a wild pitch by Kimball.
Moran’s brilliant base-running was one of the features of the game In the eighth inning, he found himself on second, watched for his opportunity, and then raced down third while the pitcher still held the ball. Kimball made a poor throw to get him, and Moran scored. Colrick, who had been on first, reached third on the play, and scored shortly afterwards on a neat Texas-leaguer hit by Hart, batting for Feehery.
Only in the final inning did Rust show any symptoms of weakening. A single, a hit batter, and a mean slow-moving grounder to short, filled the bases. Johnson then, took four straight called balls, and the only run registered by Western State was forced in. Rust then tightened and retired the side without further difficulty.
The game marked the first appearance of Johnny Law behind the plate for Notre Dame this year. The stocky catcher replaced Joe Lordi, whose throwing arm has been causing him trouble lately. Although Law’s stick-work was not especially commendable, his fielding and all-around playing were flawless.

IOWA WINS ERRATIC BASEBALL GAME FROM NOTRE DAME, 13-7
A conglomeration of timely hitting, excellent relief pitching, and costly errors swept Iowa to a 13-7 victory over the Blue and Gold nine last Monday afternoon on Cartier field. A ragged brand of baseball was displayed by both teams.
Coach Mills selected Joe Jachym to occupy the mound for the home team, but the Irish hurling ace did not seem to be his usual self. The activity of the Hawkeyes’ bats, coupled with the erratic fielding of his own teammates, left him in distress several times. Brown, Iowa’s starting pitcher, fared no better than did Jachym, and with one-third of the game over Notre Dame led by a 6 to 5 margin.
Vogel, Iowa mentor, then replaced Brown with Forrest Twogood, the strike-out artist of the Western Conference. Twogood held the Irish consistently helpless during the remaining six innings, allowing only three hits and one run.
Both teams indulged in a slugfest during the first three frames. The visitors acquired two runs in the first on a single, two passed batters, two stolen bases, and a costly error. The Millsmen came back with two runs in their half. After Palermo had fanned, Moran got a hit over third base. Colrick popped out, but Feehery singled, and Bray got on via an error. Then McCleary pounded out a neat single, registering Moran and Feehery.
The Hawks scored three in the second inning on two singles, a hit batter, a base on balls, and a sacrifice fly. They were then held scoreless until the unlucky seventh. In the other half of the second, singles by Jachym; Palermo, and Moran, coupled with an Iowa mis-play in right field, netted the Blue and Gold more tallies. This left the score 5 to 4 in favor of Iowa.
In Notre Dame’s half of the third, Jim Bray singled, McCleary was safe when Brown fumbled his attempted sacrifice, and Griffin drove a single to right on a hit-and-run play, scoring Bray. Lordi walked, filling the bases. Jachym tapped into a double play, but Palermo’s hit in back of second brought Griffin home with the tally which placed Notre Dame in front for the first and last time.
The Iowa lucky seventh saw the collapse of the home team’s hopes. Clayton Thompson, Hawk catcher, led off by smacking a terrific triple to deep center field. Mowry dropped a single over second, scoring Thompson. The bombardment continued when Glassgow lined to left, and Moran trying to catch the ball off his shoestrings, let it get away from him, Mowry holding second. Several errors and another hit were productive of three more runs.
The visitors cinched the game in the ninth with another four run rally.

But who wants a ‘fairly good egg
Sfflben his Lordship the Bishop asked his guest how he enjoyed the breakfast egg, that timid —but always truthful—young curate replied:
"Parts of it were excellent, sir!”
Now isn’t that just like saying that such-and-such a cigarette is mild? Mildness in tobacco is not to be despised, but is it the ne plus ultra, the summum bonum, the ... in plain English, is
that all you ask from your cigarette? We think not.
Take Chesterfield’s mildness for granted, and get the full relish of its rich, real taste under your tongue. That’s its difference from the common run—all the difference between plus and minus. Chesterfields are mild... and yet they satisfy!

N. D. WHITEWASHES WABASH IN FIRST HOME GAME, 5-0
The 1929 aggregation of the Notre Dame baseball team got off to an auspicious start last Friday afternoon by trouncing Wabash 5 to 0. Oscar Rust, one of Coach Mills’ veteran pitchers, was on the mound for the Gold and Blue. Despite the cold weather, and a drizzle which lasted during
The Notre Dame Scholastic

the first half of the contest, the Irish played errorless ball, making nine assists and completing one double play.
The Little Giants were able to collect only three scattered hits from Rust’s offerings. In the eighth inning they threw a temporary scare into the Irish camp when Weist led off with a long triple to right center. He was left stranded at third, however, when Rust injected his famous “knuckle-ball” into the fray.
McCleary paved the way for Notre Dame’s first tally in the second nining when he singled to right field. He went to second after Griffin drove the ball over third base for another hit. Both men advanced when Lordi was given a free ticket, filling the bases. Rust then won his own game by smacking a single through shortstop, scoring McCleary and Griffin.
In the sixth Notre Dame opened up again, collecting three more tallies. Feehery smashed a three bagger along the right field foul line, Bray got to first on Hendrick’s error, and McCleary was hit by a pitched ball, again filling the bases. After Griffin had popped out, Lordi hit to Weist but when Taylor, Wabash catcher, muffed his throw, Feehery scored and before the ball was recovered Bray had also crossed the plate. The comedy of errors ended after Griffin had counted on a wild toss by Benntt.
The Little Giants again threatened to break into the scoring column when Casey and Manker both drove out singles in the sixth and seventh, respectively. A fast and difficult double play, McCleary to Palermo to Colrick, ruined Casey’s work, while Rust fanned Cox to end the rally.

The only tough opposition that the four-mile relay will '] get at the Penn Relays will come from N. Y. U., with Joe Hickey and Phil Edwards, indoor intercollegiate mile cham- , pion and runner-up respectively, running two of the legs on it. But the other runners on the eastern team do not measure up to the standard of these two and it is likely that Coach Nicholson’s men will have a better average strength.

When Johnny Miles won the Boston marathon last Friday fox* the second time in four years, he proved conclusively that he was not burnt out as many critics said he was when he failed to repeat his 1926 victory last year or the year before. It is seldom that-one as young as the diminutive Canadian reaches the peak in this toughest of all grinds. Usually the best marathoners are men on the shady side of thirty, such as Joie Ray, Clarence Demar and Whitey Michelson. Stenroos of Finland, who won the Olympic marathon in 1924 was 44 years old.

ELDER, O’BRIEN, AND RELAY TEAMS COMPETE IN DRAKE RELAYS
Captain Jack Elder and a contingent of Notre Dame track athletes are competing in the Drake Relays at Des Moines, Iowa, today and tomorrow.
Elder’s coming for the special 100-yard dash event further increases the interest being shown in this race, which will literally be the “battle of the century.” Elder, one of the greatest collegiate sprint stars in the country, winner of the 100-yard dash at Drake in 1928, and at Kansas last week, and coholder of the world’s' 75-yard dash record, will be opposed by such stars as Claude Bracey of Rite Institute, national collegiate champion last year, who this spring has been clocked in 9.4 seconds; George Simpson of Ohio State; Parks of Drake; Meier of Iowa State; Wilcox of Kansas; Root of Chicago; Timm of Illinois, and other great sprinters. The event at Drake is expected to develop into one of the greatest races ever seen in the middle west.
One other Notre Dame athlete will participate in the special events on the Drake program. Johnny O’Brien will compete in the 120-yard high hurdle event.
Three relay teams will represent the Irish in the university relay section. The sprint relay team which will run in the 440-yard relay and possibly in the 880-yard relay will be composed of Captain Elder, Ken Boagni, Bus Redgate and Nichols. All of these men have been timed in 10 seconds or less for the 100-yard dash, and they are expected to be well towards the front in the meet here.
A fast-stepping quartet of quarter-milers will represent Notre Dame in the one-mile relay. This team will be composed of Tom Quigley, who has been timed in 49 seconds; Tom Kelly, whose best record is 50.4 seconds; Spike Kelly, a 51-second man; and Cunningham or Bucky O’Connor, who have been clocked in 52 seconds.
Captain Jack Elder, Johnny O’Brien, “Moon” Mullin and either Jim Brady or Freddie Collins will compose Notre Dame’s quarter-mile football lettermen’s relay team.	•
Notre Dame will be represented in the Penn Relays by the four-^nile relay team consisting of Bill, Brown, John Brown, Bob Brennan and Pete Morgan, who should do under 18 minutes for the distance. Bill Brown has a record of 4:27 for the mile.

RACQUETMEN OPEN SCHEDULE TOMORROW AT KALAMAZOO
The 1929 Notre Dame tennis team will swing into action for the first time this season tomorrow, when they cross racquets with the Western State Teachers’ College at Kalamazoo. Captain Ted Griffin, ud Markey, Henry Burns, John O’Brien, and John Cianci will probably represent the Blue and Gold in the match.
The Drake University team will be met on the Notre Dame courts in the first home match next Tuesday afternoon. Play will start at 3:15 o clock. Friday, May 3, Captain Griffin and his mates are carded for a match with the Armour Tech racqueters in Chicago.	.

ELDER TAKES 100, FOUR-MILE QUARTET SECOND, AT KANSAS RELAYS
.Repeating his sensational victory of last year in the same games, Jack Elder, Notre Dame sprint star, ran to a brilliant victory in the 100-yard dash at the Kansas Relay carnival held at Lawrence, Kansas, last Friday and Saturday. Elder was clocked in 9 4-5 seconds, which exceded by 1-5 of a second his winning time in the same event last spring. He was pressed closely the entire route by Wilcox, Kansas dashman, who placed second. Tolan of Michigan was a close third, and Wilson of Warrensburg (Missouri) Teachers’ College was fourth in the race. The event was run off in a drizzling rain, which made Elder’s showing the more remarkable.
Notre Dame’s four-mile relay team also covered itself with glory in the carnival by placing second in to Illinois in that event. Running in the order named, Bob Brennan, Pete Morgan, J. Brown and W. Brown finished ahead of the Nebraska and Kansas State representatives.
A Blue and Gold quarter-mile relay team composed of England, Boagni, Nichols, and Elder failed to place in that event, and John O’Brien was eliminated in the 120-yard high hurdles after reaching the semi-finals.

For the last five or six months I have been trying several other kinds but I find Edgeworth is the only tobacco for me.
If I am smoking any other brand my wife will tell me, as she likes the smell of only Edgeworth. When I’m smoking others she opens all windows and doors.
The reason for writing this letter is that I had a card party last night, and most all of the party asked me what kind of tobacco I used.
So I told them Edgeworth.
Yours very truly, A smoker of Edgeworth (Signed) E. E. Boisvert

“ 'Look here, will you please tell me what’s wrong with me?’ ”
“Yes,” she said, for she liked his sterling character and winning ways, “I am sorry to have to say so but you are funnylooking.” “Is it my face or my figure?” he asked, gulping. “Neither,” she replied. “Your clothes are all wrong. Your shirts bulge. Your ties are queer. Your coat never fits. Your . . “Stop,” he cried, “is there anything I can do?” “Yes,” she said, “get yourself fixed up.” “Where?” said he. “It’s up to you to find out,” she answered.
Of course he found out. His best friend was willing to tell him. Naturally he advised him to go to SPIRO’S. He did and from that day forth he was a brilliant success.
You see—Spiro’s are selling the “Dress Well” idea—not just clothes. Stylish, quality clothes on you creates confidence in others of your ability and judgment.
