Gorby Hall.
At the opening of the scholastic year next September'; a new departure will be made in regard to the quartering of students. The building now commonly called the community house will thereafter be known as Corby Hall, and will be given over exclusively as a dormitory building for students . .of the Freshmen and Sophomore classes. There are one hun-
Here we present you. with a picture of Right Reverend John Lancaster Spalding, D. D., orator for this evening. The bishop needs no introduction to Notre Dame audiences as he has always been a great favorite at the University. It has been a great pleasure for us to have him appear on our stage to lecture during the scholastic year,
dred and eight well-ventilated rooms in the building and its situation right on the brow of St. Mary’s lake makes it an ideal home for students. It will afford more opportunity for close association • between the men living there " and the Sorin Hallers, and will give a different tone to the University. Old friends and students will all rejoice in learning of this great change, for the opening of Corby Hall will do away with a long-felt need at Notre Dame. It will, no doubt, have a marked effect on the standing in . classes of the gentlemen that are to live there, for much more satisfactory work

The Art Exhibition. ; .	?
From half-past nine this , morning till three in the afternoon, the doors of the drawing-rooms and Art Studio were thrown open to _ the public, and the work of the students displayed to an interested and critical assemblage of visitors. ' Although there were many attract tions at the lake and on the campus during the day, the crowd r which visited the art exhibi-
tion was large and apprecia- -five. The visitors had to climb three pairs of stairs : . . to reach the object of .their ; . search; but several speaking-to the Scholastic reporter, declared that they would not - . have missed the art exhibition for a dozen pairs of stairs.. :
The department of me-chanical drawing, conducted by Professor Ackerman, who, ; during his tenure of office ' has raised the standard of drawingto a remarkably high ; ; plane, was invaded by a se-' -.
lect crowd of young ladies and practical- engineers, who,, while admiringthe work done by the students of to-day,
contrasted the work done by the students of to-day with their .own-student efforts, much to the advantage of the former. The classes ih; mechanical drawing are composed; principally of students in the various engineering courses, and the

Over at Prof. Paradis’ studio there were on exhibition drawings which were examined with enthusiasm; Prof. Paradis’ department has been in existence only this year, but the work done under his supervision deserves particular commendation. Fresh from the studios of Paris and Rome, where he has studied for several years, he has infused into his pupils the spirit of the great masters. The work displayed today evinces a freedom and lightness that promise well for the future of the young artists. There were several charcoal and crayon sketches bf object and still-life studies done by members of the Saturday sketch class, and a few water-colors of familiar scenes and sketches from life, drawn by the Notre Dame Crayon Club, an organization that deserves to be. perpetuated. Mr. Fox’s work in charcoal, which includes the familiar pose, of- Mri O’Brien and his pipe, was greatly, admired. One of the prettiest pieces of work in the exhibition was Mr. Cooney’s copy in red chalk of. Raphael’s cartoon for his picture of St. Catherine. Mr. Elitch’s work in charcoal, Mr. Svensden’s in watercolors, Mr. Bouza’s lead pencil sketches from life, and Mr. Scheu-beft’s still-life sketches, -were all, favorably commented5 bn.

St. Edward’s Hall.
The closing exercises of St. Edward’s Hall, which took place this afternoon, were certainly a source of pleasure . to all .who attended. The Princes have the reputation of being very successfull in entertaining their guests. In the programme to-day it was evident that a careful balance had been preserved in arranging the parts. There were interesting recitations and dialogues and a generous selection of vocal and instrumental music. The entertainment opened with a piano solo by. Master W. M. McNamee. It is gratifying to note, in. this regard, that the composition is the work of Prof. Dam is Paul. Following this number was a medley by the Mandolin Club—twenty pieces strong. Masters L. McBride and McMaster gave recitations, and took part in a dialogue gotten up for the occasion.
The Daily Scholastic takes occasion to congratulate the little fellows, and feels that they have done themselves great honor. This is the way the Very Reverend President Morrissey felt, and he was prompted to say as much on making the closing remarks when the Premiums were distributed. He has watched with interest their work and progress under the good Sisters, and, as he has frequently done before, he expressed his gratification at seeing them thus succeed.

Mr. Macdonald Re-elected. •
Our popular athlete and first baseman, Mr. Angus D. Macdonald, has been unanimously reelected to captain the Varsity nine for next year. There is general satisfaction among all members of the athletic association over the result of this election, as Mr. Macdonald has filled that office most creditably during the past season. Had the matter been left to the entire student body, there would , have been but one choice, and that would be the man that is now chosen by the players themselves. With Mr. Macdonald leading the team for another year we will do even better than we did this season, and this was our banner year of .baseball.
