So Long, Farewell...
Well, this is it—the last issue of Scholastic to be produced by the 1991-’92 editorial board. After spring break there will be a new lineup of names in the list at left But before the class of 1992 rides off into the sunset, I get my traditional chance to say goodbye to-the magazine.
The attitude of 1978-*79 editor Jake Morrissey has become almost legendary around themagazine’s office. “I hated being Scholastic editor,” he wrote at the expiration of his term. “I wouldn’t wish it upon my worst enemy.”
I have to disagree, at least in part You see, f wouldn’t wish Scholastic’s editorship on my worst enemy, either—I’d save that wish for my close friends.
I’ve been working at Scholastic since the first semester of my freshman year, always hoping to be editor some day. I’m not going to whine about how much work it’s been

because, the truth is, I’ve loved every minute of it. ’
The magazine has made a lot of changes this year: We introduced “Editor’s Notes” (you’re reading them right now), “CampusWatch,” “Glancing Back” and reintroduced the two-page “Coming Distractions” calendar. The magazine’s layout has been redesigned, from the table of contents to “The Final Word.”
In issues this year we’ve examined subjects ranging from the serious: date rape, SUFR, harassment, .Burtchaell’s resignation, the pressure student athletes face — to the not-so-serious: Winne-the-Pooh, ethanol, guides to Graceland and South Bend nightlife. Last semester we made a first try at offering a student course evaluation booklet, an attemptl hope will be continued, expanded and refined next semester. The average length of the magazine has gone from 24 to 28 pages as we have tried to get more in every issue.
Of course, we seniors won’t be completely gone. You’ll probably still see some of our names on story bylines, but we’ll just be writers — it’s not our show anymore.
I know that Patti Doyle and next year’s staff will be making more changes and improvements as they lead the magazine into its 126th year. I also know it’s time to step aside and let them run things.
Thanks to everyone on this year’s staff, and a special note of gratitude to you, without whom we couldn’t have done it: Thanks for reading.

End The Silence
Father James T. Burtchaell has been atNotre Dame for almost 40 years. Burtchaell served as provost for seven years in the 1970s, and for a time seemed next in line for the university presidency. His resignation in December, following public charges of sexual harassment, shocked the campus community.
In the December issue of Common Sense, Michael Vore identified himself as a victim of abuses by Burtchaell. Vote charged that allegations against Burtchaell had been investigated by leaders of the Holy Cross order as early as the mid-‘70s, and added “Whatever the case may be, the University knew about Burtchaell long before I ever stepped foot on this campus as a freshman in the fall of 1982.”
Vore’s charges raise a number of troubling questions: Who knew about Burtchaell’s misconduct, and when did they first become aware of it? If the Holy Cross order and the university were aware of it years ago, why did it take so long for any action to be taken?
Because of these concerns, in his December article, Vore called for “a quick, thorough and public report to be issued within three months.”
It is now three months later. There has been no public report. The university has not issued an official statement answering Vore’s charges. The university has not even issued an official statement of regret
The only official statement about the Burtchaell case was made not by Notre Dame, but by Rev. Carl F. Ebey, the local provincial superior for the Holy Cross order. Questions to President Malloy and Provost O’Meara about this issue are referred to public relations. Public relations usually cites concerns of confidentiality and declines to answer any questions.
Officially, Burtchaell is on sabbatical leave from Notre Dame, and has been reported to be researching at Princeton.
But no one answers the phone at Burtchaell’s listed number in Princeton. Telephone calls to Princeton University have revealed that Burtchaell is no longer there. 'Lorraine Fimim, of the Princeton religion department, said that she had no information as to Burtchaell’s current whereabouts. Neither did Michael Garvey, of Notre Dame public relations, or Lawrence Cunningham, chair of N.D.’s theology department Both men suggested contacting Burtchaell through the Holy Cross provincial office.
An administrator at the provincial office confirmed that Burtchaell is not atPrinceton, but declined to say where he is now. Scholastic can only assume, and hope, that he is now undergoing the “psychological evaluation and treatment” mentioned in Ebey’s statement. But the
MARCH 5,1992
mystery surrounding Burtchaell’s whereabouts is symptomatic of the misguided secrecy which cloaks this entire case.
The only thing that grows in the dark of secrecy is rumor. Was Burtchaell’s 1977 resignation as provost related to the current charges of sexual misconduct? The reasons Burtchaell stepped down as provost have never been clear; according to the Oct. 7,1977 Scholastic: “The major factor complicating response to the Burtchaell resignation has been the absence of any official explanation. Joseph Duffy, professor of English, is disturbed ‘that something so dramatic could happen without explanation. Obviously it was forced, and no explanation was given. Any respectable university would have given an explanation. Anything that serious would have been brought up and explained, however tactfully.’”
Scholastic wishes to stress that Burtchaell’s 1977 resignation as provost may have been for reasons unrelated to the current situation; the only thread connecting them may be how the university has responded. In the 1977 Scholastic Physics Professor Paul Kenny was quoted as saying “According to Notre Dame’s style the University genuinely tries to shield the individual as much as possible, but the intention often brings the opposite result because it creates rumors.”
Notre Dame style hasn’t changed much in 15 years; it still creates rumors and still doesn’t answer important questions. Did the trustees know in 1977? Did the Holy Cross order and university administration know?
According to the Dec. 5,1991 Scholastic, Sister Kathleen Gannon is the official in the provost’s office who usually handles sexual harassment cases, but the Burtchaell case was handled by the provost himself. Why? How would the university have handled this case if the professor involved had been a lay person, rather than a priest?
. Priests have a special pastoral ministry which involves counselling students. This means the university and the order have a corresponding responsibility to ensure that students are protected from those who would abuse their ministry. But again, the university is less than forthcoming in discussing the steps it is taking in response to the Burtchaell case.
The administration is hoping all these questions will just go away. So far their approach has been successful.
The students of Notre Dame must press for an explanation of the handling of the Burtchaell case. More details could be released without compromising confidentiality. The investigation into this single case of sexual misconduct should also include a second section, dealing with steps the university is taking to prevent recurrences of such cases.
The administration’s attitude seems to be that silence, like the Dome itself, is golden.
It is usually silver which tarnishes, but lately it seems as if the top of the main building glows a little less brightly at night. The questions must be answered,	f

LETTER
Last Week’s Missing Cartoon
Editorial Response: Judgement Call
Dear Editor:
The cartoon thatl submitted toScholastic last week didnotappear because it was, as the editor described it, potentially offensive and simply not funny. Ironically, the editor did not actually believe the cartoon to be offensive, but felt that some students might “misinterpret” its meaning. He did concede that had the piece been funnier, he would have taken that chance. Such an attitude is extremely condescending to the magazine’s readers. Apparently the editor does not have confidence in the reader’s ability to make their own distinction of what is offensive, and instead must be protected by his superior judgement. Had he found the cartoon offensive himself, I would have better understood his action. His point that the cartoon was not funny enough is probably a better one (I sometimes forget that Scholastic boasts the staff of Larson, Trudeau and Watterson). Recall however, that I obtained this job through a reader’s poll earlier in the year. Because of this, I naturally assumed that the editor would allow readers to decide for themselves whatis funny and what isn’t.
It was the editor’s suggestion that I write this complaint, and I sincerely appreciate his candor. I do not believe that what the editor did constitutes some gross violation of the First Amendment. I just wish that student publications would be more committed to the free exchange of ideas and show their readers more respect by allowing them to think for themselves.

ters to the editor on every subjectinthemagazine.
Dear Readers:
As editor of Scholastic, I encouraged Scott Liebertz to submit his letter of complaint because I felt we might owe readers an explanation of why his cartoon did not run last week.
In order to really answer his charges properly, though, I have to explain the content of the cartoon I chose not to print The comic in question was subtitled “Why a cultural diversity requirement is needed at N.D.,” and it featured a game of trivial pursuit between two teams. In the cartoon, a white student complained that the question he picked to to ask the opposing team was too easy; they were asked to identify the rock group that was responsible for “Surfin’ U.S.A.” and “Good Vibrations.” The opposing team drew a blank, responding “The Funkadelics?” In the drawing, the opposing team member was black.
As I explained to Scott, I used a two-part process in deciding not to run this cartoon. I felt that his comic was: 1) potentially offensive in implying that black students were ignorant of the Beach Boys, and 2) bluntly put, not very funny.
Since I’ve met Scott, I knew it was not his intention to offend anyone, but rather to raise a point about classes labelled “cultural diversity” that actually teach only about one single different culture. As Scott wrote in his letter, I did fear that other students might misinterpret Scott’s meaning and take offense.
I also told Scott that I would have printed the piece had I found it to be funnier. I’m willing to offend some people for the sake of humor that makes a point, and after the magazine had been printed, I encouraged Scott to explore the idea behind the cartoon in another less offensive, and hopefully funnier, manner.
This isn’t the first time Scholastic hasn’t run a comic. In the past year I’ve also refused to print two cartoons from another artist that were graphic depictions of vomiting, which I thought was a subject that might strike a little too close to home in a publication distributed at dinnertime.
As the magazine’s editor, I am responsible for its content: I choose what we print and what we don’1.1’m not always right, and deciding not to print Scott’s drawing was a judgement call. But if a cartoon is both potentially offensive and not funny, I’m not going to print it.

NEWS COMMENTARY

BY THE G I P P E R
Information, opinion, attitude and outright innuendo
29 Ways to Get Through February
The Month That Would Not End may have ended, but you never know when you might need a list of things to do on campus, and so ... (drum roll, Anton):
29. Check out the new Allegro cafe in the LaFortune basement. Sure, it’s overpriced (it’s university food services, isn’t it?), but it’s well on its way to becoming the classy version of the Night Oak.
28. Go on a campus tour to torture the guide with annoying questions or just leam a little about the school you attend. Check the admissions office for times.
27. If you’re not abusiness major, go into Hayes-Healy and look at the big globe. Sure is one big globe, isn’t it? Kind of cool...
The Gipper interrupts this list for a special CampusWatch announcement:
A Confession
For the past year I, Ian Mitchell, have been masquerading as “The Gipper.” This column began fairly simply, as the answer to a problem. The difficulty was twofold: 1) people don’t read campus news stories and 2) the interesting goings-on at Notre Dame never get much beyond the status of rumor. The solution we came up with was a campus gossip column, with short, opinionated news items. CampusWatch can print the stories that don’t belong anywhere else, and maybe break a story or two by asking the right person the right question. I honestly didn’t mean to end up writing the column every week, but after the first few times I became addicted.
Some Have Guessed, But Few Have Known
Writing “CampusWatch” has always been interesting: The Gipper has gotten some fun mail, and the chance to spout off on the
MARCH 5,1992
mistakes of the university and student government is one that’s hard to pass up. I always tried to keep CampusWatch from sounding too much like my own writing, but I guess I wasn’t entirely successful. Every once in a while a friend would ask about the Gipper’s identity, but I cleverly thought up a strategy to throw them off the track. Here’s a sample conversation in which I try my tricky ruse:
Friend: Hey, Ian, are you the Gipper? Me: No.
This sometimes worked. Other times I would just refuse to make any comment about who the Gipper was. The only people who actually knew I was the Gipper were the editors of Scholastic and my family (I figured I could trust Mom).
A Retraction
I have to correct something I’ve written a few times above: I said I was the Gipper, but I’m not, at least not really. I can’tbe, for I’ll be graduating in May (knock on wood), but the Gipper will forever remain at Notre Dame. You see, sometime during this year, I became aware that the spirit of the. Gipper was the real author of CampusWatch, not me.
I’d like to make sure everyone knows where to lay the blame. It was the Gipper, not me, who called Edward Aloysius “Monk” Malloy, our esteemed university president, “Hocker Head.” Several times.
It was the Gipper, not me, who dared to criticize the bookstore as being overpriced and sponsor a contest for those victims, er, customers who dropped the most cash at Hammes “On the Campus.”
And it was the Gipper who stopped just short of accusing HPC members of causing the problem of hunger in Africa through then-weekly student-supported feeding frenzy. Being possessed by the Gipper’s spirit on a weekly basis has been great fun, but the spirit is leaving me, which is why I’m now able to
reveal that I was its custodian for lo these many months. No one knows where that wandering spectral gossip may have gone; he may have infected a staff member, or he may have wandered out of the office to strike an unsuspecting student
One of the questions the Gipper most often received in the mail was “Can I have your job?” Now the answer may be yes, if you’re the authentic custodian of the Gipper’s ghost
Are You the Gipper?
If you feel the spirit move you, submit three sample CampusWatch items to Scholastic. The items must be true, and all submissions become the property of Scholastic, so even if you’re not selected as Gipp your news tip might end up being published. Remember that the sacred duty of the Gipper is to keep his (or her) identity secret for an entire year, so take some precautions in submitting your entries. Don’t tell other people you’re trying out to be Gipper (only the Scholastic editors will know the Gipper’s true identity). Send submissions in a sealed envelope with no return address, and mark them as letters to the editor on the outside. Losing Gipper candidates will not be notified, but the winning Gipper will have the honor of laboring anonymously (for most of the year, any way) on CampusWatch. Become one of the few, the proud — the Gipp!
CampusWatch Continues
In recent days the Gipper has gotten a lot of interesting mail and heard a lot of interesting rumors, all of which will be passed on for Gipper II (whoever that may be) to take advantage of. If you’ve got a news tip, a great question or some inside information, write CampusWatch at303 LaFortune, drop it off in die office on the third floor of LaFortune, or call 239-7569. The next Gipper will thank you for it	□

Noah's Oscar Ficks and Pancakes
Notre Dame's answer to Gene Shalit tells it like it is
by Noah Cooper
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Letters (Sciences — whatever) will present its 64th Awards on March 30. ! This year’s field contains some heavy com-i petition, and I will provide my choices for the categories as well as who I think the ; sometimes blind Academy will choose. So '	pay attention, because you could win a lot of
i money from your less-informed friends. All of the following picks are based on past j Oscar history, careful attention to all of the I performances, my present mood and, in the acting categories, how much the individual i does not look like Tom Bosley.
Best Supporting Actress: (Diane Ladd, Juliette Lewis, Kate Nelligan, Mercedes Ruehl, Jessica Tandy) Two performances tower above the rest. I loved Juliette Lewis in Cape Fear with her powerful performance as the naive daughter of Nick Nolte. Her sexual awakening through the revolting Max Cady (Robert De Niro) made her an idiot, yet ! strangely attractive. Mercedes Ruehl ’ s per-i	formance in The Fisher King made the
;	Bridges character seem stale. Somebody
< give her a leading role!
Coop’s Pick: Mercedes Ruehl Academy’s Pick: Kate Nelligan
Best Supporting Actor: (Harvey Keitel, i Ben Kingsley, Tommy Lee Jones, Michael I Lerner, Jack Palance) Kingsley should have never been nominated because he was not in Bugsy long enough to do anything. Palance played the exact same character in City Slickers as he has played in every move •	since Shane. Jones was extraordinary oppo-
site Kevin Costner in JFK, and gets my i	second place vote. Keitel did a solid job in
।	Thelma and Louise, but gets lost in the
shuffle with Geena Davis’ and Susan I	Saradon’s acting. The most enjoyable and
>	energetic performance came from Michael
|	Lerner as a cartoonish movie producer in
Barton Fink
Coop’s Pick: Michael Lerner
Academy’s Pick: Tommy Lee Jones . Best Director: (John Singleton, Barry
Levinson, Oliver Stone, Jonathan Demme, 6
Ridley Scott) Hats off to the Academy for finally nominating a black director (Singleton). So many talented directors get overlooked because our culture is afraid to face the problems they present. While Singleton needs a better vehicle than inBoyz N the Hood, at 23 years of age, he will win before he is done. Levinson did an excellent job of handling the Bening-Beatty love story while not losing the gangster story. Stone pounds his message much too hard for my taste, and did not really make a movie as much as a personal appeal. Scott did an incredible job of keeping his heavy-handed directing to a minimum by just letting Davis and Sarandon work their magic. Demme remains as the clear choice with his grotesque yet fascinating tale of serial murders in Silence of the Lambs. Any other director might have let the gore take over but Demme* s death-is-just-around-the-comer pace makes the film spectacular.
Coop’s Pick: Demme
Academy’s Pick: Demme
Best Actress: (Geena Davis, Susan Sarandon, Jodie Foster, Bette Midler, Laura Dem) Annette Bening was unfairly shoved aside for Midler, who basically plays herself in For the Boys. Dem is tremendous as the sexually aggressive young woman in Rambling Rose, but has no chance against the others. Sarandon gives another compelling performance, but her character remains too static to take home the little naked gold statue with the sword between his crotch (Oscar). Foster treats us to her best performance ever. Any actress willing to stand up to Anthony Hopkins’ chilling Hannibal Lector deserves some kind of an award, but she already has an Oscar for The Accused, so I say give it to Davis, whose character went through some kind of transformation in every scene, and Davis pulled them all off remarkably. Davis has reached a point in her career where she will be nominated every year like Meryl Streep, and she should be rewarded.
Coop’s Pick: Geena Davis
Academy’s Pick: Jodie Foster
Best Actor: (Warren Beatty, Nick Nolte,
Anthony Hopkins, Robert De Niro, Robin Williams) Beatty’s Bugsy Segel was too well-suited for him — a womanizing egomaniac. Nolte has never won, but seems to have found the right role in his excellent portrayal as an unemployed football coach who falls in love with his therapist in Prince of Tides. Hopkins played the year’s most intriguing role in his finest performance of his great career; he could appear as Santa Claus and I would still be terrified. If the lambs aren’t still screaming, I am. De Niro gave a similar portrait of unmitigated evil, but showed more versatility with in Cape Fear, but if he couldn’t win with his performance in Awakenings last year, he cannot win this year. Williams cannot measure up to last two because he also plays himself for most of The Fisher King, and is not as convincing in his serious scenes. Hopkins wins out over De Niro by a tongue-length (ouch).
Coop’s Pick: Hopkins
Academy’s Pick: Nolte
Best Picture: (Beauty and the Beast, Bugsy, JFK, The Prince of Tides, The Silence of the Lambs) What? No Steven Segal flick? JFK is the one film that does not belong on the list Over three hours of Stone’s theory and preaching makes me think Stone killed Kennedy — he knows so damn much about it. Bugsy suffered from too much Beatty and not enough Bening. The Prince of Tides mantains that Barbara Streisand is the most annoying actress of all time. The Silence of the Lambs had too implausible of an ending to an otherwise lock to win the Oscar. Beauty and the Beast has tremendous animation coupled with a fantastic score. The classic happy ending does not hurt (but Angela Lansbury does). My pick for Best Picture is Thelma and Louise. The enticing characters, brilliant acting, tight screenplay and the mounds of issues it raises makes Thelma and Louise a movie gem for years to come. .
Coop’s Pick: Thelma and Louise
Academy’s Pick: The Silence of the Lambs	□

_________by Marshall Armintor____________
Lou Reed is one of the few artist/ songwriters who can make a song seem like he found it instead of having written it; Bob Dylan, John Fogerty and Buddy Holly are some of the others who have had this miraculous ability to produce not just great songs, butsongs that seem to have been apart of the universe since creation. I mean, didn’t . Moses receive “Bad Moon Rising” and “Peggy Sue” along with the Ten Commandments? Or is that apocryphal? Anyhow, Lou has already carved out his niche in cultural history with the Velvet Underground, having influenced practically every so-called punk or alternative artist to come after them: from Patti Smith to R.E.M. to the Cowboy Junkies and the New York-based “No Wave” noise-feedback-hell-while-people-in-black-drone-poetry movement all benefitted from the legacy of VU, not to mention the punk do-it-yourself and the anybody-can-be-in-a band movement.
But what do you do after you’ve changed music irrevocably, and your productive angry young man/woman years are finished? You simply cope with growing up and maturing — post rock ‘n’ roll stardom, and maybe, if you’re lucky, you’ll reach the status afforded only to the most venerable figures in blues and jazz: tough and weathered, but still able to blow your hom with conviction and dignity.
With his classic 1988 album, New York, Lou Reed more than proved his endurance and commitment to making music, after struggling artistically in the mid-‘70s. With his new album, Magic and Loss, Reed completes his trilogy of requiem pieces, beginning with New York, a scathing condemnation of modem urban America as it disintegrated during the ‘80s, and continuing with Songs for 'Drella, a song cycle com-
memorating the life of Andy Warhol, written in collaboration with old VU mate John Cale. In Magic and Loss, Reed deals explicitly with the deaths of two of his close friends from cancer, detailing his own feelings and experiences with his vivid lyric style.
Musically, Reed works in the same urban folk-jazz mode as he has in recent works, aided by the synth-guitar of Mike Rathke and the fluid bass of jazzman Rob Wasserman. But the album’s style veers away from the blunt ferocity of New York; most of Magic andLoss flows steadily along in the hymn-like mode of the Velvet Underground’s self-entitled third album. Beginning with the brief commencement theme “Dorita,” which sounds like Handel’s Messiah worked over by Led Zeppelin, Reed’s artistry takes us through a mix of sturdy country-blues (“What’s Good,” “No Chance”), gospel (“Power and Glory I & II”) and even revved-up guitar assaults (“Gassed and Stoked,” “Warrior King”). Most of the album, however, consists , of jazzy guitar strummed softly over glowing clouds of synthesized tones, with Reed’s sung-spoken lyrics setting an even pace.
As a narrative, the evolution of Reed’s feeling cycles through frustration, anger,
sadness and eventually acceptance of death and a willingness to face the future. The narrative Reed spins begins with “What’s Good (The Thesis),” which shows off Reed’s sardonic wit in the face of tragedy; “What good’s a war without killing/What good is rain that falls up/What good’s a disease that won’t hurt you/Why no good, I guess, no good at all.” After the song’s ending lines, “What’s good?/Life’s good/ But not fair at all,” the album then embarks into the thoughts of those in all aspects of death: the dying are given a voice in “Magician,” with its lyrics expressing the longing of the spirit to be rescued from the prison of the body, the act of remembering in “Goodby Mass” and “Dreamin’,” rage at one’s own inability to cope with the pain of living in “Sword of Damocles” and “Harry’s Circumcision” and finally, the celebration of life itself in the holy blues of “Power and Glory II.” The album’s last track, the meditative “Magic and Loss (The Summation)” expresses hope for the future after the survival of any tragedy: “When the past makes you laugh/And you can savor the magic/ That let you survive your own war/You find that fire is passion/And there’s a door up ahead not a wall.”
Although the subject matter of Magic and Loss is tough to handle at times, the purgative journey Reed takes the listener through is well worth it. At times, if Reed appears to overreach his grasp because of the complexity of the narrative, on repeated listenings, these moments fade into the dazzling, coherent whole of the work. Asin the best Velvet Underground songs, such as “Beginning to See the Light,” “Pale Blue Eyes” or “Sweet Jane,” a sense of hope and expectation shines through Magic andLoss, a statement about not just death but the preciousness of life filled with both wonder and sadness.	□

The media inundates the public with staggering reports of the AIDS epidemic. It is all too easy for college students to dismiss such statistics as random occurrences. Although the media is often subject to hype and distorting stories in the name of ratings, AIDS is a reality that many will have to face.
In lightofrecentdiscoveries regarding the virus, AIDS remains a volatile issue. Perhaps the unresolved questions regarding the virus perpetuate rumors about the contraction and spreading of the disease. Nation-

wide campaigns continue the crusade to enlighten the public, attempting to allay fears and provide accurate information.
College students have led sheltered existences, engrossed in the academic and extracurricular routine. The University of Notre Dame is not exempt from this rule. According to Carol Saeger, the director of university health services, “The minority women are demographically the fastest growing group affected by the AIDS virus.”
Saeger noted that AIDS is not exclusive. “College students are particularly at risk due to their age range. They are more apt to lead lifestyles filled with experimentation. Sexual activity at this age increases.” College students adopt an invincible mentality. They are young, healthy and distanced from worldly concerns. Such a mindset can be disastrous, convincing college students that AIDS is not an imminent threat
The university handbook, DuLac, has no provisions for an AIDS policy. University health services does offer an AIDS guideline booklet to all interested students. Seager encourages students to peruse the guide. At present, according to Seager, there are no reported cases of AIDS within the Notre Dame community.
Notwithstanding the present lack of written policy, the. university has made several provisions for concerned individuals. Seager emphasizes that students can be tested on their own volition. “AIDS testing

can be done on our premises or in the County Health Department downtown,” she noted. Confidentiality is ensured in either situation. Personnel assign students with numbers, and only the doctor knows the identity of the recipient “The student is free to be tested at any time on our premises,” Seager claimed. “There is a service fee involved, however, as we run a private laboratory.” The County Health Department is a governmental organization, and testing is free. The only stipulation of the County Health Department is that appointments are mandatory.
Another service provided by the university-is Students With AIDS Training. A fledgling organization solely comprised of students, SWAT serves as a liaison between
students and the administration. SWAT is

tial grant from the Center for Disease Control and the Indiana State Board of Health, the student leaders have participated in AIDS education on a larger scale. Recently, members Brian Fitzpatrick and Karen DaCosta-Hemandez made presentations to the National Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities.
Diana Bradley, a SWAT member, stated, “Students are surprisingly receptive to us. We go wherever we are invited.” The tenor of dorm meetings is informal. “We consult with students and supply them with information.” The students do not feign expertise on the subject and lead students to the proper resources if necessary. The university also mandates AIDS education for all rectors and resident assistants.
The media is culpable for depicting misleading images of AIDS patients, Saeger said. “AIDS is a hidden disease, sometimes latent for as long as seven to ten years,” she said. “When we see emaciated AIDS cases in the media, we assume that everyone stricken with the virus will have telltale signs.” AIDS can thus lay dormant, eluding its victims.
A few short years ago, the AIDS virus was an obscure affliction reserved only for categorized groups. Today, the epidemic seems to envelop all lifestyles, assuming larger than life proportions. Notre Dame’s response to AIDS involves students and the university health service, in hopes that continued AIDS education will banish any negative stereotypes and misconceptions, fostering a more secure scholastic community.	□

It’s Not on Hog’s Hill But It’s Still Holy Cross
by Chris Blanford
Holy Cross College holds its own, despite being in the shadow of big brother Notre Dame

Three Holy Cross students review their assignments In between classes


Imagine a Notre Dame degree for only $3900 a year.
Effectively this is what students at Holy Cross College are getting. Students there pay just $130 per credit hour to attend a school whose curriculum matches that of Notre Dame’s.
According to its General Information Guide, Holy Cross is a college designed for students to transfer to a senior institution.
“We’re a two-year transfer institution, not a community-type of two-year college,” says Brother James Bluma, vice president of student affairs.
“Our first two years are geared upon what Notre Dame, Saint Mary’s, and the Indiana University system requires,” he says. Holy Cross College provides the prerequisite courses that a student needs to transfer to the institution of his or her choice.
But attending Holy Cross does not guarantee acceptance into the University of Notre Dame.
“If a student has done very well after two years ... and taken all the courses that are
required, then Notre Dame gives them con- Indiana University.
sideration,” says Bluma, “We rank high in that because we do have the transfer curriculum and the students know what they want. They are motivated.”
The lower cost is not the only reason students attend Holy Cross.
Brendan Murphy was recruited to play
10

soccer for Notre Dame but wasn’ t admitted to the freshman class, so he attended Holy Cross for two years and transferred. He is now a junior living in Zahm Hall.
Murphy had two brothers who went there before he did. “I’ve always known Holy Cross was a good school.”
“I think oneof thebiggestadvantages,” he-says, “is that it is a small school and very personal. You know your professors.”
Michael Stewart, a Holy Cross freshman andpresidentofits student advisory council, says, “I don’t think I would have been as good [astudent] atNotre Dame as I am here. ... You get all the attention you need here,” he says.
“I think students at Holy Cross in a sense are getting a better education because the classrooms only have 20 or 25 students in them and there’s a chance for interaction with the teacher,” says Murphy.
Holy Cross students also have access to mostofNotreDame’s academic andathletic facilities. Brother Bluma says that three years ago an agreement was reached so that students with Holy Cross I.D.s can use the facilities at Notre Dame, Saint Mary’s and
But Holy Cross isn’t perfect for everyone.
If a student is interested in science, engineering, or pre-med, “We would tell a student when they come here, *No. Don’t come to Holy Cross. Don’t start off here,”’ says Bluma, because the college only provides courses in the liberal arts.
Also, with an enrollment of 419, Holy Cross’s status will always be played against the larger schools nearby. “It’s in the shadow of Notre Dame and it’ll never be something like Notre Dame,” says Murphy.
Students there do not get football tickets, nor can they use Notre Dame Health Services. Housing, too, isn’t part of the cost. According to Bluma, about seventy percent of the college is from the Michiana region. There are no dorms on campus, making Holy Cross strictly a commuter school.
Holy Cross’s General Information Guide states that “the housing facilities at the University ofNotre Dame and Saint Mary’s College are not open to Holy Cross students.” Yet according to the university directory, two students from the college live on the Notre Dame campus in Carroll Hall.
“How they got there... is not something I enter into,” said Brother Bluma. He attributes their residence in the hall to “special interest groups for Notre Dame... There is no agreement between the two institutions at all,” he said.
Holy Cross College is run by the Brothers of the Congregation of Holy Cross. The congregation, as well as lay people, teach the classes at Holy Cross.
This year marks the college’s 25th year. Holy Cross Junior College opened in the fall of 1966 through the leadership of Brother John Driscoll, C.S.C., who served as President and Dean until 1987. Its first class consisted of student Brothers. Male students from the surrounding area were enrolled in the fall of 1967.	1
The College became coeducational in 1968. Now officially called Holy Cross College, the school has grown to include local, national, and international students.
Students are admitted mostly on the basis ofhigh school performance. “WeuseSATs as a guide to help us make a decision,” says Bluma, “but it’s how well they did in high school and the courses they took that matter.”
Nearly every student at Holy Cross likes the close-knit atmosphere. “To me it’s like a big family. After a month you know everybody, at least by face, even when you’re out somewhere,” Murphy says.
Stewart adds, “I think Holy Cross is a
well-kept secret.’

Peckham plays both classical and Broadway tunes at the requests of the older crowd.
Peckham’s entrepreneurial instincts payed off when he saw the potential for
piano entertainment at the fledgling restaurant. “I knew that they were going with a 5-star plan, and it seemed that a piano bar would be a nice addition,” says Peckham. “They were not even advertising. I just saw the piano and I said, ‘Listen, I can do you a service.’”
Although Peckham hadn’t ever performed in a restaurant before, he told the manager, “I’m not sure how I’m going to be. Just let me come in.’ It was the night of a big Valentine’s Day party.”
Peckham admits he was a little nervous, because he “had no idea what the people wanted, or how I would sound amid bar chatter... I didn’t know what kind of music they would like, so I relied on my grandfather to pick out the songs ... and I played
them and everyone loved them. Then I just developed my own style.” His family often drops by to see him perform. “My grandfather comes out a lot. My parents come out every other weekend. They usually order a drink, then take off,” he says.
After his trial performance, it was obvious that the customers liked the addition, and Peckham has been a fixture ever since.
He says his job is definitely more fun than work. “You meet a lot of interesting people,” Peckham says. One memorable experience was the night a bachelorette party came to the restaurant and invited him to their little celebration. “The only two males that would have been there were the stripper and me.
“Their limousine broke down so they all hopped in the back of my station wagon. I dropped them off at a bar in Springreen, but I had better things to do.” Better things to do? Peckham grins and reconsiders, “Well, maybe not belter, but I had obligations I had to takecareof.” One night he even saw Bill Murray at the restaurant.
“You get a lot of interesting advice as the night goes on,” g he adds. “Basically, the men f tell me women just aren’t worth 5 it.”
Peckham thinks he’s good at what he does because he can “read” the crowd. “A lot of what I do is play off of the people who come into the restaurant. You can adjust the type of music to the crowd, and that’s always fun.”
Peckham plays in the percussion section of the Marching Band and recendy joined the St. Mary’s Collegiate Choir. Although Peckham plans to continue his performances on the piano, he doesn’t plan on making piano-playing a career after he graduates. “But who knows. I may end up, if the money’s right, playing the piano every night and managing the restaurant I play at I enjoy playing so much that if I was in charge of a resort, I’d love to play.” Considering the success that Peckham’s already had, it wouldn’t be a surprise if his whim comes true.	□

How Very Himesian
Father Michael Himes gains a loyal following in mass and in class using wit and old-fashioned charm
by Mollie Mudd and Elizabeth Baytion
One of the “top ten threats to the Catholic
Church” can be found right here at Notre Dame. In an interview Father Michael Himes confirms the rumor that a “quite right-wing publication described him as the
seventh greatest threat to the Church.”
“I thought it was a great honor,” Himes says, “but if I’m one of the ten worst threats to them, then the Catholic Church is one of the most secure institutions in the world.”
When you meet the man it’s difficult to believe he could hurt a fly, let alone the stronghold of the Catholic church.
Dressed in a char
acteristic tweed
jacket, vest and tie, Himes has the air of a British professor transplanted to the com and wheat fields of Indiana. The mix of a Long Island accent “with a bit of Britain thrown in” — the influence of his British-bom mother — adds to the impression.
Himes has been a popular theologian on campus for the past five years. He says he tries to teach his students to “be intelligent, responsible and a believer.
“One of the reasons I so immensely enjoy being at Notre Dame is the students. Notre Dame is the national Catholic seminary — in the very broadest sense of the word. This is the training place for the leadership of the Catholic community of the future,” says Himes. Teaching at Notre Dame gives him the opportunity to interact with the future leaders of the Catholic church.
In his attempts to convince students of the criticisms of various classical philosophers, Himes describes himself as an “intellectual
used-car salesman.” He teaches two general undergraduate theology courses, “The Critique of Religion in Modernity” in the fall, and “The Sacramental Principle” in the spring.
“The things that he says are applicable to life as well as theology,” says Hilary Jones,
Himes’ lively lecture style shows In his class “Sacraments and Sacramentality.”
a senior in Himes’ spring course. His students, the majority of which have had Catholicism spoon-fed to them since elementary school, like the way Himes can make worn-out Catholic doctrines seem fresh and exciting.
“I just like what he has to say, ” says Jones. “It’s not just a bunch of theology ‘mumbo-jumbo’ ... that doesn’t have any application to what we do today.” Jones thinks that Himes’ lectures are applicable to real life.
In the classroom Himes is entertainer as well as professor.
Meg Garnett, a senior in Himes’ course last fall, says, “He’s really a dynamic lecturer ... You go to his class just because you want to go and listen to him talk.”
Do his students think he’s a “liberal” priest?
Jones says that she does consider him liberal “just because he admits that everything is not necessarily right with the Church
and that there are problems.”
“It’s hard to say,” says Garnett, “because on the one hand he really emphasizes the sacraments and going to mass, and... to me
that seems really traditional. But on the one hand he makes it very personal. That makes him seem liberal to me, compared to some of the priests I know.”
Himes is as known for his rousing homi
lies as his classroom lectures. He describes his homilies as moments “when I speak to myself and other people eavesdrop,” since he prepares homilies to help himself understand the Gospel.
“You cannot begin to prepare a homily by saying ‘What do they want to hear?’” be
cause first one has to define who “they” are. Instead, he asks himself, “What do I need to hear from these readings?”
When people ask Himes why he decided to become a priest and professor, the best explanation he can offer is a quote from Wordsworth: “What we have loved, others will love, and we will
teach them how.
“What one has found deep, important and valuable,” Himes says, “other people will find deep, important and valuable.”
Garnett says that if there was one thing that she took away from Himes’ course, it would be “how he emphasized that religion and faith is something that you live out... He really stressed that the Christian faith isn’t necessarily the words in the Bible or the rituals... it’s the way that you live your daily life and how people relate to each other.”
Even if it’s next to impossible to get into one of his courses, Himes can be found celebrating evening masses in Keenan on Thursday and P.E. on Monday. Himes constantly speaks of the “Notre Dame student body of future leaders” and how glad he is to be able to interact with them. Likewise, his students consider themselves just as lucky to have “the 7th greatest threat to the Catholic Church” living under the golden dome.	a

It’s Time To PLAY BALL!
Irish baseball coach Pat Murphy has his charges poised to take the MCC, and then the NCAA, by storm
Courtesy of Sports Information
By John Regruth
Long before the 1992 season began, the Notre Dame baseball team’s chances of winning a spot in the NCAA tournament improved measurably. In a meeting held last November, the NCAA Baseball Committee recommended restoring the automatic bid for the winner of the Midwestern Collegiate Conference tournament champion. The NCAA Executive Council approved that recommendation a month later, assuring an MCC representative.
Notre Dame’s head baseball coach, Pat Murphy, applauded theNCAA’s actions but said, “Our approach will be the same with or without the automatic bid. In baseball, it’s ridiculous for a tournament bid to ride on one tournament game. Too many things can happen: your best pitcher might have an off day or their pitcher might have the game of his life.”
Despite his reservations, Muiphy understands the importance of an automatic bid as much as anyone. In the two seasons since the MCC’s bid was revoked, the Irish have compiled a 91-28 record, with victories over powerhouses like Miami (Fla.), Texas, and Louisiana State, but have failed to attract an
14
at-large bid from the tournament committee. The Fighting Irish won last year’s conference tournament, which could have remedied their predicament if the bid still existed.
Because a similar fate has befallen Notre Dame’s women’s basketball team, some people have theorized that both squads were the victims of animosity towards Notre Dame after it signed last year’s TV contract with NBC.
Murphy simply calls the events of the past two years “an injustice” and chooses to look forward to the upcoming season. What he sees is one of the mostpromising seasons for Irish baseball in years.
The national college baseball press has taken a liking to Murphy’s team. In Collegiate Baseball’s “Fabulous 40” poll, the Irish are 20th. Baseball America ranked Notre Dame eleventh in the country in its preseason poll, in front of Texas, LSU (last year’s national champions), Cal St-Fullerton, and Arizona State.
Muiphy is skeptical of the recognition. Last year, he humorously downplayed preseason rankings saying, “I told the guys we’re ranked 278th. That’s the Murphy poll. We’ll stay there until we beat somebody.”
Murphy continues that refrain this year saying, “Rankings are someone else’s opinion. They’re good for the press and for outsiders, but they don’t mean a thing for us. We know inside how good we are.”
The recognition keeps coming, however, and other MCC coaches believe it whether Murphy does or not. Besides a high ranking, Baseball America also picked Notre Dame to win the conference title. In its “Who to Watch” section, the starting lineup for the Irish nearly appears in its entirety.
Jim Brownlee, the head coach of MCC rival Evansville, said, “I think Notre Dame has to be the favorite going into the season."
“They’re solid everywhere,” said Larry Redwine, who is the head coach of the Xavier Musketeers, another of Notre Dame’s MCC foes. “Their pitching from top to bottom is the best in the conference.”
Statistics back up Redwine’s assertion. Notre Dame’s returning pitching staff accounted for 43 of its 45 victories last season. PatLeahy has drawn the most attention as he enters his third year. The 6’ 7”, 245 lb. right-handed hurler posted an 8-3 record againsta 4.76 ERA last season, and is considered by Baseball America to be one of the top 25 college draft picks. Alan Walania, also a
SCHOLASTIC
junior,
returns after equalling the school record for wins in a season. He went 11-5 with three saves and a 3.69 ERA. David Sinnes (5-2, 4.73 ERA last season), Chris Michalak (9-1, 2.47) and Tom Price (7-2,2.55) will round
out the starting rotation for
the Irish.
Notre Dame also added four talented freshmen to its pitching staff: Dan Adams, Craig Allen, Marty DeGraff, and Tim Kraus. Kraus was picked in the 11th round by the San Francisco Giants, even though he had already signed a letter of intent to attend Notre Dame.
Despite the level of talent on his staff, Murphy said, “Pitching is a funny animal. It’s hard to figure out Just take a look at Bret Saberhagen or Doc Gooden. We’re optimistic about our pitching staff, but our optimism is guarded.”
Murphy is less reserved about the other facets of his team, particularly its hitting ability.
“Our hitting will be outstanding,” he boasted. “Our young guys are aggressive and the upperclassmen are experienced and smart.”
The focus of the Irish offense is first baseman Joe Binkiewicz. Last season, Binkiewicz led the team with a .379 batting average, and his 15 home runs and 48 RBI’s were second only to
Frank Jacobs, who is now in the New York Mets organization. Binkiewicz displayed his prodigious power last year against Xavier when he hit a Ruthian blast over Coveleski stadium’s 35 foot wall in dead center field, 405 feet away from home plate; In addition to his work on the field, the Irish senior survived the pre-med program, and has been accepted by two medical schools.
Another senior pre-med student who figures to play a major part in Notre Dame’s offensive attack is senior Cory Mee. A
switch hitter who batted .355 last season,
Mee will probably occupy the hot comer at third base. He will also share the catching duties with sophomore Matt Haas and freshman Bob Lisanti.

stone combination. Counsell, who will tricaptain the ‘92 Irish along with Mee and Binkiewicz, batted a career best .312 and led the team in doubles last season while finding a home at shortstop. Layson made a big splash at second base in his first year of college ball. He was selected the top freshman second baseman by Baseball America after hitting .338?stealing 20 bases, and shining defensively. '
Murphy can barely contain his enthusiasm for Layson saying, “He’s an outstand
ing (player). You’ll lay in bed before a game
trying to find out how to stop him, and he’ll still find a way to beat you.”
Dan Bautch and Eric Danapilis will be fixtures in theNotreDame outfield. Bautch, a speed merchant with a golden glove, will roam center field. The junior stole 16 bases
last year, second best on the
team behind Layson. Danapilis figures to settle in rightfield, andhisbatfigures to fall near the top of the batting order. After hitting at a .374 clip last year, Danapilis’ career average actually fell to .399. Murphy will most likely fill the third outfield slot with senior Mike Rooney, junior Edwin Hartwell, freshman Tom Anderson, or freshman Craig DeSensi.
Perhaps the only problem facing Murphy this season concerns his talented freshmen. Ranked third among recruiting classes across the country, Notre Dame attracted three players selected in last June’s professional draft. In addition to Tim Kraus, Paul Failla and Steve Verduzco turned down pro offers. Failla, who doubles as a quarterback for the football team, was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the seventh round. Collegiate Baseball rated him as one of the 20 best infielders in the nation last year. Verduzco, also an infielder, was picked in the fifth round by the Philadelphia Phillies.
The test for Murphy will be to find room in his already tal-
ent-laden infield for his new arrivals. At the moment, the field is crowded with experienced seniors and Layson, who is the cornerstone.
Murphy has called Failla and Verduzco “our infield of the future,” but adds that they “have to wait their turns. They have to earn (a spot in the starting lineup). I can’t go by potential.”
Because of his pro-caliber, throwing arm and bat, Verduzco may find playing time as a left fielder. Murphy said he does not
expect grumbling from any dissatisfied

freshmen, however.
“One thing you find out when you talk to these guys is that they’re great people,” said Murphy. “They have it together.”
Competition for the team promises to be as stiff as settling the starting lineup. Notre Dame’s first 18 games are on the road, including three each against 19th-ranked Arizona State and top-ranked Miami (Fla.) The home-opener will be April 2, when the team takes on Valparaiso.
Once the Irish begin conference play, Evansville and Xavier look to be the toughest opponents. Baseball America and coaches around the MCC agree that the Purple Aces will finish second to the Irish and the Muskateers third. “They’re both teams to be reckoned with,” said Murphy.
Evansville, like Notre Dame, has drawn preseason raves from the college baseball press. Baseball America rated it the 34th best team in the country. Pitching will be its strong point. This year’s staff accounted for 31 of Evansville’s 40 wins in ‘91. The Purple Aces return two of the conference’s leading pitchers in John MacCauley, who lead the league in wins (13), and Greg Willming, who posted a 10-5 record. MacCauley ranked among the MCC’s ERA leaders as well, finishing with a second best 2.48. Evansville will also pack a mighty punch on offense. Pat Schulz and his .387
batting average (2nd best in the MCC in ‘91) and slugger Marty Watson are back. Watson hit 14 homers last year, outdone only by Notre Dame’s Jacobs (20 home runs) and Binkiewicz (15).
Despite his experienced returnees, Evansville head coach Jim Brownlee said, “Our success will depend on our newcomers.”
In particular, Brownlee is looking for Hank Wheeler (whose hitting ability Brownlee compared to Don Mattingly) and Eric Devlin to contribute on offense.
Xavier, on the other hand, will count on its
cadre of seniors for leadership. The Musketeers’ offense begins with senior center fielder Scott Federle. A .325 hitler last season, Federle also showed off his quickness and aggressive as a baserunner by stealing 38 bases. SeniorsMattGriffin(llhome

runs, 42 RBI’s in ‘91), Mike Maxey (5 HRs, 44 RBI’s), and the budding Mike Lassandro should provide the pop in XU’s offense. Maxey will also sure up the pitching staff along with sophomore starter Bemie Cuervo and junior closer T. R. O’Brien, who recovered from a series of arm troubles and finished third in the conference last year in saves. Considering its schedule, Xavier will need all the leadership, pitching, and hitting it can get.
“We have by far the toughest schedule in the conference,” said head coach Larry Redwine.
The numbers support Redwine’s claim. XU’s opponents have a .580 winning percentage against other Division I schools. The competition includes sixth-ranked Oklahoma State, #21 Indiana State, #25 South Alabama, and traditional Southern powers Tulane and New Orleans. Redwine hopes the gni-eling preseason schedule can strengthen his team as it heads into conference play.
The bottom half of the MCC is. populated by programs that are rebuilding. Detroit Mercy, a strong team last year, lost much of its starting lineup to graduation. However, it will return All-Conference southpaw Jason Novetsky and a couple of strong batsmen in Mike Heard (.326) and Mark Dube (.316). Butler will have the services of the MCC’s best hitter from last year, Brent Berglund (.392), and Dayton, which finished in the conference cellar in ‘91, will try to improve under the tutelage of fifth year coach Mark Schlemmer, who will count heavily upon home run hitting sophomore Brian Harlamert.
With the MCC shaping up into a three team race for the title, Murphy is confident in his team’s chances of winning it.
“We’re the best,” he said simply.
The trick for the ‘92 Irish will be to turn all of their potential and promise into tangible results.
“Our major concern is adher
ing to (our) expectations,” said Murphy. “There will be a lot of outside distractions like pro scouts, the media, and agents. We have to remember how we got here: with a good attitude and an unparalleled work ethic.”
And so, the six-team Midwestern Collegiate Conference has regained its automatic bid to the NCAA Baseball Tournament, a bid that it had held from 1984 to 1989. Notre Dame figures to lead the MCC pack in pursuit of the coveted invitation to the tournament of champions. Until then, it's time to play ball!	v □

The Irish softball squad enters its fourth season ready to take a crack at the 1992 NCAA tournament


Since the inception of softball as a varsity sport at Notre Dame, solid defense and strong pitching have catapulted the Irish to one of the top teams in the Midwest. Entering their fourth season, the Irish are poised on the verge of national recognition with a solid, well established program as the foundation of their success.
“If we have the success we’ve had in the past two seasons, we should be invited to play in the post-season,” asserts head coach Brian Boulac.
In 1988, assistant athletic director Boulac was given the reigns to head coach the first varsity softball team for Notre Dame. Three seasons later, Boulac has built up a program with two MCC championship titles and over 100 victories.
The softball team achieved their climb to success with Boulac juggling his jobs as head coach and assistant athletic director. Softball was the only varsity sport without a full-time

coach, so Boulac looked for assistance. Last fall, he enticed Lake Michigan College softball coach and athletic director Liz Miller to join the program as a full-time assistant coach. With over 500 victories, Miller is the winningest junior college coach in softball in America. She started the softball program at Lake Michigan College 17 years ago, and later started and head coached the volleyball and women’s basketball teams.
“I was really impressed with her as a teacher and for her dedication,” comments Boulac.
The addition of Miller not only helps Boulac with organizing practice, but the full-time Miller is available to the players for extra instruction if one of them misses a practice.
“Teaching is a big part of coaching,” Miller believes. “I really enjoy working with the [athletes].”
This season, the coaches have placed more emphasis on hitting in practice. Last year, none of the Irish upper-classmen managed to bat above .300. Offensive firepower came from frestimen bats.
“We’ve worked hard to become a better hitting ball club,” Boulac explains.
Last season’s three freshmen who led the team in batting average have all garnered spots in
this year’s starting line-up. Last year’s freshman StephaniePinter,	up at third base, is slated to start at first base though she might be
who posted a.364 average in 30 games as a pinch-hitter and back-	moved to designated hitter.

Sophomore Christy Connoyer, who averaged .339 last season, will return to second base this season. .
“ [Connoyer] is a fine, fine athlete who has developed into a good infielder. She and [senior shortstop Ruth Kmak] will give us a great middle infield,” said Boulac.
From either the outfield or the pitching mound, sophomore Carrie Miller returns to the line-up as the only other player topost an above .300 average last season. She batted .308.
This year Boulac adds another strong hitter to the line-up with the arrival of freshman Sara Hayes.
“Sara brings a big bat to the line-up. She’ll hit for average and for power,” Boulac comments.
Hayes will probably join the defense in right field, along with returning lead-off hitter Ronny Alvarez.
Alvarez, a junior center fielder, uses her quickness to beat the throw to first, hitting the ball with a left-handed ‘slap-bunt’ technique. Boulac claims that she has really worked hard to develop this technique into a consistent offensive weapon since adopting it last year. '
Every year the softball team has bettered their previous record, and each season the prospects improve. In the first year of varsity Notre Dame softball, freshman Missy Linn was the pitching sensation that sparked the team. When Linn, now a senior and still the pitching star, leaves after this season, the program will not collapse with her absence. S taci Alford enters her third season this year as the second starter for the Irish, with an impressive 12-5 record and 1.44 ERA. Joining Alford on the mound will be sophomore Carrie

Tight defense has always been a hallmark of Nqtre Dame softball. This year, the Irish will have some more offensive firepower as they compete in the MCC.
Miller, who posted a 1.41 ERA in her freshman year. For next year, Boulac has signed Tenilynn Kobota and Kara Bamdenberger, two top California pitching prospects who will help provide for the future success of the Notre Dame softball program.
But next season is far from the players’ minds as they prepare to travel to Florida over spring break. Playing teams from Rhode Island, Princeton, Army and Oklahoma will give the team a competetive diversion from its primarily Midwestern schedule, as well as valuable experience before entering the Southern Illinois tournament on March 7-8. The Irish will face Bowling Green, Southeast Missouri State and powerhouse host Southern Illinois. The first home game scheduled for the team is appropriately on St. Patrick’s Day (March 17) against Bowling Green.
With strong pitching, a solid defense and hopefully hitting, Notre Dame softball is poised in the starting gate, on the verge of a season which could propel them into a post-season national toumamentfor the first time in its short but successful history.	□

Mime is Money
(but what's up with Minnesota?)
President Bush Slain
It seems that a couple of University of Minnesota students tempted the wrath of our nation's Secret Service recently with a parody rap song entitled "How I killed George Bush." The College Press Service reports that the song was not meant to be a political statement, but a "mockery of the ambiguity and rhetoric that shrouds rap music." The song, which is also the title track of F-kripz's debut album, contains the lyrics, "To be all I can be/ I'll kill the p-r-e-zj cuase the Sedition Act/don't mean a thing to me." A flustered agent, who will remain nameless, feels that the Sedition Act should mean a lot to everyone. Of Bush, he simply stated: "He's not dead yet"
Not Alone
Not satisfied with heat from the Secret Service, another group at the University of Minnesota tempted the wrath of an even higher power. According to the College Press Service, a group that calls itself the Athiestists and Unbelievers attempted to raise the public consciousness of atheism through a public lecture. Michael Valle, the organizer of the lecture was quoted as saying: "It's harder to get an atheist out of the closet than a gay." The purpose of the group is not to convert anyone to atheism; They just want athiests to know they are not alone. Unfortunately, to become a part of this group, new members mustfirstadmitthattheyreallyare all alone before the other unbelievers will accept them.
New Study: Mimes Not Totally Useless
According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, librarians at Stetson University in Deland, Florida will no longer have to shush noisy patrons in the library. Instead, $ crack team of peer-pressuring mimes will use their many skills to keep things under control. Known and feared, the Stetson Quiet Library Society has overcome all resistance in its quest for quieter libraries everywhere. One student uses his mime skills to attract new recruits. So far he has lured 70 new members who pledged, "I believe the library should be a place for quiet study, research, and reading."
Condom Contract Rejected
The Chronicle of Higher Education reports that Harvard University has refused to let a company sell condoms emblazoned with its insignia. Although the condoms would help the university encourage its students to practice safe sex, Harvard officials balked at the offer over fears of legal troubles if the condoms proved defective. The University of Notre Dame recently rejected a similar offer due to projected troubles should the condoms prove effective. □

Yes, it’s true. This will be the last time you and I will be able to exchange our thoughts, problems, and generally disgusting material. I don’t want to get all gooey but I would like to thank everyone who ever sent in a letter. I solved some problems, created a few others, and tempted the censors. You were the ones who made this far-too-uptight campus laugh at itself once in awhile and act like normal college students. But for now, I’ll answer one more pressing inquiry before I sign off. I know the spring in your step will be gone without me, but that's that. Hope to see some of you when our sentences are up. •
Dear Mr. Manners:
I know you are being overloaded with excess questions about body functions and oddities, deformities, etc., but I need help with this one. My girlfriend has a few, well, way too many male hormones resulting in a very visible dark mustache with accompanying neck hair. Women’s lib is one thing, but this is out of control. I can see it, my friends can see it, and it’s heinous. But I can’t tell her because she might like it. She shaved it.once and I received severe facial abrasions in a passionate moment. What to do without embarrasing her?
Your bud, Jack Dillon Hall
Dear Jack,
If you don’t tell her, I will. This is just too gross for me to comprehend. I would call her on it, if you really want to “save face” so to speak. If she does not respond, hold a dorm fund-raiser for the little honey’s electrolysis/birthday gift.
While bleaching is a favorite inexpensive method, no one really wants to look like a ferret. I'd say cut the hair or cut the relationship. Mid-term week is almost history so there is no excuse for such atrocious personal hygiene. Has she no pride?
Dear Mr. Manners:
I just heard about your untimely demise and so I Fed-Exed this right to you. What are we going to do without you? You made my dinners bearable, my social life a little better, and my sense of humor maximized (and gave me a reason to pick up a campus publication). I don’t want to live in a world without satire! What’s next?

Dear Beth,
The only reason I can give for my demise is a the fact that we can’t all act like we’re 13 forever. I’m just glad I had the opportunity to serve all of you, and Behavior Modifier doesn’t look bad on the ol’ resumd. It’s a well known fact that this is the first flipped-to place in the publication, but humor will continue, even without my sarcastic bite. You stayed with me when some extremely brilliant leader forced me to the back pages in hopes of your reading everything else first, but you were smart enough to flip the magazine over and read backwards (I've seen it in the dining halls). Can't talk now, I have to prepare to go see the freaks in California for break, so check me out on The Price is Right ("One dollar, Bob, one Dollar!"). Later.	.	□

I Ahuna (Be An Anarchist!!!
Roger Hipp takes a humorous look at the frustration with student government
By Roger Hipp
Maybe it’s the recession and poor job prospects that are making people around here so serious-minded these days. In happier times, graduating seniors could expect to get good jobs with their degrees and eventually become better off than their parents. Nowadays, graduates are lucky if they can return to their high school jobs at Yogurt Hut. This is pretty serious stuff, but hey, most of us are not seniors hoping to enter the job market. I tend to think that most of the excess seriousness on campus comes from people taking themselves too seriously.
Case in point: student government hi high school student government was something of a joke, but at least it had some relevance to student life. If your senior class president had spent all the class funds on pizza, there would have been no prom. But here at ND, student government has about as much impact on student life as the Lithuanian Parliament Hardly anyone got upset over the “revelation” that HPC was going out to dinner with hall funds, because most of us already knew that ordering pizza for itself is the primary function of our student government;
I’m kidding, of course. The primary functions of our student governors are to create and to sit on committees. That’s why candidate resumes are filled with entries like: “Co-Chairperson, Publicity Subcommittee of the Vice President’s Committee on Special Task Forces.” Student government candidates are also responsible for generating millions of election posters, and the winners get to order name plates for themselves. These advertising expenditures
might have been enough to pull the greater Michiana region out of the recession, at least for the duration of election season.
These committees of poster-printing pizza-eaters would be agreeable enough if they didn’t take themselves so seriously. Look at this year’s somber posters for student body president Reading the slogans, you couldn’t help thinking that these were serious people campaigning to do seriously important work.
“DEMAND EXCELLENCE ... IT’S OUR TRADITION.” The only place where
demand decent beer.
Domers have traditionally demanded excellence is on the football field. The rest of the time we don’t even demand, decent beer. Until no freshman refrigerator chills a can of Old Milwaukee, I don’t think we can brag about a tradition of demanding excellence, least of all from student government
“REAL PROMISES ... REAL RESULTS.” This concise slogan is worthy of an investment bank (“At Travelling Dean Shearson Lynch, we make real promises...and deliver real results,”) but I don’tthinkitresonatesin the political world. Other than the FRED-line, I doubt many students could name a single campaign
promise any of their student officers have madegoodon. Call the Gipp if you know of another one.
“SCREW YOU” was the anti-establishment ticket’s idea of clever advertising. Apparently concentrating on the Arts and Letters vote, they decorated O’Shag with invitations to thecandidate debate topped by that eye-catching headline. Even in this era of negative politics, that seemed a bit much. Besides, can you imagine going to a candidate “debate” to hear a discussion of the “issues?” Unlike recent “outsider” candidates, these rebels seemed bent on taking student government even more seriously than the establishment tickets did.
“MAKING STUDENTS MATTER” was the winning slogan, perhaps because it was the most honest. The winning ticket in essence admitted that making students matter would be a pretty novel idea for student government.
Don’t get me wrong: the last thing I think Notre Dame needs is a student body president with an Agenda for Change. Student life at Notre Dame is a good case for anarchy. Things are more or less satisfactory, and the Administration wouldn’t listen to our major gripes if Thomas Jefferson were student president. In fact, Jefferson would be perfect for the job. Since he’s dead, he wouldn’t order pizza, form committees, or print posters. He’d be about as effective as recent presidents at addressing student needs, and he’d certainly be much more quiet about it.	□

The history of the Basilica of Sacred Heart is even older than that of the university
।	By Heather Rakoczy
( O acre^ Heart? Of course I remember ;i	that magical place. In the autumn,
. I when the leaves are falling and the church : i bells are booming, I couldn’t help but feel I - ■. was walking three feet off the ground,” said - ■. - Jim Dillon, a visitor from Joliet, Illinios. It is this “magical place” to which students j < have access every day. Yet, while Sacred : -:	Heart is a massive, decorative building and
: | <	a place to keep company with God, for most
b: - students it remains a mysterious enclosure : ; -	of little-known facts.
1 - In 1686, it. was the Potawatomi people, < French trappers, and other settlers that - - worshipped at the first Catholic church es-;-Z tablished on the grounds. This place of is ~ Z worship was the Chapel of Saint Marie du I; - Lac which was founded by a French mis-:■ z sionary priest, Father Claude Allouez. In
1759, however, the British seized theregion. Z It was not until 1832 with the aid of Father Z Stephen Badin that the chapel was rebuilt
Both Allouez and Badin’s chapels were built ~ on the site of the Old College.
~ Ten years following Badin’s efforts, in Z 1842, Father Edward Sorin renamed the 2	mission Notre Dame du Lac. With the new
; name came a larger log chapel built on the 2 site of the present-day church. Finally in I	1848, a new church was built and dedicated
I totheSacredHeartofJesus. The first church >'	of the Sacred Heart was 90 feet long, 38 feet
r 2 2	wide and 24 feet high, whereas the church of
j;2;	today is in the form of a Latin cross, 275 feet
i;-; long and 114 feet wide.
L - 2 It was not until 1870, however, that con-:; 1 struction for the present Gothic revival ■ • church was begun, with the cornerstone
being put in place in 1871. The “magic” began for the first time when mass was celebrated in the “new church” on August 15,1875.
Since that firstmass in 1875, Sacred Heart has undergone a renovation of the sanctuary in 1968 so that it would be in accord with the guidelines of Vatican II; then in 1989, the church was closed for an extensive period of
M I I I ) i I t l l I t II I / l l
restoration. Following this period of improvements, on January 17, 1992, Pope John Paul II raised Sacred Heart to the title of “Minor Basilica.”
The Gothic revival style of this “Minor Basilica” originated in the 12th-century France. Basic elements of this style were the pointed arch, stained-glass tracery, the flying buttress and the vertical spire. All of the elements contributed to the new openness and height of a structure in an attempt to achieve an illusion of upward movement; the verticality of the Gothic tradition directed a feeling of upward movement toward God.
Inside the church, the windows, murals, large gallery organ and bell tower also enhanced the emphasis on upward reflection. Because other windows of the same period were destroyed dur-
ing the First and Second World Wars, the nineteenth-century French stained-glass has become a unique and valuable collection of 42 large windows. The murals and the Stations of the Cross were painted during the 1870s by Luigi Gregori, an artist of the Papal Household of Pius IX and an art professor at Notre Dame. Gregori used both members of his family as well as priests and brothers as

models for figures in the Stations.
On the east transept walls are paintings of the Nativity of Mary and the Teaching of Mary by her Mother, Saint. Anne. Other depictions include the Presentation of Mary, the marriage of Mary to Saint Joseph, Mary sewing and singing praises to God assisted by angels, the Annunciation, and the angel sent to dispel fears of Saint Joseph.
On the west transept walls are the Visitation of Mary to Elizabeth, the Nativity of Christ, the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist,
the appearance of the angels to the shepherds, the visit of the Magi, the Presentation of our Lord in the temple, the flight into Egypt, Jesus surprising the doctors in the temple, and the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin.
In addition to the walls, the ceiling above
the sanctuary is adorned with a painting of Moses, David, Jeremiah, and Daniel and the four evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. On the west side of the sanctuary are depictions of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Saint Gregory the Great and Saint Ignatius of Loyola. On the east side are depictions of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Saint Augustine and Saint Benedict. It is above the arch leading to the Lady Chapel that Mary is represented being crowned by the Most Holy Trinity surrounded by Old Testament Prophets. To the right of the entrance to this chapel is the paint
ing of the death of Saint Joseph in the arms ofJesus and Mary. To the left is the painting of Mary appearing to Saint Bernadette at Lourdes. The Exaltation of the Holy Cross is on the ceiling of the Lady Chapel.
Finally, along the west side of the nave are depicted several saints, including Saint Agnes, Rose of Lima, Aloysius, Stanislaus, Dominic, Francis of Assisi, Bernard and Anthony of Egypt and Appollonia. Saints Cecilia, Lucia, Bonaventure, Thomas Aquinas, Benedict Joseph Labre, Alexis,
Mary Magdalene, Paul the Hermit and John the Baptist decorate the east side of the nave.
In addition to the windows and murals, the organ and bell tower entice an upward gaze. The new organ installed in 1978, has nearly replaced the original organ of 1875. The new organ has four divisions with three
manuals, 54 ranks of pipes, 40 stops and nearly 3,000 pipes. While the bell tower consists of only 24 bells, one bell is a seventon great bell named after Saint Anthony of Padua. Inside the 218 foot spire is North America’s oldest carillon, a sounding board for the bells, installed in 1854.
Should the gaze be momentarily averted downward, the main altar and seven apsidal chapels also contain many intricate details. Installed in 1967, the main altar was constructed from the sides of pews once used in the Lady Chapel. Designed by Father Sorin, the Altar of the Blessed Sacrament, however, was built in France. The doors of the tabernacle bear the Alpha and Omega and are decorated by the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. Bronze sides and figures of angels and saints adom the rest of the altar.
Each of the apsidal chapels are distinctive. Especially noteworthy are Ivan Mestrovich’s “Pieta,” the windows illustrating the Seven Sorrows of the Virgin Mary, a relic of the True Cross, the church Baptistry and the tomb of Cardinal John O’Hara, C.S.C., former president of the University and Archbishop of Philadelphia. The ornate Lady Chapel, constructed in 1886, was built in Bemini-style. The tabernacle door contains a fragment of wood from a table upon which Saint Peter once presided at Mass; the figure of Jesus on the cross is made of wood from an olive branch grown in the Holy Land.
From the Gothic spires, buttresses and pointed arches to the stained-glass windows, murals, main altar and apsidal chapels, the Basilica of the Sacred Heart can be a mysterious adventure to anyone who chooses to investigate its structure. Clues to its identity lie in the glass, timber and people of the past and present It is a beautiful building and a place to keep company with God. It is tradition; it is the “magic” in walking “three feet above the ground.”	□

____:______FINAL WORD
Positive Action Can Help Improve Northern Ireland I by Bob Kehoe
Bob Kehoe is president of ND’s Northern Ireland Awareness Group and a graduate student in the College of Science.
26
WJ orthem Ireland — a name that most people 1^1 equate with an incomprehensible form of violence where dark tribal allegiances produce terrorists in a remote and tiny comer of the globe. Such a characterization certainly makes it easy for us as Americans to ignore the conflict. But can we wash our hands of the situation? We see the broker of peace in Northern Ireland to be a generally fair Britain trying to resolve the arcane conflict between two religious factions — one Protestant and one Catholic. Isn’t it merely arrogant to consider interfering in a matter clearly between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland in such a situation? This line of thought only serves to prevent the attentiveness of Americans, and perhaps especially the 45 million Irish-Americans, to the region.
The Northern Ireland Awareness Group (NIAG) does not make a sectarian call for justice for only Catholics in Northern Ireland. That would be a grave mistake leading directly to the pitfalls of all traditional approaches to end the conflict The facts are that, although Catholics are certainly the worst off as a group, deplorable conditions exist for most people in Northern Ireland regardless of religion. The current view is that a religious struggle is taking place, yet a closer look at the cause of the violence in the last 20 years shows that the friction is due to economic and political oppression. It is often stated by Protestants and Catholics that they have more in common with each other than with either the British, or the Irish in the Republic.
Britain has never been forthright enough to face the problems head-on, despite being taken to task by the European Commission on Human Rights, Amnesty International, the United Nations, and others. In a land of 60 million, the 1.5 million inhabitants of Northern Ireland are hardly audible above the wind. It is for this reason that NIAG was created. Instead of supporting sectarianism, NIAG’s function is to encourage debate, present information, and act to positively improve Northern Ireland through American pressure.
To do this, we must have a diversity of information and opinion, yet the way in which we normally get our news limits our perception of the situation. Most of the information in the American media comes from British sources. Certain political parties, such as Sinn Fein (one of parties wanting unity with the Republic of Ireland), are not allowed by British and Irish laws to be interviewed in the news. This is meant to remove the media from being used by “extremists” as a puppet, but its effect is to ignore the opinion of a large portion of the Catholic community. Also, the IRA routinely provide the focus for the presentation of events. If the IRA is not involved, the actual group involved is often not even mentioned. This leads to very misleading statements by the media. NIAG will help report news occurring in Northern Ireland by British forces, Unionists (want union with UK), Nationalists (want union with Republic of Ireland), and any other group without promoting any form of violence.
Although the troubles may seem to be insolvable, there are things Americans can do. Through letter writing we can support the MacBride principles, which are guidelines for American companies operating in Northern Ireland to prevent discrimination against minority groups. Several states have MacBride legislation but Indiana does not There is also the Irish Children’s Fund in which any money our group raises will go to bring children of Protestant and Catholic communities from Northern Ireland to America to meet people of backgrounds different than theirs to learn to heal the open wound of centuries of distrust. We can also help to bring speakers to campus to discuss the situation.
If you are interested, please join us in our meeting jus t after Spring Break. To find out where and when, call Bob Kehoe at 273-1442 or Ken Lamkin at 273-0585.	□
