Closing Exercises in the Chapel.
We no longer look forward to the Fifty-Fifth Annual Commencement; it is a thing of the present, and was well begun yesterday morning. The Solemn High Mass, celebrated in the college chapel by Reverend President Morrissey, was the first step in the exercises closing a most successful year and adding to the list of our alumni.
The Baccalaureate sermon was preached by Rev. Luke J. Evers, A. B., ’79, A. M., ’86. His dis-- course, brimful of'sound and practical advice for all students as well as for those of this year’s class, was delivered in a most pleasing manner. He reminded the young men that all their building in after-life will depend on the foundation with which they start. The firmest foundation is the one that gives room for the building,of noble, Christian and manly virtues. In the early day, seek out the highest ideal in God, and work to that with all earnestness. There is too little thought of eternity- among the people of to-day; this workaday world, with, its small reward of gold, claims too much attention. The men that are leaving here as graduates were warned by the speaker that unless they are true to the religious training received here, they can not call themselves loyal sons of Notre Dame, nor will they ever gain that success that she wishes them to have; a success reflecting credit on herself and her sons, and leading them to the reward of those that do not bury their talents but use them well. ।	.
Last Year’s Class.
Twelve months ago when the Daily Scholastic was making its initial bow and the busy days of Commemencement were upon us, the members of the Class of ’98 were most conspicuous among the parties that were interested, in the exercises that were being carried on. Few of these gentle-men are with us now. Mr. Thomas A. Medley, A. B., of Springfield, Ky., and Mr. Raymond G. O’Malley, Litt. B., of Cresco, Iowa, are following studies in the Law department. Mr. Frank Hering, Litt. B., is still here acting a leading role in all matters pertaining to athletics. William Sheehan, Litt. B., and Mr. Mingey, Litt. B., are both studying law, the former at his home in Hancock, Mich., the latter at the University of .Pennsylvania. Michael R. Powers, Litt. B., captain of last year’s Varsity and a baseball man from head to foot, is wearing the glove and mask with the Louisville National League team; Mr. M M. Oswald is studying for the priesthood and is located , in St. Joseph’s novitiate, just across the lake. Mr. Kegler, B. S., is still with us and is now a member of the civil engineering class. Mr. W. W. Fitzpatrick, B. S. in Biology, was forced to leave the University of Pennsylvania on account of illness, and is at his home in Paris, Texas. Mr. Falvey, B. S. in-Biology, has joined the ranks of the benedicts and is working in an office in St. Joseph, Missouri, Of the Law graduates, Mr. Wurzer goes to Washington as-private secretary to Congressman Brick.

’99 Flag at the Top. -
The beautiful large flag floating } from the top of our pole is the one donated to the University by the Class of ’99. It was raised ' yesterday for the first time, and, : will float during these davs, the best and happiest of all college days in the lives of those that presentedit. When they pass out through our gates with their diplomas Thursday and look at the Stars and Stripes they chose for , their gift to their Alma Mater, may it be an inspiration to them. to keep up the patriotism they exhibited while here. ' .
Solemn Benediction and Te Deum,
Yesterday afternoon solemn' Benediction was held in the col- ., lege chapel. After Benediction‘a grand Te Deum was sung, in which Rev. President Morrissey asked all to join in gratitude for the / success we have had this season. :<

—Good evening, friends! The Daily Scholastic for the second time presents you with' its compliments, and is pleased to extend a most hearty welcome to Notre Dame. Many of you we have seen before, so we invite you to seek out your old acquaintances and find the best of all that is good at Notre Dame. In some respects you may find changes in our Universify, but in one respect there is not and never will be any change. Notre Dame always extended her hospitality as best she could, and you will find her to do the same how. You may miss some faces . that you saw last year, and many a hand shake may be wanting; but those that are here have naught but good-fellowship to .. offer. Those of you that are visiting our college home for the first time we invite to make yourselves right_at home. We are pleased to have you with us and hope your stay will be most pleasant. The Scholastic begs to offer any . service it may be able to render, ' and, with apologies to Mr. Mans-
field for the phrase, asks to . considered as “Your servant .command.”

tangled up in Marconi’s system of telegraphy. Well-, we are glad to inform you that the Scholastic was present on that occasion, and
that Mr. Green, not finding himself tied down with any wires, extri
cated himself in a very creditable manner. And our gymnasium,— well, it’s not such a bad place after all. Some of our friends, among whom were Messrs. Powers and Corcoran, made a close investigation of all its crooks, turns and corners, and since then they have made many favorable reports that were entirely satisfactory to all our citizens. Mr. Macdonald, one of our esteemed fellows, made a close study of the baseball question. After forming decided ideas on that most interesting subject, he induced a dozen or more other residents to take like views. This handful of men visited other universities to argue the question, and in addition to this invited other colleges to send representatives here to talk the matter oyer. It was alriiost universally conceded
that we took the proper view of Fathers Evers, Fitte and French
the subject and that Notre Dame knew a thing or two about baseball. Incidentally, we may mention that our usual policy -of making high class work a fixture at Notre Dame was closely followed out, and worked very successfully too. All this goes to show that we have had a pleasant time of it, and find small room for complaint.

The Lawn Concert.
The first of the series of concerts to be given by the University band during Commencement week was rendered last evening and proved a most enjoyable affair. There are not so many members in our band as we had last season, yet they have all been carefully handled by Mr. McLaughlin, and, as last night’s entertainment showed, can use their instruments well. The “Light Cavalry Overture,” always a favorite piece at Notre Dame, was played as' well as we have heard it this season. The other selections were as follows: “El Captain,” “Her Grace Waltz,” “ La Fiesta,” March; “ Don Juan,” selection for cornet and baritone; the “Banner” March; “Belford’s Carnival March,” Waltz “Libe-straume” and “Stars and Stripes.”
Medals for the Minima.
The Minims finished cheering for their athletic heroes of this season, when the successful ones were awarded their medals last night. The occasion was honored by Rev. President Morrissey, Rev.
and Dr. O’Malley, all of whom addressed the young men complimenting them on their good work in athletics and in class as well. Manager Ragan of the Varsity also spoke to them, and said they would never come back defeated as the Varsity did from Ann Arbor.
Dr. O'Malley read the names of those that were to receive prizes, and with an Adrian C. Anson look on his face, each one of the little fellows walked to the front where some of the visiting ladies pinned on the medals. Refreshments were then served, and the happy Minims .with their prizes showed them-

How It Happened. "
The baseball season for ’99 closed last Saturday when Michigan took our last game to her credit. We played in hard luck, and lost the game, not our reputation—that stands forth the best yet. At Kalamazoo it looked doubtful for awhile. The diamond was a composited affair comprising a section of second growth timber, a portion of the Michigan Central R. R. and an irrigation ditch. That ought to be a good excuse'’ for any errors. Fleming quitted his third sack for the pitcher’s slab; he remained there for five innings, and did good work, but got rather poor support. Gib. went in and, of course, we won out. Eight to nine was the score. Mulcare won his game at Albion.
The hitting of our team was. remarkable. Twenty hits—that’s all. Fleming was six times at bat. and got two 3’s, two 2’s and two singles on ’the try.
The way the game started at Ann Arbor it didn’t seem that we could lose. McGinnis got his base; Snow tried to sacrifice, and Fleming threw him out to McDonald who threw McGinnis out to Lynch at third, making the quickest and cleanest double of the season. For three innings neither side scored, and then the fatal four came around. In that inning Michigan scored four men and only one hit was made. In the fifth we had two men on bases, and Gibson knocked a good two-bagger; but the umpire for some inexplicable reason insisted that it was foul. Gib. then knocked a long fly into centre which McGinnis neglected to hold, and Becker scored. Errors were responsible for Michigan’s three other runs.	.
