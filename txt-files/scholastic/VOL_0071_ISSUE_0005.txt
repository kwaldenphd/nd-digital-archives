PLAN BIG PEP MEETING TO WHIP UP SPIRIT FOR RUFFLING NAVY GOAT'S APLOMB
READY FOR INVASION OF GOPHER'S LAIR
Tonight, the Spirit of Notre Dame will be aroused once more as a gigantic pep rally, arranged by the Student Activities Council under the direction of Scott Reardon, gets into full swing. During this week, special rally committees for each hall, appointed by the rector and a Council member, were busy preparing for the event.	_____________________________
Large signs were placed in each hall with different slogans all meaning “Beat Navy,” and personal contact by the committees has raised the spirit of the student body.
After supper the University band will lead the parade to the field house. A preliminary cheer fest will be held on the Lyons-Morrissey quadrangle, and possibly at other points along the way. At the sound of the band, the rest of the student body is asked to go to the field house with all the others.
There, through an amplifying system, Scott Reardon will introduce the speakers. Head Coach Layden and Clarence “Pat” Manion will be enthusiastically received by the pep-sters. Also, Lieutenant Hardwick, head football coach of the U. S. Naval Academy, and “Rip” Miller, Navy line coach and Notre Dame alumnus, have been asked to speak. At press time, an acknowledgement had not yet been received.
“Beat Navy” tags were distributed to the students by the S.A.C. this week.
Several stunts are planned to augment the rally. The nature of these will be made known tonight.
Patricians Make Plans
An important meeting of the Patricians will be held this week at which the future plans of the club will be discussed. Topics for consideration will be presented to the group and various members will be assigned subjects for future lectures.
The general outline of activities points toward a furthering of the club’s purpose: to foster an interest in the classical world.
The names of the applicants for admission to the club are still in the hands of the committee on membership, whose selection will be announced at the meeting.
Servers Meet
The Servers’ club met last Monday evening, Oct. 18, in the sacristy of the Sacred Heart Church. Brother
Boniface, C.S.C., instructed the members in the correct form of serving Mass. Serving a low Mass, a high Mass and a solemn high Mass was clearly illustrated and explained. The meeting adjourned after the members had received their assignments for serving Masses on the campus.

LUNN TALKS ON TRIP TO SPAIN'S WAR AREA
SESSLER ASSEMBLES CAMPUS CAMERA CLUB AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHERS RESPOND TO CALL
Arnold Lunn, assistant professor in the Department of Apologetics, in his third of a series of six lectures, spoke of his summer journey through war-torn Spain. The English author climaxed his lecture by presenting a startling description of his experiences at Irun, Burgos, Salamanca, Madrid, Toledo, Seville, Granada and Malaga.
Mr. Lunn had spent part of the winter and early spring in Switzerland. Travelling by the way of Avignon in France, he crossed the international bridge at Hendaye across the border into Irun. For three weeks he visited the scenes of destruction, village after village, until he emerged at the Madrid Front. His journey ended at Gibraltar where he set sail for England.
From his actual experiences he related :
“I knew before I crossed the frontier at Irun that the Reds had been guilty of atrocities, but I did not feel the Spanish horror in all its intensity until I had spent some days in Spain, days which transformed notional into real assent.
“The misery of those who have relations and friends behind the Red Lines infected the very air that one breathed. Spaniards do not overwhelm one with atrocity stories. They could not restrain their sanity if they allowed their minds to dwell on these things.
“When Mola appealed for volunteers at Burgos, dukes and factory hands, tradesmen and peasants, stormed the recruiting offices. The Burgos of 1936 was an escape from darkness into light.
“They had lived for months, these men who were to restore Christian Spain, under a reign of anarchy, seeing police stand by under instructions from the government not to interfere while churches burned and gangsters looted.”
Mr. Lunn then described the spectacle of Madrid that he had witnessed as he stood on a shelled tower that overlooked the shattered city:
“The sun broke through the last defences of the mist, gleamed on the long facade of the Palace, and unshadowed the heart of Madrid. The reverberation of a trench-mortar dissipated the last rags of clouds which still clung to the University City, and revealed the wounded frontage of shell-shattered buildings.
“The cruel sun of Madrid was like the arc lamp in an operating theatre, disclosing every detail of grim and savage wounds. Never, even among the mountains, have I felt, as I felt at Madrid, such a sense of personality behind inanimate things.
Over 100 students were present at the first meeting of the Camera Club, held Wednesday night in the auditorium of the John F. Cushing Hall of Engineering. Dan Cochrane was unimously elected president of the club. This is the first attempt on the campus of an organization of this type. Its purpose, ______________________________________according to Stanley F. Sessler, fac-* ulty moderator of the group is “to

Magazines Print Works By Prof. Langford
•
Walter M. Langford, assistant professor of Spanish, is the author of an article on Bernardo del Carpio, which appears in the October issue of His-pana, the organ of the American Association of Teachers of Spanish. In the article Professor Langford discusses the possible origin of this legendary figure of Spain and his consequent appearance in Spanish, in French and in English literature.
The writings of Professor Langford have also appeared recently in the Catholic World and in the Magnificat. In the former, the article was entitled “The Church in Mexico Today” and in the latter, “San Felipe de Jesus,” who was a Mexican saint of the Thirteenth century and one of the two American-born saints.
Professor Langford received his master’s degree with honors at the end of the recent summer session of the National university of Mexico in Mexico City.
Take Pictures
The coming week will be the last chance for Junior pictures was the warning given by James Raaf, managing editor of the 1938 Dome. All off-campus students in the Junior class are urged to have their pictures taken as soon as possible. The Dome office is located in the. basement of Walsh Hall and is open every afternoon except Thursday from 1:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. On Thursday the office will open at 1:45 p.m.
develop a better talent for producing good camera pictures; to really encourage good photography and to develop it to a high degree of perfection as a hobby.”
Mr. Sessler introduced a guest lecturer, Mr. Benjamin Doktor, of South Bend, whose talk was illustrated by colored slides. These slides were still pictures taken on Koda-chrome film, the same film used in the small 35 millimeter motion picture cameras. The shots were of landscapes, flowers, and sunsets. The exhibition is rated as one of the leading collections of this kind in this section.
Other officers elected at the meeting, in addition to President Cochrane, are: George Dalker, of the Department of Fine Arts, vice-president; and John Lacey, secretary. The new president is a member of the school of Electrical Engineering.
Something unusual in the way of activity for campus groups is to he inaugurated by the club shortly. Plans are now being formulated for an exhibition of student photography to be shown on the campus. Camera studies of all kinds will be accepted although complete information is not available at the present time. A program of speakers has been pre-’ pared and will be announced at the next meeting of the club.
A constitution for the organization is now being drawn up and will be presented for acceptance at the next assembly of the members. Members are urged to be in attendance as enrollment will take place.

MUSICIANS ELECT MULLEN PRESIDENT; PLAN TO FEATURE SCHUBERT'S UNFINISHED
By Richard Anton
The symphony orchestra completed its first step in reorganization this week when they elected new officers. The members met last Monday night, Oct. 18, and chose Robert Mullen, sophomore music student, as president for this year. At the same time they appointed Edward Cronin to the vice-presidency, and John Gaven as music librarian. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under the direction of Professor
Daniel H. Pedtke, new head of the music department, the musicians went to work on their first orchestration. For this occasion Mr. Pedtke has chosen Schubert’s famous Unfinished Symphony in B minor.
As leaders of the group, Mr. Pedtke hopes to have rehearsals twice weekly, whenever possible, on Monday and Thursday nights at 6:30, because, as he says, “Only time and practice will bring about the results we hope for.”
The company met again on Thursday evening in Washington Hall and held a sectional rehearsal. The string sections were combined under the guidance of Professor Ingersoll, while the wind instruments were under the direction of Professor Pedtke.
Although he has no nucleus with which to start, Mr. Pedtke expressed the belief that he has a well balanced personnel, and assures us of some very good concerts during the course of the year.
Plans for an organization to supplement the Glee Club are as yet unfinished. This group will, however, consist of freshmen. They will rehearse on Wednesday and Friday evenings at 6:30
Student enthusiasm for this new undertaking has been evident in the large number of musicians who have already joined the movement. Any student who wishes to join either the symphony or the freshmen singers should report to Professor Pedtke in room 1 of the Music Hall.
Lawyers Hear "G" Man
Mr. Harold Raneike, head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the State of Indiana, spoke at the meeting of the Law Club, on Tuesday, Oct. 19, in the Law Library. Mr. Raneike discussed the FBI and its activities in preventing crime and apprehending criminals. This discussion revolved around the recent Brady case which had its origin in Indiana and was handled by the FBI.
The monthly 'social meeting of the club will be held on Tuesday, Oct. 26, at 8:00 p.m. in the Faculty dining hall. At- this meeting, Robert Proctor, former state senator, will give a short -address.- Smokes, lunch, and entertainment are free to all club members.
Vice-President Cronin Strings and Woodwinds.
CAMPUS OPINION
The question which the roving reporter of The Scholastic placed before some of the notable esquires of the campus was: “What are your expectations of tonight’s Sophomore Cotillion?” Some of the answers were subtle, others obvious, but all of them manifested that certain aloofness which is characteristic only of college men.
Joe Mulqueen, president of the Sophomore class: “I think it will be the liveliest dance of the year. It ushers in the social season and paves the way for a most delightful weekend.”
Bill McVay, Carroll: “Judging from last year’s Cotillion, tonight’s frolic should prove tops in every respect. Smooth music and a skyline of top hats.”
Tony Mallek, roof-tops of Badin: “Considering the fact that I’m taking the sweetest little gal from Chicago’s north side, the dance should be a glamorous affair. Take a look at the pile of letters and see if she hasn’t been looking forward to the Cotillion.”
Jim Prather from the haunts of Morrissey: “You’ve got me there, pal; but I can bet my collar button that those upperclassmen aren’t going to show Sophs up. Our dance tonight will eclipse all other shin-digs of the social whirl.”
Bob Benavides, Sorin: “Without doubt, the Cotillion will be a most successful affair setting the pace for the coming social events. It won’t be as exclusive as our Lawyer’s Ball, but I’m looking forward to a grand time when Reggie Childs gets going with that baton tonight.”
DEBATE DECISION TO SORIN. MORRISSEY
•
The first round of the interhall debating tournament resulted in victory for both Sorin and Morrissey halls.
The affirmative question, “Resolved: That the National Labor Relations Board should be empowered to enforce arbitration of all industrial disputes,” was successfully defended by Morrissey while Sorin, upholding the negative side, won over Alumni. Bob Heywood and Pierre de la Vergne were the judges of the contests.
The second round for the orators will be held on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday evenings in the meeting room of the Law building. The teams participating on these nights are Morrissey vs. Freshman, Alumni vs. Walsh, on Tuesday; Cavanaugh vs. Badin, Dillon vs. St. Eds, Wednesday; Zahm vs. Lyons, Brownson-Carroll vs. Sorin, Thursday.
The members of the various halls are welcome to attend these debates and especially so when the team representing their hall is scheduled.
STUDENTS' MISSION UNIT REORGANIZES
Rev. J. Hugh O’Donnell, C.S.C., and Rev. Raymond Massart, C.S.C., will address the first meeting of the Notre Dame unit of the Catholic Students’ Mission Crusade next Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. in the Law Building.
Father O’Donnell will talk on the early missionaries who labored in this section of the middle west. Father Massart, who recently returned from missionary work in Bengal, India, is expected to relate some of his interesting experiences in the mission field.
A report on the national Crusade convention in Cleveland last summer will be given by Patrick Bannon who was the representative of the local unit.
Jerry Green, president of the unit, has announced that the crusade activities of the year will include the collection of cancelled stamps, private reading and study of mission literature, and the offering of prayers for the success of the missions, particularly the missionaries now in the War Zones.
All students of the University interested in such activities are urged to be present at Wednesday’s meeting.

ENGINEERS HAVE FUN; FRESHMEN INITIATED
Washington Hall Presents "Movie Tonight" Or "I Seen it at Home Last Summer"
Two weeks ago it was the Monogram club initiation; last week the Engineers had the fun. Approximately 50 Freshmen turned out on Wednesday night to be shocked into knighthood. According to indications, this was ably done under the direction of President George Schlaudeck-er and King Kesicke. Here are some of the events which took place:
Refreshments, in the form of the brains of Archimides were served. Archimides’ brains consisted of ground meat with a little limburger add for flavoring. ’Tis said it was rather repulsive for the blindfolded Frosh.
The upperclassmen tried several experiments. The most interesting was this: Substituting limburger for Mum. Although the same pleasant effect wasn’t achieved, nevertheless, B.O. was done away with. This in itself was a notable achievement; and limburger is less expensive too.
Several assignments were given out. One lad had to count the window panes in the Main building. This fellow really has a bright future in Engineering. He counted 3,621 panes on the outside and 2,927 on the inside. Another lad counted 3,416 people entering the Dining Hall—possibly the reason why we ran out of meat the other night.
The greatest punishment was the painting on the forhead of each Frosh the initials of the degree he expected to receive. With downcast eyes each one walked about the campus, trying to live down the Ch.E. or E.E. on their brows. It wasn’t the paint that bothered them!
Upon interviewing several Freshmen after the initiation we came to the conclusion—they had a shocking time.
CONFIRMS FOURTEEN TOMORROW
Tomorrow morning, at ten o’clock, a group of fourteen Notre Dame men will be confirmed in Sacred Heart Church by the Right Reverend John F. Noll, Bishop of the Fort Wayne diocese.
Rev. Francis Gartland, C.S.C., assistant prefect of religion, will conduct a class of inquiry into the Catholic faith. The class is for Catholics who need further instruction and for non-Catholics who wish to know about Catholicism. The class, which will be taught twice a week, has a present enrollment of twelve students.
The nurse paused before the door. “Now, remember what I told you,” she said, “no excitement, and you can’t stay long.”
“It’s the first show for me.”
“Right,” I agreed. We entered the room and there was the patient nicely clothed in adhesive tape and bandages. I walked over to the bed and bent over the still form. “Have you any statement to make, old fellow?” I asked.
The nurse coughed discreetly. “You can’t tell with all the adhesive tape,” she informed me, “but you’re talking to his feet. His head is on the other end.”
“Oh, thank you,” I replied, and shifted my base of operation. I repeated my formei* question. There was a faint stir and a low murmur within the bandages. Finally, a piece of tape stirred and an eye peeped through.. Another moan and the bandages a bit further below slitted to reveal a mouth. I bent low to catch the words.
“I was out in front. . . past Father Sorin’s statue and across the campus. ... I was ahead of them all. ...”
“Yes, yes, go on.”
“I was gaining . . . then I tripped over the fire-plug. ... I was down. . . . the horde swept past me—trampled me down. ... I was dazed, battered . . . but I struggled on. . . finally I reached Washington Hall. . . . Oh, it was horrible, horrible. ...”
“What was?”
He paused; then continued with an obvious effort. . . . “A woman and her small son were just ahead of me, entering the front door. . . . Then the second wave struck—it was the Freshmen, I think . . . they were yelling like Indians . . . they bowled me over ... as I fell I saw the woman and the tiny boy borne down and trampled . . . the last cry of that unfortunate woman. . . . Oh, it was horrible . . . you have no idea how horrible. ...”
He had raised himself slightly, but at his last words he fell back on the bed, exhausted.
The nurse tapped me on the shoulder. “You’ll have to go, now. He had had too much excitement.”
I started to leave, but a hoarse cry from the bed stayed me.
“No, don’t go.” The figure on the bed was half erect. “Don’t go. I want you to know what happened. . . . “It’s all right, nurse,” he added as the nurse began to remonstrate, “it’s all right. I haven’t much longer . . . and I want him to know what happened.”
The words came fainter now. I bent lower.
“Finally, I recovered consciousness and dragged myself up the stairs . . . then everything went black again. When I awoke I was in a seat behind one of the balcony pillars. ...”
“Yes,” I prompted as he hesitated. He was sinking perceptibly. “Quick, nurse,” I ordered, “hand me that pail of water.” Whereupon, I doused him with the water, which tended to revive him slightly. He stirred.
“They were rowing across the lake in a canoe, Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald. She was singing . . . she’s beautiful . . . but I couldn’t see Nelson—the post cut off half the screen . . . there she was gliding across half a lake in a bisected canoe ... it seemed like hours ... I waited, but they never did get up and swap seats, so I never saw Nelson. . . . Oh, it was maddening . . . then I lost consciousness again . . . when I awoke I was here in the infirmary. ...” The figure on the bed gave a convulsive jerk; then was still. A brave spirit had flown.
“Waddaya mean—your seat?”
I arose. The nurse was daubing at her eyes with her handkerchief. “There, there,” I comforted, “don’t feel badly. You did everything possible.”
She lifted a valiant, tremulous chin. “It’s not that,” she sniffed. “Just think what might have happened if they’d run a new picture like “Lost Horizon,” instead of an octogenarian like “Rose' Marie. It would have been a slaughter. Those poor boys!”

MUSICAL NOTES
By Paul R. Locher
It would seem a typical characteristic of the collective American personality to be fascinated, if not awed, by the various polls, popularity contests and statistical information constantly thrust before him. It would be interesting to speculate whether this characteristic is a psychological development of the fundamental idea of democracy—that the opinion of the majority should serve as a determinant of the standard.
This desire for statistical information is prevalent in the field of music, as well as in many others. The management of the Philadelphia Orchestra recently sent out an appeal to listeners to select a request program of serious music. The response was as enlightening as it was interesting, indicating a musical appreciation beyond the prediction of most critics.
The number of votes was not given, but a graduated list of preferences w a s deduced. Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony received the largest number, with Tschaikovsky’s “Pathetic” Symphony following. To prove these preferences were not made at random, the poll discloses Tschaikovsky occupying five prominent places in all,. and Beethoven closely behind "with four. Coming in order after the “Pathetic,” the Fifth Symphony, the Fourth Symphony, the “Nutcracker Suite” and the “1812” overture were the Tschaikov-sky favorites. Admirers of Beethoven chose the Ninth, Eighth, and Seventh Symphonies in that order.
Brahms captured three places with his First, Fourth, and Third Symphonies. Wagner also merits three positions, the excerpts being from “Tristan” and “Lohengrin.”
A hiatus occurs in the list, with no composer bridging the gap with two favorites. The other composers listed as holding one position, in the order in which their number of votes place them, are as follows: Franck’s Symphony in D Minor, Schubert’s “Unfinished” Symphony, Rimsky-Korsakov’s “Scheherazade,” Liszt’s “Les Preludes,” Dvorak’s “New World” Symphony, Ravel’s “Bolero,” Sibelius’s “Finlandia,” Strauss’s “Death and Transfiguration,” and Debussy’s “Afternoon of a Faun.”
It is surprising to note that Wagner’s later operas do not appear on the list, while Ravel’s “Bolero” does not show the strength of its earlier vogue.
Oct. 8, 1898—The new battleship “Varsity” is to be launched and christened. Miss Illinois has been selected to officiate. Champagne will be used.	.
George Francis Fitzpatrick, Fitz to most of us, is just another case of a small town boy making good at Notre Dame. He hails from a small mill town in eastern Mass., which accounts for his broad ‘a.’ He is looked upon as quite a wonder by the farmers of his home town, who number 400 “as the boy who goes all the way to Indiana to school.” Even with generous applications of grease or whatever he can borrow, his red hail’
refuses to stay combed. Stooging for the little Jersey boy, he tried a crew cut but has regretted it ever since.
Fitz has been going around seeing people about votes since his Freshman year. Reached his climax last year when he ran two miles ahead of the field for the Senior VicePresident, despite the fact that he refused to ‘dress’ for the votes, running around in dirty white sweater and slacks.
He is quite a ball player around his home town, hero of St. Joseph’s of Medway. Aspired to the Irish nine, hitting a home run in practice, the only time that Jake wasn’t around. Blames his misfortunes on the loss of an old baseball cap he wore at Dean Academy, where he prepped for Notre Dame.
At one time the North Bellingham lad carried on a good deal of correspondence with fair damsels from New Jersey to Chicago, and was mad about all of them. He hasn’t decided whom to take to the Ball, but there is a rumor concerning a nurse at home, “If she wants to come I suppose I’ll have to take her.”
SECURITY EXCHANGE IS DISCUSSED

Members of the Economic Round Table, a club for Economics majors, met at the Rose Marie Tea Room Monday for their third meeting of the year. The speaker of the evening was William J. Riley, who explained and discussed the Securities Exchange Commission.
The aim of the SEC, said Riley, is “to eliminate exploitation of the public by the sale of unsound, fraudulent, and worthless securities; to place adequate and true information before the investor . . . and to bring into productive channels of industry capital which has grown timid to the point of hoarding.”
Riley then discussed the means used by the Commission to accomplish these ends. The SEC, Riley said, is attempting more or less successfully to prevent the “excessive use of credit to finance speculation in securities.” It is making available “to the average investor honest and reliable information sufficiently complete to acquaint him with the current business conditions of the company, the securities of which he may desire to buy or sell.”
He concluded by saying that the SEC is a “passive organization only in the sense that it is not empowered to express approval of the merits or value of any security.” It is, however, capable of regulating trade on all exchanges, and it forces the “disclosure of material facts necessary for the investor to exercise his own judgment properly.” The future of the SEC appears very promising according to Riley.
Wranglers Hear of Japs
Members of the Wranglers at their meeting last Monday heard an address by William Bowes. Bowes upheld Japan’s attitude in the Far East. He presented facts attempting to show that China was responsible for the initial engagement in the “undeclared war” between China and Japan.	'
China, according to Bowes, had been pursuing a definite anti-Japan-ese policy since the kidnapping of General Chang Kai-Shek. In addition, the anti-Japanese economic policy on the part of China and the ever increasing tariff barriers put up by the nations of the world had placed Japan in grave economic peril.
With the exception of Italy, Japan is the poorest of any major power in natural resources. Her whole existence is dependent on foreign trade. China has more land than she needs and has not developed Northern China to any extent, said Bowes.

THE WEEK
The Engineers
Twice a year the engineers step into the blinding glare of the campus spotlight. The first appearance is the annual initiation of the Engineering club. Usually the initiation rites are borrowed from some sorority or Hi-Y club. This year, however, with A.B. men contributing the suggestions, the Freshmen engineers were given practical engineering problems, and the Hi-Y stuff was confined to painted noses and funny ties. In one day the boys were required to count the windows in the Main building, count the number of people who got off street cars backwards, add up the license numbers of all cars entering the grounds, count the number of ’35 forks in the dining hall, and find the height of the flag pole (one fellow handed in an answer of 431 feet). But the initiation is over so the Engineers can go back to their slide rules, logarithm tables and obscurity until their Ball rolls around.
Top of the Week
The Navy goat in front of the dining hall this noon blissfully unaware of the S.A.C. sign. “No meat today, but steak tomorrow.”
Gay blade
The ’41 boys aren’t the only ones who have their troubles. One night last week a gay blade from Alumni Hall dashed out of the hall with white tie awry, tails flying, and top hat in hand. After waiting a few impatient minutes for a taxi, he hurried to the taxi telephone across from the sentry booth. There the gay blade spent a bad eight minutes trying to force a nickel into the taxi telephone at every conceivable spot. After eight minutes of futile searching for the coin slot, the Senior sighed the sigh of disgust, muttered something about the Indiana Bell Telephone Co., and boarded the proletarian street car along with five fellows from Sorin.

Hi-de-ho stuff
In a few short hours our first social debauch of the year will be getting underway to the mild melodies of somebody or other. We don’t know much about this year’s Cotillion, but we’re willing to bet a copy of last week’s Scholastic against a large box of popcorn that the honky-tonk Palais will be decorated in the usual way: A huge colored N.D. light at one end of the dance floor, monogram blankets along the walls, and colored streamers strung out from the chandelier. These have been the decorations since the Cotillion was
By Harold A. Williams
started, way back when South Bend was just a hick town. And they will be the decorations when South Bend is incorporated with Mishawaka, we suppose, because the Cotillion decoration committees do not seem to be very ingenious. But what can one expect from political appointees? However, that’s a thought for the S.A.C. to mull over.
But regardless of the decorations everyone will be happy. Most of the Seniors, a large group of Juniors, and a handful of Sophomores, will shuffle and slide to their hearts content, the chaperons will hover in the background happy in the thought that everything is under control, and the lovely girls will have enough to talk about for weeks, and weeks and weeks.
Have a good time and don’t forget to be in by two (A.M., that is).

All paths lead to the gym tonight at seven. Be there and yell like heck (“heck” isn’t the word we mean, but “heck” it will have to be for the Scholastic) .
TURN OF HEART
Editor’s note: THE scholastic does not commit itself zvith this poem. It was submitted by a student. The opinion is his.
I stood on the bridge at noonday
With my ears alert and alive
To hear the President dedicate
The gate that opened the Drive.
Black was the name on every tongue.
And Black was the thought of man. For Black was back and black was the day
And black was the track of the Klan.
While the robe of the Klan teas ghastly white. The new robe was black to the scam;
And the new black robe made the wearer Part of a Bench Supreme.
They watched the leader and waited a move That would give them the cue to chide;'
So they stood with me on the noonday bridge Where a city’s bullion had died.
The waited intense for the President’s voice;
They watched for the tension to crack Foundations of freedom and darken the flag— They wanted the word to be BLACK!
But the voice they heard was the same old voice
That had taken their hearts before.
And the Black of the day turned a grayish white.
Then turned to the red of tvar.
Nations paused in their march of hate
To gasp at how quicly the sun
Had softened the bridge at noonday. Had softened the Eastern Gun.
The ones who had waited defiant
Were the ones he wanted to reach, And they turned their minds in confusion to "interpret the President’s speech.”
The black of the day had faded that night;
The bench had drawn back in the shade; The critics screamed their wrath in vain As they watched their blackening fade.
As I stood on the bridge in the evening. Long after the work was done,
I thought, “Hmu few are statesmen,” “Thank God for giving us one!”
—John Scott.

Grand Knight James L. Quinn has appointed C. Richard Jenney, Senior in the College of Commerce, as chairman of the affair. Jenney will be assisted by Past Grand Knight Joseph Drolla, tickets; Deputy Grand Knight Richard Foley, reception; and Robert LeMire, music. The music will be furnished by Myron Walz, one of the most popular of the local orchestras. Tickets will be on sale at the door, or can be purchased from any of the hall representatives of the organization.
The Dance is being given to raise funds for the. Gibault home, charitable institution sponsored by the Indiana district of the Knights of the Knights of Columbus.
The members of the Navy and Notre Dame football teams are expected to be in attendance, as a special program is being planned in their honor.
New Cheer Plans
Keeping in spirit with the rejuvenated pep of the student body, Frank Farrell, head cneerleader, has devised a more efficient metho’d of announcement for the Navy game. Large initialed cards will supplement the megaphones in announcing what the yells will be. Also, cheerleaders to be stationed in two of the aisles of the stadium, will yell out the names of the cheers immediately after they have been indicated by the cards.
Following is the code to be used:

John Walsh, a junior living in Dillon, is the club librarian for the year. He reports that some books by contemporary Catholic authors are now available to the members and that some new books will be added to the reading list as soon as they are ac-, quired.
No definite plans for future guest speakers have been arranged, but President Hal Williams hopes to present some interesting speakers to the members before Christmas.

Masks!
Feeling a bit tired? Seeing spots before your eyes? Is the typewriter hopping all over the table? Don’t worry. Grab yourself an oxygen tank mask and take a couple of good healthy whiffs. Feel better? Now let’s go!
You say our attic needs a tenant? No, that’s just a sample of what the American Psychological Association has in store for future collegians. Dr. Arthur G. Bills, of the University of Cincinnati, has proposed just such a new oxygen mask to protect mental workers from fatigue caused by thinking.
Delivering to the breather a combination of about 50 per cent pure oxygen mixed with air, the mask’s “use cuts in half the number of pauses per minute that comes to persons doing brain work. These pauses are the result of mental fatigue — the brain taking a short rest.
The mask is the final step in a series of experiments to prove the theory that fatigue is not due to the brain becoming tired but to the failure of the blood to supply all the oxygen the brain wanted.
Americana
According to Wilfred J. Funk, publisher of the New Standard Dictionary, the ten most overworked words in current American speech are: lousy, okay, terrific, contact, gal, racket, swell ,impact, honey, and definitely.
What’s the matter with swing, Mr. Funk?
Surrealism
Surrealist literature is the latest thing at Ohio State. The results of the surrealist masterpieces are to say the least, startling. Take this example. “Baseball bats and theatre tickets floating as a halo over the head of a green lobster and sure that Christmas will come if there is a fire plug on the corner or not. And a high silk hat sits and chuckles, perpetual motion.”

An inventor in Germany has invented a “bomb-proof” bed. ... A professor is a guy who talks in someone else’s sleep. ... West Point Military Academy was startel by a Catholic—Count Kosciusko. . . .

Hear, Ye! Hear, Ye! The Notre Dame social season is being ushered in tonight. We shall see Top hats, tails, white ties! (They’ll be returned to their rightful owners Monday morning.) Good luck, to the two kings of the evening—Mulqueen and Tierney—and orchids to their lucky dates. (Two bits they get gardenias).
With the arrival of this auspicious affair, we are reminded of an embar-assing situation taking place at Cotillion Time a few years ago. As the story goes; a certain young “Casanova” went to pick up his lady ot the evening (corsage and all in hand). —and was quite anxious to get to the dance. As he approached the house he saw something that gave him a sickening feeling. Here is his date coming out of the door with one of the hero’s classmates. They were headed for town in Cotillion regalia. Dost thou remember, Gene?
Tonight will be the showdown for Freshmen “bull sessions” of last year. Tonight the much discussed “home town honeys” will be on display. Bill Tobin (Morrissey) has promised to show the boys the “queen of Menominee” Wisconsin. Tom Hos-ty is afraid that his girl will hear about his South Bend “friend.” Keep your fingers crossed, Tom. Jerry Donovan’s mail has picked up considerably during the last few weeks— what power this Cotillion has! The corridors of Lyons have been buzzing with the particulars on a certain vivacious redhead! What say you, Kelly? The lovely guest of Chairman Tierney has decided that the Soph Cotillion beats any high school prom. It took quite a while, but she did decide. The last we heard Ed “Bomber” Sweeney, Badin, still harbors a hope of being in attendance tonight.
George Becker is bringing his little “Dody” tonight in spite of G.F.B.— isn’t that what you wanted us to say, George?
It seems as though a message, via Uncle Sam, is responsible for Jim Carson’s absence tonight. Poor Jim! —but John “Jackie Pie” Thulis will be there with “Patsie Pie” from Chicago. . . they’re cute! John “bonkus OF the konkus” Wilson is waiting for further instructions from the “boss” before purchasing his ducat.
Last year’s “king for the night”— Joe McDermott—will not be seen tonight. He is content to merely reminisce—Trouble, Joe?
And don’t forget the K. of C. Football dance Saturday night. Don’t mention it, Eli.
But— be on your guard, dear dancers, and potential Lotharios, for this department always has its scouts out. Anything seen peeping beyond pillars, under tables, in your pockets— that is the all-seeing eye at work. The Rover Boys will be there gathering the dope. Beware—for the grand finale in next week’s column. . . the expose.
Be sure boys, that you see the same fair friend off at the Station Sunday night, that you met Friday.
So much for the Cotillion—Fancy a senior lawyer stealing into his former roommate’s territory. Maybe that is why Johnny Ford is rushing up here Saturday—to protect his Texan interests! Then don’t forget that genuine Irish smile of John McIntyre (Carroll) ... he always seems to rate that Sunday afternoon ride in the Lasalle convertible.
If anyone wants to learn the latest
“He learned that step at last year's Cotillion.”
dance sensation (the big apple) they can get lessons from Eugene “Duffy” Dolan in Walsh.
Flash from Brownson! ! ! Wally Kristoff has been receiving quite a bit of mail from one Harvard avenue, Chicago address. Her name might be Rosemary. . .
For the benefit of our “Readers” we assure you that this department is destroying past precedent by refusing to allow any intimidation or pressure from one “Sabby.” Incidentally, his living off campus this year is not the only reason why he is not seen on the campus of late.
Editors’ note: This is our first endeavor in the “Winchell” field, so we request that all criticisms be rendered by mail only. (If we aren’t fired from the staff, we will be haunting you next Friday.)
(No, you are wrong again, we’re not Bearskin).

"The Fighting Irish"
Editor’s note: Last iveek the sports publicity department released a request to the press to designate Notre Dame competitive teams by the time honored name, “Fighting-Irish.” At a football testimonial banquet Rev. John Cavanaugh, C.S.C., former president of the University, more pointedly addressed the press to the same effect, the scholastic is happy to reprint herewith part of its own record on the subject from the issue of Oct. 25,-1929.
“r 11HE term ‘Fighting Irish’ has been applied to Notre
X Dame teams for years. It first attached itself years ago when the school, comparatively unknown, sent its athletic teams away to play in another city. ... At that time ‘Fighting Irish’ held no glory or prestige. . . .
The years passed swiftly and the little school began to take a place in the sport world. . . . ‘Fighting Irish’ took on a new meaning. The unknown of a few years past had boldly taken a place among the leaders. The unkind appellation became symbolic of the struggle for supremacy on the field. . . .
“The term, while given in irony, has become our heritage. The implications of ‘Fighting Irish’ are too much like our own struggles for recognition to be easily ignored. We are criticized on every side for using the term, but the critics gave us the name. They, too, see that it has more than one application. Too late they seek to retract what they gave in irony a few years ago.^ Realizing that the name ‘Fighting Irish’ has taken on a sig- j
nificance they never dreamed of, they now seek to disparage us with other terms. ‘Wandering Nomads’ we are called. ‘Ramblers,’ and ‘Galloping Gaels,’ and ‘Fighting Irish-Italians’ are made use of to describe us. None of the terms stick. We hope they will not. One by one the sport writers will come back grudgingly to the old name.
“The ethnologists object to the name on the grounds that the Irish are in the minority on the football field. The Savoldis, the Caridios, the Schwartz’s, they say, are not Irish, and so are not fighting Irish. For that matter Yale men are not ‘Bulldogs,’ Wisconsin players are not ‘Badgers,’ or Northwestern ‘Wildcats.’ Our name is merely an identifying one which has been glorified on many a field of battle. So truly does it represent us that we are unwilling to part with it. . . . ”
V
The Truth About
CATHOLICS, especially Notre Dame men, earnestly want to know the truth about their Church and the struggle it is going through in various parts of the world today.
Right here on this campus the ideal opportunity to hear first-hand information about this struggle is presented every Thursday night in Washington Hall. Actual eye-witness accounts by an outstanding educator and lecturer are yours for the mere attending. Moreover they are accounts of the greatest struggle the Church and its forces have gone through in recent years . . . the war in Spain.
Arnold Lunn spent a summer there this year. When Mr. Lunn spends a summer anywhere intending to gather first-hand information about his Church and related subjects he does a thorough job. Ask anyone who has attended the first lectures. Profit by their example and attend the rest. Learn the truth about Spain . . . the truth about a great struggle.

Co-operation
WE NOTICE the various campus cultural organizations are formulating their yearly programs. The Patricians, Bookmen, Chesterton Society, and a new one, The Schoolmen, afford worthy extra-curricular activities for any society. We sincerely hope they will enjoy suc-cussful years.
The objective of these societies is to acquaint their members with more specified fields of higher learning. Their round-table discussions, prepared papers, and guest speakers undoubtedly serve this purpose for the members. Why, we ask, should this be confined to the members? Select groups that they are, they should be willing to let the student body at large partake of the great benefits they enjoy.
A yeai* ago The Scholastic inaugurated a literary page for this express.purpose. Opened it to all who wish to contribute. It wasn’t meant, originally, to print short story contributions exclusively. It was hoped that all types of papers would be submitted for publication.
Last May cards were sent out to each Philosophy and English major asking for literary contributions. The Scholastic repeats the invitation. It carries a front page box to that effect. We hope the response will be generous.

When Good Fellows Get Together
John Morrissey stood in the center of Arch Lyons’s living - room and glanced about. “Say, Arch,” he said, “I like your new quarters. The rugs and the chairs—such a lovely color combination. And the drapes. Gorgeous! Did you pick them yourself?”
Arch nodded.
“They are gorgeous. But then you always had such excellent taste. I remember your rooms in Freshman Hall—especially the all-blue bedroom. But come on! Show me the rest of your suite.”
Arch led John through the living room, past the dinette to the bedroom and back again. They sat down. John was impressed.
“Well, Arch, you old rascal, you’ve done it again. Wait till the fellows see these rooms. You’ll win the ‘Tidiest Quai-ters Medal’ again this year, hands down.”
Arch shrugged modestly. “I’m glad you like the place, John. Of course, I don’t have the space I had last year, but you remember what I said in June, ‘No more large apartments.’ Why, towards the end of last year the place was all out of hand. The butler threatened to quit and I had to promise him the coupe two nights a week before he would consent to stay on. Dreadful condition.”
John tchtchtt an understanding tchtchtt, then changed the subject. “By the way, who else is coming over this evening.”
“Frederick Kellogg and his brother, Alexander. I thought we might have four for bridge.”
“Kelloggs?”
“You must know them. They’re those well-set-up boys who run about the campus in the two-tone sweat-shii’ts.”
“Oh, yes, I remember. I met Frederick in the library, last week. He was in the magazine room reading the comic supplements in the out-oftown papers. He’s such a card.”
“Yes, Frederick’s a great wit . . . they should be here any minute now . . . by the way, I asked Father O’Shaughnessy to stop in and act as chaperon.”
“Good old Father O’Shaughnessy. How is he? Remember how he used to throw ice water on the kids to get them up for morning-prayers? Great Fellow!”
“Wasn’t he, though? . . . I’ll bet that’s he at the door, now.” Arch arose and opened the door. A young man stood there.
By William Cullen Fay
“Wanta subscribe to the NewsTimes?”
“No.”
“Wanta buy some stationery?— hundred sheets for a buck.”
“No.”
“Wanta buy any pennants, Yale, Columbia, Carnegie Tech? — three for-a-quarter.”
“You go away or I’ll call a prefect. Scat.” Arch slammed the door angrily and returned to his chair. “Aren’t they the limit?” he asked.
John nodded. The two chums were thoughtfully silent for a moment. Finally, John spoke. “By the way, Arch, how’s Mary this year?”
Arch’s face fell. “Mary doesn’t live here any more,” he said, his voice thick. “They transferred her to that Big Walgreen’s, on State Street, in Chicago.” A lonely tear gathered in his bleary red right eye.
John reached forward and patted Arch’s knee, consolingly. “I’m sorry, old man. I didn't know.”
Arch braced himself. “It’s . . . it’s all right, John . . . and your girl, John. How is she?”
It was John’s turn to grow sad. “She’s gone, too,” he mourned. And it seems like only yesterday she started to work in the Caf, filling up the coffee mugs. She was successful, too. It wasn’t three months she worked her way up to second helper on the toaster. Then — phyffft — she was gone.”
“What happened, John?”
“The manager found out-that she carried her lunch.”
“What a shame,” Arch sputtered indignantly.
The two chums once again lapsed into silence, which congealed until a cheery rat-a-tat ticked on the door which opened to disclose what had to be Father O’Shaughnessy.”
“Good evening, gentlemen.”
“Father O’Shaughnessy, this is a pleasure,” responded the chums in unison. “Won’t you sit, down?”
“Thank you, gentlemen.” Father O’Shaughnessy sat down. He carried a book entitled The Jesuits in Education beneath his left arm.”
“Have a cigar, Father?” Arch arose and took the humidor from the end-table.
“No thanks, have one of my own,” responded Father O’Shaughnessy fumbling a butt from his inside pocket.
John arose and took up a smoldering stick from the fireplace. “Light, Father?”
“Thank you. Well, gentlemen, where’s the rest of your group?”
“They’ll be along, Father,” responded Arch. “There are just two more. Perhaps you know them, Father? The Kellogg Brothers?”
“Oh, yes, I passed them on the stairs. They seemed to be arguing about something.”
The sound of altercation came from the hall. Arch arose and opened the door. There was the sound of voices.”	.
“Give it here!”
“I will not.”
“You will, too.”
“I will not, neither.”	~
“You always want to be best.”
“I do not, neither.”
The Kelloggs trundled into view. They seemed to be vying in friendly joust for a package done up in the nicest tissue paper and the biggest red ribbon you ever saw. Suddenly, they sensed that they were being observed, and blushing and giggling, they broke off, and entered the room.
“We brought you this candy, Arch,” said Alexander, shyly proffering the package.
“Why, Alexander, how nice,” said Arch, touched by the utter simplicity of the offering. Arch opened the package. “Oh, look, John,” he called, “Bubble-gum!”
“Oh, goody,” enthused John, fairly dancing with joy.
Soon all were chewing away for fair, except Father O’Shaughnessy, who still had three shreds of tobacco and some cellophane left of his cigar.
“Let’s play cards,” suggested Arch at length.
“Yes, you boys go ahead,” said Father O’Shaughnessy. “I’ll just sit over here in the corner and read my book.” And he did.
Soon Arch had the card table set up and they were all grouped about ready to play. Arch dealt.
“Two spades,” said John.
Alexander looked at Frederick. “How many cards have you, Freddie?”
Freddie shuffled his cards onto the table one by one. “Either thirteen or fourteen,” he finally said.
“That’s what.I thought,” responded Alexander, tossing his cards to Arch. “You gave me eight too many cards.”
“Say fellows,” asked Freddie," how do you play? Do you need Jacks or better to open?”
“How droll,” laughed Arch to John

FIGHTING IRISH SEEK REVENGE FROM NAVY MIDSHIPMEN HOPE TO REPEAT 1936 WIN
By Robert B. Voelker
The Middies are shouting “Anchors A weigh” as Coach Hardwick trains his big guns on eleven smoldering Blue and Gold Jerseys tomorrow afternoon. Navy’s Hardwick uses the same Ingram System that worked so successfully for Tom Hamilton, his predecessor. The new coach stresses a single-wing
power set-up, with two backfields alternating for ten-minute intervals. He is fortunate in having a powerful nucleus of holdovers for line and backfield, plus reinforcements from Plebe ranks. Six of the eleven men who will start for Navy tomorrow saw action against the Irish in Baltimore last year—and won, 3 to 0.
Most promising of the Plebes is marlin-like Allen Bergner, who has been converted from fullback to tackle. This adds a personal touch to the game, for blond Joe Beinor met Bergner when Joe played with Thornton H. S. against the Kankakee eleven several years ago. Bergner shows signs of developing into another Slade Cutter. He tips the scale at 189 and has had considerable gridiron experience. He played one year at military school, one year at Northwestern, and is beginning his second season with the Middies.
In the end positions, the veteran flankers Fike and Powell will see action against Notre Dame. Fike was one of the boys who helped beat the Irish last year. The tackle slots will be filled by Ken Hysong, Bergner, and giant Frank Lynch, who won first place in the shot put against Notre Dame last spring. Heber Player of Navy is probably the most aptly named athlete in the country today; he has played almost every position in football for Navy. He will start at guard, teaming up with Captain DuBois. The Navy looks a bit weak amidship, where the centers seem below the usual Annapolis standard. Fincher and Andrews will be likely candidates for this pivot post.
In the backfield, William T. Ingram, II, son of Jonas Ingram will do the passing and drop-kicking. Bill is the boy who entered last year’s game as a substitute and won it with his dropkick. He comes form Jeffersonville, Ind. Frank Case, Jr., veteran Navy quarterback will call the plays tomorrow. He is a cousin to Captain Clint Frank of Yale.
Art Franks, Jr., will fill the other halfback post. Art, who comes from (Continued on Page 16)

TAP GRID SCHEDULE STARTS THIS WEEK
By Clarence Sheehan
The first round of the Interhall Touch Football Tournament will be played Sunday. At ten o’clock the upper bracket, which consists of sophomore, junior, and senior halls, in addition to the freshman and off-campus outfits will cany on their warfare after dinner. Mr. Scannell has decided to determine the interhall champion this year by means of the elimination process. The scarcity of fields and the fact that the participants could not afford to devote more than a day each week to this activity prompted this decision.
The final practice round was completed Sunday morning. The Freshman boys continued to dominate the early sessions as they blanked Carroll, 12-0. Brownson fared much better than their dorm mates as St. Ed’s fell before them, 18-6. The Badinites were extended to the limit in their contest with Cavanaugh, which they won, 6-0.
Soccer was scheduled to get under way on Monday but was postponed, due to rain. Therefore the Fresh-man-Zahm contest as well as the Cavanaugh-Brownson encounter of Tuesday, which was also rained out, will be played at a later date. Fourteen members of the championship team will be awarded medals.
The soccer coaches are: Kolander, Freshman Hall; Conrad, Zahm, Gag-lione, Cavanaugh; Horman, Brownson; Schulz, Sophomore; Geygisberg, Juniors; Gormley, Seniors.

not intend to stand around and bemoan the dearth of veterans on his squad, however. Instead he plans to depart from some of his coaching methods in order that he may better handle the current situation.
In seasons past many two or three weapon men could be found on the Irish squads. This year the mentor is seeking perfection and is assigning each man to the department in which he is most skilled. There may be three possible exceptions to this. Captairi Zerbst, an experienced saber man, may be assigned to the epee post. Colgan, an epee man, and Pierre de la Vergne, a saber man, will probably be groomed for the foil division.
Since all the foilsmen were graduated in June Mercado, Kiefer, and Doody, who have had but little experience, will probably see plenty of service during the coming campaign.
The epee men are a little more promising. Colgan, Graham, Mahoney and Geurin are expected to be very adept with the sword when the season gets underway.
NAVY EDITOR EXPRESSES SOME GRAVE DOUBTS. BUT MIDDIES SEE ANOTHER VICTORY
By B. P. Hayden
Sports Editor, Log of the United States Naval Academy
ANNAPOLIS, Md., Oct. 21.—Anxious to prove that the three Navy victories over Notre Dame of the past four years were no flukes, the midshipmen invade Notre Dame Saturday expecting the toughest kind of a ball game. Coach Hardwick is taking 36 men west with him, while the ranking officers of the

•
Although thousands will be at the stadium Saturday to watch the Middies battle the Irish, many other interested persons will have a picture of the game drawn by some of the best sports writers and radio broadcasters in the country. The press box will also hold scouts from all of the teams left on the Notre Dame schedule, amongst them will be Bernie Bierman of Minnesota.
The Minnesota team has Saturday off and many Minneapolis and St. Paul newspaper men will accompany Coach Bierman here. These men, George Barton, George Edmond, Bill Hammond, and Bill Cullim, will give the Minnesota fans an idea of what to expect the following Saturday.
Not all Chicago papers have as yet assigned men to cover the game, but Warren Brown of the Chicago Herald and Examiner is expected to be here. Papers all over the country will tell about the game as Steve Snyder of the United Press and William Week of the Associated Press will be here. Bill Fox of Indianapolis, Jake Frong of Dayton, Jimmy Corcoran, James S. Kearns, and Marvin McCarthy all of Chicago will also be here to cover the game for their papers.
Besides Coach Bierman, there will be scouts here from Pitt, Army, Northwestern, and Southern Cal. Columbia, and Princeton will also have scouts here to pick up Navy plays. Army will be the best represented with five scouts in the press box and two in the stands and these men will have a twofold job as Army plays both Notre Dame and the Navy later in the year.
The game will have a country wide broadcast, for N.B.C., the Mutual chain, and the WLW line will have men here to cover the game.

Case and Antrim, also somewhat banged up last week, were used sparingly in order that the Blue might put its best foot forward against Coach Layden’s crew. The middies will, however, be without the services of their first string center, Mike Wallace, who apparently is through for the season. Dick Fincher, talkative Arkansas lad, has been doing a fair job in replacement, however.

INTRODUCING By Mark J. Mitchell
RESERVES TURN BACK PURDUE 32-13
The story of the average football player’s success seems to have a certain Horatio Alger ring. However, this week we present to you a lad who fulfills not one or two, but all the qualifications—hardships, disappointments, and ultimate success—of the true Algerian hero. Only he isn’t really an Algerian from Africa; he’s an Irishman from Bloomington, Illinois.
starting post against Carnegie.
Charles Alexander Sweeney, present first string right end of the Notre Dame Varsity, has had a long hard fight, and the best part of it is that he’s still fighting. As a sophomore, he made the Irish “A” squad, even took all of the trips with them, yet missed his monogram almost by seconds. Last year he earned his “N. D.” with minutes to spare, but still he had to compete against a red-head named Joe Zwers. And you don’t have to ask anybody how hard a job that was. In the Illinois game two weeks ago, Chuck played before a crowd which included most of his home town —and played a game that was good enough to boost him to the
So it is that Chuck Sweeney—globe-trotter and pipe line worker—earned a first string post on Elmer Layden’s team. But that’s not the whole story. At Trinity High school in Bloomington he was an excellent basketball player, captaining in his senior year a team that played in the National Catholic tournament at Loyola. He went out for basketball at Notre Dame, made the squad too, but what can even a good basketball player do against such fellows as Moir and Meyer, Nowak and Wukovits. Another disappointment, but it only made Chuck concentrate harder on football. The result of this concentration needs no telling.
We mentioned a while back that Sweeney was a globe-trotter. The year after he finished high school he spent the summer as a seaman. The past two summers he has worked with a pipe line crew in southern Illinois. He rooms on the fourth floor of Walsh with one of the ace sports reporters of the Scholastic (that’s where we got most of this dope), and intends to return to Notre Dame next fall to finish his law studies.
A fact we’d like to reiterate before we leave this 190 pound six-footer, is that he is still fighting. And despite the three stitches in his jaw from the Carnegie affair, the fact that he has to hold down his position in competition with his captain, and a perennial nemesis in one form or another, he’ll be out there tomorrow, one of the fightingest Irishmen of them all.
FIGHTING IRISH SEEK REVENGE (Continued from Page 14)
Harrisburgh, Illinois, has played a prominent role with the second team. Wood and Whitehead, two brilliant Plebes, will stand as reserves for the backfield. These two sophomores,
Emmett Wood and Ulmont Whitehead, promise plenty trouble of the Layden men. Wood clears the way, and Whitehead follows like a runaway destroyer.
A three - touchdown rally in the fourth quarter gave the Notre Dame “B” team a 32-13 victory over the Purdue “B” eleven. The game was played last Saturday in the local stadium.
Though the crowd was small, those present saw a wonderful ball game. The lead see-sawed back and forth no less than five times. Foi’ Notre Dame, Danny and Jack Sullivan, Johnny McMahon, Paul Morrison, Alan Mooney, Sweeney Tuck, and Kelleher were standouts in the backfield. Linemen Aug Bossu, Joe McDonough, and Harry Fox, among others, did exceptionally well.
The only score of the first period came when Paul Morrison cut off tackle from the five-yard line. The point was missed. Early in the second quarter, Herbert, Purdue left half, tied matters up when he concluded a 75-yard scoring sprint. The conversion was made via the placement method, and thus the Boilermaker Jay Vees possessed a single point lead.
Before half time came around, the Irish were again in front. Jack Sullivan tore through the boys from Lafayette for 26 yards and a first down on the three-yard line. From there, Alan Mooney bucked the leather across. Once again the point-attempt was unsuccessful.
In the third period, a fumble gave Purdue the oval on the Irish 23. A pass completed in the corner of the end zone made the scoreboard read: Purdue 13, Notre Dame 12. And when the fourth quarter opened, the down-state Hoosiers were still protecting their single point margin. The Blue and Gold second-stringers decided that it was time to stop fooling around. Two runs by Danny Sullivan, one of 51 yards and the other of seven, gave the N.D. eleven its third touchdown. A few minutes later, a pass, Tuck to Sitko, resulted in a fourth Irish tally. It was after this touchdown that Mooney made the initial Notre Dame extra point. Just before the contest became history, Danny Sullivan accounted for his second six-pointer. He intercepted a Boilermaker heave in midfield and mainly through his swiftness of foot was able to reach the counting stripe again. Mooney’s placement ended all scoring for the day.
Next on the “B” team schedule is Illinois. Since Bob Zuppke is known to give his scrubs a good deal of attention, the locals had better beware. The date of the affair is Oct. 30.

On The Enemy's Bench
By Ed Brennan
Tomorrow’s contest with Navy marks the 11th consecutive game in football rivalry between the Middies and Irish. A crowd of 50,000 fans is expected.—
Frank Case, Jr., veteran Navy quarterback, who started against Notre Dame last year is a cousin of Clint Frank, Yale’s candidate for All-American honors. Case is captain of Navy’s LaCrosse team.—
Navy, Pittsburgh, and Northwestern are the only remaining teams on Notre Dame’s schedule that are undefeated, Northwestern is the only one of the three thus far untied.—
Apparently Bernie Bierman is going to capitalize on Minnesota’s off-day, for he will be present to scout tomorrow’s game in preparation for the Gopher-Irish battle next week.—
Army will also have six scouts present. Two will be behind the goal posts and four in the press box. They will take notes on both Notre Dame and Navy, for the Cadets meet both teams later in the season.—
Navy changes its head coach every three years because of the intervention of a required sea duty.—
Bill Ingram, Middie half back, won the Navy Athletic Association Sword for general excellence in athletics as a second classman. (junior) He is also captain-elect of the baseball team.—
One of football’s greatest crowds, 110,000 persons saw Notre Dame defeat Navy 7 to 0 in 1928, at Soldiers Field, Chicago. A deceptive short pass from John Niemic to John Col-erick provided the margin.—
The Irish and the Middies opened their athletic relationship in 1913 with a baseball game, making 1937 the silver jubilee of their friendly rivalry. This is also the 25th anniversary of the opening of the Notre Dame-Army football series. The Irish and Cadets met in a baseball game in 1913, prior to their first football clash.—
Frank Lynch, giant Navy tackle, won a first place in the shot put against Notre Dame in track last spring.—
Earl Brown, junior left end, will be 22 tomorrow.—
The performance of Northwestern’s line against Purdue last Saturday should eliminate all of Coach Waldorf’s pre-season doubts regarding its strength. Twice in the third quarter it held the Boilermakers for downs inside the Wildcat 25 yard line, and in the fourth quarter they again checked Purdue’s attempt to score, this time on the 1 foot line.
Keogan Releases 1937-38 Basketball Schedule Cagers to Meet Nation's Strongest Teams
Director of Athletics Elmer Layden this week issued the 1937-38 Notre Dame basketball schedule. This year’s schedule looks like a case of where the football team leaves off
Cage Captain Meyer “No More Smoking.”
the basketball team begins because George Keogan has scheduled some of the toughest basketball quintets in . the country to face his Irish squad.
Such Big Ten standouts as Wisconsin, Illinois, Northwestern, and Minnesota will furnish the Irish plenty of action when they meet any such nationally-prominent teams as N.Y.U., Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Pittsburgh, and Colgate promise to score possible upsets over the National Championship Irish team.
The schedule will take the team from Minneapolis to New York City.
Determined Irish Squad Drills in Mud and Cold to Beat the Midshipmen
In last Monday’s mud, the Irish football squad started the hardest, roughest week of practice it has had all year. The coaches, who have ever insisted on strong, smart, driving play, have been more caustic, have encouraged good blocking or tackling or running more triumphantly, jibed more sarcastically at every display of ineptitude. There has been an air of deep earnestness, more intense than ever before, about each practice session. Joe Boland has kept sending his linemen against each other, against the dummies, against the ever-learning, ever-tougher freshmen. Chet Grant and Joe Benda have been working the backs and ends, riding some for not blocking, riding others for being blocked. Coach Layden is all over the field, combining lines and backs, criticizing the work of each unit, continually emphasizing timing.
Two eastern jaunts will highlight the Irish season. The first on January 4 will take the team to Philadelphia where they will meet the great Pennsylvania team, and then to Buffalo where the scrappy Canisius outfit will be met. Late in January the Irish will again turn eastward, this time to New York and Albany. N.Y.U. and Colgate will be played respectively, on this trip.
The season will open Dec.ember 1 at Notre Dame, when Columbia College, of Dubuque, Iowa, furnishes the opposition. The first five games on the schedule will be played on the local floor. After these the Irish travel and will not appear in action at Notre Dame again until Jan. 15. The season will close March 11 at Detroit when the University of Detroit meet the Irish.
The schedule:
Dec. 1—Columbia College at Notre Dame Dec. 4—Ball State Teachers at Notre Dame Dec. 8—Western State (Kalamazoo) at NJ). Dec. 13—Wisconsin at Notre Dame
Dec. 18—Northwestern at Notre Dame

There is a certain lilting drive apparent in the play of the various teams, which has been missing till now. The shock of the last weekend, when the “Fighting Irish” were outfought, has initiated an emotional -surge to supplement the already apparent competence of the varsity in the various mechanics of play. Every man has been running harder, hitting more viciously, more solidly smacking down freshman ball-carriers. Gradually the passers have been finding the receivers more easily. The passes are getting away quicker, the receivers are grabbing them more cleanly. The fundamentals have been fairly well learned; now they are becoming coordinated more than ever before.

SPLINTERS FROM THE PRESS BOX
By John F. Clifford
Comforting sentiments for Notre Dame grid followers emanated from the trusty typewriter of Grantland Rice during the past week, and rekindled a smouldering flame of hope for the success of the 1937 season. The sports savant whose pertinent opinions are always unbiased and authentic, in speaking of the modern mania of scheduling nine or more dynamite-loaded games on successive Saturdays, states that any team facing such a season can consider the winning of a sixty per cent of its games a highly admirable record. To see the truth in this statement just look over a few of the beaten or tied teams which earlier in the season had been picked by the so-called experts to be in the limning for national honors—Pitt, Fordham, Minnesota, Nebraska, Army, Ohio State, Navy, Duke, Princeton, Tulane, and Columbia. We could mention at least thirty great elevens which already have been toppled from their feet of clay and still have the toughest games of the season ahead of them.
V
The glorious era of picking a National Champ by the unbeaten-untied method passed out of the picture with 3.2 beer and bond-selling college grads. All-American Committees no longer merely ask what did a particular player do; they want to know against whom did he do it. Notre Dame undoubtedly has the toughest schedule in the country this year. Having tasted sweet victory and sour defeat, the Irish have yet to meet the Goliaths of the football world. Gar Davidson, head coach at West Point, hit the nail smack on the nose, when, speaking of this ultra-modern football, he said, “Football is like that now, and the only way to get through a season is to put the games behind you that have been played and get right to work on the ones to come.” And Notre Dame is yet to come. . . .
V
The Yale Bulldogs look like the shining star on the Eastern horizon this year. They have two fleet-footed halfbacks in Clint Frank and Al Wilson, who have had a swell time romping over their opponents. Last year this kid Wilson couldn’t hit his stride because the turf in the Bowl caused him to stumble before he could get under way. So, what did the Yale A.A. do but re-sod the oval so that Mr. Wilson might reach pay dirt for OF Eli. Effective? He stepped 85 yards against Maine returning the kick-off for six points, made two touchdowns against Penn and scored one of the Elis’ two touchdowns against the Army!

1-2-3-4-5—BEAT NAVY—1-2-3-4-5
With no less than 21 tie games and upsets galore throughout the country last week, football forecasters consoled themselves by looking over their averages to date. The Wizard of Walsh led with his chin on six occasions ending up with 9 wins, 2 losses, and 4 ties, which by no means puts him in the lower bracket. So far Steve has called 27 right out of 42 games, and discounting 6 ties he has the enviable average of .750. Placing the ties in the same class as losses he is still batting Ducky Medwick style—.642. The 1937 season is one-third over. From now until New Year’s Day you can look for some “ripsnorters” that will make aspirin sales soar sky-high. Just cast your lamps on these games below for to-morrow.

STARS OF PAST STUD NAVY-IRISH SERIES
By Nick Lamberto
The Navy-Notre Dame clash tomorrow marks the eleventh meeting of the two teams. This friendly football rivalry began in 1927 and has been an annual feature ever since. The Fighting Irish have won 7 and the Middies 3 of the 10 games played to date.
The series opener in 1927 was played in the Baltimore Civic Stadium before a capacity crowd. Notre Dame’s second team played the entire first half and was on the short end of a 6 to 0 count as the period ended. The Irish first team then went into action and soon rolled up three-touchdowns. The final score was 19 to 6 in Notre Dame’s favor.
In 1928 the two teams met in Soldier’s Field, Chicago, before a crowd of 110,000. Notre Dame grasped this one out of the fire in the fourth quarter when Niemiec passed to Col-erick for a touchdown and a 7 to 0 victory.
Notre Dame continued its winning streak over Navy in 1929 with a 14 to 7 victory. Navy led 7 to 0, but Carideo’s pass to Elder tied the score and Mullins’ short plunge won the game. The Navy journeyed to Notre Dame in 1930 to dedicate the stadium. Joe Savoldi had a field day and the Irish sent the Middies back to Annapolis on the short end of a 26 to 2 score.
Gordon Chung-Hoon played valiantly for a losing cause in the Navy-Notre Dame struggle of 1931. Schwartz, Banas, and Murphy scored for the Irish and gave them a 20 to 0 win. In 1932 the Fighting Irish torpedied the Middies with 24 first downs and two touchdowns to win their sixth straight in the series, 12 to 0.
Navy snapped this winning streak in 1933 with a 7 to 0 victory. The Irish piled up 21 first downs to 4 but couldn’t pass the double stripe. The Middies gave en encore in 1934 and beat the Blue and Gold boys, 10 to 6 on Slade Cutter’s field goal and Borries’ pass to Dornin. Pilney passed 25 yards to Peters for Notre Dame’s score.
Pilney and the Irish beat Navy 14 to 0 in 1935. Pilney passed once to Gaul for a 53-yard gain and a touchdown. He passed again to Layden for a 5-yard gain and a touchdown. This was the fifth game in which Last year the Irish lost a tough one at Baltimore, 3 to 0. Bill Ingram, disregarding the odds, kicked the Navy into victory with a field goal. Incidentally this boy Ingram also intercepted five passes.

KEOGANITES START STRICT TRAINING
CARNEGIE TECH FIELD GOAL UPSETS IRISH. 9-7; SCOTS STOP IRISH SCORING THREATS
Coach George Keogan’s netmen took to the floor for the first time last week to begin their long period of training for the 1937-38 basketball season.
Up to the present the Irish have simply been limbering up and practicing shooting preparatory to the start of regular scrimmages.
The Irish face the season’s beginning with eight monogram men on hand. Not a single member of last year’s first string quartet was lost through graduation. The entire team, composed of Captain Ray Meyer, All-Americans Johnny Moir and Paul Nowak, Tommy Wukovits, and Earl Brown, returns intact. The other lettermen are Mike Crowe, Ed Sadowski, and Tom Jordan. All of these men have reported for practice except Earl Brown who is an end on the football squad.
In addition to these lettermen Coach Keogan has a number of excellent prospects from last year’s freshman squad to depend on. Among this group are Mark Ertle, Louis Wagner, Ellis, Clair, and Sitko. These former freshmen will press the letter-men and make them hustle to retain their positions.
The Irish wall probably begin scrimmaging the first part of next week. The scrimmages will be light at first but will gradually lengthen out as the netmen get into shape.
Clubs Play Soccer
The LaRaza and Memphis clubs have started what promises to be a regular schedule of weekly soccer games. The two clubs have already played two games and plan to meet in another this Sunday.
The two clubs have each won one game. Wednesday, a week ago, the Memphis club defeated the La Raza team, 2 to 0. Last Sunday, however, the members of the Spanish club took revenge on the Southerners and licked them in the rain, 3 to 0.
Other clubs will probably take up the game, and it may take its place as a regular sport feature. The series will continue between these two teams until other clubs organize.

SO THEY SAY
Glory, great chunks of it, came tumbling down around the brawny shoulders of Carnegie Tech’s gallant football team yesterday on the green-covered turf of the Stadium, as the inspired Tartans, encompassing all that had gone before this season, achieved one of the prize upsets of the year by downing Notre Dame’s previously undefeated gridders, 9-7.
The embattled Plaid sent a crowd of 45,000 fans into hysterics several times with matchless goal line stands as the Irish, quick to take the breaks, but slow to capitalize on them, were thrust back three times within the very shadows of the goal posts.— Lester Beiderman in the Pittsburgh Press.
The Canny Scots of Carnegie Tech gave nothing but promises to Notre Dame today. Time and time again they tempted the Irish with chances to score, but in the pinches they refused to yield. So the warriors from South Bend, always threatening but seemingly without punch, tumbled to defeat, 9 to 7, before 44,617 spectators. It was Carnegie’s fourth triumph in 15 engagements with Notre Dame.—Irving Vaughan in the Chicago Tribune.
Carnegie Tech’s struggling Skibos, a thorn in the side of some of Notre Dame’s greatest elevens, rose from the ashes of two defeats today and beat another undefeated Irish team, 9 to 7, in the stirring fifteenth renewal of their rivalry.
Coleman (Koppy) Kopcsak, member of a prominent Greensburg, Pa., football family, stood on the Irish 16-yard line late in the third period and place-kicked the field goal that brought the Tartans victory after both teams had scored touchdowns in the previous period. — Associated Press report in the New York Herald-Tribune.
Carnegie Tech 9, Notre Dame 7.
There you have it—the result of yesterday’s football game witnessed by a crowd of close to 45,000 in ideal weather at the Stadium.
A thriller—another one of those old-fashioned Carnegie Tech-Notre Dame thrillers — if there ever was one.—Harry Keck in the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph.
♦ Last Saturday the Pitt Stadium jinx on Notre Dame helped Carnegie Tech to frustrate six out of seven Irish scoring drives, and inspired the Skibos to capitalize on their only two opportunities of the afternoon. Notre Dame pushed the ball forward almost at will, piling up 15 first downs to 2, 235 yards to 7, but the Scots, who deserved the appellation “Fighting” more than the Irish last Saturday, became impenetrable whenever their goal line was in danger.

team had warmed up to the battle, Carnegie Tech gained 59 yards on a long pass from Merlyn Condit to Jerry Matelan. A diving tackle on the two-yard line by Andy Puplis saved a touchdown on that play, but Leo Napotnik, the Tartan fullback, immediately plunged through for the first score of the game.
The Irish revived and played determined football for a while. After three touchdowns had failed, “Bunny” McCormick scored from the 24-yard line on a short pass from Jack McCarthy. A place kick by Andy Puplis kept Notre Dame’s perfect record on extra points intact and the Irish led 7-6.

One of Notre Dame’s fourth quarter scoring threats was spoiled when Jerry Matelan, the hero of the game, rushed out of nowhere to knock the potential victory pass from the hands of Len Skoglund in the end zone. Notre Dame’s greatest opportunity of that desperate last period came when two offside penalties on Carnegie Tech gave the Irish a second down on the Tech half-yard line. The Irish tried three times to put the ball across from that position, and three times they failed.

bett, in his first season on the varsity, as chief understudy. At tackles the “light” set, 190 pound Al Bergner and 203 pound Ken Hysong will probably start, with the heavyweight set, Ben Jarvis and Frank Lynch, who each move 214 pounds around, as first replacements. Captain Ray DuBois, who covered himself with glory last year against Notre Dame, is pretty much of a fixture at one guard, with Gunderson and Player available at the other. Fincher will be snapping them back.
Case, Ingram, Antrim, and McFarland, the first class or senior backfield, will probably start, though any or all of the Cooke-Woods-Franks Reimann outfit may be in, and all four are sure to get into action. Lem Cooke, sensation of the Navy season to date, is given the best chance of nosing into the starting lineup. He has looked better than Ingram, especially offensively, on several occasions and it was his great stop of Green, running clear on Navy’s five last week apparently sure of a touchdown, that saved the middies from a beating at the hands of Harvard. He lack’s Ingram’s ability as a dropkicker, in particular. U. I. White-head, also, will get into the game as a back.
Bancroft Hall, the big dormitory at Annapolis, is getting steamed up for the game. “Beat Notre Dame” signs of one sort or another are making their appearance, and the Pep committee plans a big sendoff for the team when it leaves Thursday night. This will be the one game of the season that part or all of the Regiment will not witness, but 2200 midshipmen are hoping they can follow the team on the air. The old timers, remembering the ’34 game in Cleveland which Navy won, despite the fact that the game was almost entirely played -within Navy’s 30-yard line, hope they get a little more chance to relax than they did the last time Navy and Notre Dame played away from home.
The old saw about opposites attracting each other in affairs of the heart is just the exception that proves the rule, science has decided.

WHEN GOOD FELLOWS MEET
(Continued from Page 13)
for he had a sense of humor and could enjoy a good joke. “As if you fellows didn’t know we were playing bridge,” he scoffed.
“Bridge? . . . Bridge? . . . never heard of it.”
“Can’t play bridge? Oh, come now,” broke in John.
“We can’t play Bridge.”
“Well, what can you play?”
“We’re good Rummie players.”
They played Rummie. After several games Alexander- playfully sat on the ace of spades for a whole game, which was a good joke, because Freddie had only two aces and consequently couldn’t complete his hand.
“Dash you, Freddie,” said Alexander, when he learned of the stratagem, “I ought to pummel you,” and so saying Alexander made a friendly shy at Freddie which Freddie avoided neatly although he did knock down the bridge lamp.

Gentlemen:-
About eighteen months ago I was forced to quit smoking a pipe because the tarry products in the heel kept me chronically nauseated. Too bad, but it couldn’t be helped. No use feeling miserable every time I fired up. So I stayed off tobacco for over a year.
Then one day I saw a few Frank’s Medicos in a druggist’s showcase, and half-heartedly decided to try one. So many patented filter systems on the market. But I’d risk a dollar on one anyhow,-just in hopes ...
For six happy months, how I’ve been smoking that Frank’s. This afternoon I bought my second one, and have it sending up incense as I write. I want to tell you - in case you don’t already know it -ithat you’re one of the benefactors of so-iciety. Lol the poor Indian! Lol Sir Walter Raleigh! Lo! everybody who died before you brought out a filter that really works. I’m-tolling my friends by the dozen, but not fast enough.
You may use my name if you care to, and add that this letter is absolutely unsolicited on your part.
Very cordially yours.

day—run with a new, fresh elan. The three or four “first" backfields are inspiring each other to finer displays of timing, deception, cutting, dodging, blocking, by their rivalry for the starting job against the Navy tomorrow. O’Reilly, McCarthy, McCormick, and Thesing in one group, having barely staying ahead of the other combinations of Puplis, Binkowski, Zontini, and Burnell or Gleason, and Sitko, Gottsacker, Sullivan or Arboit, and Sheridan, Lynn, or Stevenson.
There was little drill all week on any new trick to make up for the ones Notre Dame was forced to reveal in vain against Illinois and Carnegie Tech, but rather a sharpening up - on the already familiar powerplays, reverses, delayed bucks, long and short passes. For the first three games of the schedule, practice was concerned with the mechanical execution of the plays; this week it was concerned with adding a certain spirit, a > certain necessary spark to the mechanical execution. Navy will determine the existence of that spark; Minnesota, Pittsburgh, Army, Northwestern, and Southern California will test its endurance.
