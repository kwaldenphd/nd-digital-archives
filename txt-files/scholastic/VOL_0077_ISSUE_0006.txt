THINGS-ARE-TOUGH-DEPT.
“Each student will be required to turn in his sugar rationing card at the Treasurer’s office in order that the school may obtain its supply of sugar.” That’s the way they’re doing it at St. John’s in Collegeville, Minn., and the Office of Price Administrator says it must be so. But then the lads are to be given their No. 8 stamp for Christmas vacation, so the riot is quelled.

Harvard is having trouble, too, but of a much more serious nature. Unless more students volunteer for waiters’ jobs, the administration has announced, the midmorning snack of hot chocolate and wafers will be discontinued!
BAIL FOR YALE
And just in passing, we’d like to mention a good bit of news we heard from a Yale man. A pool, it seems, is maintained for the assistance of dilapidated and dissipated Yale students who at times may require bail from the New Haven jail system.

AFTER HOURS
The Varsity Neivs of the University of Detroit reports another robbery. It’s the Union Room again, the third time in as many weeks. But this time they’ve got fingerprints, and all the Detroit detectives, amateur and otherwise, are on the hunt.
Just can’t keep those kids away from the coke machine, you know.
PRAISE THE LORD. ...
The co-eds of Minnesota are being armed! The priorities board has seen fit to outfit “co-eds who want to learn to carry a gun,” and ammunition is being supplied as needed. This from the Daily, and who or what is being shot is not mentioned. Maybe it’s wolf season in Minnesota.
HONESTLY!
Our latest fan letter, (the first since July), is from the exchange editor of the Fordham (School of Education) Curved Horn, feminine counterpart of The Ram.
We shall quote at careful random: “I might think you’d find many strange characters at that school you so lovingly refer to as The Rock. . . . Here’s for better co-operation between Fordham girls and Notre Dame men.”
She lives in the Bronx, too, and thinks it’s a mortal sin to mention the word Brooklyn !
FOR THE BOOKS
Here are some more facts about our allies to file away:
The total value of the 3,000 fraternity and sorority houses in the U.S. is $95,-000,000; the average house is worth $28,118. The average frat house has 24 rooms; sorority, 19. Frat house furnishings alone cost $11,000,000, and each one in the country possesses at least one chapter-owned radio.
WILLIE, AGAIN
Willie in a fit insane,
Thrust his head beneath a train.
All were quite surprised to find How it broadened Willie’s mind.
TIME BOMB
Perhaps it’s the rationing, but The Cornell Widow is going a long way to get its jokes these days. The latest issue contained one quoted from the Notre Dame Juggler, which you might remember as one of the leading campus humor magazines of ten years ago. Yes, the joke was good—but ten years ago.

BARE - SKIN
Who is Bearskin? This seems to be the favorite topic for discussion these Friday afternoons. After reading the column for three years we are inclined to think it has been mis-named. The bear should be substituted by- another furry little animal which is said, to resemble a pussy. Well who is Bearskin? It might be Clashmore Mike but evidently the author is- able to write so that eliminates Mike. Besides, we wouldn’t want to blame something like Punts and Passes on poor Mike. It could be the Morning Bugler. The style is as bad, the cracks are as misdirected, and the odor is as annoying. He is probably an “expert” who knows a swell place to peek into Cartier Field, sees two home games, reads the
Street and Smith Football Annual, has met Harry Wright, has attended a pep rally and doesn’t think it was at all as “nice” as it should have been, and spends Saturday night eavesdropping on the freshmen Monday morning quarterbacks as they plan Bearskin’s strategy and criticism for next Friday’s column.

Few students know that each and every member of. the Cavaliers is a member of the marching band.... It has been well said that: “A pun is a joke at which everyone groans—because he didn’t think of it first.”...

! Unique Bonfire Rally Scheduled Tonight;
Pre-Game Excitement Reaches New High
Attempt On Goal Posts Seems Unfounded Rumor
“It’s a ‘natural’,” is the vague, but most encompassing answer to the high-pitch excitement and tenseness that has settled down over the Notre Dame campus, the city of South Bend and many nearby towns, as the kickoff time for the Notre Dame-Michigan football game approaches. Over a month ago the ticket office announced that all choice seats for the contest had been taken. Early this week the official S.R.O. sign was hung out. The only tickets available now are in the hands of scalpers and • the unwary multitudes who neglected to get their .tickets early will probably pay high prices for their ducats.
Tonight’s pep rally will light the fuse which will touch off the explosion tomorrow afternoon. The rally will start, with a band and torchlight parade over to the field house immediately after supper. Due to war-transportation problems no definite promises have been made for the main speakers on the program. However, among those prominently mentioned were Dean “Pat” Manion, Warren Brown, Coach Leahy, and possibly Governor-elect Harry Kelly of Michigan or Governor Schricker of Indiana. Also Coach Crisler of Michigan and some of his squad may be persuaded to put in an appearance.
Immediately after the rally-proper the crowd will pour out on to Brownson field where Art Ley, Student Council special events man, has planned a unique bonfire. The usual bonfire material was not available again—war conditions are to be blamed. So Ley has procured a number of old railroad ties and has spelled out “Michigan” with these. The ties will be burned as a final point in the program.
The Glee Club concerts in the Alumni-, Dillon court are fast becoming a tradition. Tentative plans have been made to continue the series tonight after the bonfire. All are invited to enjoy the singing.
All pre-weekend statistics have point
ed to one of the biggest, most enthusiastic crowds ever to overwhelm South Bend. Michigan is sending its 125 piece band. The music lads are scheduled to parade in downtown South Bend tomorrow at 11 o’clock and to eat their noon meal here in the N.D. dining halls as guests of the University. Among the estimated 20,000 out of town fans will be some 4,000 rabid student rooters from the Wolverines’ home stamping grounds. Result: the Michigan team will not lack supporters.
An unfounded, ominous rumor has been drifting around this campus all week. The story has it that a prize has been offered to the Michigan fraternity returning to Ann Arbor with the biggest section of the stadium goal posts. The subject has been a favorite for standing-in-line-for-meals conversation during the past several days. The general concensus is that the whole thing is just a wild rumor. Most of the students are quite confident that the goal posts will remain intact after the game. They point to the
Programs! Can't tell Bertelli from Rymkus without a program!
unsurpassed, competent usher system in the stadium. They do not seem worried at all; they all just smile and look speculative.
A sports broadcasting record will be set tomorrow when ten different crack announcers describe the game to radio’s football fandom. This ten mike hookup exceeds even World Series broadcasts and shows conclusively that this is the season’s biggest game so far.
The game football is being auctioned off to the highest War Bond bidder. Bidding has been spirited to date and more action along this line is expected as Michigan contingents arrive tonight and tomorrow. The local Commerce Forum will be on hand with its Defense Stamp corsages and. Bond Booth just inside gate 15. A record sale of both stamps and bonds is expected.
The South Bend Association of Commerce has announced that all available rooms in the city are reserved. A list of rooms in hotels in Mishawaka, Goshen, Elkhart, and Michigan City has been sent out and all association members have been urged to cooperate to the fullest extent for the convenience of the record crowd.

Mitchell Ayres Slated for Prom;
Juniors Await "Fashions in Music"
Mitchell Ayres and his “fashions in music” orchestra are slated to play for the annual Notre Dame Junior Prom one week from tomorrow night. Nov. 21, at the Palais Royal. After three months of negotiations, Dick Doermer, president of the Junior Class, finally succeeded in landing a top-flight band.
Final arrangements have been completed for the affair, and supporting the Ayres troupe will be charming Meredith Blake, baritone Dick Dyer, and the glee club.
General chairman of the Prom is James Meagher of Valparaiso, Ind. Others prominent in making arrangements for the annual dance are Frank Vignola, vice - president of the class, Frank Stumpf, secretary, and Frank Curran, treasurer.
Featured all the way from the Casino on Catalina Island, Calif., to the Roseland Ballroom in New York, as well as top-notch theaters, hotels, and clubs along the way, violinist Mitch Ayres promises to play music that is danceable and listenable. This is the same aggregation that in recent years has consistently called for from three to six network programs a week. And in every broadcast and engagement at least one novelty tune will be interspersed with the popular melodies, in keeping with the band’s “please-all” policy.
Tall, athletic Ayres is a graduate of the Physical Education School of Columbia University. The native New Yorker and his band boast a musical library valued at more than $40,000, from which they select their arrangements of popular, novel, and semi-classical tunes.

Knights Dedicate War T Plaque of Service Men
The Knights of Columbus remembered its members who are now in the armed services of the United States last Sunday by having the Communion-Breakfast , Mass offered up for them. The Mass was I at 8:30 in Sacred Heart Church and its celebrant was Father Johnson, C.S.C. , The Knights, attending in a body, break- ? fasted in the Council Chambers in Walsh ' Hall.	i
The feature of the day came when Father Craddick, C.S.C., prefect of religion, dedicated a blue and gold plaque bearing the individual name of each knight who now is serving his country. Jerry Killigrew, th e Council’s grand knight, announced that names of all other knights entering the service in the future will also be added. The plaque was on exhibit all day Sunday in the vestibule of the Main Church, but on Monday it was transferred to the offices of the Knights of Columbus in Walsh Hall where it will hang hereafter.

Prof. Shanahan Discusses Naval War At First Student-Professor Meeting
s The initial Student-Profesior meeting of the Fall semester starred Mr. William '	0. Shanahan, popular professor of his-
tory and outstanding historian. Some sixty students crowded the Rockne Memorial lounge to hear Mr. Shanahan describe “N aval Power in Modern Warfare.’’ Just as after his first appearance at the Student - Professor meetings last spring,
J he sent students away convinced that I “he knows what he is talking about.” | Mr. Shanahan first distinguished two types of naval warfare: the warfare of > 1 blockade which the British have used so I advantageously, and the warfare on commerce which the Germans have been using recently and which they used during the first World War. The first, said . Mr. Shanahan, requires battleships, the latter makes effective use of submarines. “Don’t sell the battleship short because of all the talk you hear about its antiquity and uselessness. The backbone of sea power has been and is the battleship. It is particularly important in blockade warfare. Incidentally, the battleships of this country are the heaviest gunned in the world, but they are also the slowest.”
He went onto describe the role of each type of ship in modern war. The destroy-5 er, he said, is fast but has virtually no armor; the cruiser has light armor and is also very fast. The battleship, of course, is slow and heavily armed and armored. ■ “As for aircraft carriers, I believe that we are probably changing some plans for battleships into plans for aircraft carriers. When we hear of aircraft carriers being sunk, we must remember they provide a fine target for the enemy. They are big and bulky. But most important, > they must carry huge supplies of gasoline, which, of course, makes the chances of fires and explosions very great.”
“At present in the Solomons and the South Pacific, we are waging a war of attrition. We will do well if we lose one ship for every one the Japanese lose, be- cause our replacement ability is superior to that of the Japs. Further, when we moan over disasters to our own fleet, we ; must not forget that all the time we are taking a heavy toll of Japanese ship: it Ping.”
Following the lecture, Mr. Shanahan _ • was quizzed as to the length of the war. “I think Germany can be defeated in a year; another year and a half after that and Japan will be finished.”
Next Monday; Nov. 16, at 7:30, probably in the Rockne Memorial Lounge, Dr. Waldemar Gurian will discuss Hitler’s Methods of Expansion. This is Dr. Gur-ian’s first appearance at the StudentProfessor meetings. The possibility of a large crowd of students and faculty may necessitate changing the location to the Law or Engineering auditorium. Students are asked to watch their hall bulletin boards for the final announcement of the place.—Al Sommer
Economics Foundation
Announces Big Awards
This week the American Economic Foundation announced its second series of national intercollegiate radio prize debates. The subject to be debated this year is, “Should American youth support the re-establishment after the war of competitive enterprise as our dominant economic system?”
The American Economic Foundation is a non-profit organization whose purpose is to arouse public interest and discussion of vital economic and social problems. This series of collegiate debates is one of their means. The Foundation is located at 295 Madison Avenue, New York City. Represented on its advisory committees are such distinguished Americans as R. L. Wilbur, president of Stanford University; William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor; and the Right Rev. Msgr. John A. Ryan, director of the social action department of the National Catholic Welfare Conference.
The contest is open to any full-time undergraduate student now working for a bachelor’s degree. Each college or university can enter one speaker for each side of the question. These contestants must be chosen from a competition open to all students. Before Jan. 25, 1942, each candidate certified by the president
VICTORY DANCE
“Veet" Capello and his CAVALIERS will furnish the music for tomorrow night's dance at the Indiana Club, announced John Murray, chairman of the dance for this week's sponsor, the Knights of Columbus.
$1.10 will be the charge for the hundreds who are expected to celebrate here the predicted victory over Michigan. The fun will begin at 8:30 and end at 11:30. Proceeds will be distributed to charities by the Knights.
of the University must file with the Foundation an outline of not over 500 words of a proposed seven and a half minute speech. These arguments must be entitled “For the Affirmative” or “For the Negative” and be unsigned. Included under the same cover with the outlines must be an envelope containing the name, address, and college of the representative. The 16 affirmative and negative speakers judged best from these filed outlines will be informed that they are to debate over local stations of the Blue Network. At each of eight stations, two affirmative and two negative speak- ' ers will compete. All traveling expenses of these contestants will be paid by the foundation. These local radio debates will be held between Feb. 15 and March 15, 1943. The best speaker will receive a §50 award and the better speaker of the oopposing side a $25 prize. Then these winners in each local debate will submit full manuscripts. From these, two affirmative and two negative speakers will be chosen for the final debate for the National Championship. The final nationwide radio debate will be broadcast over the Blue Network from 3:15 to 4:00 pun. Eastern War Time. These four speakers will be entertained in New York during their stay at the expense of the Foundation. The winner of this final debate will receive a $1000 war bond and $250 in cash; second prize will be a $500 war bond and $125 in cash. The winners will be determined by a nation-wide poll of listening judges.
On the campus the speech department is sponsoring a contest in connection with this nation-wide contest. Those who wish to enter should submit their speeches in final form before Dec. 4 to some member of the speech department. For further details prospective speakers can see Mr. W. J. Coyne, director of debating on the campus.—Al Sommer
Many Students Enlist
In Reserves This Week
This week several branches of the service visited the campus to recruit students who are eager to enlist in the armed forces. Medical examinations were taken in the field house Monday, reports on these were posted in Father Trahey’s office in the Engineering building Wednesday, and students were sworn in Thursday.
The exact number of students to be enrolled in this latest drive has not yet been determined. Most of those who applied seemed to choose the air corps. The branches of service represented were the Army Air Corps, the Marine Reserve Corps, the Navy V-l and V-7 classifications, and the Army ERC.

Band Initiates Members Enroute to Gotham; Concerts, Super-Good Time Highlight Trip
JACK WOELFLE
East side, west side, all around the town. The N.D. band was in New York, and things were really falling down.
The University band members boarded the Pacemaker last Thursday afternoon and left on their first overnight trip this season. Trip time is initiation time for the new members so what could have been more appropriate than an initiation? There are plenty of funny answers to this one but the band members stuck to tradition.
Mister Five By Five had nothing on . the freshmen. You couldn’t tell whether they were coming or going, one of the rules being that all members show up at the station with uniforms on backwards. Aboard the train it was impossible to carry out the originally planned version of the initiation. Because of crowded conditions the baggage car could not be had and the railroad officials would not allow cars to be blocked off, so freshmen got off with a minimum of shoe polishing, bag carrying, and cigarette supplying. It was easy telling the band members from the porters. The porters had red caps. About 11 pan. each lad turned off the light, rented a pillow, hung up his coat, pushed back the seat, stretched out, yawned, and then lay awake all night.
Arriving in Grand Central Station Friday morning the boys rushed to church, then to Hotel McAlpin. As they began
Coming or going? Read the sign!
checking in, the other guests began checking out.
Friday evening the band straggled one by one through the lobby of the Waldorf Astoria where they played a short concert for the Notre Dame-Army War Belief Rally. The Waldorf bellboys kept asking the band members what hotel they worked in. After the concert the band stepped from the stage into $100 reserved boxes where some of them reviewed the floor show. Others left to put on a show of their own.
Saturday morning while the Cavaliers hummed The Mole the boys descended into the dark mysterious recesses of the Sixth Avenue subway where they beheld petrified chewing gum and Subway Sam, who hasn’t left 34th Street for six years. He explained that he was looking for a white Christmas. Dick Tracy strolled by on his waj’- to capture Wrinkle-face. One of the lads told him to try St. Mary’s.
The band arrived at the Yankee Stadium early enough to run through their 11 formations before the audience began arriving. Later they went through the same formations with never a flaw. It was all Notre Dame that afternoon.
Immediately after the game the boys returned to the McAlpin lobby where they played an-hour concert for the Irish fans. The plasterers were hard at work repairing the lobby ceiling when the band
left Sunday afternoon. There was plenty ’ of plaster left after the band and students had departed.
The trip to South Bend was very quiet aboard the Commodore Vanderbilt, but , the band was on the Pacemaker. The thing is that the boys in the band have heard that the Michigan band is out to make them look bad. They will be as surprised and as sad as the Michigan football team when they leave for Ann Arbor tomorrow evening.	.
Walsh Surges Into Lead	' i
In War Stamp Drive	*
Additional buying of 10- and 25-cent 1 war stamps has increased the total cam- $ -• pus sales to $2,000—enough to buy four j army jeeps. However, there is a general let-down in weekly sales despite the energetic work of the various hall chair- " men and their sales assistants. They Ji knock on every room door each Thurs- Z day night to sell more war stamps.
Zahm, Alumni, and Breen-Phillips tt d halls have slipped down in their weekly . * average per student. Jim Danaher and his sales committee have kept Walsh hall
at its former weekly average of 20 cents
per student to take the lead in the present hall standings.
In Dillon hall, Vince Oppenheim and his committee promise to reach higher sales upon more effort on the part of the students to buy war stamps. This promise also holds true in Zahm and Alumni -halls where, respectively, Bill Roney, Ed $ Hickey, and their committees are work- -ing hard to urge more students to dig . deep for Uncle Sam.
Ten 25-cent stamps to every 10-cent


stamp are sold. Many students had started previous to the campus sale of war stamps, a book of the 50-cent denomination stamps. This denomination is not sold by the Knights of Columbus, but to accommodate those students they null redeem all 50-cent stamp books for the same value in 25-cent books.
To sell at least one quarter’ stamp to every student is the goal of the war stamp drive. Many individual students, have made it a point to buy a dollar’s worth of stamps every week.

THE FIRST AND THE LAST — UNTIL TOMORROW
Michigan Taught Irish, Beat Them in Football
(This article originally appeared in the April 4,1941 issue of SCHOLASTIC. Because of its timely interest we reprint it this iveek.)	’
Wednesday morning was a free period for the Notre Dame students in 1887. Usually they slept in, studied, or took a walk. On Nov. 23, they went to the senior playground instead. There they found the white-clad Michigan fooball team, champions of the West, teaching Notre Dame how to play. For a half-hour Michigan men instructed Notre Dame men. Then they played the game which was first in the history of Notre Dame, first in a long series of defeats at the hands of Michigan.
Among the crowd of students cheering “Rah, rah Nostra Domina” was a Scho-' lastic reporter who observed for posterity that “on account of time, only a part of one inning was played, and resulted in a score of 8 to 0 in favor of the visitors.”
After the game the winners were fed, packed into carriages and transported to the Niles station. As they left, Notre ; Dame men cheered them, wished some day they, too, might be champions of the West.
With such a beginning the Scholastic was optimistic and “hoped that the coming years will -witness a series of these contests.” Not so sanguine was one member of the faculty who wrote that Notre Dame had “ample room for extended walks and. for all manly sports including alas! the redoubtable game of football.”
So good was the Michigan instruction that Notre Dame entered a three year, . eight-game winning streak, whipping such teams as Northwestern. South Bend High school, Kalamazoo, Albion and Hillsdale.. But the instruction was not so good that it would defeat Michigan. Twice more the Ann Arbor men came to South Bend and twice more the Notre Dame team was defeated. For a while after that, Michigan did not appear on the schedule, and it was then that the first winning streak was accomplished.
In the 21 years from the start of foot, ball at Notre Dame until 1909, Michigan ) and Notre Dame met eight times and on ; each occasion it was Michigan that was victorious. Finally, after 21 years of effort, pupil defeated master. Notre Dame won 11 to 3. They were champions . of the West. “Rah, rah Nostra Domina,” the students cheered.—Don Heltzel
Notre Dame Team Praised
After Crushing Michigan
(The following is the account of the 1909 Notre Dame-Michigan game as it appeared in the SCHOLASTIC exactly 33 years ago today—November 13, 1909. The man who starred at left half back for Notre Dame in that game 33 years ago is none other than Harry Miller, father of Tom and Creighton of this year’s varsity.)
“And Notre Dame has the crust to think they can beat Michigan.” This was one of the inspired utterances of the oracle who sized up the Michigan-Notre Dame game for one of the Detroit dailies, a day or two before the game. Kindly note in these columns the comments on the game after the varsity trounced Michigan last Saturday. Any words we might say in praise of our men would be mere repetition. Their actions and the final score speak for them. From what the fellows say who went up to see the game, Michigan men, though somehow downcast, have shown themselves good sports and good losers. Most of the talk about what might have been is done by newspaper writers who failed to make good as prophets. They were-all ready to go around with a wise look on their faces as they remarked to all who would listen: “I told you so.” We slipped one over on them this time. Everybody has probably read the detailed accounts of the scrap. Hence we permit the great game to pass into history with a handshake to the warriors in Gold and Blue. We append herewith the line-up followed by comments of various newspapers and football authorities throughout the country.

When William Joseph and Joseph John Sherer were six years old—Bill ten minutes older, a great-grandfather who had studied painting abroad died and left the twins with paints, easels, and 600 brushes.
This year, after scattering a path of paint through seven schools in Ohio, New Jersey, New York, Indiana, and Connecticut, the two brothers are seniors in the University school of architecture. In the pursuing of this long trail, they undoubtedly have used up a considerable number of the 600 brushes, but they have attained some goals of distinction en
route.
The Brothers Sherer
After four years at Notre Dame, they are “Bill” and “Jack” to campus students, and since entering the school of architecture they have won several national honors. Jack, younger, lighter, and somewhat shorter than his twin, has thrice won first prize in nation-wide problem contests sent out by a prominent group of New York architects. And when Bill won the national contest, his was the only entry submitted that solved the problem.
Coming from West Hartford, Conn., Bill and Jack graduated from Kings-wood Academy. In high school they played on the tennis team.
Experts at design work, they started on this road back in high school when they designed year books, papers, and the official school jacket. In high school they became interested in tracing family coats of arms, and did professional work along this line. They still carry on a large amount of this commercial work, and have one ambition that so far has eluded them: to do the design for one of the annual class dances here—Cotillion, Prom, or Ball.	:
Jack is ait editor of Scrip, the campus, literary publication, and both have put in three years work on design and sketches for the Deme. They also designed the
Dillon Hall Trojan horse that won first place in the Homecoming contest last year, and did the set designs for the South Bend “Bundles for Britain” show. During the past summers they have designed stage sets, working this last summer with the Canton (Conn.; Show Shop.
Identical twins, they share the same likes and have a hobby—oil painting. When they work with oils, they work on the same picture together, both painting at the same time.
Jack and Bill were to enter the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer school under the famous Cedric Gibbons, after graduation. But Pearl Harbor has at least deferred that plan until the war is over. Graduating in May, the brothers are enlisted in the V-7.

Glee Club Scores Hit In First Fall Concert
Before a capacity crowd in Washington Hall, the Notre Dame Glee Club, under the direction of Mr. Daniel H. Pedt-ke, head of the department of music, presented its first concert of the semester last Tuesday night at 8 o’clock.
The club, now totaling over 60 voices, appeared in full dress for the first time since May graduation. The program presented, living up to traditional standards, was well received by the audience. Included in the repertoire were three selections by Notre Dame men: “Irish Backs” by Joe Casasanta, “Alma Mater” by Rev. Eugene Burke, and the “Victory
March” by Father Shea.
Making his debut as soloist for the Glee Club was Owen Donley, baritone, who sang “Border Ballad” and an encore. Also on the solo side for the evening were familiar Bill Scully, baritone, who gave his popular “Tally Ho” by Bullard, and tenor Bill Brady who sang “Thy Beaming Eyes.”
Reggie Flynn, bass from Youngstown, Ohio, is president of the prominent campus organization this year. Other officers are Kevin O’Toole, tenor, vice-president; William Scully, baritone, secretary-treasurer; William Murrin, bass, publicity director; James Treacy, bass, business manager.

Hall Decorations Lag
As Homecoming Arrives
There is a tradition at Notre Dame— a very old and very colorful tradition. It goes something like this: Every year during the football season the Student Council sets aside a week-end commonly
Not so hot!—for a fire.
V
known as “Homecoming.” Throughout the specified week-end the respective halls put on their colors, clever decorations, and bright lights. The hall having the gayest colors, most clever decorations, and the brightest lights will receive a “smoker” as first prize.
Possibly, it is unnecessary to remind students of this tradition, but, at this writing, very little is being done. Walsh hall is ahead of the field having made their collections and, at present, well on their way in planning their design. Dillon and Breen-Phillips are coming to life with notices asking for suggestions and contributions. With the Northwestern game, this year’s “homecoming” weekend, only a few days off, it is high time some of the halls got busy.
Last year Dillon hall’s gigantic Trojan horse copped first honors edging out Morrissey’s “modern design” musicale. Both of these decorations required weeks of planning. If the Centennial Decoration week-end is going to top last year’s, there has to be some action.—Phil Keen

Boys From Buffalo Skate
The Buffalo Club having had their last assembly in October, is planning a meeting for this month. The Club’s chief activity to date this semester has been a roller skating party held a few weeks ago at Playland. Plans are now unfolding toward another such afternoon.
Besides this, this year’s annual Christmas dance to be held in Buffalo is commencing to receive attention from the Club officials: Ed Duquette,- president; Bob Gardner, vice president; John Eag-en, secretary, and Bob Degenhart, treasurer.;—Frank Sierawski

"Success Story" of Notre Dame Written;
Father A. J. Hope, C.S.C., is Book's Author
AL SOMMER
In Notre Dame—One Hundred Years, Y the Rev. A. J. Hope, C.S.C., has written an inspiring success story. It is not the ' story of an Horatio Alger “rags to riches” hero unless you can call a university. a hero. It is not the story of a t< single man overcoming handicaps; rather it is the tale of man after man taking up' where his predecessor left off. It is the story of hundreds of men and one ' university. Father Hope tells of men and events, but there is something the reader will remember long after the names of the men and the dates of the events are forgotten. He will remember a story of courage, love of God, patience, and heartbreak.	'
Father Hope has begun the story with the founding of the Congregation of Holy Cross in France. He takes the reader back to the cold November day when Fr. Sorin and a handful of companions stood in a blistering Mid-west wind and viewed a wilderness from which they were pledged to produce a university. ’ The struggling days on the prairie are vivid; then the heart-rending set back when the Main building and adjacent . structures vanished in fire and smoke.
Father Sorin was then in Canada ready to embark for France. He received . word that Notre Dame, his Notre Dame, - was in ruins. He returned. The sight would have broken a Godless man. Fath! er Sorin knelt down, took up a brick, scraped the mortar away, and began to rebuild. That was 1879.
1 The Holy Cross fathers and Brothers built new buildings, better buildings. The years passed. Notre Dame remained a little Mid-western school, little known beyond the borders of Indiana.
In 1913, Army wanted a little school to _ play to give it a “breather” before Navy marched against it. It decided on Notre — r Dame. Notre Dame was in the headlines! . Notre Dame, 35; Army, 0. From then on the ascent was swift. Rockne, Gipp, and a host of others made the nation Notre Dame conscious. But all the while the j,, silent men were building. New buildings, better education, maintenance of longstanding ideals. The book relates the despair and. the gloom the day newspapers headlined: “Rockne Dies in Air Crash.”
Again disaster, but again the spirit of Notre Dame weathered the storm.
Years of feverish expansion followed. Finally, Father Hope relates to the advent of the Navy and closes the story 100 years from the beginning. Notre Dame—One Hundred Years. When you have read the story, you will know it was a glorious, back-breaking hundred years, ending when Notre Dame is beloved throughout the nation.
The excellent characterizations by Ff. Hope highlight the book. Fathers Sorin, LaGrange, Morrissey, Charles O’Donnell, Nieuwland, Corby, J. W. Cavanaugh, Hudson, the two Walshes—all these are vivid and real. Rockne, Gipp, and other greats of Notre Dame represent the incarnation of Notre Dame ideals and traditions.
Father Hope received his Litt.B. degree from Notre Dame in 1920. Following that he studied in Rome, receiving his Ph.D. and S.T.D. from the Gregorian University there. He is well-known as an organist and all-around musician. He has written several historical studies connected with Notre Dame, among them the characterizations of Fathers Sorin and LaGrange which appeared in the Alumnus.	■
This is the first definitive and documented history of Notre Dame to appear. Fifty years ago a series of reminiscences appeared called Golden Jubilee. Father Hope officially began work on the book in the summer of 1941, but research has been going on for the last seven years. The Rev. Thomas - McAvoy, university archivist, and Mr. J. A. Corbett, professor of history, have done valuable research in the archives in preparation for the book. The old files of the South Bend Tribune and other South Bend “publications were minutely scrutinized by Mr. William Farrell, former professor here, so as to be of. value in presenting a rounded picture of the university.
Notre Dame—One Hundred Years is particularly valuable because it will establish Notre Dame as an important source of contributions to Catholicism in this country. ,	.
The book is tentatively scheduled for publication , by the Ave Maria press in January. According to Mr. James Arm
strong, secretary of the Alumni Association and head of the Department of Publicity the first printing will be limited to 3,000 copies, which will be placed-on sale on the campus.	.
University Proposes New
Industrial Training Course
Adding to the University’s industrial training courses now being offered, the organization of a class in Time and Motion Study exclusively for women was announced this week.
The proposed course, to be taught by C. Robert Egry, associate professor of mechanical engineering here, will be directed toward women already in industry, and particularly married women, who face the prospect of taking men’s jobs in industry as manpower becomes more diverted to the armed forces.
Professor Egry has just returned from the annual fall clinic of the Industrial
Professor Egry . .
Management Society in Chicago where factory managers, ordnance experts, the WPB authorities and educators compared notes. He reported emphasis on the problem of women in industry and the present urgent need for women trained in simplification study. Jobs for women in this field already exceed the number trained by industry.
The course is not one of machineoperating, but follows the already established success of courses in time and motion study which have increased production, cut .down cost and waste, and which, in the case of women in industry, will cut down the problem of fatigue and strain. Increased earning power for the worker has also been a result of the studies and has been a strong factor in recommending the courses to labor generally.	..
Professor Egry says that the time and nature of the specific course or courses will be based on inquiries, which may . be directed to him personally through the College of Engineering.
Chopin Fine Arts Group Offers Exhibit In the Wightman Memorial Galleries
Leary Announces Dates For K. of C. Initiation
The Chopin Fine Arts Club of South Bend, opened an art exhibit in the Wightman Memorial Galleries in the University Library Sunday ; afternoon, Nov. 8. The exhibit was formally opened by Rev. John C. Bednar, C.S.C., of the Notre Dame art department. Assisting Father Bednar was a committee of the Fine Arts club headed by Stanley J. Mezykowski, general chairman of the club.
More than 35 paintings by six contemporary artists, four self-taught and two traditionally taught, will be on display from 2 to 5 p.m. daily, and on Tuesday and Thursday evenings from 7:30 to 9. The exhibit is being held in conjunction with National Art week. Similar exhibitions are being presented throughout the nation at this time.
Father Bednar in his opening address attempted to trace the development and causes of art in the course of centuries for a better understanding of the art of today. The academic type of painter is still present with us, he said, as well as the rebels of a decadent period and the unsophisticated “primitives,” self-taught artists reminiscent of the primitive painters of early ages. The present exhibit was arranged not merely for the enjoyment of the paintings themselves but carefully chosen to illustrate certain phases in the history of art. The pictures on display divided themselves into two helpful groups, the one represented by the talented Makielski brothers with their formal training in art schools, and the other represented by the “primitives” Lebduska, Pieck, Dix, and Koch/ who are self-taught.
Father Bednar also asserted that we all have an nrge to express ourselves but most of us are content with expression in language or music. We are all potential artists, too, painters and sculptors, but few ever have the opportunity to learn what is good painting or good sculpture. Most of us are spoiled by faulty training in the schools devoted to general education as well as by the realistic effects of the camera and . the photographic representations of advertising art. As a result we might wrongly assume that good art is the art which best approaches the miracles of the camera. .	.	.
After finishing his talk Father Bednar conducted the Fine Arts Club members and visitors on a tour of the current exhibit pointing out the application of the theories and principles mentioned in his talk to the works on display.

Brother Borromeo and Fourteen Helpers Control Modern Heating Plant Here
VINCE SCULLY
(Editors Note: The folloiving is the second in a series of articles written by members of the journalism department’s feature writing class for SCHOLASTIC)
Far behind the University Mairi Building and a little to the east stands the University steam plant which heats the 45 buildings on campus. This plant may not be the largest in the vicinity, but no one can claim a cleaner, more modern, or better equipped one.
This building is managed by genial Brother- Borromeo, who with his 14 aides control the furnaces and in their spare time polish and man the University fire engine which is kept in the same building.
Brother Borromeo says that during the cold weather from 75 to 100 tons of coal a day are carried along the conveyor system into the three furnaces used in the winter.
This modern steam plant is automatic throughout and is a marvel of efficiency. You stand in awe as you watch the coal, which is dumped outside the building, being brought in on the conveyor; as it is carried through the basement; up the far side of the building and eventually dropped into an overhead bunker. This bunker extends the length of the building and is directly over your head as you stand on the main floor. It holds 500 tons of coal when filled.
From the bunker the coal is then placed in a hopper, a large cup like device, by the weigh larry. The weigh larry looks like a large funnel and can be swung from one hopper to another filling each as it travels on rails suspended from the ceiling. From the hopper the coal goes directly into the furnace where it converts piped water to steam. The steam is transported by these pipes to the hundreds of radiators in the residence and other halls on cariipus.
Beneath the University sod are nearly two and one-half miles of tunnels. These contain the steam and hot water pipes that run to and from the halls. The tunnels are large enough to walk through and are electrically lighted throughout.

convention also held on the University campus.
Included in the junior academy’s program were general exhibits, and demonstrations presented by members, along with numerous round table discussions and speeches. ,	'
The power plant also heats about 100,000 gallons of water a day that is distributed for use by the University. Besides being heated this water has to be softened. Two large vats are used for this and a car load of salt. Forty ton every three months is necessary to complete this operation.
Brother Borromeo and his 14 co-workers have found time during the past two years to build a large combination pumper, hook and ladder fire apparatus. This bright truck now serves the University campus. These men are quite proud of the machine they “crew” and don’t regret that they do not have more occasion to use it.	-

Famed Capt. Wm. Maguire Addresses Student Body
Captain William A. Maguire, Catholic ' priest and senior chaplain at the San Diego Naval Training Station, to whom for many weeks America attributed the famed phrase “Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition,” addressed the University of Notre Dame students, the United States Naval Reserve Midshipmen’s School, the faculties of the schools and g iests, in the University gymnasium last night.
Captain Maguire, who was at Peari Harbor on last Dec. 7, is a veteran chaplain, author of a popular recent book. He joined the Navy in 1917, saw action at Scapa Flow and was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.
Through Bishop John F. O’Hara, _ C.S.C., Father Maguire has expressly denied authoring the famous song’s words, and the credit has already gone elsewhere as a historical fact. But Captain Maguire has said several times that the words came very close to expressing his sentiments on that fatal day.
And the Notre Dame band and glee club featured the number as part of Thursday night’s appearance.
Father Maguire was at the Notre Dame-Army game in New York and is enroute to his post in San Diego. University authorities prevailed upon him to stop here for an address to the combined Navy-student group. With Father Maguire’s rich background and strong personality it was a highlight of the series of addresses of war personages on the campus.
Glee Club Preparing New Program Feature
The Notre Dame Glee Club, fresh from a program last Tuesday, is scheduled to begin work on a special feature for its December concerts. The new attraction is to be a musical story of Notre Dame, from its founding in 1842 to the present centennial * celebration, organized very much like the club’s popular presentation of last year’s “Song of the Free.”
Those who remember the striking success of “Song of the Free,” which musically told the story of America, will appreciate this attempt of the glee club to put Notre Dame’s history to music. Mr. Daniel H. Pedtke director of the glee club, and head of the department of music will again compose the musical background to the lyrics written by Kelly Cook, editor of this year’s Dome and prominent contributor to the campus literary magazine, Scrip.
In attempting to equal the “Song" of the Free,” the club is undertaking a big job. The former story was written by
Felix Pogliano, editor of Scrip and well known campus writer. Another asset the club then had was actor Jack White, prominent in campus plays and radio, who narrated the story with the background of the glee club and former student Jack Malloy and his orchestra.
Prominent Personages To Attend Game Here
-Two governors and one governor-elect will be in the University presidential box at the Notre Dame-Michigan football battle here tomorrow, it was announced this week by the Rev. Hugh O’Donnell, C.S.C., president of Notre Dame.
Governor and Mrs. Murray Van Wagoner, Governor-elect and Mrs. Harry F. Kelly, Michigan Highway Commissioner and Mrs. Donald Kennedy, comprise the guests from Michigan. Governor Van Wagoner is an alumnus of Michigan, while Governor-elect Kelly is president of the Notre Dame Alumni Association. Governor Schricker, of Indiana, and Mayor Jesse Pavey, of South Bend, will also be present.
The annual fall meeting of the associate board of lay trustees of the University will be held on Friday, Nov. 13, with subsequent probable attendance at the game on Saturday of the members of the board. Present membership includes :
Postmaster General Frank C. Walker; Joseph T. Kennedy, former ambassador to England; William C. Potter and John Moody, New York City banker and * investment authority; Constantine McGuire, Washington economist; Charles T. Fisher, Detroit industrialist; William J. Corbett, Edward J.Doyle and Byron V. Kanaley, Chicago business leaders; Peter C. Reilly, Indianapolis industrialist and Indiana art patron.
Roy McCanna, Burlington, Wis., and Walter Duncan, La Salle, Ill., business men; John P. Murphy, Cleveland; Terence B. Cosgrove, Los Angeles, and Grattan Stanford, New York City, all prominent attorneys; Joseph A. LaFortune, Tulsa oil magnate; John H. Neeson, director of public works of Philadelphia; and the four South Bend trustees, E. M. Morris, banker; Frank E. Hering, editor of the Eagles Magazine; George L. O’Brien, president of the O’Brien Varnish Co., and John J. O’Brien, president of the South Bend Lathe Works.
The Board, charged with the investment of endowment funds of the University, meets each year at Notre Dame in the fall and in the spring. Byron V. Kanaley, Chicago, is president; Peter C. Reilly, Indianapolis, is vice president, while Roy McCanna, Burlington, Wis., is treasurer.
Walsh, Brownson-Carroll
Win Primary Debates
Interhall debate, under the direction of Chairman Bill Talbot, got off to a wrangling start last Tuesday in the Law Building when Walsh met St. Edward’s, Brownson-Carroll challenged Breen-Phillips, and Dillon attacked Zahm.
Lyle Joyce’s three-man negative team from St. Edward’s hall pulled apart the affirmative framework proposed by the Walsh Hall team coached by Joe Rud. The question argued was, “Resolved: that the United Nations should form a permanent union after the war.” The debaters from St. Edward’s were, awarded the decision on the basis of well organize 1 material and good presentation.
A strong, aggressive team from Brownson-Carroll, coached jointly by Jim Newman and John Shannon, took the decision over the freshmen from Breen-Phillips. The latter team is coached by Jack Utz.
In the third scheduled debate of the day, Ted Weber and his Dillon Hall aggregation arrived to take a forfeit from Zahm hall. Rules allow 15 minutes for a team to show up. The men from Zahm were penalized with a loss for their non. appearance.
The next debates will be held in the Law Building basement tonight with the remaining halls competing. The interhall debates are sponsored annually by the Wranglers, campus honorary forensic society. Members of the Wranglers organize, coach and judge all debates and present at the end of the rounds a trophy to the winning team.

Lesson in Naval Leadership
A ship cannot be imagined without organized leadership. It is obvious that the first essential in any military body is an established system of controlling men. We have the benefit of the system of controlling men. We have the benefit of the system as it exists in the Navy. We are backed up by all the machinery of law, regulations, and custom. They help a lot, but such things are only externals—means toward an end. Obedience itself is not the object. It is only a step toward the end—a necessary step, but it should be a demonstration of willingness and not an evidence of compulsion. The end sought is the coordination of individual strength to produce the maximum concentrated effort toward the accomplishment of the object in view.
We shall never be leaders as long as our men are giving only the measure of obedience compelled by law. We shall be leaders only when our men look up to us with confidence, when they are anxious to know our wishes, eager to win our praise and ready to jump at a word from us in the execution of our orders regardless of whether they think them right or wrong.
How is this to be done? How can we arouse this sentiment in the men of this ship? The answer is simple, but the practice is difficult.
BY SETTING THE EXAMPLE. BY PRACTICING WHAT WE PREACH.
A ship, like the navy, is as good as the men in that ship—NO better.
Officers can guide, can influence, can mould men, but whether their efforts are successful depends upon the officers setting the very best example in everything and of PRACTICING WHAT THEY PREACH. There is scarcely anything more infamous, more destructive of discipline and loyalty than the officer whose philosophy of life is based on the principle of “Don’t do as I do, do as I say.”
It is NOT- how much ability an officer HAS, but HOW WELL HE uses what he does have that determines his value to the Navy.	-
A man’s character expresses itself in everything he does.
It is said that “responsibility makes cowards of us all.” How many of us are but too inclined to criticize and hold forth on what we would do were we in so-and-so’s billet. Yet when we actually
do step into his shoes and shoulder the responsibility for the success or failure of operations which seemed so simple from the outside looking in, we find this responsibility so discouraging to our dash and conceit that we only too frequently follow the path of least resistance—excessive caution.
Any fool can criticize. Most fools do.
Don’t nag your men; don’t neglect them; don’t coddle them; don’t play the clown.

IRISH ARE "ALL OUT" FOR SIXTH VICTORY

Bill Boss
With the fathomless employment of a score of. competent backs and a line that has repelled the charge of the finest offensives in the Mid-West Michigan’s enlivened Wolverines will come to Notre Dame Stadium tomorrow spiked with a boiling determination to eclipse the Irish victory of five consecutive triumphs.
Piloted by H. 0. “Fritz” Crisler, whose associations with the Fighting Irish have been few, the Michigan eleven will brandish the bulk of their power in an effort to quell the victory surge of Notre Dame.
For Notre Dame and Michigan this contest marks the renewal of old acquaintances. On desolate Cartier Field with a few interested watchers the Wolverines taught the Irish the rudiments of gridiron play in 1887. It was no more than social courtesy that the Wolverines should tag the Notre Dame eleven hard

1909—With Harry “Red” Miller and the Notre Dame squad flushed with a desire to terminate the Michigan victory string the Irish clan throttled the Michigan attack and won amidst stern reprimands, 11-3.
After 33 years the two teams have erased previous misunderstanding and are fllirting with the idea of renewing one of the strongest gridiron rivalries in America.
The Ohio State-Notre Dame rivalry eclipsed all previous combat sessions on the Irish schedule during the past decade but the surge of student spirit on the campus here at Notre Dame and the
overwhelming clamor that has rage'c' through the minds of Wolverine grid dom during the past weeks make ttiT.| r game a “natural” battle.

Notre Dame, fatigued from last week’s strenuous engagement with the Army, will fortunately be represented by the same group that started Saturday’s fray with the Cadets in Yankee Stadium.
Serious injuries are not frequent on the Irish squad, but the recurrence of old minor injuries are numerous among the Notre Dame defenders.

Sorin, Walsh, Cavanaugh are Victors In the Heavyweight Football League
bill Waddington
Notre Dame’s best intramural heavyweight football league in the past ten years is still going great guns as the climactic point of the season will have been reached when the final gun sounds this Sunday.
Many important games were scheduled this week, acording to the boss, Vince Commisa. The outstanding game of the week was contested Wednesday with Dillon and Walsh fighting it out, both yet have not tasted the bitterness of defeat. The game was too late to get the results in this edition.
Games will be played through the remainder of the week, however, in accordance with the games played Sunday. If postponements occur, they will have to be played during the week in “Brownson Bowl.” Two “ponds” on that field hamper play, but since Cartier Field is in use by the varsity some attempt must be made to play these games elsewhere.
Decided spirit has sparked team play during the season thus far. After the games, the vanquished fail to give in to their superiors, and accountably this denotes the fight that has paced the season. As a result of the renewed enthusiasm Alumni has scheduled a post-season game with Sorin, who have already been victors ovei- the former.
Supervisor Commissa also asks for the cooperation of able-bodied officials. He has been up against it and would like some well informed gridiron enthusiasts to enlist their time and proficiency. Commisa holds forth in 337 Alumni.

Sorin’s running attack met with little ( success in the early moments of the game

but Bob Madden instigated an aerial in “Bertelli-like fashion” to Breskas in the end zone, for a 50-yard touchdown play.
With renewed spirit and a greater incentive to win, the Alumni boys came back into the ball game as Bob Baker took Krewer’s after touchdown kickoff and raced 90 yards through the entire roster of Sorin stalwarts for a touchdown.
Not to be denied their first thrusts at victory, Sorin retaliated with Madden’s . arm, who pitched them to the opponents’ 3. Ed Ryan, powerful halfback, then carried the mail across the line on the first play. The final score, that put assurance into the Sorin picture, came when Krewer took an Alumni fumble as it bobbled in the air and scrambled 35 yards to the end zone diagonals.
The aggressiveness displayed in this game is a good example of the true “Irish spirit” that has marked the greater portion of the battles this season. Although digging in and with plenty of fight, the conquered Alumni-ites shook hands with their senior buddies and trotted toward the showers.
Walsh, 26; Breen-Phillips, 0
Continuing their march toward the league championship, the Walsh heavies humbled another foe by the one-sided score of 26-0, the team on the losing end being Breen-Phillips.
All the essentials necessary for victory were displayed once again by the league leaders as their passing and running attack stood out with equal brilliance, with, of course, the help of the outstanding line of the division.
Yoklavich, Brown, and O’Brien shared honors in the backfield, and were well supported by Metzler, Bowling, Boyle, and Dunne in the line.’ Dunne, a left-footed kicker, kept the frosh well back in their own territory.
For the losers, Hardigan put on a good backfield exhibition while Logan and Callahan did equally well in the line.
Cavanaugh, 7; Dillon, 13
A real thriller, however, was the 13-7 close call that Dillon handed Cavanaugh.
Coach Cuddigan put the victors very
much in the game as he counted in the major part of the scoring. His 35-yard run to the end zone, plus Oppenheimer’s pass to Mahoney, which covered 45 yards to score gave the Dillonites their two scores.
Casey’s aerial to McLaughlin, a 45 yarder in the payoff area, took the blank / away from Cavanaugh.	,
The heart-in-the-mouth sensation came towards the finale as Cavanaugh had possession of the ball on Dillon’s 1. With first and goal to go, it was almost certain victory for the juniors but then the gun sounded, and undoubtedly a few of ' the worried Dillon boys fainted.	_>
Mahoney, Pojman, and Oppenheimer starred for the winners, while Casey, McLaughlin, Kerrigan, and McDonald •were in there pitching for the boys on the wrong end of the score.

Creevy, Murphy Score Defeating Army, 13-0
’Neath blue skies and on solid turf, Notre Dame once again harnessed the Army Mule and sent the spirited Cadets back up the Hudson, a loser. The rugged play of an inspired Irish line spelled out a 13-0 victory, before a thrill-packed stadium crowd of 76,000.
From end to end, the Notre Dame stalwarts hurled back each and every Cadet sally. The Army, too, in the shadow of their goal, time after time held the fort from thrusts by land and air. When the flinging of Bertelli was smothered by the future “looies,” the Irish dealt out a
bone-crushing running attack featuring the brawn of Clatt and Cowhig, and the speed of Dick Creevy, Ashbaugh and Livingstone. For the Army, halfback Anderson, tackle Merrit, and end Kelleher were standouts.
The first half was a succession of fruitless Notre Dame scoring threats. After going all the way overland, the consistent change to the stratosphere near glory dirt, paid off in nothing but standoffs. Army didn’t even see midfield offensively, but just managed to keep the wolf from their .own door.
In the third period Ashbaugh blanketed an Army fumble on their 35, and from that spot “hustle with Russell,” Clatt and .Creevy smashed through to the 15. Creevy, on a quick opening play inside guard, skipped through a frozen Cadet secondary to a big six points. Bertelli split the bars for the conversion.
Captain George Murphy made it a great day for the Irish, when he grabbed the handles of a Bertelli aerial, fresh off the fingertips of two Army safety men. The game ended a few moments later.—Bill Carey
"Touch" too Tough for Varsity Quarterback
Did you ever hear the strange story of the test pilot who day after day safely spun from dizzy heights to establish new records in the stratosphere and then one day broke his neck on a five foot fall from his front porch? A similar case happened here on the campus last week.
George “Mike” Frawley, Walsh Hall junior from Los Angeles, Calif., and reserve quarterback on the varsity football team, has been out there on Cartier Field every day scrimmaging with the toughest of the 1942 squad members. He has never suffered anything more than a mild charley-horse or a slight bruise after an afternoon of blocking men like bfg Lou Rymkus or Wally Ziemba. Nothing on Cartier was too tough, for him to handle.	•
The other day some of his friends urged him to venture onto the famed Badin bog for a light game of touch football. “Touch” is the type of game in which nobody has ever suffered anything more than a slight case of perspiration. But “Mike” Frawley, who had withstood the hard blocking and tackling of the men who play for keeps, hadn’t been on the bog five minutes when he tripped in a gopher hole, twisted his ankle and sprawled. In another five minutes his foot was bigger than the football, and for three days he was limping like a w’ounded marine just off Guadalcanal.
A strenuous game, this touch football.

The big Chicago lad, born Oct. 6, 1919, in Royalton, Ill., has shown more determination and fight this fall than he did in winning the Hering medal for proficiency at tackle play last spring. Upon graduation from Logan Grammar school Lou enrolled at Tilden Tech on the South Side of Chicago. Here he teamed with Ed Cycenas, now playing for Purdue, and Bill Krenske, Cincinnati U. tailback, to set the South Section afire. Lou led the Tildenites into Soldier Field in 1936 to battle a powerful Austin High
team paced by De Correvont, Skor, and Bauman. Lou barged through to block one of master De Correvont’s kicks and fall on the bounding ball in the end zone for six points. This was his greatest thrill in high school football. He also played against Jay Gibson, Irish track star.

Creevy always wanted to come to Notre Dame. In fact he says he almost worshipped the University. He hasn’t as yet won his monogram, but at this writing he needs only a few more minutes to win the coveted monogram.
That last minute pass against Illinois last season, a 45-yard toss to Tom Miller, was Creevy’s top college football thrill. The journalism major, who graduates this December, lists Glenn Miller and T. Dorsey as his bands. A steak dinner

Here are a few of the Creevy opponents: Don Griffin, Illinois; Ray Florck, Illinois; “Tippy” Madrick, Detroit; Norm “Jack” Barry, ex-Notre Dame; Don Hogan, ex-Notre Dame; Chuck Jacoby, Indiana; Bob Wallis, Northwestern; Dick Barwegan, Purdue; Andy Zimny, Indiana; Bob White, Indiana; Steve Juzwik, ex-Notre Dame; Tom Galvin, Purdue; and Stan Kudlacz, Notre Dame. And on that Carmel team were: Brother Tom Creevy, Ziggy Cza-robski, Gene Dwyer, Bob David, all at Notre Dame; and the Purdue touchdown twins, Anoretich and Meakim.
Dick’s greatest thrill in high school was beating St. Leo, 19-0, in his senior year. He was captain of the team that lost to Fenger High in Soldier Field, 13-0, before 90,000 spectators. Dick was a basketball guard, and he held Eddie Riska to one basket when he had to guard the high scoring ex-Notre Dame

Interhall Athletic Leagues Add Three New Sports
The department of interhall athletics this week announced that training sessions are under way for all wrestling, gymnastic, and volleyball enthusiasts. Leagues are to be formed in each sport with regularly scheduled matches.
The wrestling program is planned to run much like the boxing of this summer. Supervised practice is held at 4:15 on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in the light apparatus room of the Rockne Memorial. Finals are expected to be held before Christmas.
Gymnastics will again be introduced to the interhaliers. Several years ago a gym team was included in Notre Dame sports.

Mr. Maxwell, former captain of the gym team and at present an assistant in the department of physical education, will direct the program. Competition will be held throughout the remainder of the fall with a final meet before the Christmas holidays. Medals will be awarded to the winners of all-around, side horse, high horizontal bar, parallel bars, and individual tumbling.
This week also marks the inauguration of interhall volleyball. Matches will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the frosh basketball court at the west end of the field house. Beginning at 7:30 and 8:15 the best out of five games will determine the winners. There is no limit on the number of teams eligible from each hall.
These sorts, three of the most popular* winter indoor pastimes, give every student a chance to get in shape for his next vocation: Working for Uncle Sam.

Yes, that cross-country team of ours is bringing us more fame and glory with every succeeding meet. Especially impressive was their work of a few weeks back when they took the Loyola Invitational at Chicago for the second straight year. Yes, and orchids to you Ollie Hunter, for your great race in that record breaking time.
For all those who always had the desire to take up fencing and become Knights of the Round Table, but felt the equipment was too expensive to buy, .lend me thine ear. Coach Langford has informed us that the student body may now enjoy such sport without the yoke of expensive working utensils. The school will now furnish such equipment. Due to the “War Graduation,” Coach Langford claims that there will be several spots open on the varsity squad for those promising interhall men.
The band is still playing and marching as if possessed; keep it up, boys; you’re looking great—the New Yorkers are still talking about your smooth formations.
The latest news from Tommy Halligan’s Walsh Hall bowling league is that the Little Foxes headed by Capt. G. V. Funk were defeated by 31 pins last Sunday by an All-Star team from Water’s recreation hall. Lany Goebler had a 639 series with a 249 high game.
That Fighting Spirit
When you want to meet a tough bunch of ball players just come out to Brownson field and watch the boys playing tackle on a turf studded with puddles and rather deep holes. This unfortunate condition is the result of lack of playing fields. You see the Navy is putting up their drill hall on a portion of Cartier Field, and the only other field left to play on is the one running parallel with the varsity field. That would distract the varsity, so the only remaining space is a vacant lot which goes under the name of Brownson field. It takes a real love of the game and lots of intestinal fortitude to come out and play with death on such a field as that.
One of the outstanding games of the Notre Dame interhall season, and one which really brought forth the true Notre Dame spirit, was the game between Sorin hall Zephyrs and the Alumni Aces. The highlights of the game were the beautiful passing of Bob Madden and the exceptional running by -Eddy Ryan and Bob Baker. Bob Madden’s passes accounted for the first seven points. Then Baker almost broke Sorin
by returning the kickoff 90 yards to tie the game at half time at seven-all. The Sorinites went on to score another six points in the last half to win 13 to 7. The game was so enlivened that the officials were constantly taking time out to separate the players. According to Vince

Through fine conditioning and steady practicing the Zahm Lightweights have assured themselves at least a playoff in this league. We give the player-of-the-week award to the entire Zahm team for their 57 to 0 defeat of Breen-Phillips.

Tommy Mills Preparing For Interhall Basketball
With the grid upsets becoming history and the Christmas holidays drawing near, basketball is again in the air, so
Tommy Mills has completed the plans for the interhall basketball leagues, and here they are.
Practice for the eagers started Monday with each hall entering two teams,
heavyweight and lightweight squad. The N.R.O.T.C. will also have two squads in the league. Because of the confusion of the war time graduation and the moving from halls at the semester, the league will sponsor games until Christmas, which games will not count on the final standings. The games will merely determine in the minds of the coaches who is
with the Navy men, there aren’t as many tournaments going on this year as in the past. However, the students can look forward to handball and squash tourneys which are being planned for the future. Keep your eyes on the bulletin boards in the “Rock” for future events.

Recently at Spokane, Wash., the St. John Bosco Center, under the direction of the Brothers of Holy Cross was dedicated with appropriate ceremonies by Most Reverend Charles D. White, D.D., Bishop of Spokane.
The Center is a school for orphan boys of the diocese. The principal is Brother Octavius, C.S.C., a graduate of Notre Dame.
The Brothers, too, are established in California since the fall of 1941, consti-uuting the faculty of St. Anthony’s High School at Long Beach.

Notre Dame is well represented in the field of public relations in this war. Word has been received at the University that John E. Dowling, student at Notre Dame from 1931-33, is covering the newsfront with Admiral Nimitz in the Pacific.	•
Dowling is the second known Notre Dame man to be prominent in the public relations field, as Philip R. North, ’39, was previously reported as press relations man with General MacArthur.

The Rockne fieldhouse will be used for the interhall net men every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday nights. There will be four games each night.
Beside the basketball tourney, the annual interhall swim meet will be staged Tuesday and Wednesday, Dec. 8 and 9. The first night the preliminaries take place; then the finals on Dec. 9. Mr. Mills suggested that the men begin getting their sea legs into condition now. It’s a good chance for the students who couldn’t quite make the football or basketball squads to show what they can do. Medals go to the first three place winners besides helping one’s hall to victory.
The list of events is as follows: 150 yd. medley (3 men), 200 yd. free style, 50 yd. free style, diving (low board, 3 optional dives), 100 yd. free style, 50 yd. back stroke, 50 yd. breast stroke, 200 yd. free style relay (4 men).

ND campus studios will broadcast the music of Johnny “Scat” Davis on Sat- ' urday, Nov. 14, with Joe Flynn at the mike. . . . Davis has been in desperate need of a good publicist for the last two years or more. I can see Tomcik, Martina, and Jacobs, campus engineers, frantically adjusting, readjusting, running to and fro with a 150-pound mike as they attempt to reconcile Davis’ blazing trumpet and voice with quality radio reception. The boys did a swell job on the Senior Ball and the Soph Cotillion and are telling us that they’ll do the Junior Prom just as well (Mitchell Ayres’ Orchestra).
Chuckles: Rumor has it that the single r reason why Glenn Miller decided to skip the Junior Prom is because Uncle Sam decided first. Think so?
Best gag in weeks: “Junior” (Red Skelton)—the “I dood it” man of radio — was pawing for trouble when he tripped a football player on the 30-yard stripe and when asked why he did it, ' said that he did it because of the President’s orders—can’t go over “35”!
Comedians, with the exception of popular Red Skelton and Fred Allen, have . , been suffering from the lack of good script writers since the beginning of the _ fall season. . . . Skelton beat Hope to the punch by swiping the latter’s best gagwriter not long ago . . . really showing-up now, too. Jack Benny’s slipping even * more so than Hope, though. . . . Best bet for newest improvements in future comedy scripts will also be found on the J Skelton show—new characters should relieve the popular “Junior” line before it fags itself out. “Deadeye Dick” tried hard—flopped hard. Many would like to see his “Drunk” return—it was plenty popular while.it lasted. Not to be forgotten by any means, is the show which has passed Benny twice on the Crosley poll to snag the yearly comedian’s crown —Fibber McGee and Molly.	„	,

IRISH "ALL OUT"
(Continued from page 17) ny” Clatt, Pete has been heading the Irish running attack during the last few weeks and will continue against the Wolverines.
Dip Evans has been sidelined indefinitely now and will see no action Saturday. Evan’s injury kept him out of action until the Illinois tilt when the great back saw limited service. Tears in his eyes, the Dipper watched his teammates scurry to an even score at Wisconsin in the opener. During the following weeks Evans, without a doubt one of the greatest backs in America today, reclined on the bench, the same sadness marking his sight of the games. It would be a fine gesture on behalf of the Notre Dame team, if they would dedicate tomorrow’s tilt, the most important of the remaining games, to the South Bend boy and really show him that Notre Dame considers him the finest of the lot. Yes, a
Michigan defeat would be a fine present to hand to the Dipper.
It has been rumored that reports from Ann Arbor have declared that Michigan has three things in view for their trip to Notre Dame: (1), beat the Irish; (2), tear down the Irish goal posts, and, (3), take over the Irish campus.
Tch, tch!—haven’t they heard that we are called the Fighting Irish.

fire All-American material. Against the Illini he completely outplayed his nearest foe for the honor, Alex Agase.
At center, Merv. Pregulman, switched from guard, gives promise of being the best Wolverine pivot man since the glory ; days of Chuck Bernard. Fast, aggressive and tough, Pregulman spells only trouble for anybody who gets in his way.
Senior Bob Kolesar is at the other guard. A regular for three years, Kolesar is now combining Medical School with-football. And it hasn’t affected his > playing any. He’s never been better, and, you know, he’s always been good. Watch his downfield blocking and you’ll see something.
Bill Pritula, Michigan’s surprise performer, is at the other tackle from Wis-tert. Third team center last year, has risen to first team tackle with an amazing spurt of hard work and determination. He’s been one of the sturdiest of the "Seven Oak Posts” and he hits hard and often.
Two seniors, Elmer Madar and Phil Sharpe, hold forth at the ends. Madar, a transferred quarterback, is a little fellow, weighing only 170 pounds. But he’s like a stick of greased lightning, he’s so fast. He can catch impossible to catch passes, and he turns opposing end runs right into the waiting arms of Wistert and Ceithaml. Bernie Bierman called him the best man on the field during the r Iowa Seahawk-Michigan fray.
Sharpe, a quiet-spoken boy from England, got his early training on a rugby field, but it hasn’t deterred his progress in the least. He’s a fierce blocker, a good pass - snagger and a hard defensive player.	-
Behind these seven, however, lies a vast valley of practically nothing. The reserves ’ haven’t been too strong, and that alone weakens Michigan’s chances. But that first team—-it’s tops.

To us, there is a thrill of pride in those simple words above. For we have, in fact, been honored as the retail store of this area appointed by the U. S. Navy as official distributors of the new Regulation uniforms for Naval Commissioned Officers under the Navy Plan.
Every Naval Officer will be interested to know that the prime purpose of the Navy Plan is to make uniforms available to him at the lowest prices consistent with the high quality standards demanded by the Navy Department.	‘
To that end we, as official distributors, have willingly agreed to sell the new U. S. Naval- Officers’ Regulation uniforms on a profit basis substantially below our normal profit basis.
Moreover, we have pledged ourselves to render the highest type of service with particular reference to alterations, deliveries and maintenance of complete stocks not only of uniforms, but also of furnishings, caps, braid, insignia and devices.	_
In addition, our sales personnel has been specifically trained to assist Naval Officers in their purchases and to advise with them on all details involving regulation U. S. Navy dress ethics and procedure. We are proud and happy to serve the U. S. Navy!
