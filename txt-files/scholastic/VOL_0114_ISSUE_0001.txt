_The Kodally/Orff concept of ele­

mentary music education originated with a series -of techniques devel­oped in Europe during the early sixties. At the root of these tech­niques is . an -attempt to intensify perception while preparing mind and body coordination for musical ex­pression. Exercises in a Kodally/Orff class include rhythmic speech accom­panied by ·body movem·ent, singing games, hand-clapping, and other forms of musical expression through the primary source of the body. Only when discipline at this primary level is acquired do pupils expand into instrumental niusic, usually played on true-tone bar instruments such as the xylophone or glockenspiel. Drums. and basic-tone instruments are used as well. What is sought is genuine musicality, the instinct behind crea­tive musicianship. The benefits from this liberal program of music edu­cation go beyond the immediately musical, providing foundation train­ing for. activities as diverse as poetry, through rhythmic verse, and physical education, through the in­-creased coordination acquired. By means . of · a literal immersion in music, the method reaches the indi­vidual psychology of the pupil at the common . source . of musical apprecia­
tion and expression. 
The effect of all' this is to make 

music irresistible to the pupil so that his response to music becomes a total one. Not _only does he become more competent musically, but he grows in personal confidenc;_e as well. An elementary musical foundation given early prevents barriers to _musical· expression from arising and paves -the way to greater achieve­

With the pollution problem reach­ing tremendous proportions at the turn of the decade, plus an increase in public awareness of the problem, it has become necessary to develop new .and more efficient measures to combat air and water pollution. One major-problem in this fight has been that the Jawyer and the engineer, instead of combining their energies against polluters, have worked more or less independently. The result has been harmful to effective pollution control. The Department of Civil Engineering and the Notre Dame Law School are very aware of this communications gap and are making an earnest attempt to reduce it. 
Three semesters ago the Depart­ment of Civil Engineering began research in water quality and the effects of foreign material on water. With the maturing of the program, air pollution was brought in as well; thus the study of pollution took on 
a highly technical perspective. How-· ever, after a careful consideration and examination of many facts con­cerning why air and water pollution is so prevalent, it was realized that even a good engineer could not be expected to. look at the problem from a legal point. pf view. Nor could the engineer expect the lawyer to deal with pollution in a legal manner without first taking a great deal of time to study the particular quantitative aspects of a particular pollution case. This serious problem· created the need and brought into existence the program of cooperative efforts between the Civil Engineer­ing Department and the Law School, an attempt to make lawyers reason­ably adept in the field of quantitative pollution study, as well as to bring engineers within the realm of laws governing and involved in pollution control. The program headed by Dr. Donald Linger of the Civil Engineer­ing Department, is twofold, with the 
current semester serving as its start­ing point. 
The initial part o! the program deals with water pollution. It en­ables the second-year law student who has sufficient scientific knowl­edge to take courses on the environ­ment in the College of Engineering. He would thus have a major in law, and a minor in Environmental En­gineering. The same is of course true for the Environmental Engi­neering student, who could work toward a·minor in law with concen­tration on pollution control.· 
The latter section of this coordi­nate effort, dealing with air pollu­tion, is more sophisticated at this time in that it allows the law stu­dent, again with a scientific back­ground, to earn a bona fide master's degree in Environmental Health En­gineering, so named to imply that health is its primary purpose, along with his Juris Doctorate. 
The repercussions of these quali­fied people working to control pollu­tion will be felt for quite some time. The amount of speed with which 
they will be capable of operating could be most beneficial in avoiding unnecessary delays in prosecuting polluters. In the future, this group of individuals could very well re­place Nader's Raiders as pollution fighters, as they would have a larger and more involved understanding not only of the qualitative areas of pollu­tion, but also of the quantitative engineering processes necessary to solving these complex problems. 
To facilitate instruction, intense summer programs are planned for the Environmental Health Engineer­ing candidate. After completion -of the first year in the program, stu­dents will be placed in appropriate air quality control agencies; thus they will gain practical experience in the process of controlling air pollution and hopefully will now contribute to the agency's endeavors. The second summer research pro­gram is _directed at getting the 
E.H.E. student out in the real world of pollution regulation. Among pro­grams under consideration at this time include the development of an effective ordinance for air quality control for a local_ government, as well as the study and cures for pollu­tion from a stationary source, such as a fossil-fuel-fired power plant. After the completion of each indi­vidual summer, the student's activi­ties will be subject to an evaluation by both law and engineering person­nel, who will listen to presentations and will examine the materials com­piled by the student. 
Installment of this program is a monumental step in the fight against pollution, for an individual trained and experienced in Environ­mental Engineering and Law is really capable of dealing with the increasingly difficult problems pre­sented by the increase of industrial and home pollution. Only by com­bining these two fields will the prob­lems be solved effectively. What were once very different and diver­gent areas are now shown to be highly related and dependent upon each other with respect to contami­nation of the atmosphere.

Student Suffrage 
Last July, members of the com­munity of Notre Dame faculty united in an effort to register local voters in hopes of bringing out more sup­port for their candidate, Democrat George McGovern. Over fifty volun­teers worked as registrars in parks, shopping centers, theater lines, rock festivals and concerts. Later they carried the effort into a door-to-door campaign. Their object was to bring out the McGovern vote, but they reg­istered anyone in spite of affiliation. 
Working in conjunction with the Faculty for McGovern people is the Voter Registration on Campus Com­mittee, headed by Floyd Kezele. Ac­cording to Mr. Kezele any student not already registered can decide where he wants to vote but he warns that in some instances they may not be able to register by mail. For as­sistance on this and other questions on registration, Pam Sayad in the Law Building is offering an informa­
tion service. 
At present anyone wishing to reg­
ister to vote in Indiana may do so at 
the Institute for Urban Studies lo­
cated in the Rockne Memorial Build­
ing. Also available at the Urban 
Studies office will be information on 
absentee balloting. September 23 is 
the on-campus deadline. Students 
failing to register by then can still 
be registered through October 10 at -the county courthouse. 
Within the next week the faculty 
and student organizations hope to 
have volunteer registrars on duty in 
every hall and in public places all 
over both campuses. 
Anyone wishing information on 
registration or wishing to offer their 
services can call the office of Urban 
Studies at 1112.

Celluloid Celebration 
In a somewhat frugal and eco­nomic-minded time, -the College of Arts and Letters has .made a pur­chase for which money could not be considered as an obstacle-Kenneth Clark's exceptional Civilization film series. It is a 13-part film series tracing Western man's cultural de­velopment from the birth of a Chris­tian civilization at Charlemagne's coronation to the birth of technology in the 19th century. Each excerpt touches on significant achievements of man at specific times during his ages of growth. The series captures, in a way no history book ever could, the cultural evolution of Western man. 
Written by British historian Lord Kenneth Clark of Saltwood, con­sidered Great Britain's unofficial minister of culture, the series has won a name for itself as "one of the most significant cultural events of the last decade." Produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation, Civilization-A Personal View pre­miered for American audiences in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., where it was attended by thousands. Presentations of the extraordinary film series were also made on public television, under­written by the Xerox Corporation. 
The College of Arts and Letters is now in possession of this film series, and is preparing to offer it for view­ing by faculty and students alike. The 52-minute, full-color presenta­tions will begin on Monday, Septem­ber 18 and will be shown on succes­
' 
sive Mondays and Thursdays at 3:30 in the Engineering Auditorium.

THE SCHOLASTIC 

week in distortion 

MY BACK PAGES ... 
You perhaps remember Father Julius Nieuwland, the inventor of the Science Hall, the man who said, "A gentleman is someone who knows how to play the saxophone but doesn't." 
Yes, you remember. But did you know of the good Padre's literary leanings? From the Winter 1899 SCHOLASTIC we have the following: 
Another year has gone for aye, As a raindrop in the evening gray That falls upon the stream below Is lost forever with its flow Where waves of boundless ocean 
sway. 

Some flowers bloom no second day; But once they glow in the morning ray: So many a heart shall never know Another year. 
Death plucks the rosebud on his way, And lets the wilting blossoms stay To waste their fragrance where they grow. Us too, He fain would take, although The recor.ding angel grants delay Another year. 

THEY SAID IT, WE DIDN'T 
A newspaper writer noted in an article appearing last Friday that "the coming of coeducation prompted some star gazing on the part of the Administration and after prodding many spoke favorably of the future." We can't speak for the Administra­tion, but our own low-level probe did find some "star-gazing" on the east side of Howard Hall. 

MIRACLES OF ~IODERN SCIENCE 
A number of researchers have re­cently emphasized the fact that pow­dered charcoal adsorbs and serves as an antidote for arsenic, strych­nine and kerosene. It has no effect on alcohol, however. 
Ever check out the pepper shakers at Eddy Price's? 

EQUAL RIGHTS FOR HIMICANES 
Meteorologists, perhaps seeking to avoid high pressure (from females), have announced the discovery of the neutercane, a storm occurring at the border of the temperate and tropic zones. A tropical storm (hurricane) forming at this boundary can be transformed into a neutercane by a frontal storm or cold air mass in­vading from the temperate zone. Ever solicitous of aiding our breth­ren in the public information fra­ternity, the staff has compile~ a list of suggested names for neutercanes to correspond to feminine appella­tion assigned hurricanes: Billie, Bobbie, Chris, Jackie, Jamie, Leslie, Marian, Pat, Jean. 
We wonder also if pressure from liberateds could convince weather people to designate the invading air mass as a "himicane" . . . perhaps named Don Juan. 

DRUNKEN DRIVING CAN BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH! 
. The president of Zambia, con­cerned about that nation's rising number of traffic fatalities, recently signed a bill mandating weekend imprisonment for drunken driving. 
By African standards, this isn't too harsh a penalty. In South Africa, people convicted of drunken driving are executed by a firing squad. 
THE POOR l\IAN'S TOILET PAPER 
A South Carolina service-station owner has found a new use for corn cobs: He cleans his customers' wind­shields with them. 
He noted that, when soaked in a cleaner, the cobs are the easiest method of removing auto stains. "It takes a lot of rubbing with a regu­lar rag to get a windshield clean, but you can do it swiftly and easily with a corn cob." 
Farmers have known that for years. 
The Scholastic is pleased to an­naunce the revival of the "Week in Distortion" column, rising from the ashes of pages past. The column will awear as a regular feature, perhaps.

SEASON FORECAST Legend: (H)-Home Game 
+ -Did not play in 1971 -* -Night Game -$$ -National T.V; 

NORTHWESTERN (7-4) (Sept. -23)-Head_ Coach Alex Agase admits, "I'm going to have to temper my optimism with realism. This has got to be a re­building year." You tell 'em, Alex baby. Fact is, any year that you open with Michigan and Notre Dame is going to be pretty tough. The Wµ.dcats lost eleven starters through graduation, including hotshot All-Big Ten quarterback Maurie Daigneau, who's now pitching pineapples for Trinidad of the Caribbean League. The student body must think that they're pretty cool, voting to change the team nickname to the Purple Haze (but the trustees, none of whom are very into Hendrix, vetoed that idea). Phooey on them, too! Agase should recruit more tackles and less intellectuals. · I hope we score a hundred points. PREDICTION: ND 100, NORTHWESTERN 0, 
HENDRIX oo. 
I 

The Fall Season 
PURDUE (3-7) (Sept. 30)-This game should be a good one for all you weirdos that sell your check­out passes to little kids for five bucks a shot. Last year the Irish won when the Purdue punter (now the White Sox center fielder) fumbled in the end zone, giving ND the game and Coach DeMoss a duodenal ulcer. This year the Boilermakers are loaded. They've got Otis ";super Flash" Armstrong, "Ram­blin'" Darryl Stingley and an 800-lb. Bulgarian at right tackle. ND has the same guys from last week and a nearsighted field judge who's scared shitless of home crowds. PREDICTION: ND 8, PURDUE 7 (But only if it 
rains) 

MICHIGAN STATE (6-5) (Oct. 7)-·"I was optimis­tic going into last season," says Duffy Daughtery, the Adlai Stevenson of college football, "but this time I think there is even more cause to be optimistic." Duffy and Ernie Banks should have their own talk show on the fine points of the frontal lobotomy. The old Dump just hasn't been the same since ND beat him out of a second straight national title back in '65 (or was that '66?). The Spartans have Brad "The Stud" Van Pelt at cornerback, some good­looking cheerleaders, and a bunch of nobodies be­hind center. I hope that Brad's gonna wear a face mask for this one. He's gonna need it. This game should be over by halftime or Ara's first Ford com­mercial, whichever comes first. PREDICTION: ND 28, MSU 16 (Guys who drive 
Chevies should be so lucky) 
PITTSBURGH (3-8) (Oct. 14)-In recent years, the 
Panthers have been to ND what Custer was to Sit­
ting Bull. 

PREDICTION: No comment. 
OHIO STATE (6-4) (Oct. 21)-Woody Hayes, the ogre of the Olentagy, almost set a world record for sideline marker .flinging during his Academy Award winning performance at the Michigan game last year. Besides this old geezer raving along the side­lines, the Buckeyes have about twelve All-America fullbacks, a coach for every position and a front line that makes the Minnesota Vikings look like an inter­hall team. They'll probably win the Big Ten title, the Touranment of Roses parade and the Super Bowl. Luckily, they're playing Indiana on this date. 
T.C.U. (6-5) (Oct .. 28)-What does TCU stand for? 
NAVY (3-8) (Nov. 4)-The Middies haven't had a decent team since Jolly Roger "The Dodger" Stau­bach shipped out for Dallas by way of Viet Nam. The NFL sure beats slinging hand grenades but Navy isn't going to beat anyone. Basically, they have the same old junkies who blew last year's 24-23 show­down to Army, the other Eastern power. The best part of this game will be laughing at all the short hairs of the "new Navy." PREDICTION: ND 72, NAVY 6 
MIAMI (Nov. 18)-My schedule doesn't say whether this is Miami of Ohio or Miami of Florida but I hope it's the latter 'cause they're not as good. PREDICTION: ND 27, .MIAMI (O.)· 26 
ND 27, MIAMI (FLA.) 0 
SOUTHERN CAL. (6-4-1) (Dec. 2)-Don't pay any mind to Dan "Tequila Sunrise" Jenkins and those Alkies at Sport Illustrated, this is THE BIG ONE. Ara Parseghian drives his Thunderbird to the Levee. If everything goes our way, we've got a good chance to take 'em. Still, our guys will have a tough time running against the likes of Mike "the Blur" McGirr (6-5, 380), Mike "The Rock" Hawk (6-8, 350) and a hairy junior college transfer who trains solely on bananas. Can the Irish line push holes in this stout 
defense? Can the deep backs contain Edesel Garris­son and Lynn Swann. Will we be able to p&ss effec­tively against USC's tough 4-4-4 stack? I don't kriow; you tell me. I'm tired of writing about sports; I wish a decent album would come out so I could review it. Oh well, see you at the Senior Bar. By the way, whatever happened to James McAllister?

Someone (the rector has no idea who) has taped a sign.to the first bannister post to remind everyone that laundry is to be picked up the next morning. The only appointed official seems to be the mail clerk, sophomore Jim Gresser. At the hall meeting, he explains that he is per­fectly willing to assist by hauling small parcels from the post office and to take outgoing letters when he goes to pick up the hall mail. (The nearest mailbox is on the South Quad.) He stipulates, however, that Old College residents, like those in other dorms, must take 
care of 1!ansporting large packages .the~selves. He 
humorously cites the incident of. having to haul three 
huge· bundles of braille bible for the RA.

LIFE at Old College could be romantic and is poten­tially downright idyllic. The beauty of the Notre Dame campus is especially profuse at Old College, where one finds a rare abundance of the primitive. The ducks (endlessly fascinating to Molly) and fish are closer than residents of other halls. There is the placid lake, the grassy embankment sloping up past the basement to the log· chapel, where Old College residents have their .liturgy. A corner of the· architecture building noses toward the setting, but in no way violates or· im­poses upon the rustic atmosphere. Probably no other spot on campus corresponds so favorably to the phrase "Notre Dame du Lac." 
Freshmen living at Old College are becoming sensi­tive to the fact that their first-year experience at Notre Dame -will be vastly different from the. norm. Like · most freshmen, they admire the upperclassmen, who in turn envy them for their particular good fortune. 
Fr. Flanigan is reminded of.what it is to have an all­freshman dorm, a phenomenon that faded with the ad­vent of the stay-hall. Everyone can gather for popcorn and lemonade and they are content merely with this and their fellowship. As much a resident as rector, he finds that he must, as a rector, draw on his own earlier Notre Dame experience to adapt his role to the novel situation. 
These freshmen will have a chance to grow natu­rally into the ways of _their upperclassmen, without _ being thrust into a residence hall bent on "making them feel at home" at all costs. What will come after this year'.s growing is over, is still unknown. Perhaps next year housing will not be an accordion squeeze and Notre Dame will continue as before, or almost as be­fore. Whenever and wherever they go, the men coming from Old College could be different from their peers, but far closer to what all of them are striving_ to become.

I I 
WOULD 'like to share with all of you a few of the thoughts I have had in the last months. I seek here· not confrontation, for the times are long beyond that; rather I seek to share in my own way a little of what I feel as openly as I possibly can. I invite your response to this letter. I realize that I am open to all types of criticism so I would like to simply say that ­my primary concern for the last three years has been the Indochinese war. I have studied that war and all its many ramifications on sever;µ different levels: sociological, geological, ethical, military, psycho­logical, legal, political, etc. I have worked to aid the victims of that war on both sides by helping to form RAP (Refugee Aid Program) and Student World Con­cern. I have talked with many government officials who first supported that war and now oppose it. I have talked with Vietnam_ese people who have lived with that war and all its horrors. I have workea. with 
.and counseled the real victims of Vietnam: the young who refuse to go and now sit in the prisons of America and the young men who did go and now sit · unemployed, disillusioned, despairing and mangled in many of our cities. I have also worked with other American victims of the war: the poor at home whose very lives reflect the violence that we as a nation export, the imprisoned who are dehumanized in our punish­ment systems and finally the mentally ill, many of whom are the most sensitive among us-good friends, their only problem is that they are unable to under­stand the insanity and contradictions that exist around them. My work with Vietnam Vets and the mentally ill has particularly sensitized me to the dangers that we are creating by the environment that we manufacture around us. 
I would like-to explain why I feel that the fast I am about to undertake is necessary and consistent with my work o_ver the last few years. The war in Vietnam is at its most critical stage and yet attention on it in America is at an all-time low in very many ways. In South Vietnam a state of martial law and mili­tary control exists. Hu~anist efforts by the Buddhists, the students and :rp.ost recently a large number of Catholics working for peace have been totally sup­pressed by secret police, tear gas, suff ocati~n gas, TNT, grenades, burning, prisons and torture. Hundreds of students have disappeared not to be heard from again. Many Buddhists have been killed or_ sent to prison. It is little known within this country that in South Vietnam there is a large non-violent movement that has fought for years to end American involve­ment and American aid to Thieu. The very government that we support is not supported by its own people. Within South Vietnam the people have organized strikes, returned business licenses, the presidents of large universities have resigned, professors and deans have refused to teach ( 40 professors at Hue Univer­sity), there have been massive boycotts of classes and 
-refusals to fight in the war. More publicized. in the US are the acts of individual Buddhists who have been driven to protest through an act of_ supreme ·sacrifice, self-immolation. In the South, members of the clergy, laymen, even young students like myself have made this tragic and painful sacrifice for peace. American people often misunderstand and see self-immolation as an act of violence. To the Vietnamese it is quite the opposite. By accepting extreme suffering, one lights the fires of compassion and thus awakens the hearts of the people, as Jesus did. Two Vietnamese who immolated themselves for peace have especially moved me very deeply: Thich Quang Due, a very peaceful and gentle monk, and Nhat Chi Mai, a very beautiful, young girl student. 
There have also been many other painful sacrifices by these people. I shall mention only one other, the one most often used by Gandhi to communicate with the people-fasting. Thousands of Vietnamese, both as individuals and in groups, have fasted to end the war. To the Vietnamese, fasting is a form of prayer; it is used to purify one's heart and strengthen the will; or on another level it hopefully awakens the latent 
THE SCHOLASTIC 
awareness and compassion of the population. During 1966, the venerable monk, Thich Tri Quang, fasted for 100 days, deeply affecting the people of Vietnam. 
JN December of this year the Congress of the United States will have been appropriating taxpayers' money to wage war on Indochina for 25 years, a quarter of a century. A young American like myself who was born then would finally be able to vote. His parents would have been paying taxes during his entire life to supply napalm and ammunition and to hire Viet­namese troops and other mercenaries. This same tax money has also gone to pay for the huge drug traffic in Southeast Asia run by some of the very generals whom we support. It is certainly a paradox that mil­lions of Americans pay money in order that their sons can be sent halfway around the world to be destroyed by drugs. After having worked with and aided these returning G.I.s there is no way I can begin to explain to anyone the sadness, the hurt, the violence and the anguish that these young men carry with them. Close to 60,000 Americans have lost their lives and God knows how many are POW's, or how many have lost arms or legs or minds ; this is all one standard of what an American will do for his country. There is another one, several hundred young Americans now live in the prisons of this country. They are als·o prisoners of war and there are many thousands more who have been under indictment because they felt it was their duty as responsible human beings to oppose this war. The time is long past when decent people can afford to be silent as the German people were silent during the Second World War. We can no longer ignore the fate of Vietnam. To close our eyes now is to ignore the responsibility of being human. It is to turn our backs on the judgment of history and indeed, of Al-· mighty God. I dare say that we are in the middle of a very dark night. We as a people must claim the right of decency, honesty and humanity to reign over in­justice and genocide. The Vietnamese war has now without any trace of doubt become what we have all 
feared it would: the absolute genocide of an entire 
people's way of life: 
I believe that the use of American technology and Asian mercenaries, the increased. use of American Air Power (the heaviest in history-bombs, missiles, napalm, defoliation, computer warfare) have reached such destructive levels that I can no longer ignore making a total response to this war. We are paying for and allowing another nation to be destroyed while ours is in need. Nixon has scheduled cuts for this year in Human Resources, Public Assistance, Education and Manpower, Health and Veterans' Benefits. 
. . J believe that those who profess to believe in peace must be willing.to risk at least as much as those who make war. The majority of Americans are against, the war. But to voice an opinion involves very little , personal risk; the real danger to persons lies in trying t,o stop the war. If we are not willing to pay as high a price for peace as others pay for war, then our peace­making is a prostitution of the Gospel message of . love. My own particular witness comes out of a Chris-. tian background, and I firmly believe that a Christian .. 
SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 
must be willing to go to the cross for his fellow men. I believe this is the highest act of love and faith. I believe that faith and trust ar~ essential to any act of love and I see our fast as basically an act of faith and hope. I believe in the basic goodness of the Amer­ican people, but I also believe that summer fun cannot exist at the price of the madness of bombs. 
THERE are many who may respond with ridicule or criticism to this fast. I can respect this, but I must respond to it by stating that I can no longer worry about losing face, or job, or future, for when any of these are purchased at the price of the lives of thou­sands of other human beings that future existence is one that I could not live with. I believe that the way of peace, the way of a Christian in America in 1972 must pass through suffering to be reborn again in love and hope and life. I invite others to help us spread 
· life. We have come to an historic moment in which we no longer have choices, we face the crossroads of violence and nonviolence, death and life. Those of us who believe in the possibilities of man working himself 
. out through an incarnate God have chosen the values of truth and justice which are nonviolence and life. We ask others to begin to take their own lives serious­ly. My heart is filled with grief and pain at the absurdity of this war's death and violence. I see my country raining death on another people's culture. 
I ask that men and women everywhere of good,vill and decency and humble respect for the laws of Go4 and man might come forth and join with us in a mighty cry that would help save the land of the Viet­namese from any further destruction at the hands of the powers of death and violence. This fast will only have the power which those involved in it can bring to it as living and loving human beings. We ask for your support, each in his or her own way. We who fast have very little power. We have only our bodies, our spirits, and our desire for justice, peace, and good order among men. I am convinced that the truest act of love comes out of a personal witness for others under­taken in a totally nonviolent struggle for peace and justice. The death of God's children must stop. The way of violent killing violates all that is human and decent and sacred about man. It violates the ·"way of all the earth" that men must learn to live by. Please join with us on our path. w_e believe in another way, the nonviolent way of Jesus, which is the way of truth and of life. Life is sacred; help us to spread life and to end the death.spread everywhere by this war. 
.THE: ~ime has come for all the American people to become fully conscious of their responsibilities to help end this war-now. Ours is a fast for peace, truth, children, decency and for all that is Life and all that is• Yes to Life. Help us with your support and your actions. Come together now to help us end this war. 
In the hope of Peace and Joy,

Joan Didion is a very fine and 
talented writer; whatever else she is 
or is not, this much remains clear. 
In the course of her career she has 
been variously termed, "an embit-. 
tered woman," a "tough-minded 
bitch," and an "ardent feminist." 
Joan Didion has been described by 
one feminist as "the movement's first_ 
great novelist." In one of the pub­
lisher's blurbs on the jacket of P7,ay 
It As It Lays, Gloria Steinem herself 
lauds Joan Didion, saying that "no 
one describes the plastic ironies 
around· us with more clarity." "Us," 
in this context, presumably being th~­
female sex, or, perhaps more pre­
cisely, that portion of .the female 
sex who have indulged themselves in 
Ms. Steinem's particular mode of 
"liberation." Since its publication in 
1970, Play It As It Lays has been 
generally ·. received and overwhelm­
ingly acclaimed as a feminist mani­
festo. And, . of course, Miss Didion 
has . received congruent critical ap­
praisal as a "maker of manifestoes," ·a "long awaited voice," etc., etc. 
Congruent, that is, until July 30, 
1972. For, on that day, there ap­
peared in the New York Times Book 
Review an . essay by Joan Didion 
dealing with the literature of the 
Women's Movement. Surprisingly 
enough, Didion denounced the ma­
jority of this literature as a "clumsy 
torrent of words" that "became a 
principle." She termed an alarming 
renunciation of style as ''unserious." 
In general she condemned the de­
velopment of the Movement for its 
lack ofintellectual substance and its 
graspings ·after arithmetical equal­
ity. And, as is true with most of her 
essays, Joan Didion has a valid 
point .. One gets the impression from 
some of the more active proponents 
of institutionalized feminism; in the 
"egalitarian marriage," for instance, 
a "liberated" couple confronted with 
eleven dirty pots might find the cor­
rect procedure to be to wash five 
each and throw the eleventh out the 
window. Such trivializations of an 
ad~ittedly urgent social and politi­
cal problem do belie a "directionless­
ness" and a lack of appreciation for 
the problem's profundity that is re­
grettable, to say the least. 
Further, it would appear that the constituency of Joan Didion's "us" is a bit different from Gloria Steinem's. To wit: "To those of us who re­mained committed to the exploration of moral distinctions and ambigui­ties, the feminist analysis may have seemed a particularly narrow and cracked determinism." Ethical re­. flection? Moral imagination? Surely such terms must have seemed ir­relevant, to say nothing of counter­revolutionary, to those feminists who have busied themselves calculating just how many meals it is that the

average American woman will cook in her average American lifetime. Didion also examined the current rage for innocence and "gentleness" a la Ellen Peck and concluded, with considerable wit, that "the deroga­tion of assertiveness as 'machismo' has achieved such currency that one imagines several million women too· delicate to deal with a man more overtly sexual than, say, David Cas­sidy." 
The essay prompted the predicta­
ble deluge of letters to the editor, 
most of them righteously indignant, 
outraged, and anything but witty. 
Unfortunately for the Movement, 
they tended, on the whole, to confirm 
Miss Didion's pronouncement that 
the Movement has gone downhill, has 
become, in her words, "a symptom 
rather than a cause." Susan Brown­
miller, for example, summed up her 
objections to these weighty charges with the enlightening proclamation that she, for one, would "take boots and blue jeans over manicured, Mandarin fingernails any day of the week." Nice. .Now, I am not -sure what "Mandarin fingernails" are, or even whether Miss Didion in fact has/wears (?) them; nor do I care. I do know that she is the authoress of · a puzzling novel, Play It As It . Lays, and I do suspect that it may be time for some of us to read it again. 
SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 
Didion's style is taut, reminiscent of Hemingway: 
"Why do you say those things? Why do you fight?" He would sit on the bed and put his head in his hands. "To find out if you're alive." 
Her situations and characters are played off against this style. Maria Wyeth is a Hollywood personality, a sometimes actress and the ex-wife of movie director Carter Lang. The world she inhabits is decadent and ornate-the world of beach homes, cocktail parties, sleeping pills, me­nage a trois, and sundry other ba­roque goodies. Maria suffers under a radical sense of insecurity and is given to frequent periods of depres­sion, which she attempts to re­lieve with high-speed freeway driv­ing. Maria's dress and behavior are as eccentric and self-indulgent as the rest of the characters', if not more so. But, there is one crucial, distin­guishing factor. Maria is compelled to think, is unable to stop thinking, is plagued by her need to consciously examine herself and her surround­ings. Her flights on the freeway are futile efforts at extinguishing this consciousness. Her financial misman­agement, slovenliness, and generally irresponsible conduct are the result 
of being dragged down by the weight of concrete reality. Maria's mind is like the novel. It is even fair to say that in the end the novel becomes Maria's mind. Together, they consti­tute a labyrinth. And Ariadne's thread is nowhere to be found. 
Maria has a sense of livi..ng her deepest life underwater. She is in­capable of kicking free from-·is forced to live in painful recognition of-these "first elements," these un­answered and perhaps unanswerable questions. The same is true, mutatis mutandis, for the novel. There is in fiction an irreducible ambiguity, call it, as Maria does, "the hard white 
_empty core." These recesses, both in the mind and in the fiction, cannot lend themselves to social idealism, feminist or otherwise, because they are hostile to ideology itself. One question, any question, left unan­swered puts the lie to airtight pro­grams for social revolution and makes necessary the painstaking in­tellections which Joan Didion has urged on the Movement. 
Vincent Van Gogh, whom Miss Didion greatly admires, concluded 
· his final letter to his brother, Theo, with this sentence: "You can still choose your side, acting with human­ity, but what's the use?" Right on, indeed.

Notre Dame's 
Currently, the Art Gallery of the University of Notre Dame, located in the south wing of O'Shaughnessy Hall, is showing paintings, prints, and drawings from the permanent collection. The collection, largely the result of gifts, loans, and dedicated personnel of the university commu­nity, has become an integral part of the liber(J)l arts education in the spirit of the philosophy of John Henry Cardinal Newman. 
While the gallery has lesser known holdings, they are works of art with a value and importance that are al­most unattainable on today's art market. Art History has increasingly focused its interest on styles of art that have been neglected hitherto either by time., scholars., opinion., or ignorance. Such works have been of increasing value because of their im­pact on major movements. and art-· ists. Minor artists have always been subject to prirnal evaluation. One 1nay cite the Cleveland Museum of Art's recent show., Caravaggio and His Followers. Indeed, it was the 20th-century art historians who ac­knowledged Caravaggio as a major artist of his time. 
As far back as 1850, when Notre Dame was nestled in its medieval surroundings in the hinterlands of 
THE SCHOLASTIC 
KUnsthaus 
Indiana, an art gallery had emerged through professors, alumni, and others who had donated art works to be shown to the entire commu­nity. This small endeavor, initiated by an interest in the visual arts, gave birth to the present art collection. All of the paintings except one, at­tributed to Van Dyck, were lost in a fire in 1879. This statement sug­gests that nothing of great value or historical significance was lost as such paintings as a Titian and a Raphael appear fo the records as being lost. That the University had acquired a Van Dyck, a Titian, and a-Raphael is quite improbable. 
In 1917, the President of the Uni­versity, Rev. John C. Cavanaugh, pu~chased from the vicar general of Quebec, one Monsignor Marois, a collection of paintings which evi­dently in the course of time, had been obtained from the Braschi Col­_lection _of Rome. While the original Bra:schi · Collection glimmered--with famous artists, the identification of the 1917 ,purchase (74 paintings) was -next to impossible, as over the years verification of· the "master­pieces" had either become unde­pendable, lost, or outright -incorrect. Nevertheless, minor, but not-artisti-

cally inferior painters, such as An­
-drea de Leone, J acopo Vignali, and Francesco Allegrini are some of the few from the Roman collection that form the nucleus of the present col­lection. 
-Though the Braschi purchase was a bit of a disappointment because of a lack of anticipated great artists, it stimulated such a growth for the University collection that between the two wars it took up residence in the library under the name of the • Wightman Memorial Gallery, in honor of a major donor. By 1925 the collection had acquired 240 pieces and had in its service four rooms fo!' showing. Amusingly enough, this mass amount of paintings had listed in the 1934 catalogue such famous artists as Bernini, Caravaggio, Tinto­retto, Peter-Paul Rubens, and Paolo Veronese. With quality objets d'art such as these, the gallery would have ranked among the world's greatest. Why travel to the Uffici or the Louvre when one could go to South Bend? 
The years 1951 and 1952 mark the 
major dates when the collection was -given-its present location. The earlier -year designated when the Fisher Collection of Detroit was given to the University. Among the Italian paintings from the collection are Raffaellino del Garbo, a wonderful 
· portrait of Beatrice d'Este by Barto­leomeo Veneto, Pollaiuolo, the school of Botticelli, and others. The 18th century was also represented-por­traits by French artists Hattier, Tocque, and Oudry; a late, if not fun, romantic composition by Fran­cois Boucher; and works by Romney, Gainsborough, Opre, Schall and others. The wonderful Fisher •gift enabled the collection to be recog­nized as a vital organism of a liberal arts education. 
In response to the growing collec­tion and its importance, a new gal­lery was planned for the new Col­lege of Arts and Letters Building in 1952. The new quarters, which oc­cupied an entire wing of the build­ing, included _a large gallery used primarily for continually changing special exhibitions. Four adjacent galleries in which other minor show­ings and portions of the permanent collection are rotated throughout the year. Concomitant to the new loca­tion, the name was then changed to the Art Gallery of the University-of Notre Dame. 
Slightly before the collection was moved, the University asked Hans and Erica Tietze of Austria to over­see and make recommendations for culling out works of inferior quality. The collection, neglected for some time, had needed expert and schol­arly advice to bring up its qualita­tive standards. Those that did not make the critical analysis were even­tually sold. At that· time, also, the enormous problem of conservation and restoration plagued the main body of the collection. Under the direction of Mr. Alfred Jakstas, con­servator of the Art Institute of Chi­cago, a program was inaugurated for eventual cleaning and restoring. The 
-collection showed signs of indiscrimi­nate overpainting, paint loss, dirt, and improper techniques of restora­tion, not to mention a lack of resto­ration of frames. The program of restoration has not only saved the loss of invaluable works, but has helped bring to life many works hid­den by neglect. 
In the years since World War II, the collection has had many signifi­cant donations. The Samuel K. Kress Foundation Study Collection has added an impressive dimension of quality to the collection. Included in its gift are an excellent Crucifixion attributed to the Master of the Fab­riano Altarpiece, works by Taddeo di Bartolo, and Gualtiere di Giovanni, all of which extended the Univer­sity's collection into the Trecento for the first time. It must be mentioned that the Foundation also donated the first marble from the Renaissance, a Madonna luctans, by Giovanni An­tonio Amadeo. 


The present collection is weighted toward the Italian periods from the Trecento to the 18th century and in the 17th and 18th · centuries of French, Flemish, and English paint­ing. Quite notable in this group is Jacob Van Ruisdael's Watermill. Augmenting the Fisher Collection are a number of Baroque portraits, including excellent works by Raves­teyn, Merevelt, Luttichuys, Lely and several others. · The 19th century brings forth a large sketch by Con­stable and an interesting group of American painters: Eakins, Inness, Scott, Carducius Lean, Beckwith and Blakelock. 
Three Americans who have worked in the late 19th and early 20th cen­turies that fit suitably into the collec­tion are William M. Chase, Edward 
H. Potthast, and John Singer Sar­gent. 
The 20th-century section of the collection has grown in size due mainly to the generous donations of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Randall Shapiro of Chicago and Mr. G. David Thomp­son. It is from these collectors that the Gallery now has paintings repre­senting such artists as Gottlieb, Karl Appel, Alfred Jensen, James Brooks, and watercolors by Hechel, Nolde and Pechatein. Without these initial donors the collection would probably not have gained access to such works· by Ben Nicholson, Joseph Cornell, Pierre Bonnard, Paul Modersohn­Becker, or Marsden Hartley. And, even more important to mention is the large Marc Chagall, Le Grand Cirque, the interesting Picasso from the 1930's, Le Miror and a significant Leger, Le Coquillage Rouge-all de­lightful paintings on an extended · 
Joan from the Stern Foundation of New York. 
In the field of sculpture, two pieces that one is especially attracted to are the Rodin, B1.1,rgher of Calais, Jacques de Wisant, and the Quatrocento terra cotta head of Christ. Along with these fine pieces and others is the growing collection of primitive sculp­ture in memory of Dr. Thomas Dooley. The collection of prints and drawings, so important to the study of Art History as well as excellent pie~es of art in their own right, in­cludes such names as Tiepolo, Claude, Callot, Flaxman, Millet, Cezanne, Marquet, Roualt, Klimt, Max Weber and others. 
This article has been intended to spur an interest in the visual arts, particularly the Art Gallery's per.­manent collection. One must a,e­knowledge that the University is quite fortunate to have such a fine art collection. While the advantages to this facility might not be readily seen, one can only see and feel im­mediately upon entering the glass doors of the gallery that magic, in the form of artistic creation, is alive and living at Notre Dame.

The American Dream: 


A Gothic Idyll 
In being compared to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, as has been the case in the national press, David Ackles's American Gothic loses much just praise. The lush melodies and precise lyrics of this solo album are blended skillfully to form a lavish and potent musical liqueur. 
The album defies classification. It is neither rock nor country nor any synthesis thereof. It is cer­tainly American, though. Strains of Aaron Copland, Gilbert & Sullivan, Kurt Weill, George Gershwin and American folk music can be found. The lyrics range from soft words of love to terse bits of philosophy and sharply pointed satire. The master­ful commixing forms a vision of America with neither pessimism nor optimism. It is not an America of David Ackles's dreams or night­mares. It is America as it is. 
American Gothic achieves the highest degree of sentiment without overstepping into sentimentality and a most effective satire without suc­cumbing to condescension and vindic­tiveness. These are attained not through lyrics alone, but through a mixture of lyrics and music. "Love's Enough" is the best and truest love song I've heard since Paul Simon's "Kathy's Song." It is moving in its 
SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 
simplicity. And this simplicity is its 
beauty. 
"Montana Song" achieves another sentiment, perhaps more difficult to pin down and understand. It is that feeling for personal roots which shows itself so often in our culture. However, it's not quite so simple. The music is symphonic, much like a Copland composition. The lyrics are a soliloquy of a man in quest of his past: 
I went out to Montana 
With a Bible on my arm 
Looking for my fathers 
On a long-abandoned farm. 
And I found what I came looking 
for. 
This piece is the most awesome of the album. The ten-minute length, the full orchestration, and the emo­tion expressed show a great deal of ambition accomplished. 
Probably the most effective satire in the album is "Oh! California": 
Where the road to tomorrow 
Is a dead end doubt 
If you can't find the route. 
_We'll be happy 
Until the sun goes out. 
The melody is as sharp as the lyrics, 
and Ackl~s recorded the cut slightly 
off-speed which adds to the effect. 
The title cut is a narrative with a 
Gershwin, show-tune melody. The 
tale is of a marriage gone bad and 
David Ackles uses it to draw a con­
clusion: 
They suffer least 
Who suffer what they choose. 
Sgt. Pepper reflected the emotions of western youth in the mid-sixties. David Ackles has achieved a thorough portrait of the hopes and fears and iongings of the America of the seventies. American Gothic appears to hold some reflection apro­pos to every individual American. It is grand to recognize feelings so en­chanted as this unusual brew would have them appear. That is David Ackles's great achievement in Amer­ican Gothic. The embellishment of common beliefs and desires. 
The feelings left by the album may lend themselves to satisfied laughter or longing melancholy, but their truth is apparent. American Gothic is a strong potion spiced with sweet melancholy. Its effects are a pleasant intoxication with no hangovers or comedowns and a dulcet innuendo.

A conversation the other day with an acquaintance from the English Department prompted some hours of thought about the teaching of literature. Critics of the humanities often question the value of such attempts, and, after the conversation, it occurred to me that a teacher of literature must also question what he does. He must at least convince himself that what he does has value. 
It would seem that a writer must convince himself similarly. But, to talk about the role and responsibili­ties of a writer is, for one engaged in such an endeavor, a terribly difficult thing to do without sounding preten­tious and inflated. Perhaps, though, the writer must take this risk in order to share such thoughts with his readers. 
The role of the SCHOLASTIC is different from that of the Observer. The magazine's goal is not to provide comprehensive "news coverage." Because of its format, and, more importantly, because of the personalities engaged in its production, the magazine has more of a responsibility to provide an in-depth look into the issues affecting our lives as students. The magazine writer must look into the implications of events, not merely report them as they happen. 
This line of reasoning leads to some complicated problems with the questions of objectivity and subjec­tivity in news writing. If one's goal is comprehensive news coverage, he docs, in fact, have a responsibility to be objective, to be as uninterpretative of events as possible. On the other hand, a writer with a more ana­lytical bent cannot avoid reaching conclusions and interpreting the events that he writes about. But, after presenting data, he is obligated to share with his read­er the reasoning which has led him to his particular conclusion. He must form a "responsible bias" and share this bias with the reader along with the reasons for his position. 
Obviously, when one attempts such a treatment of issues, he cannot hope to discuss all topics. Another problem of subjectivity, and another instance where the writer must form and share a "responsible bias." He is forced to be selective in what he chooses to write about: he must discuss those things he personally feels most important to illuminate. The SCHOLASTIC will con­tinue to be a "biased" magazine; and it will continue to be reflective, because that is what is necessary to be "responsibly biased." 
The SCHOLASTIC will be a critical magazine when it discusses topics we feel warrant criticism. It will be laudatory when looking at situations we feel deserve praise. The arts will receive more coverage than sports, because we honestly feel the arts should be more im­portant in student life than sports. '\Ve will always try to form a "responsible bias" and to share with the reader our reasons for that bias. And we will always be open to criticism.
