On the first page of his novel In the Beginning, Chaim.Potok has several different people quote the same adageto the book's protagonist, David Lurie. The saying goes, ,"~11 beginnings· are hard, especially , _ ones you make yourself.''. When I read this proverb during the summer, I paused brjefly. Upon-further · consider.atioq, h~wever, I quickly _ releg&~dit to my storehouse of. "nice" sayings and forgot it.. Now I find .that· this adage can be aptly applied to Scholastic this year. 
., ~ach n~w year an<i _ea_ch ne:w " editor is a beginning for Scholastic. New directions are explored, directions which are re~ections of the ·.editor's-perscin'ality. This ._new 
infusion is carried so far that-previous volumes:of,the inagazirie are never referred to by year, but rather by the editor's name. Naming the year is amuch more concise _· ·. indicator of the \roliime's quality and tone than a date. And so when I took the job of editor, Tknew ~hat the magazine would·be a reflection 


Prelude 

ofthe direcUon and effort'rput into •. the editor's l>ri~fly yet e~pertlyout~ it. I set my goals/I determined niy _; •· Hned the phi~osophy, purpose and . motivations. Both·came·:from inside:;, place of Scholastic.,• The ideas.· 
Scholastic is totally subsidized 
by Notre Dame. Our funds' come. 
indirectly from a general University 
fund, though the mechanics of how 
the money snakes from tuition . 
fees to our coffers are known 
totally by only a few. Through this 
monetary leash, the magazine is 
subtly controlled and guided .by 
the University. We are never · 
censored and we are never_ instructed 
what to print. However, the sta­
bility and size of our budget are 
subject to review by a few 
administrators. The new impetus
that I feef is ·coming from these 

people and it is demanding that :-, . S_cholastic change an~ _prove. H,self 
as ,a . magazi11e .. 
The idea of justifying the existence of Scholastic immediately enrages me. After 108 years of publication, its purpose should be self~evident. . But if someone stillWanted to kno~ our philosophy and purpose, I would send them to the April 13, 1973, issue of Scholastic. In this issue: ' ' 

me. Now I find that an entirely 
new impetus has arisen 'and is 
forcing me to push the magazine 
far beyond what I originally' had · imagined. 
delineated in that magazine are as valid today as they ·were then arid had been for years. Scholastic .. 

. should not haye to tell people why it exists. 
by John Phelan 
But the.pressures on the_maga­zine still exist. They have become an ultimatum .that states, "Prove yourself or die." And this is exactly what .Scholastic must do this year. If must show that our goals· are achievable. Our: claim. has been · made and we are being forced to 
realize it; · · · ­
To achieve this realization,. Scholastic must make a totally new start. The usual avenues the maga­zine traveled will have to be for­

' saken in favor of newer, more vital; yet more treacherous paths. Our ap­pearance, our style, our organization, our every detail will be carefully re-examined. Innovati6n{' must b_e sought, originality must be.-· engendered, vitality must be in_stilled. 
Scholastic w:m not roll over and -­die. 'Ihe magazine's back is -up against the wall, but it is our firrn intention to push Scholastic -away from that wall. And this brings me back to Potok's proverb on be-. . 

--ginnings. Certainly Sc1wlastic must make a beginning thisLyear, but ,the · exact direction must be: found. This direction can only come from within the magazine.· I am very _­rapidly discovering what a. difficult task this beginning is. · · ·

·usual dorm decor and Voice of Amer­ica T-shirts compete with books_tore . originals. But people are not so easily , ar­
·. ranged. Feelings .of uncertainty· per­vade' the excitement of seeing old friends as the returning . travelers realize that being in South Bend is 'more than just another weekend ex­cursion.· . . . ,

tage of knowing where the_ buildings are located, the returning students face a time-of readjustment and re­acquaintance. For some :this mearis attempting a delicate balance _be­tween the old and the new. 
. It .is inevitable that the foreign studies groups should become close after sharing a .year of both dis­couragement and excitement. For some this closeness has led to a re'­definition of their sense of belonging at Notre Dame. Still, as some Angers students describe it, there is a fear of being known as "Angers queer" ( defined vaguely as speaking French in the dining hall and hugging each other in the streets). 
by Kathleen McElroy 
There is a certain defensiveness felt. by many who are hesitant as to 

'. h'ow they will.reiate their.experience to 'their friends from freshman year and what reaction they will rrieet. A 
. consciousness' of the solidification of friendships which took place in their absence leaves some uncomfortable \_Vith __ both their ·soci'.11 and personal roles. 
·As one student puts it, «Every­thing each person says and does is to some extent built on last year, but I feel self-conscious since the transi­tion I went through away from Notre Dame appears distinctive when men­tioned in discussions among friends." Most are looking for a resolution of this mild paranoia of seeming pre­tentious or removed, without neces­sarily compromising the security and confidence earned from the past year. 


Academic pressures definitely were not our first concern. Traveling, sur­viving the day without feeling home­sick, getting along with the people, speaking the 7,anguage or even just waiting for a letter took priority over studying. It was my easiest year academically, but ifwas the hardest thing I've ever done. 
Over the years, the foreign studies programs have acquired a reputation as an easy 'way to raise the GPA or a year away from the competitive atmosphere,, of the normal college , curriculum. It is, however, a classic case of not allowing studies to inter­
fere with orie's education. 
Because many of the classes are taught in a foreign language and division is according to language ability, students often study courses abroad on a lower level than that to which they are accustomed. Archi­tecture and art students are involved in a program . catered toward their. proposed field of study, but others are enrolled in courses unrelated to their major. From the biology major trying to prove it can be done in four years to the psychology major re­turning as a junior never having had a psychology course, each. faces the frustrations of re-entering an aca­derrlic environment with new d'e­mands and expectations. . 
We would walk past the American 
Express building and be embarrassed by the tourists who .were charac­,teristically l,oud and a bit rude. They didn't seem to realize thatt;hey were .guests in acountry, and they expected 


everyone to speak English. Even in the streets and in the stores you could pick them· out. Still we main­tained a pride as Americans and an appreciation for what we left behind. 

Spending a year in a foreign coun­try afforded the students the oppor­tunity to re-examine their self-image as Americans. Many found justifica­tion for the harsh impressions Euro­peans form of Americans, but were quick to defend the greater legiti­macy of their home political system. 
The presumption that all Ameri­
cans are rich and wasteful was an · attitude ·encountered· by the visiting 'students. Placed in such a situation 
the choice arises. of either accepting the · challenge . to be an envoy of American goodwill or approaching the land and its people with .a non­committal smugness. · , · · · · 
Those best accepted.. in • their , host countries were those with-:programs geared tow~rd the. language'. •Al­though actual contact with the coun­try's people varied among ·the pro­grams, most came to appreciate ,an

Freshman Year: Protection or -Restriction? f 
The Freshman Year of Studies Program at Notre Dame is one of a small,. but increasing number of university programs across the country designed ex-. elusively for freshmen. In most universities, freshmen register and take courses with upperclassmen, filling their schedules from a list of standard, general educa­tion requirements. A Notre Dame freshman registers with the Freshman Year of Studies, which is, in effect, a separate college within the University designed to fulfill his unique needs. Is Notre Dame pioneering, in education or is it being unnecessarily protective? 
"I don't need a program like this. It's too restrictive," one freshman noted. "I know what I want to do and how I want to do it. I don't see why I can't go right into the department I want." 
"I came here because of the freshman program!" another declared. "I think it's great. They told me everything I need· to take for my major, and they even arranged for me to take another elective. I never would have known what to do if I were on my own." 
A senior believes that freshmen need the program, whether they think they do or not. "At first, I figured that I didn't need .any special treatment. I wanted to be as much like the upperclassmen as possible. But I started flunking out of all my major intent courses. Tutoring? 'fl:ley gave it to me. Interest tests and pro-_ files? I got those to~ven a shoulder of a live, caring, ­

human being to -cry_ on.· All I had to do was to yell for help." · · 
Dr. Emil T. Hofman, dean of the Freshman Year of Studies Program, believes that the program is essential. "The ·freshman year program exists for those who need it,'' he stated. "Some students are sophisticated enough that they don't need the services which· Freshman Year can provide., But the program 
· is designed with a _variety -of options so that those who have specific. plans may accomplish them and so that those who nee<I°more direction can receive it." 
Every Notre Dame freshman has a record of ac­complishment and· success. Many never had to study before to earn top grades. Those who did study probably received a lot -of encouragement or even de­mands from their parents to do so. Therefore, few Notre Dame freshmen have much experience in choos­ing to study. Besides specific subject material to learn, many of them need to learn how to learn. 
These -high achievers have probably never experi­enced failure either. Since many freshmen are un­decided about their majors, an element of risk is im­plicit in their entrance to the University. A freshman may decide to enter the pre-med program and.find out, after he has committed himself, that his abilities and ' interests are nof in science. Failure can be a crippling _· expe~ience., and-there is no reason that any extremely

It presents itself as one of the most unique challenges . a coach can meet anywhere, and there is a good chance Parseghian·will take on this challenge once again next summer. __ _ 
If he does take on the All-Star job again, Parseghian will prepare _the team better than this year because · of his experience. Perhaps the offense will be more daring, perhaps the de­fense will be -more solid, but the team will be better because of his . experience in the past July's game. Taking the job again will mean that Ara will not coach in the pros for yet another season. · That is a three­year layoff from coaching. Certainly no one will forget about-Parseghian and that he would be available, but as each :season passes, it becomes less likely that his familiar face will be seen on the field again in a per~

manent coaching role. 
Parseghian has .unbounded talent not only as a coach, but as Tom Pagna puts it, "as a molder of men." To step into pro coaching would be different, as he would be primarily an organizer and planner, but -less of a coach and "molder." Pro players don't need to be told about the fundamentals of blocking (at least most don't) .or need· help in becom­ing men. That's done at the college level. 
To step into pro coaching will mean that he would be entering a position where a win-at-all-costs atti­tude will.be the rule. In many cases, coaches are fired· in the midst of a: rebuilding program. · They didn't rebuild fast·-·-enough. Parseghian could get caught in a situation like that; but in any event, the whole idea · of adopting · such a 'different attitude seems foreign to a man like Parseghian: • In the final analysis, it comes down to what he would have to gain by re-entering· the football world. 

The only apparent gain is a chance to meet and conquer chal­lenges. Parseghian will be at a dis­advantage since he went out as a winner. Anything other than winning will be _considered a: step down. Parseghian will also have his health to consider; his health was one of his reasons for leaving Notre Dame. 
If he does not re-enter coaching, he can retain his close relationship with the University and the com­munity. He also could retain his spotless reputation as well as a reputation of being a winner at one of the toughest coaching jobs in the country. 
In the end it seems that Parseghian will not return to coaching, at least not on a full-time basis. There is still time until the final decision will be in and many things ·could occur that would have a bearing on a_ de­cision to return to coaching; For now, though, all indications point to one inescapable conclusion: Par­seghian will not return to coaching.

Dying 

to Get 


by Laura T. Tolosko 

I remember musing last spring how idealit would be if I could be employed this summerin tranquil surroundings, unhampered by an­tagonistic customers, fluorescent lights andall that rilendicanfstu­dents must endure for three months to survive through No.tre Dame. As it happened, I was to find myself. · among the most cooperative, even­tempered clientele that one could hope for, although admittedly I did become involved in a multitude of grave situations. The plot begins last May, whenI made my way to ·. Mrs. McCauslin's office to inquire about the 'summer work-study pro­gram here. After mulling over a few options then remaining, she left · her office and headed for what I later learned was the office of : Brother. Kieran Ryan in Business Affairs. Ten minutes later she .. returned, . obviously . delighted. with the prospects. . 
·"Laura, how would you like. to .spend your summer in the . cem~tery?" . 


.What a marvelous sense of humor, I thought. Surely this was a euphemism for the archives, or per­haps a reference to the occasionally unappetizing fare in the dining halls. 
"Why don't you stop up and talk with him yourself? He can fill you in with the details." 
She's serious-certainly the University hasn't come to this in dealing with the unemployment problem! So I ascended the stairs of the Administration Building, .wonder. ing for whom the bell was tolling, and prepared to meet my boss. 
I was put at rest in Brother Kieran's office as he explained that in fact a census was being taken of Cedar Grove Cemetery on Notre Dame Avenue, and that, if I wished, I could spend 40 hours each week compiling a sort of Who's Who in the Graveyard. Realizing that here was a task: too novel to pass over, . I agreed to the undertaking (as it were). · · 
I -should make it clear at this 
point that even as a philosophy and 
theology major, I have no clair-. 
voyant powers to speak of.. (I can, · however, walk on water during 
certain times of the year.) X-ray . 
cameras, spades, stethoscopes were 
not provided. Rather, the stones had 
to suffice as. evidence, and I. relied 
on a clipboard, a yardstkk and a 
pair of overalls which themselves 
now look as though they've bitten 
the dust.. 
The project entailed . measuring each lot and then · accounting for 

. what it contained. There were usually about four markers of various types, since the average lot was 12 feet across and could ac­commodate that many caskets three feet in width. However, there were many variables to this formula. For instance, before about 1928, people were usually buried there in pine boxes, which were somewhat thinner than the bulkier, more ornate caskets of recent years. Since then, ·the Indiana Department of Health has made it mandatory that each . casket be covered with a cement vault as well. (On amore personal note, I consider the entire funeral business something of a racket, and would hope th.at when I'm six feet under I'd be more quickly recycled.) The next step in the survey in­volved attending to the information on the stones themselves..Names and dates were most often provided, but some monuments revealed the occu­pant's position in the family­"father," "daughter," "uncle.'.'. A few even bear informative epitaphs, which tell of veterans from the Civil and Spanish American Wars, of mothers who. died in chHdbirth; of · immigrants from Serbia an.d Ireland. . This data would then be prepared . for a cross-reference file by lotand by family -name. ·

Certainly the cemetery is as-. familiar as any other scene in the campus layout. In the past four years I've taken notice of it seldom, but now that lkn6w-many of its inhabitants by name;-it begins to come.alive for me. _For example, if ym1've · wondered who owns and operates the cemetery, you'd be correct to· guess Notre Dame. And itwas begun by none other than Fr. Sorin, as a·· means of supporting the young university and serving the congregation: The oldest legible stones are _dated in the 1850's;·and ·· overtime the graveyard has ... acquired the relics of some rather .. 

-prominent figures,: like those· of . Alexis Coquillard, the "founder" of South Bend. Where Alexis was .. buried, a chapel (still standing but used _now only occasionally) was . constructed in 1860. The large shaft in the foreground of. the cemetery bearing the Coquillard name belongs to his son, one of the first Domers, who was buried there in 1890. Since dead meri and women tell no tales, I iooked for his obituary, which is on file in Notre Dame's extensive .. microfilm library. Alex U was no slouch, ,it' seems,· arid was ushered out in grand style. Somewhere under that massive stone is what remains_ 
of a cedar box, gold-trimmed and lined with copper. Father Walsh himself gave the funeral sermon, 
· with Fr. Sorin presiding at the funeral. Cedar Grove is not the burial 
place of George Gipp, or Rockne, .nor even the C.S.C.'s, who have their own cemetery on the road ti> 
Saint Mary's. But among the per­sons burie~I:on ~otre Dame Avenue,. there are nevertheless some with legends to rival even that of the Gipper. Fr. Louis Neyron, for example, interred under the chapel with Alexis, came to the University 
. boasting that he'd been Napoleon's personal· physician. However, a little calculation renders his claim suspect: he would have been only twelve at the time Napoleon died! 
· A walk through the grounds tells .· us much about the history of the 
'South Bend area. Along the periphery of th_e golf course is a large grassy mound, c'rowned with a rock; its inscJ_iption divulges that in 1928 tl~e remains of some Potawatomi Indians were transferred there from the Indian ourial place · situated where St. Joe High School. now stands: _Throughout the . cemetery are stones on which epitaphs are written in Croatian, Hungarian, Polish and Italian. There is even a weighty tribute to an -otherwise unidentified "mother." . This immense boulder is visible from Notre Dame Avenue. I couldn't help wondering if she would need · some assistance at the 
· hourof the final judgment. 
Even less revealing are the . older tombstones too weatheredwith age to be read. Those inscriptions that I could not decipher with my fingers had to be relegated to the unknown. There are hundreds of iilegible iron crosses as well, once black but 
now rusted. . . . It is becoming. more and more the case that when a burial takes place at Cedar Grove on an appar­ently vacant space, an unmarked grave is unearthed. (It is for this reason that a new addition is under way, · which will be ready in a . short time.) .It was those hidden graves that I wondered most about, containing the remains of people who . struggled, failed, achieved; 
loved and whose descendants haven't a clue as to where they lie. 
I was often asked if I wasn't afraid, wandering as I did among the graves. And I had to answer ... yes, at times I doubted that I would ever leave the grounds. It was not the presence of poltergeists or of other spirits that caused this fear and trembling, but rather those badly placed shots from the 16th hole of the adjoining golf course. In any event, I wasn't exactly alone out there. In addition to the friends and relatives that came to care for the plots, the groundsmen, and Phil, the caretaker (he calls the cemetery his "ranch"), there was at least one badger and a large population . of birds, rabbits and mischievous squirrels. (I had oc­casion to dodge not a few sizeable chestnuts that I believe were hurled in my direction.) Perhaps the highlight of the summer was when I accompanied a professor of mine to help him choose a place under the shadow of the Dome. (I've since had to repress the urge to go · info real estate.) 
Now•although the· project did . have its low spots, it was rather nice to have so many people under · 
me. (Pun courtesy. of .Ralph •. Mcinerney.)'

As an_other college football :season begins,. ABC is ready ,with its sound trucks, its-college reporters and its blimp t_o bring the agony of defeat to millions of homes from stadiums across the country. Texas, Alaba~a, Oklahoma, :, Southern Cal and, . of course, Notre Daine are the staple teams with which the network of the Olympics hopes to lure countless_ fans away from other daytime pro­gramming to watch college -football. 
College football is costly to ABC, very costly. This year they are pay­ing $18 million for the entire pack­age with the fee for national tele­vision . games . up to ·an incredible $501,538 per game. · Regional tele­casts are. $380,000 per game. Con­firmed football freaks will see 13 games nationally and 28 other games regionally. · · 
Some of the good · contests will be Texas-Oklahoma, _Nebraska-Okla­homa,-Alabama~Notre Dame, Texas­Arkansas and Notre Dame-Southern Cal. Adding to that the opening Pitts­burgh game Sept. 11 and perhaps a bowl game in January, Notre.Dame managers will be using a lot of polish ori football helmets for all of the television exposure. That also means a lot of money for the athletic cof­
fers.·· · -The only differences in this season of football watching is that the dis­

--tinguished coaches in the broadcast booth will be eliminated slightly. ABC will ·use several coaches, but 
by Burt Bmnner and Thomas Kruczek 
. . ' . ' 

not . in the great numbers that they 
were in past years. Ara Parseghian 
will be one of the coaches used. How­
ever, we wilL not be able to catch 
the guttural , nonsense fr~m 'Bear 
Bryant's mouth, ·as he is not slated 
to appear. Bud Wilkinson will be 
there occasionally and Bill Fleming 
and Jim Lampley will continue to 
provide in~deptli . analysis . of .the 
cheerleaders from the sidelines. 
But when, the·· sideline producer 

does, signal the O.K for kickoff. at 
3:20 p;m., will the Irish team be as ready for the game as the ABC technicians? The Irish are coming off an excellent spring followed by in­spired ·action in preseasori. practice'. The: Irish are also coming pff a good 
· season, considering. the inexperience of last year's squad.. With .the. tur­moil that surrounded last season, 8-3 can be considered as a good
record. · · · · · 
The .1976 Notre'.Dame team will 

differ little from the 1975 · version 
other than they will have a year's 
experience. There are several areas 
of improvement, · the most notice­
able being the quarterback spot. Rick 
Slager had one of the best springs ori 
the team ,and is now throwing the 
ball with more authority than last 
season: After "the spring game, when. 
Dan · Devine named Slager as the 
number~one ·quarterback, he ' men­
tioned that this now allows people 
to second-guess him all summer. 
That was probably done; but Slager 
has · commanded that position and 
won it clearly. -.. 
One person on whom_ Pittsburgh 

will be depending.is Tony Dorsett. Last year against the Irish he set a single-game record · for most net yards gaineti rus~ing against a Notre Dame team with 303 yards. It is said that he runs'' best ·on Astro~Turf, which tlie Pittsburgh _stadium has and which Notre Dame· doesn't have. ._ Last' year, the Irish seemed to have theiri:ninds cin ·things other than stopping Dorsett,.• so. he probably could have collected 300. yards in a 
parking lot .. : . · , · · 
The most important factor for the . 
new season could be"ihe man on the 
sidelines ·whom ..·the : regional.' ·tele-· 
vision_ audience 'will be_ observing 
closely. Dan Devine, now into his 
second <season' 'at Notre ·name, un­
derstands. what-' .the . pressure of 
Notre Dame is all about. He is more 
confident 'in his surroundings,· with 
his own staff around to work with 
him., -, ·. . .. Devine_· ~as stated·. that the prob-' lems· : of' fast year are behind him now, :and the.·team has a new. atti­tude:· The team does appear to have a' new attitude/ btit the Pitt game is a crucial one. The Irish must beat the Panthers to set a good tone for the season. A loss could bring ·the attitude problems right back into· Devine's lap.
