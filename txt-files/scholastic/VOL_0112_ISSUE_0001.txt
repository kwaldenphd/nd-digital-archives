We are, largely, a desensitized people. And so it takes the death of one close to us, it takes a loss that is intensely personal, to rriake us understand­and share the suffering that others must live with.daily. 
Randy Heeke was a sophomore. Joe Sullivan was agraduate studentrin government this past year. Both were members of the Council for the Inter­national Lay Apostolate and were in· Santiago, Chile, this past summer working with that group. Both were killed in the Peruvian plane crash that took over sixty· lives several weeks ago. 
Soon their deaths will be put aside by all but those closest to them. For most of us, it is only a surface wound-soon it will heal, and we will once again distance ourselves from the undeniable immediacy of death. But before that happens, we must pause to offer words of sympathy to those who will not be able to forget the loss. · · · 
The Same Old Song 
Last spring, the SCHOLASTIC spoke editorially to the problem of University priorities (May 15, 1970)-spe­cifically treating such questions as faculty distribution related to student flow, cost per student in individual colleges, the clandestine nature of many University financial decisions, and the inequities that abound in allocating funds. The problems, we stated, "will not be alleviated next year when the University admits its largest freshman class ever, and the percentage of Arts and Letters intents figures to be higher than ever before." 
"Next year" is now here. 

And though no one expected instant metamorphoses, extended trips between O'Shaughnessy, the Engineering and Administration Buildings, plus extended talks with a host of secretaries therein, unearthed a number of disturbing realities. The figures that follow, though in­complete, are as accurate as preregistration confusion will allow. They are meant to serve only as examples. 
• 
1740 freshmen (compared to 1640 last year and 1550 in 1968) plus 135 transfer students will be admitted to the University this fall, increasing the total student population by well over 200. 

• 
more than 2250 students will be enrolled in Arts and Letters, an increase of nearly 10%; an Admissions official projected that over one­half of this freshman class would end up in that College. 

• 
Economics (up 1), Engineering (up 8), Sociol­ogy (up 2) and Theology increased the number of teachers; English ( down 2) and Languages 


( which must handle freshmen, sophomores and juniors this year) lost teachers; most 9thers remained constant. 
• The Art Department, which must shoulder the bulk of students affected by a new fine arts re­quirement, was forced to give three graduate 
students full teaching loads; Government and Philosophy have kept abreast only through what was termed "emergency measures"; The­ology, Philosophy and Government have several sections with 200 students; Government courses remained closed to all nonmajors. 
What has come of all this? On the positive side, the Administration says it has balanced its budget for the coming year, ·thanks largely to the increased enrollment. But the costs are disturbing: an aggravated housing situation, a tuition increase, a possible decline in the quality and intensity of the education received by a majority of students in the University, no significant faculty increase (at least in Arts and Letters) to meet the increased enrollment, and an impossible dilemma for most faculty members and department heads. The "emergency situation" of last year has gotten worse; given what appears to be an accelerating student flow away from Science and Engineering and towards Arts and Letters and Business Administration, it will con­tinue to do so. 
Unless funds are distributed to meet the legitimate needs of the various colleges and departments, and un­less the community stops treating symptoms instead of diseases. This has been said before, and it begins to get a bit stale; but it will be said again and again until the problems, if not solved, are at least challenged.

On Mixing Education and Politi_cs 
AMERICAN universities have traditionally remained above partisan politics on the national and state levels. The basic tenets of academic freedom demand that the universi~y not become a tool to be arbitrarily used by political= factions. Yet neither can the university be so rigid as to stifle the moral commitments her members feel to personal political ideals; a middle ground be­tween politicization and moral irresponsibility must be found. 
The "Princeton Plan" is an attempt to find this median. While not committing the university to any particular candidate or faction, it provides a twelve-day recess at the end of October to enable students, faculty, and administrators to work for political candidates. Proposed by a Princeton University student newspaper editor during last May's strike over Cambodia, the idea has been suggested at dozens of colleges across the country, including Notre Dame. Several students, led by SBP David Krashna, appeared before the Academic Council during the strike to request that more grading options be opened to students participating in strike activities. In a special session on May 11 the Council adopted the more flexible grading system; on its own initiative the Council also proposed a general faculty and student referendum on October 2 ". . . to recom­mend to the Academic Council whether a recess shall be declared from Saturday, October 24, to Wednesday, November 4, inclusive with adequate provision for mak­ing up the class periods before the end of the semester." Top members of the Administration joined faculty and students in hailing the measure as an example of the University's flexibility in responding to a national crisis. 
The Internal Revenue Service, however, was not im­pressed by this show of unity. Citing a somewhat ob­scure section of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, the I.R.S. warned universities that their status as tax-exempt institutions might be jeopardized ;by, engaging in par­tisan political activity. This statute proscribes interven­tion by an exempt institution in any "political campaign on behalf of any candidate for public office." 
Help soon came, however, and from a somewhat unexpected source. In late June the American Council on Education published guidelines which would enable universities to take the fall recess and still retain their jealously guarded tax-exempt status. The A.C.E. noted that mere aITangement of an academic calendar to 
The Scholastic 

allow university members to participate in the election process could not be deemed participation by the insti­tution itself in a campaign on behalf of a candidate. The university would be required to make the time up at some point during the same term. It warned that universities in their corporate capacities should not intervene in a campaign by endorsing or opposing a particular candidate or taking a position on an issue involved in t}?.e campaign. Members of the community remain entirely free to participate in the election proc­ess or not as they choose. Thus administrators don't lose their money, while students and faculty have the chance to decide if they want time off for the fall cam­paign. 
A portion of the University community still opposes the proposal, fearing that only anti-war "liberals" will benefit from student involvement. But a possible back­lash reaction to student activism and the increased po­litical awareness of all college-age people invalidate this idea. An example is the Notre Dame junior who hopes to return to New York during the recess to work in Norman Lent's campaign against Allard Lowenstein. On the opposite end of the political spectrum the Movement for a New Congress is generating student support for dovish Senators and Congressmen. So regardless of lib­eral or conservative labels, the Princeton Plan repre­sents an attempt to reach students who are apathetic or politically alienated and bring their energies back into the democratic process. President Goheen of Princeton summed up the sentiments of the plan's supporters, terming it a "positive response to a grave national crisis ... neither committing the University to any political position nor interfering with its prime educational re­sponsibilities." 
At Notre Dame the measure's chances of approval in the October 2 referendum remain uncertain; much depends on the vagaries of the national political climate. The Academic Council will meet in the latter part of September to determine how time lost during the recess will be made up. Members of the community might well be asked to shorten their Christmas vacation, eliminate the Thanksgiving break, and perhaps even attend a few Saturday classes. It will be a good chance to see how strong a commitment remains from last spring's politi­cal fervor. But at least the walls of university ivory are cracking. People are admitting that the university can no longer abstain from participation in the political process and yet justifiably pass moral judgment on political failures.

The Collected Letters of Jean-Luc Godard 
I AM lying on the floor. For a moment I am thinking 
of the afternoons we spent along the river, but I've 
forgotten or tried to forget all that now. It's hard for 
me. Even on days like this, I find it hard to keep the 
river away from me. I think to myself, I can't really 
see the river. .A knows this. I can think of her, with her 
hair like a witch, and her body pulling me into the 
water, and the glistening wet skin, and my hands along 
her belly, but I will not remember them. 
Perhaps she remembers the dream of the Russian 
ships that I had, and she was with me then, I remember 
thinking, these aren't Russian ships at all, but they were 
so ominous. Later we came across little children dressed 
in yellow raincoats and rainhats. Where were we then 
.A? 

I don't know the time or the day. For a long time, I had forgotten that days come together in strings. I forgot about days. I see .A with a basket of days, bringing me Wednesdays and Fridays, spilling out of the basket, and when I try to hold them, they feel like rain on my hands and face. A soft rain. 
I will write to her. I will begin the letter, Dear .A ... Perhaps I will write of the river and the times under the sun. Maybe I will write a story. There is a glass of water on a table near me. Half empty. I can see particles floating on the surface. At night, these con­stellations are called stars. 
Perhaps later I will weave a story line into the · letter, perhaps about . . . I don't remember. I can't think of any stories for sure. I try to set one up in my mind. Suppose this-a boy meets a girl on a beach at night, and the sunset turns the water red, and the mountains arch over the sea, suppose all this-what will follow? Will they fall in love? I don't think so. Will the boy decide to torture her to death the following morning? He might. What will he do with the body? I don't know. There are too many possibilities for everything. There is no certainty. I will try again. Suppose ... 
I have not moved from this room. It is a fairly small room. It has a bed and a desk and a clock which is broken and someone is sleeping in the corner. I don't know for how long. I am afraid to speak to him. What will happen if I wake him? He will speak to me. He will say something. One word, hello-faces looking out of bus windows, places where the trains pull in and out, bedrooms where someone is suddenly looking in your eyes, they will all come back. Itis best to remain silent. It is best to remain calm in a situation like this. 
My arms are not mine. I have decided. They are moving without obeying me. They just keep moving. Now they are moving along a wall, feeling it. My fingers are moving also, they aren't mine either. Perhaps I've been given the wrong set of arms. I will look for some­one with my arms. I will have to trade for them. Look, I have used these arms for a long time, but they are not mine, this is what I will tell him. You have my arms. I will have to get therri back. I have no legs. They have disappeared.

talking about direction 
David Krashna, Notre Dame's first black Student Body President, took office April 1. Last weekend THE SCHOLASTIC asked him how things have changed since then, and where his administration 'will be going this year. 
Scholastic: What kind of leadership do you want to 
offer this year? 
Krashna: It's really hard to pinpoint what kind of 
leadership I want to provide because a lot of my ideas 
about student leadership have changed. I thought that 
my main focus would be to work with the halls and the 
individuals in the halls. While this will remain, I see 
many ways where the leadership will have to come 
where I just go off on my own and develop these things. 
For example, I'm really wondering whether people are 
as interested as I am in getting away from the strictly 
academic and athletic environment we have here. I'm 
not sure if my fellow students are as interested. That's 
the kind of leadership I'm talking about. 
September 11, 1970 17­
Scholastic: ·what specifically are you referring to? Krashna: First of all coeducation. I really believe it's being dragged right now. One recommendation may be to push these people to find out what's happening. Some other ideas? \Vell, \Ve got the Huddle set up this year (renovations, including paneling over the football mural). Even that was quite a hassle to overcome tradi­tion. 
Scholastic: The kind of changes you're talking about don't involve any radical restructuring of the Univer­sity. Kra:-,hna: Some things are uniquely Notre Dame and some aren't. I'm really more interested in Notre Dame. I spoke to the black freshmen last night and I said Notre Dame was the type of institution that reacts, not acts. Because it reacts, it reacts to pressure. And when you ·re dealing with pressure there are many unique \';ays to put it on. I suggested to them that they not spend their four years getting caught up in the rhetoric of the college student here--like such nebulous, incon­sequential terms as ''the masses of the people." What are the ''masses of the people"? And "all power to the people.'' Fine, but it doesn't do us any good here at Notre Dam~. :Now I'm saying all that to say that the things that are uniquely Notre Dame are the things I \,:ant to deal with. 
Scholastic: Yet one of the first things you were involved with as president was very national. Krashna: And yet even then I tried to make it uniquely Notre Dame by saying this is a time for us to stop and see how the educational system here is affecting us­but I think I was the only one who had that in mind. 
Schola.stic: What are a few of the things you consider 
to be uniquely Notre Dame? ·Krashna: The great amount of affiliation to traditions 
for one thing, all the way down the line. Catholicism 
or some type of religious affiliation. Now it's the great 
"Christian" university we want to be. I guess it all re­
volves around the tradition thing. Again, the sense of 
pressure: some schools are able to be progressive by 
acting; Notre Dame reacts to pressure on traditions. 
Scholastic: How do you view the move for coeducation in the perspective of minority recruitment? Krashna: Coeducation is a must for me. It's now a must because we are moving on minority recruitment: we have 61 black freshmen here this year. Coeducation falls in with the whole thing of minority recruitment. You know, social life here is bad for the white student but it is just horrible for the black student. It's more of a feeling than a provable fact. I guess you have to be in a situation to feel it. I would like to make one more observation on minority recruitment. All around the country there is going to be a tendency to start leveling off recruitment of black students. There are going to be the big years (like last year at Notre Dame was, though it wasn't big in the perspective of, say Dartmouth, which recruited 95 black students). But I think there's going to be a leveling off to the point where we'll start recruiting maybe 20 each year. I'm going to try to get away from that and make this year a bigger recruitment year, with a bigger influx of appli­cations than last year. 
Scholastic: What about the financial situation of the black students accepted by the university this year? Krashna: I got a letter from a black fellow who said he was offered a scholarship and a few days later got a letter from Notre Dame that he did not have a scholar­ship, that there was just no money. I went over to check on that in admissions and found he was one of ten cases. There are large numbers, I think, of .the 181 black students accepted who did not come because Notre Dame did not have the financial aid for them. I can't accept personally the statement that Notre Dame doesn't have the money; I think that if Notre Dame wants to, they can get as many black students here who want to come and are acceptable. Father Hesburgh has a tendency to always say that if a minority student is accepted here he will not be turned away simply be-

cause of financial need. This is a blatant contradiction of that: many black students couldn't come because of financial need. 
Scholastic: Do you have any comment on the new administrative appointments? Krashna: Overall I'm very pleased. I had the sneaky feeling that this would come over the summer and not when students were here. I wasn't surprised at all by anything. I think Father Burtchaell is a well-known and respected academician. I know my dealings with him haven't been the best (in the SLC), but I think that in different positions we may be able to work together better, and I really hope so. In Student Affairs, I think both men are very good. 
Scholastic: What about the general impact of these changes? What effects will they have? Krashna: This was purposely a take-off from the Nut­ting campaign. Now you have one man to stay here and one man to go and publicize the University and raise funds for it. In that way I think we'll be all right if Father Burtchaell has the power to make decisions without Father Hesburgh here. My feeling as Student 
September 11, 1970 
Body President was that these changes shouldn't have been made unless we were in some kind of counseling capacity, especially in the area of Student Affairs. The selection was upsetting in that Mark and I, who did stay here all summer to keep in touch with things and maybe help out, were available and we could have been asked how we felt about certain chanaes and who we
0 

thought might be best. Not to say that we have the expertise to choose these people, but simply that we could counsel as to what we thought would be best. 
Scholastic: Did the summer's events. both here and in the nation, change your thinking about what Notre Dame ought to be or about what you ought to be as Student Body President? Krashna: ·while we should have some concern for na­tional issues, our most immediate concern should be Notre Dame: how it operates, how we \Vant it to operate, what \Ve want it to be. If anythina0 has chanaed
0 

it is that: my focus will be how to make Notre Dame a better place, with a watchful eye to what has hap­pened around us. I really learned a lot by staying here this summer. Consider, which \Ve don't, that students are here for four years while those \vho operate the place are here for a lifetime. I think this is somethina0 we touched on in the campaign: ho\\.-to bridge some gaps in relations with the faculty. vVe have a large precedent with the strike, \vhere faculty members did come into the halls. 
Scholastic: Do you have any feelings about the Prince­ton Plan? Krashna: I first thought the plan was \·ery progressive, as was the statement by the Academic Council. which I'm sure surprised everyone. Second. when I really got to think about it I thought about the great number of students who during the strike got their courses fixed and went home. Then I thought about politics and poli­ticians and Vance Hartke"s speech last spring-a speech I felt was obnoxious simply because it was all political. I started thinking about how students on a grand scale could be used by politicians for their particular wants. Then I started thinking maybe I should talk against the Recess. And I still have that feeling somewhat. l\Iaybe it would be best if \Ve concentrated here in South Bend and did things like teaching the people in town about the issues and candidates. I thought maybe that \VOuld be the biggest service we as students could do-instead of the vast majority of us going home for a vacation and the rest of us getting with politicians who might simply use us. But then that goes many ways, you know. Many say that we have this particular way of doing things and maybe we should make the best of it. Maybe we should help politicians who oppose the \var and make Congress a better one. Maybe we should have the Recess. I don't know. 
Scholastic: What's the most important thing for your administration to do this year? Krashna: Get away from a strict academic and athletic environment and become more socially aware. That's the thing with everything we're doing.

THIS is all that a 

great blues singer needs to say about his music. Of course, critics and scholars have to say more because they must try to compensate for the distance which separates artist from critic and, in this case, the distance which separates black from white.... Listening to the blues, you hear a man who has worked in the cotton fields since he was five, or struggled for a living in the stockyards of Chicago. He tells about a life stripped to its essentials: railroads and jails, hard times and fickle love, rivers and cities, dirt and sorrow, junkyards and dreams, the feeling of a soul hanging low like clouds over the Mississippi Delta. The blues musician has lived all this, and it goes without saying. It goes into his music. 
When so much of a man is exposed in his music, there is too much sorrow for one man, the performer, to contain in himself. You cannot help feeling the way he does. The listener becomes a product of the blues . This happens easily because nothing is hidden behind the music; all the simple passions are revealed in the m~sic itself, which has become the complete and only mode for expressing them. The impromptu narrative and simple lyrics -which may be half-spoken in lines ending with a moan or an impish chuckle -combine with the spontaneous sounds of the guitar to form the mood of the man wandering unpredictably through a song. The guitar speaks as much as the voice, filling in those parts of the story that can't be told in words. The music moves your feet, plays with your mind, and then swells in your veins until the sounds unite to form 

the rhythm and melody line of the blues. The blues 
makes distant people real and true. You come away, 
not only refreshed by the music, but filled with new 
and old experiences. 
In light of all that blues can do, it seems strange that the music never attained any degree of popularity until recently. Whatever the obstacles, they are dis­solving now before a new enthusiasm for blues. In a society where traces of humanity are too often lost as everyone becomes enmeshed in the complex ways of modern living, people are craving for gentle glimpses of what is truly human. Because the blues comes out of another life-style, it can offer these glimpses. The songs touch you as would a stranger, warm and even sweaty, with human odor and the soft sensation of a man reaching out to say something. 
THE Contemporary Arts Festival offers a chance to experience the blues, Friday and Saturday in the Stepan Center. Six men will reveal themselves through their art; it will be sad, and it will be good. 
On Friday, J. B. Hutto and his blues band will return to Notre Dame after two years' absence. Hutto's blues are city blues, the music of people and life in Chicago. His guitar, an extension of his personality, moving in frenzy and pain, tells his stories about dirty streets and wooden shacks, of a needed drink and a shadowy woman. He dances on the stage in a distorted and vibrant motion that complements the passion of his music. And with him "Mississippi" Fred McDowell will sing his stories of the slack life on the river. A master of the bottleneck, he "don't play no rock 'n roll," but weaves legends of men and women as old as man is old. His country blues contrast with Hutto's city blues and those of Houndog Taylor and his blues band. 
On Saturday night, the National Educational Tele­vision network will come to Notre Dame to film seg­ments of the Blues Festival for a documentary program on Lightnin' Hopkins and the Blues. Jimmy "Fast Fingers" Dawkins will be there improvising melodies and countermelodies on his guitar, framing his stories with lyric music. Otis Rush, one of the best modern blues guitarists, will be there playing his own kind of city blues. His stories of Philadelphia, Mississippi and Chicago are blended from his past and from blues legend. He learned to play guitar imitating Muddy Waters and Lightnin' Hopkins and has evolved a style that combines the qualities of his tutors with his own variations. 
And then there is the great Llghtnin' Hopkins him­self. In the truest sense of the word he is a minstrel, a street-singing artist born of the vast tradition of the blues. His only understanding of music is that it be as personal as a hushed conversation. He dances and moans and wanders with his delicate guitar through experi­ences that have been his for so long that they are as much a part of his personality as his name is. Whether it be a song about a new car or lonely nights when a drink was his only friend, what you witness is a t..~e artist -a man capable of opening his soul and letting its strains become his music. 
Everyone sees the blues in a different way. Maybe it's great listening music for you, or maybe it's an art. Perhaps it communicates the consciousness of a race, or creates and feels in a way no longer available to most men. ·Whatever the blues is for you, you have to experience it to dig it.

if you don't know where you' re liable to wind up someplace else 
REMEMBER Catch 22: the army will not send a sol­dier home from the war unless he is crazy, and wants to go. But if a soldier wants to go home, he can't be crazy; the crazy soldiers are those who want to stay. Ergo, no one goes home, and we see the futility of men locked in a closed system whose primary interest is in sus­taining itself, not individual men or any value which could be called humane. This theme prevails in our time, it is back again at the center of another best­seller, The Peter Principle. To approach this theme with any seriousness is to invite the blackness of Heller's novel. However, a complete denial of seriousness re­stricts the vision, and ·can produce a funny little book like this one. 
Co-author Raymond Hull begins by noting that al-

most everyone bungles his affairs, and proves it with a list of experienced atrocities. His tone is of indignation too solemn to be real (in comparison, Carl Sa.11dburg was laughing at the seduction of these farmboys), and it is sustained throughout the book. The authors ex­plain that every human being possesses a level of in­competence; that is, there is a limit to what he can do effectively. Past that limit, even the most brilliant and capable person becomes a bungler. Now, in business, government, education, practically everywhere, the placement of personnel occurs by way of a promotions system. If a worker does well at a given job, he is as­signed to a new one higher up in the institution and proportionately more difficult. Since he will be promoted as long as he is able to perform effectively at his new job, he wilI be given jobs that are consistently more difficult, until the inevitable happens: he gets a position which he can't handle. Since he no longer fulfills the 
•criterion for promotion, he will remain unsuccessfully

you' re going 
at his new job. He will spend the rest of his working life at his level of incompetence. 
That is the thesis of the study. It is established by means of fine examples, which contain some of the ripest puns going today: 
Miss Totland, who had been a competent student and an outstanding primary teacher, was promoted to primary supervisor. She now has to teach, not children, but teachers. Yet 
she still uses the techniques which worked so well with small children. 
Addressing teachers, singly or in groups, she speaks slowly and distinctly. She uses mostly words of one or two syllables. She explains each point in several ways, to be sure it is under­stood. She always wears a bright smile. 
Teachers dislike what they call her false cheerfulness and her patronizing attitude. Their resentment is so sharp that, instead of trying to carry out her suggestions, they spend time de­vising excuses for not doing what she recom­mends. 
Miss Totland has proved herself incompe­tent in communicating with primary teachers. She is therefore ineligible for further promo­tion, and will remain as primary supervisor, at her level of incompetence. 
With its thesis thus firmly propounded, the study focuses upon the phenomenon of Final Placement (FP). This is the technical name for the position at which incompetence occurs. As might be expected, life at FP is not very pleasant; perpetual failure in the job's per­formance builds gigantic stress and frustration, and can even result in physical collapse. The authors· provide a list of physical FP symptoms which would make a coroner gasp. But there is hope for those at FP: the way to avoid frustration and the evils associated with it is a technique called "substitution." Instead of doing what he's supposed to be doing and failing at it, the FP person may find some project which is vaguely related to his job, and which he is able to handle competently. He substitutes this project for his real job. Here is the case of a man who has mastered several kinds of sub­stitution: 
Grant Swinger, deputy director of the Deep­rest Welfare Department, was regarded as highly competent because of his outstanding ability to coax government and charitable foun­dations into parting with money for worthy local causes. Then war was declared on poverty. Swinger was promoted to the post of co­ordinating director of the Deeprest Anti-Dis­advantagement Program, on the principle that since he so well understood the mighty, he should be highly competent to help the weak. 
As this goes to press, Swinger is still busily raising funds to erect an Olympian office build­ing to house his staff and to stand as a per­manent monument to the spirit of aiding the needy. 
"We want the poor·to see that they have not been forgotten by their government," explains Swinger. Next he plans to convene a Deeprest Anti-Disadvantagement Advisory Council, raise money for a survey of the problems of the dis-
September 11, 1970 
advantaged, and tour the Western world to in­spect similar schemes elsewhere. 
It should be pointed out that Swinger is busy from morning to night and sincerely feels that he is doing a good job. 
Substitution may be a balm for those already at FP, but isn't there a ,way to keep from getting there, to remain at a job which can be performed competently? Yes, but it's nothing so artless as simply refusing offers to promotion. (That would mean severe social re­proval.) Inste~d, the authors propose a technique they call "creative incompetence." It's substitution in re­verse: the employee affects incompetence, while in reality he continues to work effectively. Here is how 
T. Sawyer, a carpe~ter, practices creative incompetence: 
In the last·few months he has been buying cheap paperbound copies of WALDEN and giving them away to his workmates and supe­riors, in. each case with a few remarks on the pleasures of irresponsibility and the joys of day labor. 
He follows up the gift with persistent ques­tioning to see whether the recipient has read the book and how much of It he has under­stood. Tnis meddlesome didacticism I denomi­nate The Socrates Complex. 
Sawyer reports that the offers of promotion have ceased .. 
Sawyer, who is good and happy as a workman, will be able to remain so by making sure that hissuperiors have doubts about his competence. 
As if all this were not enough, Peter arid Hun·dare to apply their thesis from individuals to entire cultures, with no loss of humor. 
JF the movement and methods of the book itself seem familiar, that is because they resemble the methods of many seriously intended studies belonging to a genre which might be c_alled "cultural analysis." This genre, at its best in the work of thinkers like Irving Goffman and Claude Levi-Strauss, has found an enthusiastic audience and has quickly developed its own set of con­ventions. Some of these · are assumed by The Peter Principle. For example, the study cites literary sources to support and embellish its contentions, invents a new interpretation of history, and so on. When these con­ventions are combined with the punning and mock solemnity, they appear ridiculous. Here perhaps the book has a purpose other than entertainment. It cannot be a real effort at cultural analysis, but it does serve as a satire of some books that are. New interpretations of literature and history.; offhand evaluations of great thinkers (Freud spoke of incompetence in terms of sexuality because he was "a satirist at heart"); the promise of revolutionizing human thought (the authors regard their study as the cornerstone for a new science they've originated: hierarchiology)-all of these things from The Peter Principle have been used, too often ir­responsibly, in previous studies. Vvnen the pretensions of cultural analysis are made to seem so foolish, we are forced to question and re-establish its worth and pur­pose. 
Good satire must begin with a serious issue; be­cause the common-sense insight of Peter's thesis is valid and substantial, the nonsep,sical elaboration of that thesis becomes a measured irony which ca ncriticize the soci­ologist. This tension between sense and nonsense also explains the book's great appeal to the general reader. As I mentioned earlier, the thesis does apprehend a principle of the modern condition which has been at the center of a black vision. We are grateful for the non­sense because it provides, for the moment, an enjoyable way of considering this fact of our experience.

Picks by Terry 

Arkansas over Stanford -Tele­vision opener and, likely, a very entertaining show. Stanford's Jim Plunkett is a better quarterback, though Arkansas' Bill Montgomery will exploit the Indians' inexperi­enced defense to amass more im­pressive stats. 
Georgia Tech over South Carolina 
-This upset could get the Yellow­jackets off to their first winning season under Coach Bud Carson. Sophomore quarterback Eddie Mc­Ashan's performance will be pivotal. 
North Carolina over Kentucky­Johnny Ray's Wildcats still suffer from inferior quarterbacking. The Tar Heels should post their first winning season since 1964. 
Oklahoma over Southern Metho­dist -These used to be big names in college football, but in 1970 the 
September 11, 1970 
Sooners and Mustangs are about equally m~diocre. Really bad de­fense both ways. It is sure to be 130 . degrees on the floor of the Cotton Bowl tomorrow; Chuck Mixon's re­ceivers will be dehydrated by half­time. 
UCLA over Oregon Stare-Bruins graduated a bundle from their 1969 squad, yet there is quarterback Dennis Dummitt, a veteran defen­sive secondary and -as always ­those quality j.c. transfers. 
O~egon over California -The Ducks show 36 lettermen and re­turn their prolific offensive unit virtually intact. 
Missouri over Baylor-The Bears may win a game in 1970, but not this week. The Tigers, a future Irish opponent, are very green in the de­fensive backfield and if Baylor can pass on them, well, that is good news for Notre Dame. 
Tennessee over Chattanooga. ­Coach Bill Battle makes his debut, and he can name the score. 
Florida over Duke-Duke is truly potent on offense and could be a sleeper in the the Atlantic Coast Conference this season. Meanwhile, Florida's John Reaves will be deter­mining the exact worth of Carlos Alvarez, a splendid receiver in '69 who is sidelined by injury this season. 
Southern Cal over Alabama-The 
'70 Tide is improved over last year's 6-4 outfit, but still there is no evi­dence of solid defense. Southern Cal is Southern Cal and John McKay won't want to leave his season in Birmingham. 
However much we are affected by the things of the world, however deeply they may stir and stimulate us, they become human for us only when we can dis<JU.Ss them with our fellows. Whatever cannot become the object of.discourse -the truly sublime, the truly hor­rible or the uncanny -may find a human voice through which to sound into the worlil, but it is not exactly human. 
Hannah Arendt 
SOMEWHERE in A Farewell to Arms Hemin~ay writes that, for the soldier in the midst of a war, all abstract words -· such as "honor" or "victory" or "just peace" or even "mankind" -become meaning­less, and that only the names of streets or villages or comrades retain any substance. The despair in that re­mark has deepened since Hemingway's time, as we continue merely to survive surrounded by several kinds of war. 
We are now at the point where it is almost impos­sible to communicate with anyone who is not already a friend -i.e., one with whom we share much more than even a common language. Raped. over and over again by armies of lobbyists and demagogues, words like "patriot" and "anarchy" and "law" and "ecology"· lie exhausted and near death. In a sense, such words are of no use to us whatsoever; perhaps we should simply throw them ouf and begin anew. . 
The temptation, then, is to remain silent, to com­municate only with friends, or to "speak" only through action. But none.of these satisfy either, because they make language something more passive and ineffective than it really is. We .run out'of choices: We despair,. and the gaps· between men grow wider. 0

the last word 
T~AT despair and. the silence which surrounds it are everywhere; it is the oppressive silence that prophesies civil war. Anyone who doubts this need only look to an endless list of signs: Mayor Daley's order to shoot all looters; the recent bombing in Madison; the police­Panther wars in Philadelphia, Berkeley and Chicago; the arming of National Guard troops with automatic weapons; the moral chaos that characterizes the largest part of our elected leadership. 
In the face of these and many more, if we are to even attempt a reconciliation (instead of just an un­easy truce) we may have to begin with words ­because they are the only form of communication com­mon to and possible for large numbers of people. Through articulation, sacrifice becomes something more than martyrdom. And only through lariguage can we make our experiences human, share them and perhaps be stirred to some· moral resurrection. Honest speech may offer a last chance, as Camus writes, for us to "negate the crudest. implications of our history." 
JT is with all this· in mind that the SCHOLASTIC staff begins this year.· The assumption is that language can be action,~ that it cim· effectively produce change and oppose evil That may or may not be. The job of recon­ciliation is perhaps impossible; ·our efforts, because we share the common human myopia, will frequently fall short. They may at times seem like mere games with which we pass time before we are forced to take sides in one more war. But until that time, it is our respon­sibility to make clear· the· distances· that divide men and the dis~ctions that preserve their uniqueness, and to ·begin ·bridging the distances without obliterating 
.~e .distinctions.: We need to speak out against all evils -and oppression until. speech is no longer possible. · · · , · ·. .: ' ··,· :·. · · steven brion
