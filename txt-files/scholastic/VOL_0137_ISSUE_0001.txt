Your New Home 
I'll never forget the first day I accidently called Notre Dame "home." My mom just about flipped. "What do you mean 'you can't wait to go home?!"' she exclaimed. ''This is your home." 
That was towards the end of my freshman year, and it was then that I realized I had fully made the transition to college. Notre Dame was my home now, and the Notre Dame family had become my family. 
Before long, you too will become a part of the Notre Dame family. Welcome. We are a spirited and diverse group spanning over all 50 states and 70 foreign countries. We come in all shapes and sizes, and we vary in age from 17 to 105. But one bond holds us all together: our love of a specialplace that has helped each of us grow into the person that we are today. . 
Over the next four years, you too willlearn to love Notre Dame. You will learn to love the way the golden dome glistens in the sun on bright fall days, the silent peace on the paths by the lakes, the squirrels which are tame enough to eat from your hand; 
Butmorethananythingelse,NotreDameisthepeople. Yourroommates,your professors, your rector ... These people, and the things you learn from them, you will take with you for the rest of your life. Cherish them all. ·

Notre Dame is renown.eel forits gor­geous campus, complete with striking architecture and vibrant landscaping. Now the scene upon arriving on campus includes fences, scaffolding, bulldozers and cement trucks. Welcome to the Notre Dame construction site. Three big projects are currently underway and work will continue over the next few years. Early in the spring of 1995, construction crews broke ground for two new men's dorms. Keough and O'Neill Halls, named aftergenerous donors, will be located on the south end of campus, on land previously occupied by the university's golf course. Each dorm will house approximately 275 men. When they open in fall 1996, the first residents will be drawn from Grace Hall, one of the high-rise dorms built in 1969.

Looking Back ... 


Early this semester, the administra­tion suddenly infonned leaders of Notre Dame's homosexual student group that they could no longer use the UniversityCounselingCenterto hold meet­ings, since the group is not officially recog­nized by the university. This sparked a wave of controversy about the university's policy regarding homosexual groups. Many campus organizations made pub­lic statements in support of GLNDfSMC. In addition, over 300 individuals showed their agitation with the administration through three protests early this semester. Asthecontroversyheatedup,mediacov­erage exploded. On campus, a series of ·open letters to the Notre Dame community appeared. Statements from the Office of Student Affairs, C?ffipus Ministry and GLND/SMC served as a dialogue of sorts and provided fuel for the fire. The Observer was filled with editorials . and letters to the editor. Alumni, represen­tatives from other universities and homo­sexuals around the country wrote to express their opinions. The South Bend Tribune covered each new step in the battle. The story broke in other publications around the country as well, including the Chicago Tri­bune a.,d the New York Times. 
GLND/SMChasdedicateditselftomeet­ing the needs ofgay and lesbian students on campus. They continue to meet, even with-/ out official university approval. And they continue to try to educate the Notre Dame community. 
Since spring break, the roar of conflict has subsided slightly. Activities and dis­cussion have taken an inward turn in order toprotectthepeopledirectlyinvolved. Both sides have found supporters and protesters, and neither side declared itself the victor. Until the administration, GLND/SMC and thestudentandfacultybodiesfindcommon ground, this issue will no doubt again arise under the dome. D

F.amily Portrait 
A guide to afew campus personalities 
by Michelle Crouch 
The Man In Charge Rev. Edward A. 
"Monk"Malloy,C.S.C., 

isinhissecondfive-year term as the 16th presi­dentofNotreDame. For­merlyamemberofPresi­dent George Bush's Ad­visoryCouncilonDrugs, he was recently appointed chairman of the new Commission on Substance Abuse at High Schools. He is also a founding direc­tor of the Points of Light Foundation, a national initiative to promote community service. 

Father Malloy hasbeenafacultymember in the Department of Theology since 1974, and he continues to teach today. He resides in Sorin Hall, one of very few university presidents in the country who lives in a dorm with students. 
An Emeritus Extraordinaire 

Rev. FatherTheodore M Hesburgh, C.S.C.,re­tired in 1987 after serv­ing as Notre Dame's president for 35 years. He spends much of his time traveling, making speeches and fulfilling his obligations as a member ofa number of international organizations. 

Despite these obligations, Father HesburghisstillinvolvedwithNo~Dame students. He can be found making guest appearances, lecturing in classrooms and presiding over liturgies in the residence halls. In addition, he chairs the advisory committees of two of the University's aca­demic institutes. 
Father Hesburgh is probably most well­known for his public service career. Hehas held 15 presidential appointments over the years, involving him in major social issues such as civil rig~ts and atomic energy. He is also a leader in the field of education, as reflected in his 127 honorary degrees, the most ever awarded to a single individual. 
Contrary to the rumor that Father Hesburgh lives on the 14th floor of the library named after him, he actually resides in Corby Hall, the residence of many Holy .Cross priests. 
The Woman Who Makes the Rules 

The vice president of student affairs, Profes­sor Patricia A. O'Harais the woman who makes many of the decisions that affect Notre Dame students. She sets the agenda for and makes 


decisions about campus ministry, campus security, student activities and residence life. 
Consequently, her relationship with stu­dents is bittersweet, as many students asso­ciate the Department of Student Affairs with discipline and punishment. ''That comes with the territory," said O'Hara. ''Partofour work is with rules and expecta­tions, but there is so much more to what we do, from CampusMinistryto student activi­ties to counseling." 
O'Hara tries to maintain contact with students, spending time in each dorm at least once a year, and working personally with theresident assistants and studentgov­emment. She also continues to teach two classes in the law school. 
O'Hara was awarded this position in June 1990, becoming the first woman to serve as an officer of the university. 
''Lou" 
WhenLouHoltzcame to Notre Dame to take over as the head football coach in 1985, no one knew for sure what was in store. It did not take long to find out. 

After only two years under his guidance, the Irish earned an invitation to the Cotton Bowl. It was their first New Year's Day appearance in seven years. The next year, in 1988, Holtz pro­duced anational championship. 

Indeed, in his ten seasons at Notre Dame, Holtz has repeatedly proven that he has made the Fighting Irish squad one of the best in college football, and the future looks promising for football. This year's fresh­man recruiting class has been billed as top in the nation . 
Probably the most telling aspect about Holtz's success as a coach is the students' undyingloyaltyandrespectforhim. Thisis evident between the third and fourth quar-. ters of every football game, when thou­sands of students hold up their hands to form the letter "L" and chant the name "Lou" over and over, to the tune of The 1812 Overture. 
Dean of Freshman Year 
Dean of the Freshman Year of Studies Eileen Kolman spends most of her time doing every­thing she can to make theadjustmenttocollege life easier for the fresh­men. 


Under Kolman's guidance, the Fresh­man Year of Studies assigns each freshman anadultadvisorandapeeradvisor. Kolman advises about 50 students herself. 
The department offers sessions in test preparation, note-takirig and time manage­ment. Moreover, they will find a tutor for any freshman who is having trouble in a class. Through these and other programs, Dean Kolman helps make the transition to college much easier.

This survival guide will answer all ofyour questions about your new life as a Domer 
· by Bridget Bradburn 
You've packed your entire life into six box.es and a couple ofsuitcases. You've heard all the advice you can handle from your well-meaning parents and all-knowing older friends and siblings. No matter how prepared you are, however, questions about daily life at Notre Dame remain. You are not alone. In an attempt to provide some of these important details, Scholastic has compiled this list of the important facts of life at Notre Dame to help you survive your first year. 
1. Starting Out 

Freshman Orientation will be your most entertaining, carefree and hectic time atNotreDame. Between the Graffiti Dance, where you meet other freshmen by signing their shirts, theme parties, cook-outs, Mass, moving in and saying good-bye to your parents, there is little time for homesickness. Enjoy every minute of this chance to socialize and meet new people before classes start. 
2. Braving the Elements 
Nomatterwhatcomeroftheworldyoucomefrom,you'llnever bepreparedfor the weather at Notre Dame. The days ofFreshman Orientation and moving in are traditionally hot and humid, so take advantage of the opportunity to dress in shorts and sandals. The Summer weather ends quickly, though the days of fall are often pleasant Alwaysbeprepared for rain, no matterwhat the weather reports say and no matter what the sky looks like. Never forget to pack an umbrella, and ifyou do not own a pair of waterproof shoes or boots, now is the time to invest. When winter arrives, it settles in for a long stay. The first snowfall can occur as early as November, and the campus usually does not thaw out until March. Agoodpair of warm snow boots areimperative,andit' salsoagood idea to bring along all the wool sweaters, gloves and scarves that you own. You will need them sooner than you think -no one wants to get frostbite while cheering in the student section at the football games. 
3. Food for Thought 
After the hot and tiring task of setting up their rooms, most students waste no time in finding their way. to the dining halls. Therearetwodininghallsoncampus,NorthDiningHallandSouth DiningHall, each offering a variety of choices. You can eat at either location, but most students choose to frequent the onecloserto their dorm. You will quickly learnyour way around the salad bar, pasta bar, deli line, pizza line, dessert display and cereal counter. Al­though the choices are certainly notalways appealing, atleast there is variety. And if you happen to miss the dining hall hours of operation, various fast foods are available in LaFortune Student Center. Unfortunately, students are not permitted to use their meal cards at these locations; cash must be used instead. 
4. Dining Out 

Inevitably, you will get tired of the loud atmosphere and institutional food in the dining hall and find your way to the local restaurants. Macri's Deli is a popular local sandwich spot. In addition, TGIFrlday's,DonPablo's, Chi-Chi's, Olive Garden and ColoradoSteakhouseareallclosetocampus. SouthBendhasafew formal restaurants as well, such as the Landing, the Emporium, the Wharfand Tippecanoe Place. For obvious reasons, most students wait for their parents' first visit before going to these expensive restaurants. Ofcourse, ordering in is another popular option. Papa John's and Bruno's are two favorite pizza places that will deliver to your dorm, and other restaurants also have delivery or carry-out services. 
5. Weekend Escapes 
Weekends offer the perfect opportunity for students to escape fr.om the tedium ofschoolwork. In the fall, bus trips to some ofthe away football games offerstuden~ the chance to visit other college towns. Once the football season is over, many students travel via the relatively affordable South Shore Railroad to Chicago and to Michigan City, an outlet shopping location. 
6. Shopping Around 
Speaking ofshopping, the University Park Mall is close by, and there is a bus that runs from campus to the mall every half hour during the day. Meijeris another favorite shopping place for many students, offering everything from food and househo}dproducts to hardware, music, books and electronics. On campus, there is a convenience storein LaFortune Student Center, and the bookstore has a limited amount of drug store products, as well as various school supplies and anything you'd ever need with the Notre Dame logo oh it.

7. HittingtheBooks 
No matter how anxious you may be to get a jump on your reading for the first semester, don't buy books until you have your firstclass, asprofessors may make last-minutechanges to thebook listor syllabus. Before you go to the bookstore, check posted lists ofusedbooksforsale. Thiscan saveyoutimeandmoney, butmake sure that the used books are the right editions before you pay for them. Whenyoudofinallybrave thebookstore,bepreparedtowait inlonglinesandto spendmostof yoursummereamingsinone trip.

12. 'l'he Balancing Act 
No matter what diversion you choose, schoolwork must remain apriority. TheFreshmanYearofSmdies provides free tutoring for those who request it, and they also have an advising program to assist freshmen in picking classes and thinking about a major.

10. Getting Involved 
Other sources of diversion available to all students are the various clubs and organizations at Notte Dame.

Despite all of mom's advice and warnings, no student can escape getting sick while at school. Stress, bad weather, minimal sleep and close contactwith other students leadto IIiany colds and cases of the flu. Notre Dame's infirmary has both doctors and nurses on staff, as well as aphannacy, but there is often along wait -· to be seen.

Packing 101: 
A crash course on the basics you will 


Fr. Tom Gaughan, rector of Stanford Hall, helps junior Brian Anderson 
unpack his car.

I
l mirror, cardashboard, and allother, available surfaces the summerbeforeIwas to leave for Notre Daine. Unfortunately, when the time came to transport all of my belongings, I quickly learned that all the items I had listed took up two cars and about three dorm rooms. 
Itis tempting to bring all of your earthly possessions to college, but most Notre Dame dorm rooms are downright tiny, not to mention that you will· be sharing that room with at least one other person. So here are some packing tips and a little common senseto help youprepareto make the great migration from home to college. 
Furniture 

Deciding what to bring for your dorm room can be a particularly frustrating issue, espec:ially since you probably have not seen your donn room and have never lived in a donn. One of the biggest ques­tions is to loft or not to loft. A loft is an elevatedbedthat leaves space open under­neath forfurniture. Aloftcanbe ahassle to construct, yet many students find that the space they gain makes the agony ofassem­blyworthwhile. Loftkitscanbepurchased relativelyinexpensivelyatstoreslikeBuild­ers Square. The university does regulate what kirid of lofts you can have in your room, however, so you will want to look into those rules beforehand. 
·Manystudentsalsoopttobringfurniture totheirdonnrooms. Alldormroomscome equipped with beds, desks and a wardrobe to store your clothes in.· One useful addi­tion to these basics are bookshelves to provide storage space for everything from food to school books. Couches, bean-bag chairs and foutons are also popular items, since they are more comfortable than sit­ting on the floor. Remember to check the size of your room before investing in big furniture,though, becauseitmaytakesome creativity to fit that comfortable chair into yourtinydonnroom. Carpetingis amustin thedorms, unlessyouwanttolivewithcold hard tile floors all year. Again, you will· probably want to wait to buy carpet until you have seeri your room, as ~otre Dame 
ne~d to get through yourfirst semester atNotre Dame 

donn rooms come in all shapes and sizes. 
Appliances 

Itisalsoagoodideatobringsomeofyour conveniences from home. A stereo or tape player is "practically essential, and make sure·you stockup on CDs and tapes; stu­dentsgenerallyfindSouthBehdradiolack­ing. Most students also choose to bring a 
' refrigerator, which is useful for keeping both beverages and late night munchies cold. A TV and a VCR are nice additions to a donn room, but they are not really necessary. All of the donns have at least 
· oneTVlounge,soyoudon'tneedyourown TV to ,catch your favorite programs. Coffeemakers or hotpots can be a valuable convenience as well, to make coffee or to heatwaterfortea,hotchocolateandsoupon chilly winter days. Afan, or even a couple of fans, are crucial if you are going to be living in an older donn, since they are not air-conditioned and are stifling in hot weather. Ifpossible, you really should talk to your roommate before spending a lot of money on-large items for your room, since you will not want to duplicate. Theissue of whether tobring acomputer 


is a difficult one to solve. There are numer­ous computerclusters on campus, some of which are open 24 hours a day, with both M.acintoshes andPCs. The cluster comput­ers are hooked up to the Internet, and many have CD-ROMs. If you plan to use the cluster computers, however, expect to wait in order to use a computer or to plan your schedule around the busy hours at the clus­ters, particularly around midterms and fi­nals. If you intend to pursue a major that involves a lot of computer use or essay writing, a computer can be a great conve­nience, but not a necessary one. One sug­gestion is to try the clusters for a semester before purchasing a computer. 
Personal Touches 

Though you probably will not care if yourroom looks like those inBetterHomes and Gardens, some skilled decorating can personalize a dorm room and make itmuch moreinviting. TheoverheadlightsinNotre Dame rooms are often dim and will make your room look like a cellar, so pack some lamps before you come to school. A desk lamp is a must for studying, while floor lamp~ can brighten a room tremendously. Free-standinghallogenlightsareverypopu­lar. Adormroom will also lookpretty bleak without something on the walls. Posters and pictures, whether they depict your fa­vorite music group or a beloved impres­sionistartist, add a lot of character to aroom and help muffle echoes. Creative touches like Christmas lights andplants also jazzup a room. Curtains make a room feel more homey, but many ofthe dorms already have curtains on the windows, so you will prob­ably want to see your room first. 

Ifyou forget something at home or want to wait until you arrive at Notre Dame to purchase something for your room, South Bend has plenty of discount stores where you can purchase furniture, electronics and other items at reasonable prices. On cam­pus, the Student Union Board sponsors a "Fall Mall" at Stepan Center at the begin­ning of the semester. They sell everything from furniture and posters to plants at re­duced prices. You can also rent a refrigera­tor for the year at Fall Mall. Keep in mind, however, thatifyouplanto have arefrigera­tor in your room all four years, it may be cheaper in the long run to simply purchase one. In addition, there is a poster sale each 
fall in LaFortune 
Student Center. 
Odds and Ends 
Apart from fur­nishings, there is a variety of mis­cellaneous items that you will need for dormitory liv­ing. Sfuceyouwill have to trek down the hall to take a shower,arobeand a shower caddy · are important. Many students also wear flip­flops in the show­ers, since they are not always the 

cleanest place for bare feet. A big laundry bag or basket, a stain stick, laundry deter­gentandlotsofquartersarenecessaryifyou plan on doing your own laundry. For those who have not yet conquered the washing machine and dryer, St. Michael's Laundry provides an on-campus service that will pick up your laundry each week if you choose to pay for their semester~long ser­vices: St.Michael'salsohasadrycleaning service available to all students, regardless of whether or not they use the weekly laundry service. Also, you will need to bring hangers for your clothes, unless you plan on folding everything. As far as bed­ding and linens go, you will need to bring sheets, towels and probably a comforter. The university provides a blanket, a mat­tress pad, and a pillow, but these items can be old, worn and stained, so you may want to buy those for yourself. A few dishes, some silverware, and cups or mugs also come in handy, but they are not necessary. An alarm clock, preferably a loud one, is necessary to wake you for those dreaded 
8:00 am. classes, and a backpack will get you and your notebooks to class. Toiletries canbepurchasedon campus,althoughmany believe prices on campus are higher. It is muchmoreeconomical to stockuponsham-, ' poo, soap and other items at home, where you have a better selection than atthebook­

· No matter how many lists you make, you will inevitably forget something. One of the joys of dorm living, however, is being able to share or trad~ virtually everything with your roommate or neighbors. And if they can not meet your needs, your family is just a phone call or a care package away.

A great number ofNotre Dame students participate in some type ofcommunity service activity. Here's a look at wha,t you can do to get involved 
reflection. 

The urban plunge is one ofthe mostlong­standingandpopularprograms. Theplunge is a 48-hour immersion over Christmas break in inner-cities around the country. Students observe and work with individu­als, agencies and parishes that are striving to meet the needs of the poor. Since 1974, a total of 4,110 plunges have been made by Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students. 
"The urban plunge gives students an in­side look at city poverty and personalizes it. It really helps build awareness as they meet people who are trying to help solve the problems of the world," said Sue Cunningham, who coordinates urban plunges and summer service projects. 
Summer service project participants live and work at sites sponsored byalumni clubs around the country for eight weeks. In the summer of 1994, 142 students participated in the program. A summer service project gives students the chance to work in an established service agency, to discuss so­cial concerns with alumni and to continue their education outside the classroom. ''There are so many advantages," said Cunningham. 
Senior Brian Mcconville, who did a project in Miami, FL, agreed: "I was look­ing for something besides the normal sum­mer job ... I knew I wanted to work with teenagers. I knew I wanted to be in a different part of the country and experience a different culture. I. knew I wanted to broaden my horizons and challenge my beliefs. The summer service project could do all that for me."

Imagine throwing a party for someone you do noteven know. You bring a box full of gifts. When you hand the pre­sents to the lucky recipient, the person surprises you by bringing out an evenlarger boxfull of more gifts andgives them to you. This strange scenario is similar to an experience shared by themany people who areinvolvedinservice workatNotreDame.

The thrust of the centeris providingopportunities for service and justice work. 
"As a Catholic university, we strive to incorporate our beliefs into everyday situa­tions. The work of the center is an attempt to link theology and life," said Fr. Do_n McNeill, director of the CSC since its in° ception. 
Part of the beauty of the center's offer­ings comes in the variety of projects which are available. Students can stay on campus, venture into South Bend, travel to another state or journey to a foreign country.

spring break, found the total immersion in another culture a highlight of her experi­ence. "I learned to appreciate the differ­ences between people and gained confi­dence in my ability to get to know aperson who seems very different from me on the surface." 
JuniorJenny Robinson worked in Appa­lachiaoverspringbreak. "Ihad avery good experience. This waspartly due to theteam work that was involved. Everyone in my group really came together." 
"Student empowerment is an important involvementin theseprograms,"addedJay Bradenburger, coordinatorfor experiential learning and justice education. ''They get an idea, develop itcreatively, andthen help immerse other students in the experience." 
While school is in session, Notre Dame students are continuously involved with service workin the South Bend commu­nity. Students may become involved in causes ranging from adult literacy and dis­ability services to homelessness and tutor­ing. 
One means of soliciting studentinvolve~ ment is through the dorms. Each dorm has ateam ofcommunity service commission­ers that is responsible for letting the dorm know about service possibilities and for organizingprojects. "Dormserviceprojects are great opportunities for bonding be­tween the guys at the same time that we're helping someone else," said Mark Shean, service commissioner for Keenan Hall. 
The academic arena is another important aspect of the center's mission. Many ofthe center's programs are offeredfor credit and involve reading and writing assignments. Additionally, faculty are encouraged to in­corporate social concerns in their teaching, research and advising. 
"It is one of the center's goals to have people in all disciplines aware of how they can tie social concerns into any work they are doing," explained Kathleen Maas Weigert, faculty liaison and academic coor­dinator. 
As many students get involved in social service during their time at Notre Dame, it is only natural that these people want to continue theirendeavors. About IOpercent of each graduating class decides to do ser­vice after graduation. 
Since its opening, the CSC has reached thousands of individuals. It has provided students with opportunities to come in con­tact with, and gain an understanding of, the· community around them. It has facilitated the integration of faith and academics. It has enhanced the university's mission. 
AsWeigertdescribedit, ''TheCSCislike a revolving door. It is not necessarily the place where service happens, but it is a . place where we both bring people in and send people out. We're constantly encour­aging people to go into the community and experience. We're constantly inviting people to come back into the center and reflect." 0

Campus Watch 
. . BY THE GIPPER 
Attitude,-A'zlegations andlnnuendo 

Greetings, incoming students! Let the Gipp here be tlie first towel­come you to Notre Dame. Since 
you do not know who the Gipp is, he'll bring you up to speed. But first, he should take care of one informality that you have no doubt already caught on to: he always refers to himself in the third person. The reason for this does not lie in some form of schizophrenic disorder, but rather in a tra­dition that started for no apparent reason. This Gipp doesn't know why the tradition started, but it sure makes writing this col­umn areal pain. Just deal with it. 
THESCOOP 

" Now, let's bring you up ·10 speed. CampusWatch is an anonymous column dedicated to bringing you, the reader, the humorous, the out of the ordinary and the. potentially scandalous events that occur at Notre Dame. This has made the Gipp Numero Uno on the administration's Top Ten MostWantedlist. Apparently, they do notliketheincrlminatingrumorsthatsome­times make itinto the Gipp' s column. The powers that· be even threatened to shut .Scholastic down unless the Gipp revealed his identity and his sources. The end seemed imminent until someone decided to remind them that this was post-Revolu­tionaryWar Americawithsomethingcalled aConstitutioncontaining somethingcalled the First Amendment. God, I love this countty! In the end, good prevailed, the evil forces were vanquished and the Gipp rode off into the sunset It was all very drmnatic. So now, .the Gipp charges on. 
JUST FOR STARTERS 

Even though Notre Danie is THE great­est university iri the world, there ~e some things the Gipp thinks you should knmu. The Gipp may sound bitter, but there are certain aspects of Notre Dame that are going to beaconsiantsourceofcomplaints 
for years, until you are finally lulled into an apathetic trance. So to brace you and save ·you from potential shock, here are a few of· 
them: 
Parietals 

Ah, yes! This is the topic which will forever be hated and debated but never abolished. For those of you who don't know, parietals are those pesky little rules that state that members ofthe opposite sex cannot be in: your room after 2:00 a.m. on weekends andmidnight on weekdays. Ap­parently, the administration believes these 
. to be the witching hours when innocent Catholic boys and girls become raging bundles of hormones hoping to indulge in sinandsex. Everyyearwehearrumorsthat the issue is under consideration. Yeah, right. If youjustignore thesenasty rumors, you won't feel as let down when nothing results from the "negotiations." TheGipp has just two words for you: off campus. But, hey, at least someorie always makes a bundle with the ever-present "Sex Kills ... SocometheNotreDameandliveforever." T-shirts. 
Ethanol 

Somewhere outside campus there is an ethanol plant which, well, produces etha­nol. Unfortunately, one of its by-products is a very distinct and mind-numbingstench which becomes particularly . poignant in cold or rainy weather. Since that's the scopeof SouthBend'sforecast, it becomes prettymuchaconstant. Don'tworry,you'll get used to it and the occasional dizziness which it sometimes causes. 
Weather 

Many of you will be fooled when you first arrive here in what would appear to be sunny, balmy South Bend. Well, let the Gipp be the first to infonn you that after about the second week of classes, the sun

Add to this scenario win­ters which have been known to inflict frost bite on students simply walking to class. University of Hawaii this ain't. 
The Bookstore

Oh, the bookstore does let you sell your books back to them at the end of the year, but those $80 books are then worth only $15. What's more, that same book will be resold at $75 next year. The Gipp must apologizeforthisdiatribe-he'sjustbitter that he couldn't even buy a pack of ciga­rettes with the money he got back for his · books. 
The Gipp knows this column seems a little bitter,buthewarnedyou. Hemustsay that he wouldn't go to school anywhere else. For starters, we've got football, tradi­tion and tailgating, which is considered a sport here. The Gipper could go on, but he doesn'twantto soundlikesome sappy little tour guide inundating you with plugs about his/her school -you probably have had your fill ofthem.

The Blue-Gold game usually pro­vides a view of what is to come, but Irish fans were anxious when at halftime the scoreboard read 0-0.

You think that because you can't throw a football like RonPowlus or kick a soccer ball like Cindy Daws, your athletic career is over? Think again. 

· by Jake Schaller 

UnderthegazeofTouchdownJesus, in the fabled Notre Dame Sta­clium, in front of a rabid crowd two teams in full football gear square off. It is fourth down and long, and one of the teams lines up for a field goal attempt Digginginto thetrenches, thedefenserushes in and blocks the kick, sending half of the crowd into hysterics. If I told you that those two teams were Notre Dame and Michigan, you probably would believe me. But what if I told you that the, two teams were not varsity squads, but Zahm and Morrissey, two interhall teams? At any other college campus in the country, this scenario would seem almost impossible. At Notre Dame, it's a reality. With interhall sports ranging from football to floor hockey, Notre Dame boasts one of the most extensive recreational sports pro­grams in the country. 
Almost 80 percent of Notre Dame's stu­dent body played a varsity sport in high school, but few can play varsity in college. As a result, many former high school ath­letes fear the endoftheir competitive sports careers. But at Notre Dame, these students have the opportunity for a new beginning. "Not only was I able to continue playing sports that I played in high school, I also started playing some other sports that I always wanted to play," said junior Mat­thew Campbell. RecSports also helps stu­dents to stay in shape. 
What really separates Notre Dame's 
In addition to the many RecSports activities Notre Dame has club teams, like the Rugby team (left) and the Ski Team (right). 
Other students try boxing in Notre Dame's Bengal Bouts (below right), and almost everyone plays Bookstore Basketball (below left), the world's largest outdoor five-on­fIve tournament. 
RecSports from other campus' programs, however, is the interhall rivalries. Teams are made up ofmembers of the dorms and even off-campus students. This means that when two teams clash on the athletic field, the pride of the dorm is at stake. A match­up between Alumni and Dillon or Zahm and Keenan can mean bragging rights for thesemester. Don'tbesurprisedtosee300­500 fans at these games. 
Club sports offer adclitional · opportuni­ties for student athletes . at Notre Dame. These are non-varsity athletic teams that compete against other schools. 
So even ifyou can 'trun the 40-yard dash in under five seconds, and you can't throw a football like Ron Powlus, your athletic careerdoesn'thavetoendatNotreDame.D

DO YOU KNOW YOUR MOTHER? 
We all have a mother who can give us abundant joy, peace, courage, strength, wisdom, and consolation, at all times and in all places. What do we have to do to receive these things? Just ask. · 
Mary is always ready to give them to us, but we seldom ask for them. No 
l 
matter what we are doing or where we are, ifwe earnestly ask Her for guidance and 
help, ifwe ask Her how She would have done i( if we ask Her to do it with us, if we 
offer whatever we are doing to Her, then She will bless it. 
The Children of Mary and the Knights of the Immaculata are two student groups that try to accept Our Mother's invitation to experience Her love daily. To do this, we are involvedin many activities. We meet daily to pray the rosary with Our Mother and to receive Her Son in the Eucharist. Following the examples of St. Louis de Montfort, St. Maxamillian Kolbe, and our current Pope, we consecrate ourselves to the Immaculate I!eart ofMary once a semester. We also adore Jesus in the blessed 
sacrament, go on retreats, volunteer at the homeless shelter, hang out together, and eat Jeanine's cookies 
(she's a good cook).· 

We invite you to join us for any or all of these activities. You can do something every day or just .once a semester. You don't need to know anything at all about Mary. (I can attest to that, because a year ago I knew absolutely nothing about Her, including how to pray the rosary). To get involved sing up with us at activities night in August, or call Dave Eichstadt, Danny Eisenbacher, or me, Tony Pillari. Oh, and if you get a chance, put in a good word for me with Mom. ·

A brief description often films essential for 
Rudy: A definite must-see for any
Notre Dame social survival 
Notre Dame.Freshman. 
by Chris Myers 

We here at Scholastic are detennined to make your tran­sition from high school to college painless as possible. We've provided you with all the infonnation on what to bring, what to leave at home, what to expect when you get here, and now, what to watch. Yes, seeing the right movies before you get here is essential for campus social survival. To be left speechless after someone asks your favorite scene inHoly Grail is more than a mere conversational faux pas -it could forever seal your fate as social reject. While we recommend you don't go overboard and start renting arthouse movies named after colors or containing the word "Papaya," (God forbid you start to sound like a film school dweeb) we do ask that you check out the following list of movies over the summer so you can be prepared to answer such pressing questions like, "Who's cooler, White or Pink?" Our top ten choices: 
l. The Star Wars Trilogy. George Lucas' sci-fl, intergalactic epic should be at the top of your list. Multiple viewings of it in donn rooms throughout the year create some of the most identifi­able film talk on campus. Overlooking the now-retro special effects, those dopey Ewoks in Jedi and all of Mark Hamill's "acting," the trilogy presents topics and ideas that can easily be incorporated into any theology, philosophy or literature class. Classic. 
2. 
NationalLampoon'sAnimalHouse. Sophomorichumorat its primitive best. From the opening motto, "Knowledge is Good," this senseless, panty-raiding, beer-guzzling, food-fighting film is closer to Notre Dame than any administrator would be willing to admit. 

3. 
Caddyshack. Another senseless, sophomoric comedy deal­ing with the complex relationship between working toward a college scholarship and golf. Rodney Dangerfield has yet to get a better role than the obnoxious, insult-spewing AlCzervik. Crude, offensive and funny as hell. Why women don't get this movie is beyond any man's comprehension. 

4. 
Rudy. Hoosiers on the football field -at Notre Dame! Saccharine-sweet, beat-the-odds story is strictly of the been-there, 


· done-that variety, but beautiful footage ofN otre Dame makes fun for repeat viewing. A definite must-see to understand the "now he's a janitor" jokes on campus at every mention of the word "Ruettiger." 
5. Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Too complex to explain in one paragraph. Hollywood golden-boy-of-the-month Quentin 
· Tarantino's one-two cinematic punch has caused pages of the Internetto swell with idle chatterover how Mr. Pink was killed and the symbolism of Ezekiel 25: 17. The ear scene, adrenaline shot, tipping debate, foot massage conversation ... ifyou don'tget it, it's just not worth trying to explain. 



6. 
Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Possibly the highest laugh-per-minute ratio of any existing movie. From knights who say "nee" to deadly rabbits, every scene is instantly recognizable at the first drop ofa line. Some consider it high comedy, others a pointless waste of time. You decide. 

7. 
The TNT Late Night Classics. At two a.m. every Saturday, TNT shows. either one of two movies: Strange Brew or Clash of the Titans. Both are bad, have cheap special effects and more camp than a Boy Scout Jamboree. Face it though, Jim Carrey and J effDaniels have nothingonRickMoranis andDaveThomas, and I have but two words for Jurassic Park's T-Rex: the Crackon! 

8. 
The Graduate. Story ofBenjamin Braddock, a college grad student who ''comes of age" over the summer (Read between the lines on that one). Dustin Hoffman's genius-turned-slacker plays closer to Generation X-ers than Ethan Hawke and Matt Dillon combined, Unceremoniously spoofed in Wayne's World 2, the film is just.as relevant now as it was 25 years ago. Anne Bancroft 



The Star Wars Trilogy 
presents topics and ideas that can easily be incorporated into any theology, philosophy or literature 
, class. 

putting on her.stockings is reason enough for the rental. 
9. 
DeadPoet'sSociety. PeterWeir'spreppyShakespearemovie is perfectly suitable for every taste. Robin Williams has since reduced himself to dressing in drag, but his dramatic tum in DPS earned him a deserving Oscar nomination. Literate, stylish and smart, this is a thinking man's date movie. You'11 laugh, you'11 cry, etc., etc. 

10. 
Knute Rockne, AllAmerican. Beating Rudy to the punch by almost five decades, this is the original Notre Dame nostalgic Win One For The Gipper movie. Classier and more heartfelt than Rudy, Knute is actually a worthwhile rental for any college football fan. Greatest difference between the two: Rudy went on to do Encino Man with geek-boy Pauly Shore, The Gipp became presi­dent with geek-boy Ge:_0rge Bush. Need I saymore? · D

By Habukkuk 

And behold a pale horse, and he that sat 
upon him, his name was Death, and hell followed him. 
-Rev. 6:8 

Sometimes when I lie awake at night I can see his evil smile, his pearly­whites glistening in the light of the moon and the acrid stench of onion breath lingering in the air as tears stream down my face. I hear him whisper softly, "Room­mate-Room -mate-be-my-friend," a monotonou·s chant that pounds my brain like a tiny hammer, pushing me toward the frayed ends of sanity. "DEVIL, BE GONE!" I yell into the darkness. I wish it were only a chance nightmare, soon to be forgotten. But alas, these scars run deep. As an incoming freshman, I was bom­barded with propaganda regarding the "Spirit of Notre Dame," a place so harmo­nious that students often frolic with deer on the quad, and iftired, a baby squirrel might curl up in your lap. A naive freshman, I blindly bought into this spirit In turn, the spirit gave me a cell block for a room and a roommate whose high school class voted him Most Likely to Receive a Restraining Order. I arrived on campus early, courtesy of NROTC orientation, and got situated be­fore my special ouddy showed up. Oh, the excitement, the fervor! I eagerly awaited my roommate's arrival, anticipating the wonderfulmemories thatwouldsurelycome as a result of male bonding. After a delight­ful dinner, courtesy of the dead Colonel who does chicken right, I returned to find theroom destroyed, butstill withoutaroom­mate. Boxes, a pre-McCarthy television and an inordinate number of obscure books littered my happy haven. Since no one was around, I decided to browse through my roommate's wealth of literature, pausing briefly to enjoy such classics as Footwear ofthe Incas and Advanced Cat Grooming. Now more of a mystery to me than ever, I pondered the student behind the books. 
That mystery was unveiled in its entirety an hour later as I had the fortune to meet his entire family. Walking into my room, I waltzed straight into a scene from the Par­tridge Family. Little kids, big kids, a mom and a dad were all enjoying a beautiful family moment when I interrupted them. I scanned the crowd and soon figured out who the 18 year-old was among the group. To break the awkward silence I introduced myself. 
"Hi, there. I'm Habakkuk." (I have replaced the names of the involved parties with those of minor prophets.) 
"I'mZephaniah,"herespondedinaquiet, unenthused voice. Because my roommate was not the social bumblebee I had hoped for, his parents came to his rescue by means of small talk. 
Thenextday,asZephaniah'sparentsleft, I didn't notice the "Good Luck" signs that Zeph's siblings hung out the window of theirfamily trucksternortheminiaturehorns that had begun to sprout from his head. 
Once on his own, Zephaniah followed me like a faithful dog, never speaking, but constantly on my heels. I searched for some subject that would spark his interest, but even the story about my cat's fur ball puk­ingproblem died a quick death. He was my shadow, and only when I went into the bathroom did hereluctantly leave me alone. If, by chance, I managed to elude him, he immediately went back to the room, an instinctual reflex that amused me to no end. Yet, as the school year wore on, he became 
increasingly harder to evade, a gnat whose 
intolerable presence left me .angry at the 
world. 
Atthesametime, thisgnathadafetishfor 

onions to such an extent that I allowed for a 
three-hour dissipation period after meals 
before attempting to go back to the room, 
where he was usually catching an episode 
ofJeopardy! Even to this day, Alex Trebek 
is the only person I know who could bring 
a smile to Zeph' s face. 
But. there is nothing that annoyed me 

more than his compulsive desire to rear­
range the room. In total, we went through 
six entire room overhauls, completely con­
ducted by him and always to my complete 
surprise. At one point, he put the bunk 
across the middle of the room, effectively 
dividing our nine0 foot wide room in half. 
Because he gave me the half with the sink 
and the door,I forbade him to walk onto my 
side, thereby trapping this Bob-Vila-on­
speed in his own creation. For him, it was 
a decorating flaw that drove him nuts. For 
me, it was a small victory in a year of pain. 
By and large, Zephaniah plagued me like . 
a popcorn kernel shell stuck between my' molars. Yet I managed to survive, passing the torch to another unsuspecting person. It is a plague that I wish upon no one, but if . you do end up with a roommate from the underworld, keep your head up and never forget the words of Nietzsche, ''That which does notkill you only makes you stronger."

Katie E. Wiltout was the 1994-95 editor-in-chiefof 
Scholastic Magazine and is a recent alumna ofNotre Dame. She is currently working for the Indianapolis News.

''Myroomisnotdominatedbyanyone 
aspectofmypersonality;insteaditis 
a sampling ofthe kind of person that I've become through my high school years. It is interesting to think ofthe changes the nextfour years in my life will bring, and how those changes will be reflected within the walls of my dorm room." 
I wrote that paragraph four and a half years ago as part of my application to Notre Dame. Browsing through someoldfiles the otherday, I came across the application. The manually typewrittenpersonal state­ment made the application look older than its four and half years. I marveled at how much even my signa­ture has changed. As I face graduation, it is time for me to stop and take a look around before I leave. 
In the personal statement of my Notre Dame appli­cation, I described my room and how it reflected the person I was. I named some ofthe books on my shelf, the cassettes in my stereo, the posters on.my wall. I. explained where the furniture came from and who made the quilt on my bed. 
In the last paragraph of the essay, the one excerpted above, I wondered what my dorm room would look like in four years. I think I already sensed how many changes I would go through in college. My room, I assumed, would manifest those changes. The book titles would change, old posters wouldby replaced by new, the cassette collection would grow. 
None of that has happened to the extent that I expected, although change has thoroughly colored me. But I have not had a single room whose walls could reflect the subtle alteration ofmy character. In college, the opposite happened -the rooms I've occupied have affected me on the inside. 
To begin with, I pictured a dorm room as relatively static and stable for four years. As I was growing up, the papered, poster-covered walls and wooden floor ofmy room were a physical sanctuary for me as well as a mental haven. During the changing decor of my youth, that fact was a constant · 
College changed all that -mostly by assigning roommates who would claim the same 13' x 8' space as theirhome, too. It was an unsettling experience for me to be forced to find refuge somewhere outside my room. As roommate squabbles escalated freshman year,Ispentlessandlesstimeinmyroom. Bytheend

of the year, it was simply someplace to sleep. That I had changed was obvious -but the walls of my room did not reflect it. 
I also never expecte<,l to live in many different rooms with many different people. Traditionally, Notre Dame students stay in the same dorm for four years. I thought I would be no different. 
Onceagain,Iwaswrong. Imovedfromacramped triple in an old dorm to a more spacious double in a new dorm between freshman and sophomore years. Junior year was an even bigger adjustment. I left the protective environment of campus housing for a flat in the middle of London. More important than gaining five rooms was gaining seven roommates, all new acquaintances. 
I did not change the room where I slept for four monthsortheflatweinhabitedinLondon. Itbearsno marks of my personality or time there. But those walls, bare though they may have been, affected me. They silently observed me test my independence, hesitatingly at first, then more strongly with each passing day. The walls stayed firm as my mind was stretched, opened and infused by my encounters with another culture and history. 
And then we moved out, as quickly and noisily as we had moved in. I found it disconcerting to leave London so easily. Simply packing up two suitcases, was not enough of a transition. 
I wanted our moving out to mirror the semester. Butitwouldhave taken too many tractor trailers to fill if physical possessions were the only measure of whom I had become in the course of a semester. I learned that a room or house or apartment is not static and stable, though its solid walls off er protection and security. It is more than a showcase of cherished objects, a place to display likes and dislikes. 
A room creates space for living, and life cannot be displayed by photographs or cassettes. It exists in actions and interactions, in raucous conversations around the dinner table or hushed late-night talks in thekitchen. WhenlleaveNotreDamenextweek, the walls ofmy room will be blank and foreboding. Only my mind willremembertheassortmentof places I've lived and the dozen people who accompanied me. The rooms will remain, ready for the infusion of freshmen and the life they bring with them.
