LETTERS
Athens, February 1, 1947
Dear Fellow Students:
We send you our greeting from Greece; at last—after the very many catastrophes and terrible damages that our country has suffered during the occupation. We begin just now to settle our schools and university. We wanted so much to come in touch with you, but we had not any chance for that. So I decided to write you myself, representing my class, and ask you some informations about your studies and life in the university.
You must first excuse me for my mistakes (as I have enough) because as you understand it is not a long time since I learn English. I don’t want to believe that you won’t excuse me that. So I dare to write to you, doing at the same time practice in writing English letters. And now let me write you our news and ideas.
The last year all students have a unique mania to come to America. That’s the modern mania. We have heard a lot of your good education. Our class lives with the hope that some day after some years we will be able with the exchange of students to come there. Our high schools and university are full of thousands of students, and we haven’t enough laboratories or equipment for these. It is enough that our buildings stand up. But I don’t think it is so pleasant, our condition, so I stop telling these.
Please, write me about your own studies, youi- books, and if you can, some things about our branch of Science which is called “Naturalism.” If you want to know our life in detail, you can begin writing to us and have a kind of correspondence with us.
We send you our best friendly love.
A boy student of the University of Athens—

Sir:
One of your columnists threw a barb at one of the Chicago dailies in the February 14th issue. In the same issue the editorial staff employed one of that paper’s most flagrant practices. The practice of meeting criticism with countercriticism and mud slinging in order to avoid giving answer to your critics is not one condoned by more ethical journalists. Yet you employed just such a method on the complaint of Mr. McBitters.

PRINTS OF THE PAST

Feb. 4: A return lecture by Mr. Seu-mas MacManus went over like a lead balloon in Washington Hall last Thursday night. The slim audience on hand evidenced that Seumas’ last lecture had been well remembered at Notre Dame. . . . Apr. 15: The Chicago Cubs took a 9 to 1 measure of the Varsity at the West Side grounds yesterday. . . . May 6: Loyola of Chicago collected eleven errors and only one hit, as the Varsity romped to a 15 to 1 victory Monday afternoon. . . . Nov. 4: Our- football team smothered Loyola 80 to 0 here Saturday. The score was only tied once. . . .Nov. 11: Knute Rockne, Notre Dame’s nonIrish left end, ran 40 yards for the only score against Pitt last week, but the ball was called back because the referee’s whistle had not formally opened the second quarter, and the game ended in a nothing to nothing tie. . . . Dec. 11: A lecture by Dr. Banks on the Nile River-kept the Washington Hall audience flooded with a constant stream of information last Friday forenoon.

REVIEW aid COMMENT
By JIM LARRICK
The indifferent and critical attitude of many Americans to things worthwhile is surprising and bewildering. Copland might write a symphony in. all sincerity and Kenneth Patchen might write a book, putting every bit of his personal, honest integrity in it, but always there are those who will find flaws and with vicious glee will tear it to pieces like a mischievous dog working intently on a prized rug. They entirely disregard a thing’s beauty, and its many good points in their search for imperfections. The U. S., and perhaps the whole world, is in a mood—an age—of caustic self-destruction and sees hardly anything good in today’s products.
Criticism is not at all a bad thing, but we should remember that destructive criticism-for-criticism’s-sake has in theory, and to a great extent in actuality, torn down our structure a thousand times but never once offered a suitable alternative. A return to the past, as

OSCAR TAKES A MIDNIGHT ...
Sprints to corner of Michigan and Washington only to find the last bus has left. Says a prayer for the Northern Indiana Transit Co. and looks at his watch. 11:47. Sprints for another block and comes to halt in front of Oliver Hotel. Spies a taxi and opens door. Spies occupants and closes door. Mutters something about taxi passengers. 11:53. Feels an itch in vicinity of his 24th vertebrae. Relieves itch by scratching. Also makes mental note to leave Anastasia ten minutes earlier next time. Sees another taxi pull up and rushes to it, deftly elbowing elderly woman. She hits the deck, Oscar hops in cab. Tells unconcerned driver his destination and pleads for speed. Red light momentarily halts progress, so he talks to God about South Bend traffic lights. S'ix minutes later, cab pulls up to circle. Pays driver as clock is striking midnight and in his haste, forgets to wait for nickel change. Thinks about it as he runs a 220 across deserted campus, taking shortcut over grass. Trips over stretched wire. Spitting out a mixture of dirt, grass, snow, and two teeth, he talks not only to God, but also to the entire assemblage of saints about invisible wires. Arrives at Sorin out of breath, wakes up watchman, signs in. 12:00 midnight.

ON FOREIGN FIELDS ...
Last week the girl’s varsity swimming team of Swarthmore beat the Univ, of Pennsylvania, 37-20. Rumors are flyin’ that Army is feverishly trying to drop Swarthmore from its ’49 schedule. ’Tis said the kaydets are planning to replace them with Rosary College in order to give the athletic contest a more intersectional appeal.

YA FADDER'S MUSTACHE . . .
We hate to take issue with anyone (it says here in fine print), particularly a fellow columnist, but in last week’s issue of the Scholastic, M. Jacques O’Connor advocates abolishing all formal dances at ND because our lads don’t possess tuxes. According to Professor O’, anyone who has a tux is 1) a professional fop, or 2) a dandy whose background has allowed him anything his heart desires. Far be it from us to criticize, but isn’t JAO the same person who
runs an item weekly about the “best dressed man on campus?”
Our compiling of the sentiments of Caf Habitues, Rec Hall Ramblers, and Rockne Rowdies leads to the general conclusion that The Week is all wet. Not a few of the men have their own soup ’n fish because:
1)	They sing in the Glee Club.
2)	They do (or used to) play with a band
3)	They hopped table at the hometown Stratigon
4)	They were croupiers at Monte Carlo
5)	They put on billiard exhibitions
6)	They were Wheels in the Banquet League
7)	They had the foresight to recognize their needs when they got to college.
If Mr. O’Connor can’t afford to buy or rent a tux, why in blazes doesn’t he hit one of the lads in the above seven categories who is not planning to attend the dance? A little forethought might have saved him a lot of bother—or perhaps he just didn’t have enough copy for last week’s column.
At the week’s end, the issue was still in doubt. Consensus on campus seemed to be, however, “O’Connor should go to the wall.”
♦
Speaking of dances though, the thought is brought to mind that a radical change has taken place hereabouts. Either Seniors are filthy with dough (at Uncle Sugar’s expense) or else there’s someone they wish to impress very badly. At the Senior meeting to discuss plans for this year’s Senior Ball, Chairman Rudy Anderson announced that the price of bids would be ten skins. To our astonishment, not a dissenting word was heard. Shades of that 55c Blue Plate Special!

Death came last week to cinemactor Sidney Toler, portrayer of Charlie Chan for lo these beaucoup years since the demise of Warner Oland, the original Chinese private-eye. But the passing of Mr. Toler should in no way throw a block into the producers’ plans to turn out more atrocities based on the sleuthing of Earl Derr Biggers’ philosophical Chinese. Already they are no doubt grooming some luckless character for the job. We’d like to see Charles Laughton cast in the role; he’s fat and stupidlooking, and deserves such punishment for his last attempt, that hilarious “Because of Him.” If not Laughton, then how about Edmund Lowe; he’s about ready for the gate. But better yet, a woman, a female Charlotte Chan! Kate Hepburn’s our gal; she’d look as good in a sack-like palm-beach suit as in anything else she’s ever worn. Yep! Kate’s our choice.

ND has had to cope with bulb-snatchers and fire-bugs before, but now it’s sugar-bowl snafflers. Seems the cafeteria has missed about three dozen sugar jars within the last month or so. Breakage can’t account for that many. Somebody is chucking them away in his mattress. One point investigators have overlooked: they could have been ground up and served in some of that unidentified bilge.

Women have long monopolized the wearing of underground fortifications, all sorts of bolstering harness which can make an Aphrodite out of a lister bag. But the men have not been idle. Middleaged business-men have hid their paunches in broad girdles. Uplifts on their heels have boosted many a short movie actor or ballroom performer up to the eye-level of his partner. But now it comes, a boon to the bony wretches! Shoulder-pads in shirts! No longer will people laugh when you take off your size forty-two sport-coat and reveal your Ich-abodish frame. For now every man can have a build like Bill Russell without as much as doing a push-up in a semester. Gym classes will fall off. Why workout at the Rock when Max Adler can get you a V-man physique for a few miserable bucks? These deltoid-falsies will revolutionize mens’ styles. Now if they can only guarantee a built-in personality
with every suit of clothes, that’ll be something.

Something ought to be done about this scheduling everything for the same night. A week or so ago the following were going on the same evening! Vet’s Club meeting to propose new elections, Knights of Columbus meeting, debate in Washington Hall against Mich. State’s all-girl team, tests in the Engineering and Commerce buildings which pulled hundreds of men away from other important, although extra-curricular, activities, and a talk by Colonel Brown. Now we know of a lot of people who would like to have attended several of these meetings and lectures had they been on separate nights. There ought to be a central clearing house that will regulate these evening get-togethers. Colonel Brown is certainly due for a repeat command performance, and the Vets are due some consideration in getting an evening and an hour that does not conflict with tests or other activities.
❖
The Telephone Hour, which follows the Firestone Hour on Monday nights at 8 p.m. will have as its guest Monday night, February 24, the celebrated Italian tenor, recently arrived in the United States, Tagliavini. Music critics and opera devotees have proclaimed Signore Tagliavini the greatest, and certainly the smoothest, operatic tenor to warble at the Met. It should be well worth listening to.
♦
The Vets are holding their campus elections in the near future. Long a gripe against the Veterans Club, and for that matter any student organization, is that they do nothing startling, like smash tradition, remove the Dome, call a lynch-party and hang Mr. Ford, or demand the student trip for ’47 be the trek to Los Angeles for the U9C game. Veterans better wise up; they can do none of the above, they can wield no club over the administration, they can start no fires. Best they can do is set good example, encourage a few constructive changes, and have a few social get-togethers and sit around and tell war-stories. The rabid vet, like the buffalo, is a vanishing species.

Uia iditiA'i 2>ed& . .
Our nerves are shattered. What’s more, we’re beginning to realize more and more the futility of all life.
Until last week we were living a fairly normal life. We went to classes, peeked into texts at infrequent intervals, attended the cinema from time to time, and occasionally dropped in at Kewpee’s for a hamubruger and coke. But all nomality is gone from us now; we are no longer carefree, but mature and fully conscious of all life’s tragic aspects.
It started on Monday, and by Saturday we were verging on the morbid, if not the psychotic. It really started Sunday night when we innocently walked into a downtown restaurant to transact a bit of business over dinner with one of our comrades. He was there, all right, but with a date and two other couples. We’re pretty bitter about him. Things would have been bad enough without having the girls turn out to be St. Mary’s lasses. To say that we were flustered by the presence of such august company is hardly the word; we were palpitating. After staggering from the restaurant and recovering from our dazed condition, we realized we had a blind date for the following Saturday with one of the fabulous St. Mary’s females.
Monday followed Sunday, just as surely as our Social Problems prof unerringly throws quizzes the days we’re not prepared. We stepped to the phone to call the blind date for confirmation and make final arrangements. Over the instrument buzzed the sound that was to become maddeningly familiar before the week was out: the busy signal. The other St. Mary’s number brought the same result. There is a third phone across the lake, we understand, but only a select few hundred are given the number. We are not one of them.
We continued dialing S't. Mary’s two phones; always the lines were busy. We called between classes, before lunch, after lunch, and before and after dinner; we broke away from bull sessions to hasten to a phone, and once we even woke from a sound sleep at two in the morning with the fixed idea of telephoning, only to be discouraged by our roommate. We had reached the point where we were certain a conspiracy existed to prevent us from completing a call, but our roommate, who is wise in such matters, assured us that it was a problem common to all ND men. Thursday afternoon, at 2:19, we parked ourselves in a booth and started ringing, every minute on the minute. Hunger and exhaustion had weak
ened us by 6:02 when success finally crowned us; instead of the busy signal we heard long, steady rings. The phone rang and rang without producing results, but we hung on grimly. At 6:17 someone lifted the receiver. Weakly we asked for our date. “Sorry,” came the impersonal reply, “the girls are having dinner and can not answer the phone.” When 17 students dragged us out of the booth we had already eaten the receiver and had started on the mouthpiece.
By the next day we had recovered to the extent that our schizophrenic personality was only quarter-split and we started all over again. On Saturday someone told us that the long line that always formed before one of the booths was the Notre Dame solution of the problem. Somebody would get through to St. Mary’s early in the morning and as each completed his call, the girl at the other end would call the next one. After standing in line for several hours we had our turn at the phone, and we were in such a condition that we had lost absolutely all our ethical values. We didn’t have even a twinge of conscience at the idea of cheating the telephone company of five cents.
We’re afraid that our date was just a bit suspicious of us. We were alternately sobbing for all the wasted hours and laughing in sheer relief as we talked over the phone. We’re even more afraid that she had more than suspicions that night when we dropped around to pick her up. She was a lovely, charming creature, but during the evening she seemed to be always shying away from us. Not that we blame her. Considering our state of mind we are grateful that she risked her sanity by going with us at all.
Of one thing we are certain: never again will we date a St. Mary’s girl via telephone. If such a happy occasion ever rises again we will use the mails or Western Union. The probability is, though, that we will forsake women entirely to devote our time Jo a holy crusade. Convinced as we are that two phones are not enough to service some 500-odd women, we are organizing the League for the Preservation of the Sanity of Notre Dame Men by Installing More Telephones at St. Mary’s.
Should a hollow-cheeked, blazing-eyed individual call upon you in the near future, do not slam your door in his face. It will be us in our official capacity as founder of the LPSNDMIMTSM seeking names for a petition begging St. Mary’s authorities to please, please, add more phones.

STUDENT MUSICAL TO OPEN MARCH 2; TO PRESENT FIVE PERFORMANCES
Rehearsals for “Meet the Missus” were in full swing this week as leading roles in the new all-student musical comedy were announced by George Bariscillo, producer of the show. Cast as a Notre Dame student and his wife will be Roy O’Neil and Agnes Haney. O’Neil is a featured soloist in the Glee Club, and Miss Haney returns to Washington Hall following a leading role in the 1943 hit, “Let’s Get Going.”
Other leads in the large cast include Mary Kay Amberg, Ralph Thorson, Mary Ann Wack, and Tom Devine. In addition to the many speaking parts, there will be a unique faculty chorus and a mixed chorus of twenty-two voices. Altogether 51 students and girls will be on the stage, and all are hard at work preparing for opening night, March 2. The girls for “Meet the Missus” were recruited from the adjacent communities of South Bend and Vet Village.
The musical numbers for the show are the result of months of work by Ed Cashman, a graduate student in the Department of Music. Twelve original songs
Meet the Missus—Seated at the piano running over one of the new tunes is Ed Cashman, composer of music and lyrics for the show, while standing (left to right) are George Bariscillo, the producer; Jim Murphy, one of the script-writers; and Noel Digby, the show's director. ■
will be introduced in the show, two of which will be staged as large ensemble numbers. The title song and such others as “Love is in the Air” and “My Affair” indicate that cupid is invading the Notre Dame campus for an all-out offensive this spring.

Performances of "Meet the Missus" will be given on March 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. Tickets will be distributed in the basement of the Dining Hall between the hours of 11:30-1:30 and 5:30-7:00 on Thursday and Friday, February 27 and 28. Because of the unusual demand for seats at the previous student musical comedy, athletic books must be presented when obtaining tickets. Married veterans may obtain tickets for their wives.
Fr. Graner Named Bishop of Dacca
VATICAN CITY.—Feb. 18—The Congregation of Rites has announced the nomination of the Rev. Lawrence Leon Graner, C.S.C., as bishop of Dacca, India. Father Graner, a member of the Congregation of Holy Cross, studied at the University of Notre Dame prior to his theological studies at the Catholic University, Washington, D. C. He was ordained in 1928 and was sent as a missionary to the diocese of Dacca.
(Father Graner returned from India a few months ago to serve as a delegate to the General Chapter of the Holy Cross Fathers. He had also been named a con-suitor on the Provincial Chapter. He was born in Franklin, Pa., and had the distinction of being ordained to the priesthood by the Most Rev. George Finnegan, C.S.C., his former superior at Holy Cross Seminary. He served as a missionary from 1928-35, and 1937-45 in Dacca, a mission field entrusted to the care of the American Province of the Holy Cross Fathers.
Father Graner declined at presstime to comment on his nomination which was released through the Associated Press because he has not received official notification from Vatican City.)
Juniors to Elect Prom Committee Chief Monday
The Junior Prom Committee, appointed last week by the Student Council and headed by Larry Turner, announces a special meeting for the entire junior class next Monday night at 7:30 in the Law auditorium. Purpose: the election of a committee chairman and the discussion of plans for the annual dance.
Turner’s group, appointed because of the lack of junior class officers, has already laid tentative plans, set May 2 as the dance’s probable date, and nominated the following six men for the chairmanship: George Sullivan, John White, John McCormack, Thomas Higgins, Thomas Jackson, and Joseph De-Spigno.

To Hold Senior Ball At Palais on May 16
After a respite of four years,. Notre Dame’s number one social event, the Senior Ball, will become a reality once more Friday night, May 16, at the Palais Royale in South Bend.
For the first time since 1942, seniors will be presented with a gala week-end that will equal in every degree the standards of pre-war festivities, for besides the main attraction Friday evening, the Ball committee has arranged with Coach Frank Leahy to have the Old Timers’ football game played in the Stadium the following afternoon, May 17. Plans are also in the making to hold a “Candlelight Dance” Saturday evening at a nearby country club.
Placing arrangements for the grandiose occasion in capable and experienced hands, President John Mastrangelo this week appointed Elmer Matthews and Rudy Anderson to act as co-chairmen. With the approval of the chairmen, Mastrangelo further announced committee heads as follows: Herb Daiker, arrangements; Willoughby Marshall, decorations: Jack Galloway, tickets; Donnelly McDonald, Saturday program chairman; and Bill Waddington, publicity.
Seek Name Band
Committee heads conferred this week to consider the choice of a band but since a survey of “name” bands having open dates that night has not been completed, the selection of a band will be announced about March 1st. It was definitely decided, however, to confonn with past Senior Ball successes by naming a band of national fame.
The announcement of the price of the bid will coincide with the naming of the band for it is the price of the band that will be the prime factor in determining the cost of the bid.
The dance is scheduled to begin at 10 p. m., ending at 2 a. m. with 3 a. m. limits set for return to campus residences. Car permission will be in effect as usual.
Who Can Come?
Besides June graduates, others eligible to attend the year’s most lavish extravaganza are January ’47 grads and those who will finish either in August of this year- or January ’48. The senior class also opened the Ball to graduate students in attendance at the University.
Unfortunately, due to several restrictions, there will be a limited number of bids available for the affair which will go on sale shortly after the announcement of band around March 1st.

Attire for the occasion will be winter formals, either tux or tails. The decision to rule out summer formals was necessitated by the prohibitive rental and the insufficient number available in South Bend and vicinity. .

Budenz Inaugurates Five-Lecture Series
Louis F. Budenz, former managing editor of the Communist Daily Worker, will inaugurate a series of five lectures sponsored by the Aquinas Library with his address at the Navy Drill Hall, Sunday afternoon, March 9, at 2:30. The series will be concluded sometime in May with an address by Rt. Rev. Msgr. Fulton J. Sheen.
Budenz, who recently attracted nationwide prominence by naming Gerhard Eisler as the No. 1 U. S. Red, renounced communism in the fall of 1945 and was received into the church by Msgr. Sheen. He then accepted a post on the Notre Dame faculty, which he resigned this past summer to join the faculty of Fordham University.
Msgr. Sheen, the leading Catholic radio orator of the day, will conclude the series in May which will be announced in the near future.
The three other lectures featuring Rev. Joseph T. O’Callahan, S.J., Rev. John S. Kennedy, and Clarence E. Manion, dean of the Notre Dame Law School, will be held at the Indiana Club.
Father O’Callahan, the only chaplain to win the Congressional Medal of Honor during World War II, will speak on the topic “Roots of Heroism” on March 20, at 8:15 p. m. A professor at Holy Cross College in Worcester, Mass., Father O’Callahan won the highest award given for bravery in battle as chaplain aboard the Carrier U.S.S. Ben Franklin. With magazines exploding and flames gutting his ship, the brave padre organized fire fighting parties which despite constant enemy bombardment were able to bring the flames under control. The ship survived the heaviest losses of any Navy craft in the war, but reached port under its own power. Father O’Callahan was lauded by the commanding officer of the ship as “the bravest man I have ever seen,” and later was awarded the Medal of Honor.
Dean Manion has chosen the topic “The Fruit of Happiness” for his address to be given April 14, at 8:15. Father Kennedy, noted author and book reviewer, will speak on “Current Novels and the Catholic Reader” April 28, at 8:15.—Ed Snyder
Seniors to Present Flag to University
Washington Day Exercises, which include the traditional presentation of an American Flag by the president of the senior class to the president of the University, will be given a peacetime revival Saturday, Washington’s Birthday, at 10 a. m. in Washington Hall.
Because of the shortage of caps and gowns, the June graduating class will be attired in business suits when they form for the processional at 9:45 in front of the Main Building. The exercises, discontinued during the war, are scheduled to begin at 10 a. m. with an overture by the University Symphony Orchestra.

Commerce Dept. Starts Visual Education Program
With the preview showings of two movies to be used by the Department of Finance, a visual education program was inaugurated this wreek in the College of Commerce.
First plans for the program were formulated six months ago wrhen William Halligan, ’25, and Ray Durst, ’25, president and vice-president respectively of Hallicrafters, presented a benefaction to the college for that purpose. With the aid of the University administration, and .Dean James E. McCarthy, a committee was formed with Herbert J. Bott, professor of marketing, at the head to initiate the program.
The preview showings of two movies to be used in the Department of Finance were held during the past week prior to showings before classes. According to Dean McCarthy, although the program is still in the experimental stages, it is hoped to supplement all courses with visual aids by next fall.

WARREN FRONRATH
Perhaps, no single issue confronting the United States today is more intimately concerned with the future of world peace than our diplomatic policy toward the Soviet Union. With the purpose of stimulating consideration of this issue, this column of last week posed the question: What type of policy should the United States maintain toward Soviet Russia? Student views concerning the course to be pursued by our State Department in this matter grouped themselves into two attitudes; one of severity and intimidation, backed by the atomic bomb and military force; the other, a policy of cooperation, characterized by a willingness to compromise on the part of both parties.
The majority of students approached supported the policy of severity. They substantiated their opinion by citing past actions of the Soviet as a member of the Security Council. They pointed out the fact that Russia had taken a deliberate attitude of offensiveness and unwillingness to cooperate on the majority of issues involving her participation. They believed that Russia’s strenuous efforts to retain the veto power is indicative of her intention to continue this policy of non-cooperation despite any eTort on our part to establish an amicable relationship between the two powers. Aside from the above example, there was a deeper and more deciding factor that prompted a portion of this group to adopt such a stern attitude: that of a philosophic difference concerning religion, economics, and politics. Almost without exception, this group pointed to the lack of a common criterion of morals existing between the two nations and hence, the impossibility of trusting to treaties built upon such divergent codes. The materialism that characterizes the Russian philosophy necessarily implies a pragmatism that demands a change of policy whenever the good of the Russian people would seemingly require it, regardless of previous commitments to other nations. Also, the obvious intention of the Communist movement, as expressed by its messiah, Karl Marx, to undermine all capitalistic systems further contributed to this lack of faith in anything but a very harsh and unyielding policy toward the Russians.
The students favoring the second alternative, that of a policy of cooperation, qualified their opinion by pointing to the necessity for a reciprocal attitude to be assuiped by the Russians. Under no
circumstsances, did this group propose that we carry the full burden of establishing this cooperative policy to the point of relinquishing any portion of our basic political tenets. This arbitration-al approach, if activated under the conditions of mutual willingness to compromise, would result in a constructive settlement of differences, rather than in stalemates that foster hate and further distrust, such as the one that now exists. This group recognizes that a great gap now exists between the two powers, but they apparently have profited from the mistakes of former generations, inasmuch as they maintain that no solution exacted by force will be a lasting one. Peace depends, they believe, upon nations resorting to rational methods of settlement since only these can produce the mutual conviction and agreement so necessary for permanent accord. It must be pointed out that this group emphasized the possibility of future inconsistency in Russian policy, hence the need of maintaining an effective military force. The science students demonstrated foresight in realizing that the atomic bomb cannot remain the possession of the United States alone due to the fact that the technology necessary to produce such a weapon is the property of science in all nations. This coupled with the fact that they have a fuller realization of the destructive powers of atomic energy caused them to be more emphatic in supporting the compromise method.

Far from being overly idealistic, the thinking student is fully aware of the concrete economic, sociological, political, and moral differences that separate these two great powers. He grants that the immediate outlook is discouraging, but none the less, he firmly deplores the proneness of the majority of the students to favor force as the first rather than the last means of settling these differences. This attitude is in
opposition to what should be the basic ideals of thinking Christians and Christian nations. The people of the United States must not adopt a self-righteous attitude or self-imposed absolution regarding world maladies tut must realize and concede the great part we have played in creating the present critical situation.
Our historical attitude toward the present Russian government has consistently been one of skepticism and antagonism. From the time of its conception in 1918, when we occupied some parts of Russia with our Polar Bear forces in an attempt to destroy the revolutionary movement, we have demonstrated a refusal to cooperate with the Communist government and to extend to them the assistance that should be forthcoming from a more mature nation. It is only to be expected that this attitude has produced a similar one on the part of the Russians. Bearing in mind our initial error and the fact that we are a more mature nation, we must accept as a moral obligation the task of initiating this reconciliation with a society that is still in its formative state.
We must refuse to grant that the situation is impossible. We must firmly believe that all men share a common, innate desire to live in peace and security. Therefore, all governments must respect this common characteristic and must demonstrate a great unwillingness and hesitation in resorting to forceful physical methods of settling disputes— methods that will ultimately deprive some men of these natural rights.
Next week’s question is also a pertinent one and by its implications demands serious and thorough consideration: Do you favor peace-time military conscription in any form and do you believe that such a policy would be an effective means of insuring lasting peace?

A new method of teaching German at Northwestern University has increased by 48 per cent the facility with which students learn the language.
A survey recently compiled from scores in cooperative tests in the German department at Northwestern indicates that undergraduate students make greater progress in learning the language under a semi-intensive, two-year course introduced into the curriculum exactly two years ago, than they do under the established system of study. The revised course was instituted as part of the university’s special program for the bachelor of arts degree.

Sister Madeleva, St. Mary's President, Lectures At Washington Hall Next Week
Notre Dame will be host Thursday evening, February 27, to the renowned poet, college president, lecturer and Catholic leader, Sister M. Madeleva, C.S.C. She will talk on “The Poet and the Philosopher” in Washington Hall at 8:00 o’clock.
Sister Madeleva has been prodigiously successful in a number of fields, although she is best known as a leading Catholic poet and president of nearby St. Mary’s College. She is the author of many volumes of distinguished verse, including Selected Poems, published by MacMillan in 1939, and her poems have been widely anthologized. She is the fifth president of the Catholic Poetry Society of America, of which her good frend, the late Father Charles L. O’Donnell, C.S.C., former president of Notre Dame, was the first president.
Another unbreakable link that binds this remarkable nun to Notre Dame is the fact that she earned her master’s degree while studying here. Thus she is a member of that small but intensely loyal band that are called alumnae of this man’s institution. Her Ph.D. degree is from the University of California, and she holds honorary Litt.D. degrees from Mount Mary College (Milwaukee) and Manhattan College. Before becoming president of St. Mary’s she was president of the College of Saint-Mary-of-the-Wasatch at Salt Lake City.
Sister Madeleva, who is small of stature, is not only a good hiker, but one who counts mountain climbing among her hobbies. Add to these surprising facts that she is an enthusiastic mediaevalist who finds much of her favorite reading in the writing of the Middle English poets, although her own practice as a poet has been influenced more by the Victorian Catholic poets, Coventry Patmore, Francis Thompson and Alice Mey-nell.
Nevertheless her interests are strongly contemporary, particularly in the field of Catholic thought. Largely through her wide friendships among Catholic men of letters, she has made St. Mary’s College the frequent stopping place of a long line of distinguished Americans and Europeans, including Alfred Noyes, Robert Speaight, Elizabeth Drew, William Agar, Jacques Maritain and Morton Dauwen Zabel.
Expect what personality one will find from such an amazing background, lecture audiences and acquaintances—from
12
her birthplace in Cumberland, Wisconsin, to Oxford University, in England— know Sister Madeleva for her gentle, soft-spoken manner, her sophisticated humor and her charming but passionate sincerity.
Sister Madeleva achieved her first magazine publication over thirty years ago, largely through the help of the late Father O’Donnell. From the first she deliberately tested herself beyond Catholic columns, believing that when Catholic writers are not accepted by the non-Catholic magazines they fail on the score of art rather than because of dis
THE WEEK WITH THE STUDENT COUNCIL
Last Monday night the Student Council, at its weekly meeting in Badin Hall, disposed of the following items of business:
1.	Introduced two new members: Charles Patterson, representing the College of Arts and Letters, and John F. Hoas, from the College of Commerce.
2.	Granted permission to the Law Club to hold a smoker on Feb. 20 in the American Legion Hall at South Bend, and to the Knights of Columbus to hold an exchange meeting at La Porte, Ind., on Feb. 27. Both permissions pending the approval of the Prefect of Discipline’s Office.
3.	Introduced a motion by John R. O’Connor to install telephones at some central point in the Veteran’s Housing Center. Mr. Hoas assigned to investigate the possibility.
4.	Heard a motion by Mr. Louis Streer to lower the South Shore rates for students travelling to points between South Bend and Chicago. Motion approved and Mr. Patterson named to conduct the investigation.
5.	Heard report from Robert Shaw concerning the bridge tournament. It will be conducted on a campus-wide basis and will be sponsored by the Council. Twenty-five cent entrance fee per couple will be charged; winners to participate in nationwide college campus tournament. Those interested see Mr. Shaw, 124 Alumni Hall, before March second.
6.	Appointed Mr. Lance to temporarily handle publicity for the Student Council until such time as a Publicity Committee could be set up. The hope was expressed that at least seventy-five per cent of the items discussed in the Council meetings would be published in the Scholastic. The Council felt that it has not been getting the proper cooperation from the Scholastic staff.
7.	Heard report from Larry Turner, in charge of organizing the Junior Prom Committee, that a meeting of the Junior Class was tentatively scheduled for Monday night in the Law Building Auditorium to elect co-chairmen for the Prom. Nominations include George Sullivan, John White, John McCormack, Thomas Higgins, Thomas Jackson, Joseph De Spigno.
8.	Appointed Mr. Humel to contact Mr. Ford, manager of the dining halls, to determine the possibility of granting the students permission to use either one of the wings at their discretion. This would eliminate standing in line at an appointed wing even though the other wing was not crowded.
9.	Vetoed a motion to grant permission for a Freshman dance on the basis that the calendar is filled up and that it is not a regular practice for freshman to conduct a class dance.
10.	Heard report from Fred Tansey that a vaudeville clown act will be performed during the halves of the next basketball game. Chuck Perrin, Charles Russell and Tansey will participate.	.
crimination. How successfully she has met this test is shown by the appearance of her work in such periodicals as the New York Times, the New Republic, the Saturday Review of Literature, and the American Mercury.
Literary students and would-be poets would do well to copy from her book of wisdom. “The Bible,” maintains Sister Madeleva, “is the best book of poetry in the world, and after that the dictionary. I love especially the Book of Isaias and the Apocalypse. I think perhaps the thinness of much of our present poetry is due to lack of knowledge of this great literature.”
Her love of the dictionary and of words is no shallow vocabulary study.

Mr. Eugene Konnendi, Notre Dame's sculptor-in-residence, oversees a group of his students at work in his studio.
Eugene Konnendi, Sculptor
By JOHN A. O'CONNOR
Notre Dame men approaching the Communion rail in Sacred Heart Church on Sunday morning kneel below a strikingly simple wooden crucifix which hangs on the pillar opposite the pulpit. From His tree of agony the Man of Sorrow looks down with compassion on the waves of college men who approach His table, the heartbreak of the ages is in His face, yet His arms outstretch in forgiving love. This beautiful woodcarving of the crucified Savior is the work of Eugene Kormendi, Budapest-born sculptor, in residence now at Notre Dame.
Since forsaking the banks of his native Danube for the twin lakes of Our Lady’s campus, Professor Kormendi has quietly gone about his work to adorn Notre Dame’s grounds with some of the world’s most beautiful liturgical art. Law students pour into their proud Law Building under the stone eye of St. Thomas More, looking down from his sheltered niche. This figure of the great English statesman and minstrel-hearted poet is the handicraft of Professor Kormendi. Gracing the recess above the main entrance to
the Rockne Memorial is the hunched St. Christopher, striding through the waves with the Child Jesus atop his massive shoulders. This saintly athlete in stone, symbol of the young men who carry Christ’s principles into the ring and onto the gridiron, is likewise the work of Professor Kormendi.
The Magyar professor, student of Rodin and Bernard, and noted well in the artistic circles of Europe, has been in the United States since 1940, and at Notre Dame since 1942. After graduating from the Gymnasium and studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest, Professor Konnendi .spent some time working under the aged master Joseph Bernard. Then, after five years in Paris, he returned to his native Hungary, where, beginning with his first exhibit, his abilities were recognized and acclaimed. His first large-scale public work was a white marble statue of Queen Elizabeth, idolized consort of the King-Emperor Franz Joseph. The acclamation of Kormendi’s genius was widespread, and soon public squares, parks and buildings mushroomed with his works. At the Zero Mile Stone in Buda
13
pest, where all the country’s roads begin, stands Kormendi's ‘‘Virgin Mary, Patroness of Hungary.” Overlooking the Danube is his heroic likeness of King John Sobieski, Defender of Vienna and 17th century bulwark against the Turks.
Here at Notre Dame his studio is the north half of the low brick structure just back of the Main Building. In one half Father Lange moulds bodies out of sinew and sweat; in the other Professor Kormendi cuts life out of stone and clay.
The studio is cluttered with sculptured heads, has reliefs, little lulls of clay, and everywhere the powdery white dust of chiseled stone. The alabaster face of Lincoln looks out from behind a case against the wall; he is flanked by cherubs, Hottentots, and every type of stone head from angel to gargoyle. Saturdays find the studio jammed with students, studying form and mass, rhythm and expression. Twenty-nine of these hopefuls are architects, three fine arts majors. Some daub in clay, shaping pliant stuff into figuri-
ness or reliefs; some chip away at stone, hammering a work of art out of the potency of rock. Some carve Madonnas out of wood, others bake a ceramic seraph in the kiln.
Professor Kormendi, who looks a little like the Texas statesman, Tom Connolly, and speaks with the heavy Danu-bian accent of S. Z. Sakall, works in the dusty privacy of the east corner of the building. Here too Madame Kormendi, a most charming woman (who, in addition to being an internationally known painter and sculptress, makes delicious tea and chicken paprikash) helps the professor- in his creation of art for Notre Dame. Right now fourteen stations of the Cross, soon to adorn some church walls, are taking shape in the dusty studio.
Alumni Hall’s chapel boasts of three of Kormendi’s wood carvings. The graceful statues on the three side altars, the Immaculate Conception, St. Joseph and his Staff of Purity, and the Angelic Doctor, Thomas Aquinas, are all works of inspirational beauty.
Two more works of the Professor bloom from the high niches on the Infirmary: the Good Shepherd above the door, and in the south wing, St. Raphael, the patron of the sick, with symbolic fish and ointment in his hands.
Before coming to Notre Dame, Kormendi had spent a year in Milwaukee. As his adopted home, it offered many opportunities to the refugee sculptor. His plaster portrait plaques of the then Archbishop Stritch (at that time residing in Milwaukee), Archduke Otto of Austria-Hungary (a Milwaukee visitor), and the city’s noted William George Bruce and Milton C. Potter were well received. When the citizens of Milwaukee wished to honor the 500th anniversary of

Gutenberg’s invention of movable types they quickly called on the Danubian professor, who executed a beautiful likeness of the German inventor for the celebration of the quincentennial.
Prior to his arrival in America, Kormendi was by no means confined to his native Hungary. So widespread was his fame that he was commissioned to create public monuments and other works in such far-flung centers as Rome, Stockholm, Barcelona, the Hague, and old Nuremburg, traditional seat of Germanic culture and city of the Meistersingers.
During his youthful student days in Paris, working under the watchful eye of Rodin, Kormendi would often slip away from the Academy Julian to spend long hours in the Louvre, where he was fascinated by the simplicity of Egyptian art. This placid and philosophic style has been a constant source of inspiration to the Professor, and is often reflected in his works.
An exhibition toui- carried the Kormendi’s to Holland in 1939, where for ten months they worked and were well received. Booking passage for the United States, they planned an extensive tour of the American art centers. After their landing in New York the Dutch liner Statesdam, on which they made the cross-Atlantic voyage, was sent to the bottom by Nazis on her return trip. War had come to Europe and the world. Gelman legions swarmed over the Continent. There could be no return to Budapest now.
Kormendi’s first works in this country were prizewinners. At Palm Beach, Florida, his “On to Victory” won tremendous praise; two gun-shouldering soldiers, swinging along in step. At the Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis, critics unanimously acclaimed the simple beauty of his “St. Francis.” This tinted plaster likeness of the Brother to the Wolf was exquisitely done, garments simplified, arms ex
tended outward from the body, like a cross, and hands uplifted in prayer. Connoisseurs lauded its haunting beauty. Down at Valparaiso, Indiana, Kormendi created a Memorial honoring war dead at the Seven Dolors Shrine. Here a fallen soldier sleeps in the lap of the Sorrowful Mother.
One of Kormendi’s projects will be the proposed Notre Dame War Memorial, which will completely make over the entrance to Sacred Heart Church. At present, just inside the great doors, on the wall opposite the roll of Notre Dame’s war dead, are two creamy ceramic plaques, symbolizing the centenary of the University, celebrated in 1942. One depicts long-bearded Father Sorin, founder of the University. Back of his enormous shoulders (he needed them for the job!) is the old main building and the little log chapel. The other disc depicts the simple loveliness of Our Lady, eyes downcast in prayer and hands folded in supplication for the University. In the background is the spire of Sacred Heart Church, the unfurled American flag, and the golden dome, representing “God, Country, and Notre Dame.” Priorities prohibited the use of any material but ceramics in 1942, but both plaques are slated for recasting in bronze for the memorial. Both walls in the vestibule are to be done in black marble, with an appropriate inscription honoring those slain for the defense of their country.
15"
Konnendi's dynamic two soldiers, his prize-winning ”On to Victory."
But of all the professor’s works, and there are many, his own favorite among the war memorials is the massive square stone group which he created in Hungary. Here are five lamenting women, representing the five continents torn by war, sitting in a tightly compact group on a square bench, leaning on each other with loneliness, sagging with sorrow, weeping and prayerful, exhausted from the hatefulness, heartbreak and horrors of holocaustic war. Such a mournful monument is his favorite because, he says, unlike the great striding, chesty soldier’s usually depicted in like memorials, here are the real heroes of wars, the mothers, wives, and sweethearts. “The boys go because they must, but the women suffer the greatest sorrow.”
So in his dusty studio, Profesor Kor-mendi goes about his work, instructing the students in sculpture, and adding to
the beauty of Notre Dame, that Our Lady’s campus may blossom like the Pincian Gardens, with flowers of wood and stone.
Flood In Howard Hall Brings Out Mop Brigade
To Shamokins Ed Ostroski last Sunday night came memories of the oft-told tale of Johnstown and its historical trickle of water. Engaged in a deep bull session in one of the neighboring fourthfloor rooms of Howard Hall, Ostroski was oblivious to his domestic difficulties until third-floor residents, backed by the watchman, stormed up the stairs.
Upon opening the door (or dam) of 408 Howard, a cascade of water, inches high, streamed into the hall. A volunteer mop-and-bucket brigade rapidly went into action, draining the Howard River. Official reports state that no drowned bodies have been discovered.
Mr. Kormendi relaxes next to his beautiful SL Emericus.
Cause of the flood was a faucet, unique at Notre Dame—it sticks in place while the water is running. Unnoticed by the departing Ostroski, the water continued running into a clogged drainage pipe, and overflowed.
A consolation for flooded Ostroski—the floor was thoroughly washed.
Dr. Nutting Addresses Meeting of Liturgy Club
Students and seminarians attended an informal meeting of the Liturgy Club on Wednesday, February 12, in the Law Building auditorium to hear Dr. W. D. Nutting. The meeting was presided over by John Mowbray, and Dr. Nutting was introduced by Father Speer Strahan who is to talk at a forthcoming meeting.
Dr. Nutting’s subject was “Liturgy and Its Relation to the Student.” In his speech he traced the evolution of a person’s habit and manner- of prayer, originating in simple childhood prayers and culminating in the prayer of the Mass. Dr. Nutting also drew a comparison between the religious and economical practices of Catholic business men. He stressed the fact that their ethics were often found wanting.
Following his address Dr. Nutting elaborated on some of the topics he had previously touched upon in answer’ to questions from the audience. —J. P. Reiner

Rebels Revel at Mardi Gras
Students from above the Michigan-Angela line (temporarily), and below the Mason-Dixon (permanently) had their own version of a Mardi Gras festival a la South Bend last Saturday night, at the Erskine Park Country Club. The occasion was the first Mardi Gras dance, engineered by the newly-formed Rebels Club, and attended by an estimated 220 couples.
Many men had as their guests girls from The Town, but most studes were accompanied by sweet young things from “ovah yondah” at St. Mary’s. Miss Mildred Martin, St. Martinsville, La., lass, who was the date of Ray Hymel, pilot of the affair, presented a regal sight as she presided in queenly manner over the dance. None of the Rebels qualified for King Comus.

ing was Phil’s arrangement of Stardust. Augmenting the musical program and evoking many ah’s and oh’s from the audience was the singing of a raven-haired charmer from St. Mary’s, Penny George, who delightfully Helen Morganized A Good Man is Hard to Find and Sentimental Reasons. Biggest surprise of the night was that Richard, kind soul, wasn’t requested to unlatch the portal more than once.
Emceeing the dance and smoothly coordinating the evening’s entertainment was Dan Gentile, Radio Club vet of many broadcasts, and a welcome Yankee to any affair, Rebel or otherwise.
In addition to Hymel, whose job it was to supervise the dance, the Rebel’s planning committee consisted of Fletcher Daniels, Chattanooga, ticket manager; and Greg Despot, Shreveport, who did southern magic with the decorations.

In the final even* of the highs, he equaled the mark whic ■ he had established previously.

John Lyons J ’ and Lou Tracy showed a marked in.- * provement as they captured third and fourth places respectively.

THINCLADS MEET STRONG HAWKEYE TEAM IN FIELDHOUSE SATURDAY
By )IM HOWARD

Tomorrow afternoon at two, the Hawkeye thinclads from Iowa City invade the local gym to attempt to win their first dual victory of the season over Notre Dame’s powerful track squad. The Iowa squad has been hitting tougher competition than the Irish, and may prove a stronger contender than was expected.
The Hawkeyes are a strong team as are all Big Nine schools. Their power is well distributed and tougher than anything the N.D. tracksters have met this year’ at home. Notre Dame will be weakened in the mile as their star, Bill Leonard will be in New York competing in the 1000 yard rufi at the National A.A.U. meet in Madison Square Garden. Bill runs against Bill Hulse of the New York A.C., Chandler of N.Y.U., and Norwicki of Fordham.
Here at N.D. the team will rely on John Smith, Dave Murphy, Bill Tully, Jim Murphy, Niel Styers, Ray Sobota, and George Sullivan to capture enough points for their third home indoor victory.
Notre Dame cindermen turned in their second decisive victory of the indoor season last Saturday afternoon, winning a triangular meet from Marquette and

Michigan Normal. The Irish cornered the market on points, piling up 73% to 30 for Michigan Normal and 25% for the Hilltoppers.

Football players receiving preference in track releases burns most of the track men up every time that they pick up a newspaper. Because they make “better copy” is a poor excuse to heap more glory on athletes who star during the fall than on the outstanding members of the track squad. It takes only a few releases such as those which we have seen of late to ruin a whole team. It’s not the football stars who are to blame. They can’t help it if sports editors continue to flash their names before the readers instead of giving the “unknowns” a blow once in a while. But it does put them in an unfavorable light with the rest of the squad.
Charlie Callahan, track publicity director, claims that sports editors are at fault in this matter. How about it, Mr. Costin?

HOLY CROSS vs NOTRE DAME

son. The event was the first half-mile for Johnson, who came in under two minutes.
Ray Sobota captured the 440, scoring a surprising upset over his teammate Dave Murphy. The two were in different time trials, or the contest might have been the thrill of the meet, and the time lower than the 50.7 run by Sobota. Coach Handy tried a new combination in the mile relay, and the time was the best of of the season. Ernie McCullough started the contest for the Irish, and Leonard, Sobota and Dave Murphy carried on to finish in 3.25 minutes. Third and fourth place in the 60 yard dash went to Bill Smith and Clifford of N.D. In the broad jump Jack Hunter took second and Ray Espenan fourth. Terry Brennan and Ray Struble tied for second in the pole vault, each clearing twelve feet six inches. Fourth place in the high jump went to Jack Painter.
The Beef Trust swept the first three places in the shot put. George Sullivan was first with a toss of 48' 5". Second position went to Luke Higgins and third to Floyd Simmons.

RUMOR DEPARTMENT
Rumor has it that Coach Leahy is seriously thinking of moving Johnny Lu-jack to one of the halfback positions next season. If he does (and we doubt it), Notre Dame’s attack would be similar to Army’s offense of the last three season. Tucker had the choice of passing, lateraling to a line crasher, or lateraling to Davis who could pass it or run around the ends. If Lu jack is in at halfback and Ratterman is calling signals, Notre Dame’s offense would be terrific. Of course, the same plays could have been worked out last season around.

The annual two game' eastern swing of Notre Dame’s basketball team starts tomorrow night in the Buffalo Auditorium with Canisius College and ends Monday night in Madison Square Garden with New York University.
Presently rated third best in the country behind Kentucky and West Virginia, the Irish will have to keep their heads up to get past these two quintets. The possible loss of Kevin O’Shea because of an injury to his untaped knee in the Northwestern game will leave Notre Dame at a slight disadvantage.
Tomorrow night’s opponent is the second team Notre Dame has played this year whose coach is a former Irish star and All-American. Earl Brown is the man. He was captain of the ’38-’39 Notre Dame squad and All-American the same year. He also turned in a fine enough performance at end on Elmer Layden’s ’38 football team to be rated All-American in that sport.
His team’s accomplishments include victories over Long Island University, City College of New York, and New York University. The other side of the ledger shows losses to Oklahoma A. & M., Texas, Oregon' State, USC, and West
Virginia. West Virginia was the only team which beat them by more than ten points.
Leroy Challet and Hank O’Keefe are the forwards for Canisius. Both are 6'-2". The guards are Tom Niland and Mort O’Sullivan and the center, Tom Muller. Niland is 5'-9", O’Sullivan 5'-ll" and Muller 6'-4%". Challet is the only foreigner to New York State. He is from New Orleans.
Canisius will be out to score their first victory over the Irish in the series between the two schools. Notre Dame has won all five contests. Last year they turned back the New Yorkers, 69-47.
After one night’s rest, the Irish move into Madison Square Garden to take on NYU. New York boasts victories over UCLA, Southern Methodist, and Duke. The Duke encounter had to be decided in a double overtime when NYU came out on top 64-61.
The tall man of the NYU startingquintet is Center Adolph Schayes. He is only 18 years old, but stands 6-6%". The forwards are Marty Goldstein, who is 5'-10", and Ray Lumpp, who is 6'-l". .

INTRODUCING
By BOB LEANDER
Perhaps you have never entertained a liking for officers. Or then again, maybe you were an officer yourself—which would tend to throw a more complimentary light on the subject. At any rate, even the bitterest ex-PFC can appreciate a fine basketball player and in doing so must give an approving nod to a former Marine shavetail, John Edward Kelly, who currently cavorts at forward with the Krause Krew.
In no wise new to these surroundings, 22-year-old Kei earned freshman numerals in 1942-43 and the following season won his monogram. During the summer of 1944 he enlisted in the Marine Corps and took leave of absence from his Arts and Letters course in favor of 8 weeks of rugged boot-camp training at Parris Island, S. C. Then followed OCS and then 21-i years service, principally within the confines of Camp LeJeune where John played a whale of a game of basketball. As a member of the South Carolina team he was high scorer, averaging 18 points per appearance over a 39-game season. His best effort was a Mikan-esque 34 points racked up against the Norfolk Naval Air Station. The Le Jeune outfit was rated third among the nation’s Service clubs and traveled to the AAU tournament in Denver after facing Memphis Navy for the Southeast championship.
Earlier in the 1944-45 campaign, the gyrine five were playing Camp Peary and finding the going a trifle rough. In fact, with only seconds remaining, the Seabees were running two lengths ahead when Brookfield, then of Peary but now a member of the Chicago Gears, felled Kei with something—possibly a lead pipe. It was just the thing for the whistle-tooters who awarded the groggy and wobbling forward two charity tosses. God forbid that Moose Krause run out and club him over the head before each free throw, but Kei made both shots and the Le Jeune Bugs went on to win in overtime, though not until one careening Irishman had been led from the floor.
Not ordinarily plagued with injuries and relegated to the bench, John nevertheless sat out the St. Louis U. and Dartmouth games as a result of a broken hand sustained in the Drake fracas. The injury wasn’t detected until the game was over and it then accounted for his having tallied a lone bucket. His total of 121 points in 13 starts indicate his real scoring potential. This year’s action will

not necessarily te his last. Although a senior, his contemplated entrance into the Law School will enable him to take advantage of another- year’s eligibility.
John attended St. Francis High School in his home town of Utica, N. Y., and captured five letters, three for basketball and two for roving the local outfield. And, Mr. Kline, he swatted a healthy .340. The St. Francis quintet won the Upper New York State title and featured John Kelly as high scorer for two
seasons. His average there, too, was healthy—20 points guaranteed, whether an afternoon or evening performance.
Engrossed as he is with Notre Dame basketball and his studies, John has still found time to ponder the mystery of the Whiz Kids, Andy Phillips in particular. Kei met the Illini star when he was stationed here in V-12 for several months and scrimmaged against the Irish var
sity. In Denver at the AAU tourney their paths crossed again and on the basis of Phillips’ dazzling performance as a member of the Fleet Marine five, Kei—and the rest of the country—considered him a cinch to regain every honor the Big Nine had to offer. Yet this season things haven’t gone according to the morning line and John provides us with what seems to be the only available answer. Somewhere between Denver, Hawaii, and Champaign-Urbana, the Whiz Kid dropped 30 pounds. The why’s and wherefore’s thereof might someday give us the belated reason for one of the principal causes of Illinois’ recent hardwood woes.
Irish Fencers Lose to Northwestern
By DAVE WARNER
In a surprising upset witnessed by a capacity crowd last Friday night in the fieldhouse the Northwestern fencing team overcame a 11-7 deficit and defeated Notre Dame 14-13, springing ahead on the twenty-sixth bout of the evening. Herb Melton’s boys had performed capably, though in some instances none too impressively, in the foil and sabre winning both, 5-4 and 6-3. The Irish looked like a shoo-in for its third win of the season, but Wildcat dominance in the epee set Notre Dame back to a .500 season standing again.
Bob Schlosser, a freshman from Springfield, Ill., was Notre Dame’s star of the evening with three victories out of three bouts; DiCicco turned in five out of nine. Displaying a sensational ability to come from behind, Schlosser treated the overflow crowd to some beautiful executed parries and repostes. Coach Herb Melton expects to rely heavily on Schlosser’s work in the remaining matches. The difference between victory and defeat might well have hinged on the surprisingly poor showing of Al Ortiz, usually a dependable point getter. Ortiz showed up for the match with an upset stomach and consequently was in no temper for the ballet-like speed of fencing. Other points for Notre Dame were distributed among Ventura (Sleepy) Gonzalez, 1; Lou Burns, 1; Ralph Witucki, 1; Pete Gross, 1.
The squad was supposed to appear in Milwaukee tonight for a match with the Marquette Hilltoppers, but the match has been cancelled. Tomorrow afternoon the Meltonmen invade Madison, Wis., where they will try to outthrust an unyielding Wisconsin Badger.
BENGAL BOUTS THREE WEEKS AWAY; Lifeguard School TO HOLD FINALS ST. PATRICK'S DAY Has Huge Turnout
By PETE BROWN
Three weeks from next Monday night marks the 16th renewal of the Bengal Bouts. Under the shadow of the Golden Dome, sixteen contestants will be out to claim eight titles ranging from 127-lb. class to heavyweight.
As of Tuesday, February 18, all of the aspirants had not taken their physicals, and the complete list of entrants was not available. But even despite this, the current probable list of contestants far exceeds those of previous years.
Of the list now available there are ten men who have had previous experience in the Bengals. Most of them fought last year, but two fought as far back as 1943. These two are Tom King and Bob Lee.
King is from Concord, New Hampshire, and when he is not using his sophomore text manuals in the College of Arts and Letters, he piles them in 158 Zahm. In March, ’43 he was a contestant in the 127-lb. class. He hopes this year to participate in the same division. King is a vet with three years service with the Army in Europe.
Bob Lee, an off-campus student, takes his weekends in Cicero, Illinois. He is a junior in the College of Commerce, and hopes to lose enough weight to fight in the 147-lb. class. After having four bouts in the ’43 Bengals, he spent three years in the Navy.
Bill Roemer of South Bend and Dick Gorman of Chicago were two of the first entrants in the 175-lb. class. Both are sophomores in the College of Arts and Letters. Roemer has the greater experience of the two. He has fought twice in the Golden Gloves and three times was winner of a city championship in South Bend. He lives at 422 E. Angela Blvd., and spent 20 months in the Marine Corps.
Gorman has moved on campus and is now residing at 239 Farley. He won the 175-lb. title in the summer version of the Bengals in ’44. He has two years in the Navy behind him.
Last year’s 142-lb. champ, Bob Satti, is out to defend his title in that division. He lives at 239 Dillon and comes from New London, Connecticut. He is a junior in the College of Arts and Letters.
The other five men with Bengal ex
perience are Frank Fahey, Lakewood, Ohio; Russ VanKeuren, Rockford, Illinois; Merritt Hoglund, Chicago; Leo Mahoney, South Bend; and Jim Greenwell, Morganfield, Kentucky. All but Hoglund are sophomores in the College of Ai-ts and Letters. Hoglund is a senior in Commerce.
Of the other 17 fighters registered, there are three each in the 175-, 165-, 155-, and 147-lb. divisions; two in the 135-, and 127-lb. classes; and one in the heavyweight division. No one but Satti has entered the 142-lb. bracket.
The lone heavyweight so far is Bill Kirley of Hopkinton, Mass. He is a junior in Arts and Letters and lives at 162 Dillon.
The other potential champions are Dick Cottey, Paul Boulus and Paul Schafly in the 175-lb.; Pete Friday, Tom Landig and Jim Engel in the 165-lb.; Bill Hopke, Bob Leander and Sars Quigley in the 155-lb; Dick McGoldrick, Walt Evans and Jim Klockenkemper in the 147-lb.; Bob Hennebry and Dante Mercurio in the 135-lb.; and Bob Phillips and Tony Ortiz in the 127-lb.
A group of Bengal Bouts entries read the bulletin board for information.
About one hundred Notre Dame students have availed themselves of the opportunity of participating in the Senior Red Cross Life Saving School which began in the Rockne Pool on Tuesday, February 18th. Although this number is really too large to handle with present facilities, it is expected that about 60 to 75 men will complete the course and be presented with the Senior Life Saving certificate. The school is under the supervision of Mr. Gil Burdick.
This course is a fifteen hour course consisting of 10 one and a half hour periods and a two hour examination. Students are taught all the methods of modern life saving including approaches, carries, defenses, and releases, as well as complete instruction in artificial respiration. An instructor’s school will be held at a later date if there is sufficient interest. This course consists of 30 hours of instruction, and the student when graduated will be eligible to teach the life saving courses to others.
Mr. Burdick would like to build the number of Senior Life Guards up to the peak reached before the war when about two hundred students held Senior certificates. The main purpose behind this is to insure a sufficient number of trained men at any particular place where Notre Dame men might be swimming.

LOST—ONE ADMIRAL TO HOLY CROSS
By ED SNYDER
In 1924 a young man of Spanish-American parentage was voyaging from Barcelona, Spain, to enter the U. S. Naval Academy. He met an American priest during the trip, and when the ship had reached New York the Navy had lost a future officer, but the HolyCross fathers had gained its new Home Mission Procurator, Rev. Alfred Mendez, C.S.C.
Alfred Mendez was always on the move as a youth. His father was in the foreign commerce field, and young Alfred, though born in Chicago in 1907, was educated transiently7 in such pole-apart places as New York, Chicago, Montreal and Barcelona. He took a crack at the secular priesthood while in New York by attending a preparatory7 seminary for a year, but he longed for a group with esprit de corps, something like a Marine Corps with roman collars. His family had been in the Navy for 300 years, so why7 shouldn’t young Alfred go to Annapolis? An appointment was procured and in 1924, he boarded a ship for New York to enter the academy.
A young man on a trip can get quite lonely7, and maybe that’s what brought Father Eugene McGuiness (now Co-adju-tor Bishop McGuiness of Oklahoma City) and future Father Alfred Mendez together. At any7 rate, when the ship docked, unknown to his father, Alfred headed for Notre Dame where he joined the Holy Cross Order.
Father Mendez was graduated from Notre Dame in 1931, and four years later was ordained to the priesthood. During the remainder of 1935 he taught at the University, but was transferred to the foreign language department of St. Edward’s University, Austin, Texas, at the beginning of 1936.
Later in 1936, Father Mendez received new orders from his superior. He had been assigned to the Mexican Mission field, which sounded wonderful until he found out that the mission field consisted of one priest, namely himself, one run-down jalopy, and St. Helen’s Church, located 30 miles north of Austin. His congregation was made up of 3,000 Spanish-American parishioners, spread over 2,000 square miles of Texas desert. A mountainous task lay ahead, but Father Mendez buckled down to it, and soon Mendez-built mission churches were springing up all over the San Antonio Archdiocese. To date, the 40-year-old Procurator and his co-workers in the
Mexican field have built ten new churches, rebuilt one, and erected a baby clinic in two dioceses.
While in the construction business, Father Mendez became a “scourge” to the railroads, since from rejects he furnished most of the raw materials for his churches. They were made from natural stone, railroad ties, telegraph poles, logs, and streetcar poles, with old locomotive bells serving as church bells. In one instance, Father Mendez asked his parishioners to bring him some wood. The next day they turned up with 40 railroad ties. That night he read in the paper that a train had been derailed in a near-by town. Heaven was stormed by his prayers until he found that the derailment had been caused by other reasons, and not a lack of ties under the rails.
Mexican labor, working at the nonunion rate of $1.50 per day, with Father Mendez as contractor, architect, and supervisor, put up the structures. “When during my absence the laborers would erect a door in the wrong place, we would just change the design of the church to fit the mistake,” he blithely reports.
The architecture of the churches has caused no little ripple of interest. Recently, an architectural magazine devoted three pages to a report on it. A national trucking firm was even confused by it, and the story of their confusion gives Father Mendez cause for laughter. It seems that the firm in an advertisement represented one of its trucks as standing before a “300-year-old Texas mission.” The picture was of the Santa Cruz mission completed by Father Mendez in 1941.
Despite the catch-as-catch-can materials that went into his churches, there was still a financial problem to be solved by Father Mendez. He did this in many ways, and that’s probably why he has been named Procurator of the Holy Cross Home Missions, with the principal task of financing further mission work among the Mexicans, Negroes and whites of the South. He tells of the thankfulness of parishioners at one mission when a new church had been completed. At an .early morning Mass he found that a hen had been generously contributed to the collection. Shortly after Mass, the hen laid an egg, which Father Mendez had for breakfast, smug over being able to get interest from the collection plate so soon after a service.
Today there are 11 Notre Dame-trained priests and one lay brother laboring
in the home mission field. It consists of 26 churches, schools and hospitals in four dioceses, including the only Catholic Negro hospital in the South.
When he looks back on the past ten years, Father Mendez says that he is amazed at the progress that has been made by the Order in the South. His coal-black hair and sparkling dark eyes are certainly not those of a 40-year-old man who has made no small record for himself as a buildei* of churches. With new approaches in mind, he has already begun the task of rounding up funds so that the home mission work can continue.
If and when the Navy gets wind of its loss, it will no doubt send a letter of remorse to Father* Mendez’s superior, the Very Rev. Thomas Steiner, C.S.C., United States Provincial of the Holy Cross Fathers. The text of such a letter might read, “Why if we had Father Mendez in the Navy he could probably build us a small fleet from tin cans alone.” And come to think of it, no doubt he’d try.
Economic Round Table Accepts Three New Members
The Economic Round Table held its regular weekly dinner meeting at the Ramble Inn last Thursday evening, at which time three new members, Allen Gilbert of Sorin Hall, Pat McCarren of Walsh, and Lou Tondreau of Badin Hall, joined the club.
The discussion for the evening was ’ led by the President, Pat Nolan, following the delivery of a paper on “World Government” by Chuck Montrie. Various proposals for world government were discussed, together with the advantages and disadvantages of such plans and the difficulties that would be encountered in bringing about such unity.
TRANSFER STUDENTS
Students who wish to transfer next semester to the College of Arts and Letters or to the College of Commerce from any college of the University are urged to apply immediately, according to a joint announcement of the Rev. Francis P. Cavanaugh, dean of Arts and Letters, and James E. McCarthy, dean of Commerce.
Last semester many students applied for transfer too late to be accommodated. With current high enrollments and strictly limited quotas, it is important that a student who wishes to transfer to one of these colleges. make application to the dean of that college without delay.

Econ Major Visions Notre Dame Utopia
By JOE WILCOX
Lean, hungry, bespectacled Cassius McWitt threw an economic bombshell into campus life last week. Veterans, harried by rising costs, had consulted the brilliant young left Elbow (Wash.) economics major, in hope of getting a solution to their myriad ills. Finally, after months of concentration, McWitt had the panacea. Hereafter, Notre Dame students would work their way through college by doing each other’s laundry.
Approached by curious scribes, McWitt had a ready answer to all the queries. One newsman, plagued by his wife’s soap shortage, wanted to know where all the soap was going to come from. Retorted McWitt: “From the Rock. We will sell it to each other.”
Outspoken McWitt declared his theory was “incontrovertibly sound.” ‘‘There ■will exist,” said he, “a perfect example of the inexorable law of supply and demand. A very simple economy will result; all will be paid alike for equal work. Intense concentration upon one thing will produce the finest laundry in the world. I anticipate that within a few years the entire country will be engaged. It seems to me, after months of the most intense research, that I have hit upon the long sought-for Utopia. I am elated.”
Less elated, the average student wondered what McWitt was driving at; asked one, “Where is all the money going to come from to pay each other with?”
Replied the undaunted Cassius, “I should not expect a mere layman to be able to understand complicated economic theory. We will get our money from each other, of course.”
Another mere layman, with ideas of his own, made a counter proposal: Everyone would do his own laundry.
Economics professors were not sure if McWitt was on the right track. One, Professor Adam Malthus Marx, Ph.D., said he would have to analyze McWitt’s theory. “On the surface, it seems that this man has something. Of course, I will have to write an explanation.”
Another professor discounted the whole hypothesis for the time being, said he would have to wait and write an explanation to Marx’s explanation.
Perturbed at the cool reception of his idea", McWitt retired for three days, was fed by loving proteges who bore Spring (1933) lamb and succulent frankfurters from the dining hall. Today he emerged
from seclusion with a revision of his proposal: Notre Dame students would cut each other’s hair. At presstime, the barber shop was still open, but McWitt was more optimistic. Nobody had as yet refuted him. Said he more modestly: “I have done nothing. Any economics major would have done the same thing.”
Two N.D. Professors
Write History Textbook
Professors James A. Corbett and M. A. Fitzsimons of the Department of History have written the major portion of a new high school textboox in world history published recently by William H. Sadlier, Inc., of New York. The first two chapters of the book, dealing with preChristian history, were prepared by Rev. Anthony L. Ostheimer of Philadelphia. The volume, entitled Christianity and Civilization, is published in the Catholic Social Study Series. It contains more than eight hundred pages and the ably written text is remarkably well illustrated with maps, diagrams and photographs.
The portion prepared by Professor Corbett covers the history of Western Europe from the foundation of Christianity to the period of the French and American Revolutions. The modern period, beginning with the Revolution, is treated by Professor Fitzsimons.
A similar textbook in American history for high schools, to be published by The Declan X. McMullen Company of New York, will bear the names of Professor Aaron I. Abell and Father Thomas T. McAvoy, C.S.C., as part authors. Both volumes were to have appeared last fall but publishing difficulties have delayed their appearance until this year.
Two Periodicals Asking for Anecdotes and Poems
Two forthcoming magazines are soliciting writers. Those students who are interested in writing poetry or prose on current events, the arts, literature, music, or the theatre are asked to contact E. T. Geldin, 817 Longfellow St. N.W., Washington 11, D. C. The other magazine, titled “Survey of College Wit and Wisdom,” is interested in anything of humorous nature in the form of poem, anecdote, or joke. The contributions are to be mailed to “Survey of College Wit and Wisdom,” Box 18, Tiffin, Ohio, by March 25, to insure publishing in the April issue of the magazine.
History Department Resumes Discussions
Modem military conscription and modem total war will be the chief topics when the Department of History reopens its regular discussions on “The Notion of the State in the Various Periods of History,” Tuesday evening, February 25, in the Auditorium of the Law Building. Leading the discussion will be Professors William O. Shanahan and Robert D. Brown. Presiding will be Rev. Francis J. Boland, C.S.C., the head of the Department of Political Science, who has recently returned from service in the Navy.
The earlier discussions, which were interrupted by the semester examinations, examined the chief notions of the state in ancient, mediaeval, and early modem times. In the December discussion, Professors Willis Nutting and Matthew Fitzsimons centered their discussion about the political theories of Richelieu and those of the English leaders in the formation of the modem state. The discussion Tuesday evening will concentrate chiefly on the relations that exist between the modem state and the military arm of the government. Of all the activities of modem government that distinguish it from earlier periods, the modem army and especially the activities of that army in total war are probably the most interesting.
Mr. Shanahan, who will discuss the problem “Conscription in the Modem State,” is a specialist in military history. His recently published volume, Prussian Military Reforms 1786-1813, has received high recognition. Besides his experience in the classroom and in research, Professor Shanahan served in the Naval Air Corps during the war and was engaged in the preparation of the history of our naval air war prior to obtaining his release from the service.
Colonel Brown, who recently entertained the student body with an account of his experiences during the German blitzkrieg into Belgium, has just completed a long term of service in the Army. Because of his studies of European governments and their war machines which he made while he was in charge of the European section of Army intelligence, he is well qualified for his topic, “Total War.” Colonel Brown is a graduate of the Naval Academy at Annapolis, the Army War College and the American and French schools for staff officers. Because of the increased attendance at these discussions, they have been changed from the Rockne Memorial to the Auditorium of the Law School.

Lyons, Howard Halls Hold League Lead
Gradually the race in the Interhall Basketball League continues to take on a definite form and there were no major changes in league standings during the past week. There are no more games scheduled in the Lightweight League and the 150-pound men of Zahm Hall were undefeated in the scheduled games, thus earning the right to claim the lightweight crown. The Club League has been divided into two divisions and the championship will be decided on the basis of a double elimination tourney. No team has been eliminated in the games played thus far.
Lyons and Howard continued to lead the field in the Western Dirision with the 2-0 records that each held last week. However, the Howard-Badin game of Feb. 12 is not reported. In the only game played in the west last week Alumni overwhelmed Morrissey 50-22.
Breen-Phillips were still leaders in the Eastern Division with St. Ed’s trailing just one-half game behind. The lads from “Breezy P” added one more victim to their string as they dusted Sorin 44-28. Leon Hart again proved to be the top man on offense for the winners. In the game briefly for the winners was Rudy Schaeffer, a Cleveland boy who may be a great football star here in the years to come. Bill Michaels and Ray Petrezelka paced St. Ed’s to a 47-29 win over Zahm which gave the Saints a 3-1 record. In the other game played last week, Farley edged by last-place Cavanaugh 31-28. Ward played another fine game for the losers but Seidel and Bittner of Farley led their mates to victory. The Walsh-Farley tussle of Feb. 12 was not reported.
Three games were played in the Club League during the past week. The Knights of Columbus topped the Rebels 43-33; Kentucky won one the easy way by claiming a 2-0 forfeit from the Married Vets; and the Law Club lost a close one to Philadelphia 29-28.
The Chemical Engineering team beat the Engineers 44-13 in the Graduate School League. In the only other game played, the Clergy swamped the Arts and Letters crew, 71-30.
The standings as of Tuesday, February 18th, excepting the above-mentioned games:

The month of February wast upon the land, and there hadst been a great blizzard; and there wast mickle snow. And Ralph O’Rafferty didst look out upon it, and verily, he didst love it not; but the pangs of hunger didst gnaw at his vitals, and well he wist that he must fare forth upon the frigid scene so that he might partake of the victuals that were in the establishment known as Ye Dining Halle. And it didst cark him much that he needs must go there, for he wot that it -wast a place of great iniquity, where the .worm didst die not, for verily, it wast served in the salad.
But Ralph didst screw his courage to the sticking place, and he didst brave the wintry blast; and ere long he didst come unto ye portal of ye great Halle. And when he didst enter therein he didst whiff, and he didst think him in the State of Denmark. But he didst recall his empty stomach and laboriously didst make his way unto ye steaming table, for there was a great line.
And when he wast come unto ye steaming table, ye damsels thereat didst give a great cry of joy; and although it wast truly the middle of February, they didst ' dance a Maypole dance, for so great wast their happiness to see Ralph come thereto, and so mickle were the things they rvist they could do unto him. And behold, he didst give his ticket unto ye keeper, that he might legally partake of potage, for well wot he what wast the fate of those who came there without ye mealbook, for ye Ford hadst spoken unto them, and hadst said, behold, and mark my words well what I say unto thee: he who cometh here without ye mealbook, him I shall cast forth upon ye blizzard. For thou knowest thy feast is not free.
And when he hadst at last approached ye steaming table, his heart didst saike within him, when he saw what wast thereat; for even as he came, and it wast only the hour of six, they didst bear away ye roast beef and didst carry in mutton, exalting mightily, and praising with psalms the name of sheep. And the mutton wast the color of tattle-tale grey. They didst give unto Ralph soup, wherein were floating bits of wool. And when Ralph hadst approached unto ye mutton, ye custodian thereof, a damsel who wast known as Goatherd Gracie, didst breathe a prayer unto ye Cooke, and didst select from her mutton a most excellent fat piece, •whereon wast no lean at all, and said unto Ralph, behold, this
V
shalt be thine. But Ralph spoke and made plaintive moan, and said unto her, Verily, methinks I cannot eat that; wouldst thou not give unto me a piece that hath not such fat about it?
Whereat, Goatherd Gracie didst smile, and didst smirk, and didst fix upon Ralph a withering glance. Indeed, spake she, thou knowest not when thou are well off. Think how little it doth cost thee to eat herein. Thou couldst be eating dogfood. What dost thou think that thou art, a human being? And she didst throw upon his plate ye fat mutton, whereat all her cohorts didst applaud; and the chief of them, that -.vast known as Sausage Sam, didst give unto her a medal for meritorious service.
And Ralph didst sigh, for he wist that it wast folly to protest more, lest he be cast upon the blizzard. And he came nigh to ye damsel of ye potatoes, who didst giggle, and cast them upon the mutton. And another of the same ilk hadst peas, and she didst throw them upon the whole. And she didst also take gravy, which she didst cast upon the whole of the plate, so that it didst cover even the peas.
But the line didst stop, whilst they of the kitchen didst carry water, that there might be a greater supply of milk. And they didst likewise cast water upon the bread, which was most stale. And then didst Ralph proceed, and they didst give unto him a piece of cake, that didst seem passing well, for there wast on it thick white frosting. And Ralph likewise bore with him a wilted salad, that didst swim in vinegar. And he didst take away his tray.
And when he came unto the table whereat he wast to eat, he saw that it was nigh ye portal, where entered the wintry air, so that it wast little warmer than without. But when he didst turn about to sit elsewhere, he wast stopped by ye traffick director, who spake unto him: Wist thou not the rules? If thou wilt not follow them, begone, fox* there are ten thousand in yon blizzard who will. And Ralph wast sorrowful, and sat him in the door, where he didst shake and quake.
When he didst attempt to eat of ye soup, he didst take therefrom a bit of wool; and there wast engraved upon it, Gilbert’s for Sweaters. And he put it from him. He didst then address him unto ye mutton, potatoes, and peas, but
24
they were most cold. And Ralph said unto himself, verily, cold mutton is more evil still than hot mutton. But he didst thing of his ribs, which were by now barren of flesh, and he didst devour the meal, even unto ye salad. Then didst he set him to his cake, for the cake didst appear good. But when he had eat of it one bite, he wist that the frosting wast made of Pepsodent Toothpaste. He didst look upon it wistfully, thinking what might have been. And he didst arise and go forth.
But the next day he didst awake and bethought a demon within him, and he took him unto ye doctor. And ye doctor spake unto him, Verily, what hast thou eaten? And Ralph made answer, It hast no name; but behold, a part of it wast mutton. And ye doctor didst wash his hands, and said unto Ralph, Go forth; thou wilt recover, and thou wilt become accustomed to the uses of the ages in this place. And Ralph didst depart. And before nightfall, he wast recovered sufficiently to beai' himself again unto ye Dining Halle, and it wast Friday. And he thought unto himself, anon doth begin Lent, what bettei- penance than this? And he took unto himself filet of carp au gutter.

SWIMMING
All swimmers are urged to practice for the coming interhall swimming meet which will be held sometime in March. There will be six individual events and two relays. A complete list of events will be given next week. All campus halls should have a team entered. The last meet was won by an off-campus team which was well organized. There should be enough swimmers in each hall to organize a top-notch team.
Newest event on the intramural agenda is the handball squash tourney now being held on the Rockne courts. There are 40 men entered in the handball singles and 19 teams listed in handball doubles. In the squash tourney 12 men are listed in the singles and there are no doubles. First round and preliminary round games must be completed and reported to Sir. Scannell or Sir. Szekely by Monday night to avoid forfeiture of the match. Winners of opening rounds will be given in this column next week.

TRITE WORD WALKING:
Some readers claim the Scholastic is stuffed-shirty; others say it is just a rag. We find that it is merely a burying ground for those shop-worn phrases which all English teachers brand as being trite. Here are the favorites, as culled from recent issues: What kind of party was it?—gala. What did the fire do to the building?—gutted it. What kind of snowstorm was it?—driving. What did the speech do to the meeting?—highlighted it. How was the team at the start of the second half?—rejuvenated. Where was the criminal taken?—into custody. What did the speaker do with his question?—raised it. How cold was it?— bitter. What did the coaching staff do with their hopes for the next game?— pinned them on.

GIVING YOU THE AIR:
This week the University Radio’s low-powered station WND let out a few more loud and long squawks. Again this semester, there will be two programs presented weekly over the Green network. They are:
STREAMLINED SPORTS (Wed., 2:30 p. m., WSBT), with sportscaster Mike Hines and George Engler tending the scoreboard. They serve nothing but pure Irish sports lore on their menu.
MEET THE PROFESSORS (Fri., 4:30 p. m., WSBT), each week with Bob Hartmann, Bill Pfaff, Joe Wilcox and Walter Biescke as your hosts. It’s a strait-laced interview with Notre Dame’s leading professors on current topics.
VET CLUB VACUUM:
For the Vets Club, it was an empty week. They had planned a big meeting to be held on February 11th to elect new officers. There was to be a new deal; but it came from off the bottom of the deck. Of the 1300 paid-up members, only 40 (probably half of these were old officers and new hopefuls) were present. When prexy Joe Dillon rapped his gavel down on the rostrum to open the affair, the Law Building was as vacant as a campus dorm on a Saturday night.
What was the reason? Evidently the Notre Dame veteran was just shirking,
could not see the advantages of a well-organized veteran’s club on this campus. Most vets, steeped in the memories of old army and navy brawls, no doubt thought the Notre Dame Veterans Club was just a shell with the pearl gone. They forgot, however, that without cooperation the club was bound to take a one-way ride. And, furthermore, it seemed that they didn’t care.
Well ? ? ?
Here are some of the reactions of ex-GIs when asked why they didn’t attend the meeting or even join the club. Said Bob Lankenau of Brooklyn, N. Y., “I want no part of it. It’s probably just a leaning post for ex-Army-Navy brass. I had enough of that in service.”
“What do they do anyway?” barked John J. Sullivan of Effingham, Ill. “I joined last semester, haven’t heard of a meeting or cutting since. I could have used that buck to better advantage.”
James Slattery of Jackson Heights, Long Island, was on the other side of the fence. Said Jim, “It’s a good organization, but it should be a little more active, I think.”
Although the gripes were often as loud as the cheers, the Vets Club was not worried. It would try again on February 24th. This time the election would be held like a class election with ballots being taken during the noon-lunch period in the dining hall basement. Already one ticket of potential officers was ready to inject a little blood into the club’s anemic veins if elected. But their success still depended upon the vet, it is his club. If
he doesn’t vote, he will only be shoveling the dirt on his own grave.
❖
WITH THE AESCULAPIANS:
It takes a pre-med student two years to learn what epilepsy is, three years to find out what an epiglottis does, but in eight years he’s lucky if he knows what Aesculapian means. Here at Notre Dame it is the handle of the Pre-Med Club, of which Ed Bannes is president. This club held a meeting last week which was “highlighted” by a speech given by Dr. Maximillian Swiech, former president and now public relations officer of the Illinois Association of Chiropodists. Dr. Swiech spoke on foot infection. On February 27, in the Law Auditorium, campus Aesculapians will hear Drs. George Stryker and M. Weiss, both of the University of St. Louis Medical School.

SO THEY SAY:
BOB LYDEN of Portland, Maine, this week cleared up that No. 1 problem “why Richard wouldn’t open that door.” . . . Debunked Bob, “That door that Richard won’t open has a Yale lock on it, and the guy trying to open it is a Harvard man.” . . . RAY HYMEL, ex-Rebel club president and member-in-sleeping of the Sackmaster’s Club, says that “everytime I get the urge to exercise, I hit the sack until it passes over.” . . . JOHN LU-JACK, football player of some repute, and GEORGE CONNOR, a member of the same profession, assert that the roughest athletic competition they have had to date occurred down at Marion, Indiana, last week. . . . After visiting the veteran’s hospital there, they took Father Archibald McDowell, C.S.C., on in a game of ping-pong. . . . Said they, “He tore us to pieces in straight sets. . . . He couldn’t have done it on a football field.”

CINCINNATI CINCH:
After many months, the Cincinnati Club shook off the cobwebs, called a meeting last week. President Ed Mers-man was re-elected, said the club would hold a number of whoop-te-dos this spring. With the club members behind him to a man (one had a knife in his hand, was quickly disarmed), the motions and counter-motions were passed, so were the new officei*s: Tom Jackson, vice-president; Harry Gilligan, treasurer; Paul Schaefer, secretary.

AERO ANTICS:
Jim Atkinson, president of the campus flying club, announces that all men interested in doing a bit of flying this
26
spring should attend the next Aero Club meeting, which will be announced shortly. Plans for securing planes and transportation will be aired at that time.
♦
The Texas Club at its first meeting of the semester last week, elected the following officers: President, Coy McGee; Vice-President, Joe Mengden; Treasurer, Pat Kelly; Recording Secretary, Charles Kahler; and Corresponding Secretary, Jerry Fisch.
Refreshments were served to all, and afterwards the Club viewed the pictures of the Notre Dame-Tulane game of 1946. Efforts are being made to offer entertainment of some sort at each meeting and to promote some activities after the Lenten season ends.
Villagers to Honor Net Squad April I
Tuesday, April 1, will be April Fools’ Day but the Notre Dame Villagers will not be playing any pranks on the Irish basketball team when they play host to the latter at a testimonial banquet at the Indiana Club. This will mark the 17th year that the Villagers, composed of South Bend area students attending Notre Dame, have honored the Irish hoop squad.
Already lined up as guest speakers are Johnny Wooden, former Central High School basketball coach and athletic director, and now coach at Indiana State Teachers College, Terre Haute, and Paul D. (Tony) Hinkle, basketball mentor and director of athletics at Butler University. Two other prospective speakers have been contacted but so far no reply has been received from them.
A feature of the chowfest will be the making of awards to senior members of the team, John Kelly and Capt. Fran Curran; to Coaches Ed (Moose) Krause and Tom Brennan; and to trainer Hugh Burns.
Reservations for the banquet may be obtained in the basement of the cafeteria on March 3, and general admissions will be $3; students $2.50.
Thomas A. Hynes is general chairman of the banquet, and Joseph Hickey is speakers’ chairman. Fred A. Tansey is president of the Villagers Club.

POUR IT ON ! ! !
Why the Notre Dame students have to steal a cheap trick from Army or any other school is a mystery to me. I have heard it at other games but last Monday night when “Pour it on” broke forth from the students’ section, I wondered what lame-brain had started it. To most of us who were in uniform during the two big-score beatings which Army handed the 1944 and ’45 football teams, we could almost visualize the cadets standing up along the sidelines yelling “Pour it on.” It brought back unpleasant memories. Besides, we were playing a team coached by a time Notre Dame man, Ray Meyer. He was one of the late George Keogan’s assistants a few years before he went to the head basketball coaching job at DePaul. Yet, we at Notre Dame thought it smart to yell “pour it on.” Congratulations to Moose Krause for substituting so freely throughout the game. The reserves were hot and all trying desperately to look good because the eastern trip was coming up.
USHERS COULD HELP
The ushers at the basketball games do an exceptionally good job throughout the game. Late arrivals are not seated until one of the teams takes a time out. for those who arrive on time this is a good deal. No one is walking in front of

them blocking their view. But why isn’t something done during the late stages of the game? If a person has a good reason to leave before the game is over, let him leave, but too many people move toward the exits. during the last five minutes of the game. How about remedying this bad situation?

Two Slates Running for Vet Offices
With two contending slates and a representative pile of platform planks the Veterans Club will go to the polls next Monday to vote on its 1947 officer choices. Elections will be held at lunch and dinner periods in the basement of the dining hall.
A second slate of officers, headed by Dave Slattery, was nominated early this week to oppose the previously named Keel ticket. Since no nominations were accepted after Tuesday noon, the ballot battle will center around Keel and Slattery and their respective parties.
Slattery’s line-up named: for president, Dave Slattery; for first vice-president, Tom McCaffery; for second vicepresident, Ray Kenney; for third vicepresident, Bill Hoene; for recording secretary, Joe Conetry; for financial secretary, Frannie Curran; for corresponding secretary, Fai Evans; for sergeant-at-arms, Bill Tully; and for treasurer, John Smith.
Keel’s party had already nominated for the same offices: H. Smith Keel, Bill Duggan, Bill Henessey, Bob Uhl, Gunnar Hald, Bob Traver, Frank Keenan, Ziggy Czarobski, and John A. O’Connor.

McGrath Proposes Chinese Policy
Support of the Kuomintang government as the lesser of two evils in China’s present civil strife was advocated Wednesday night in a detailed study of the Chinese problem presented to members of Wranglers by Art McGrath, political science senior.
After outlining the philosophies and policies of both Nationalist and Communist factions McGrath reviewed the military resources of each and basing his conclusions on personal interviews with military observers, surmised that in a prolonged struggle the Communist route armies would be victorious.
Linking this possible success to the menace o f Communism throughout Europe today, McGrath concluded that the United States should throw its support to the Nationalists as a check-mate to the growth of Communist power.
Inter-American Clubs Hold Officer Elections
Both the Inter-American Affairs Club and the La Raza Club elected officers for the present semester at recent meetings.
Luis Pallais of far famed Managua, Nicaragua, succeeds Tom Poole as president of the Inter-American Affairs Club, while Jaime Velez of Colombia replaces Fernando Serpa as vice-president, and Hermilo Gloria, a Texan retains his job as secretary.
In the La Raza Club, Ramiro Samaniego of Ecuador has relieved Roland Duarte of his duties as president, while a fellow countryman, Jaime Pinto, is the new vice-president. The other new officers are Jose Alberto deRojas of Cuba, treasurer; Francisco Salido of Mexico, secretary; and Eric Rey de Castro of Peru, sub-secretary.
Asst Dean of Enginering Raymond Schubmehl wishes to express his gratitude for the sympathy extended by the priests, faculty and students of the University on his recent bereavement.

Important men behind the scenes of “Meet the Missus” include John FitzHenry, who is pianist for the show and is constantly on hand to provide music for the many songs, and Gerard Hekker, head of the property committee, who is busily scouting South Bend for items ranging from telephone switchboards to buzz saws.

Wanted: 101 ND Men Who Offered Dates
Somewhere on this campus, among its more than 4,000 students, there are 101 men of whom Notre Dame can well be proud. Their names are as yet unknown but every effort is being made to discover their identity. According to a story by the Rev. S. John Tucker in the February 16 edition of the Chicago Herald-American, they have written to Betty Jean Lampe of Roselle, Ill., and offered to take her dancing. Betty Jean, was born without feet, and was therefore confined to a wheel chair for the past 22 years. Recently, through the generosity of Herald-American readers, she underwent an operation enabling her to wear artificial feet.
Now searching for a home in Chicago where she must go for periodic adjustments of her new feet, she already has ideas for the future. The Rev. Tucker states that she plans to attend a model’s school and to take dancing lessons as soon as the artificial limbs are fitted and adjusted. As this may take as long as two months, «the Notre Dame students will not miss out on account of Lent but will have something to look forward to when the social life swings into high gear once more.
The Scholastic, which wishes to facilitate the meeting of Betty Jean and her future dancing partners, hereby issues a request for them to step up and let their names be known. Line forms on the left.—J. P. Reiner

(Continued from p. 3)
You didn’t answer his complaint with a logical or forceful argument, you didn’t answer it at all.
The war is over, gentlemen, and even the most diehard proprietors are beginning to admit that the customer might be right. “Mr. McBitters et al” are your customers and deserve more consideration than to be brushed off for having the impertinence to question your methods. On the editorial page of the same issue you deplore the fact that 37% of the Engineers interviewed on an important national problem had no opinion. At the same time you refuse to accept the opinion of one of the students on an important campus question and impudently toss it aside as the ramblings of a nobody.
Instead of conducting polls on the closed shop, a poll on what the students think of the Scholastic, or even more pertinent what they want in their Scholastic would profit the University more. We are not all comic magazine fanatics (the classification given all who dare to raise a voice against your present editorial policy), but we do like something a little lighter than the present fare. We get our share of the deep literature in class, this overflow in the Scholastic is just too much of a good thing. Come out of the intellectual fog, you are practically alone. Take steps to correct the present student dissatisfaction with the Scholastic. Get with the crowd and give us a “representative” paper everyone can enjoy.
Neither cynically nor satirically, but sincerely yours,

Our only regret is that a limited writing staff prohibits the printing of more and better light fare, but not, we hope, of the “happy-little-collegiate-moron” (Archie McBitters, Scholastic, Feb. U, 1947) type. Surely there can be no objection if the light fare is spiced a bit with serious articles for those in an intellectual fog?—Editor.
♦
Sir:
I challenge the authenticitiy of the insulting letter published in the 14 February issue of the Scholastic above the name “Archie McBitters.” It seems to be a piece of very clever deceit which should have been obvious to you. Its contents envision an existing situation
of student attitude which is as unfair as it is exaggerated.
I have consulted the list of students as held by the Director of Student’s accounts. I find there is no person such as “Archie McBitters” in attendance at Notre Dame. Surely, you check all letters before you print them?’
Your magazine has never before printed a pseudonym in connection with Letters to the Editor as far as I can find—names are either wholly withheld or listed correctly. Ergo, the name of “Archie McBitters” by inference is the name of a student at Notre Dame. I would like to meet him, in the flesh, that is, not as a vague phantomlike character figmented to apply in general terms in a rather abstract fashion.
You might say “someone wanted his name withheld and we just made up one.” This is a serious misrepresentation and your precedent in using a pen name to bolster a most derogatory letter is hard to understand.
Instead of a cute quip or line of sarcasm after this letter why not explain the facts. If you were duped, admit it and print a rather apologetic retraction for those who know Notre Dame only through the columns of the Scholastic and not as we do who are here on the spot. If on the other hand, you knew the letter to be false or misleading, please tell us why you honored it as truth by printing it.
I’ll sign my name, please print it, don’t substitute. I do not happen to be at all ashamed of what I write. Please let us, your readers, in on the current editorial enigma, we do not mind if you are embarrassed.
J. D. Usina, 335 Dillon
For all we know Archie McBitters may be but a figment of someone's imagination. In printing a pseudonym-signed letter we were merely exercising the prerogative of breaking our own rules to bring to the students as fine a piece of satire as we have seen in many a week.
Let diametric Critics Monahan and Usina reread the now famous McBitters to determine just whom he was poking fun at.—Editor.
Sir:
I object vigorously to the last statement in the lead editorial of last week’s Scholastic, stating the intention of the editor to “prescribe a stiff dose of the social sciences for the 37% so engrossed in their math and physics that they can ignore a strife-torn world.”
This masterpiece of fog-bound thinking evidently follows from the fact that 37% of the engineers held no opinion
30
on the subject of “closed vs. open shop.” From this single fact, the crystallizers of student opinion sitting alone with their thoughts (poor company at best) deduced that: 1) engineers knew very little of current labor problems, and 2) their darkened minds may be illuminated by the simple device of a “stiff dose of the social sciences.”
Let us now consider the reasons that may have prompted an engineer to give his “no opinion.” In the College of Engineering we are taught to express an opinion only when we possess sufficient facts (once again for the editors, FACTS) to reasonably justify our conclusion. An honest “I don’t know” is worth more than a definite “yes” or “no” with no better basis than the faithful reading of Bertie’s observations from Tribune Tower. In line with this, it might be interesting, and quite possibly revealing, to determine what percentage of that 65% of A.B. men have actually worked in a closed shop which was managed by someone other than a relative or a good friend of the family. To many of us, that 37% of “no opinions” indicated a reluctance to give a definite answer backed by insufficient data, while the resounding “yesses” of 65% of the A.B. men indicated an eagerness to yelp a noisy, although unsubstantiated, opinion.
Now let’s consider the remedy proposed for the alleged ignorance of the engineers. I, along with other engineers, have been exposed to two courses in economics, each about as valuable as a lead balloon. The textbook for each course was filled with paragraphs which strongly suggested that the author pounded out the first and last sentences and left a student (doubtless one from the lofty plane inhabited by the Scholastic editors) to pack the pulp in the mid-section. Inevitably the professor, given such a book, was forced to teach almost entirely from his own knowledge, highly colored by his own political opinions. Often the knowledge was inadequate and the politics was certainly out of place.
Concluding, I fail to see that a dose of social sciences would remedy the situation, and I strongly suggest that the editors of Scholastic investigate the under-lying reasons for the actions of others instead of doing as Stephen Leacock’s horseman and dashing off in all directions at once.
R. P. Reid
When mil “sufficient facts” be in to justify cold-scientific-approach R. P. Reid and cohorts to formulate an opinion?—Editor.

The following is written in reply to the poor misguided young man who apparently without any basis whatsoever, on the subject of “closed vs. open shop.” except perhaps the fact that he has met a career girl who has had the ability and brains to outsmart him, wrote the narrow-minded and senseless article about career girls.
The old adage that there is a woman behind every man is truer today than ever before. I am sure that if this young man had the brain power to think things out, he would be among the first, but this I doubt, to admit this fact.
First of all, we unhesitatingly bring up the fact that thousands of girls are working and keeping a home so that their husbands are able to attend school. So far, we have heard no cries of protest from the men on this aspect of the career girl.
Secondly, if the real facts behind most career girls were known, you would find that in most cases they are not only supporting themselves, and doing a fine job of it, but providing for younger brothers and sisters, and in many, many instances maintaining a home and living for parents who are ill. Why not give credit where credit is due.

I can see, the only thing that seems to bother him is that his wife has proved herself superior. Perhaps if he had some of the initiative and ability which she possesses, he would find a position which would enable him to provide the kind of home and living which she, without any help or guidance from him, has the capacity to do.
We also indulge in the old-fashioned theory that the woman’s place is in the home. Any girl, career girls included, would be very delighted to remain at home. But, we also feel that few husbands are able to furnish the type of home, clothes, and above all, the sense of security which we have every right to expect.

your writers read the papers? The second was a sarcastic “dear old South Bend” that, like the first was in “College Parade” under “Stormy Weather.” That article was a crude attempt at humor to say the very most of it. The third, in “The Week” remarked that South Bend was “this Burg.” According to the bulletin, Mr. John A. O’Connor is from Venice, Calif. He had better revise his idea of a “burg.”
It has come to the point where youi" thoughtless remarks are no longer humorous. I have been reading the same ones for a long time and they are getting corny. Why not turn your “literary talents” to more useful channels and leave South Bend alone. It is no longer funny.

Dear Sir:
May I inquire as to the name of the member in good standing of the National Association of Manufacturers who penned the story “Reds Active in National Student Union, N.D. Delegates Say” featured in the Feb 7 issue of Scholastic?
I refer to his statement—“The delegates to the international meeting smelled Communism at the Prague meeting— (a smell that many people feel is contaminating every union, labor or student.). (Parentheses are mine.) Since he didn’t mention who “many people” were, I shall infer that it is himself since the N.A.M. is seldom that brash.
The unidentified source is an old Hearst trick and please, let’s not allow the Scholastic to sink so low as to set up Hearst as its idol. Union and management are in enough of a quandary

February 15, 1947 Dear Sir:
An article in “From the Editor’s Desk . . .” of the February 14, 1947, Scholastic, entitled “The Vet Studies,” verifies the oft-heard claim that “the returning veterans are far ahead of the non-veterans in the race for academic achievement.”
Whether there is a boast or not in the last sentence, “The comparison which follows clearly (italics my own) shows the academic superiority of veterans,” I do not know. I am quite sure, though, that if some unfortunate veteran had never chanced to finish grammar school and were to go back to complete his elementary education, he would again “be far ahead of the non-veterans in the academic achievement.” After all, the veteran is older than his non-veteran counterpart, and logically more mature on account of his service experiences.
If the reverse were time (the nonveterans performed better than the veterans), then there would be reason for consternation. Let’s acknowledge the veteran’s superiority, and cease this prolixity of assertions to that effect.
Yours truly, Charles A. Hickman 320 Breen-Phillips Hall

SISTER MADELEVA
(Continued from Page 12)
“I love words,” she has said, “because I love the Word. The first meeting of any class of mine is devoted to the beginning of the Gospel according to St. John, ‘In the beginning was the Word’.”
Sister Madeleva has traveled extensively in America, in Europe and in the Holy Land, and is a devoted lover of Nature. Many of her best poems are lyric celebrations of fresh, delicate, colorful manifestations of Nature’s moods and their reflection on her own spirit. Sharing the Nature bent of her poetry is the even more basic inspiration of her love for the Creator whose handiwork is so miraculously reflected in life and Nature. From her poems one easily perceives the exacting artistic discipline to which she subjects herself. She holds that every word has to work and almost fight for a living in a line. Since 1915, every poem she has written has been published.
Sister Madeleva lectured on “The Frontiers of Poetry” in Washington Hall several years ago to an enthusiastic audience. A new and larger group of students now has a valuable opportunity to enjoy her charm and absorb her wisdom.

ing in a triple hatchet murder of two prominent South Bend families? We bet that would fix Joe’s trolley.
By JACK FRAIER and BILL PFAFF
Perhaps Archie McBitters (whose contribution headed last week’s “Letters” column) was a bit too bitter about the intellectual level of This Old University; and perhaps the Editor was rather dense in his reply; but we wonder if Mr. McBit-tcrs might not have something. Of five thousand Notre Dame Men, about four had an opinion on the closed shop that they felt worth expressing. When Jim Burns and Warren Fronrath made their oral survey to augment the letters, they found an average of 18.8%, or one fifth of the student body, who possessed no opinion on the subject! A survey of the opinions of Alcatraz Men would probably do better’ than that. The only mitigating factors we can see in the seriousness of the situation are the methods of the column. It seems to us that the column could be made considerably livelier, and a better question could have been chosen to start things.
We are a little teed off on the subject

of political lethargy anyway. We were at the Palace last Thursday to see “State of the Union,” and were amazed at the frigid reception it received. Perhaps the audience didn’t agree with the liberal views expressed in the play, but certainly they should have had no argument with the plea for honesty and democracy in politics that the show propounded. The theatre was two-thirds empty before the curtain calls were over. The only two comments we heard on the play were: one gentleman to another, “Still goin’ to vote Democratic? Haw! Haw!” And one little woman (obviously an “American Uncorruptible”) to another, “I’m going to see the management of the theatre about this play.”
We’re afraid the Messrs. Lindsay and Crouse, and the Messrs. Burns and Fronrath forgot that Northern Indiana is still Tribune Territory.
Much as we love radio sometimes it gets even us down, especially on the local level. There is a certain announcer that works early evenings at WHOT. He is driving us to opium and WSBT. Why? Here are some of the gems he has gotten off recently: blithe, rhyming with myth; the song “Marchita,” “Mar-sheet-ah.” He is also the man that calls in Elmer Davis’ commentary, “come in Washington, take it away Mr. Davis!” We can picture Mr. Davis nervously fidgeting before the mike, a cough drop in one hand and the script in the other, waiting for word from WHOT in South Bend to “take it away.”
Joe Boland is another who annoys us a little, although compared to the first gentleman he is as filet mignon is to mystery stew. Outside of changed news content, the architecture .and lumbei’ of “The Old Sports Shop” hasn’t changed in the two years we have been here, and old timers assure us that ten years ago he was “strolling down Memory Lane” with the same overwhelming eagerness that he did last night. If he keeps it up we are going to take a collection among Phy-ed majors for a can of Three-in-One for those “Shutters” that get hung up every weekday night. (Except Sundays.)
What would happen we wonder (when in a sadistic mood) if the question Joe “poses for your friendly discussion” resulted in a fistfight argument climax-
After leafing through the new “Information Please Almanac” we have come to the conclusion that the work is in dire need of a censor librorum and an Imprimatur. (And mebbe a proofreader famil-liar with Michiana.) Not only do they misdescribe “Moose” Connor, as our colleague Mr. O’Connor pointed out last week; but they list St. Mary’s, Notre Dame, as a school of “529 male students.”

Rounding out the quintet are guards Don Forman, and Sid Tanenbaum. The former is 5'-10", the latter 6 feet. Tanenbaum is the pride of the east coast. He was rated All-American by the experts last season.
Notre Dame leads the parade with NYU in victories during their 12 year span as annual opponents. The Irish have ten wins against three losses. New York upset the Irish last year, 62-58.
LOOKIN' THROUGH THE HOOP
There can not possibly be any justice or law of average if one is to seriously consider what took place in the gym last Monday night. Notre Dame defeated DePaul 80-45. . . . Past History: Kentucky, 60, Notre Dame ,30: DePaul, 53, Kentucky, 47. . . . Draw your own conclusions. . . . John Brennan scored the first eight points for ND and finished the game with 23. . . . Question in the mind of the capacity crowd: Can this be the Bengal Bouts preliminaries? . . . Answer: No, just some happy fun-loving boys playing basketball.
