HUHIIHG GOLD TOR STALIN
Who started the rush for Soviet gold, that Lenin once said was useful only for filling teeth? Why is Stalin encouraging hundreds of thousands to join the search? Here’s a personal narrative of a man who traveled 200,000 miles in Russia, bringing American methods and machinery to the U. S. S. R. He reports what he saw on his travels, and some of the queer twists he found in the Russian mind.

ANTON TALKS GOOD LABOR PRINCIPLES
•
Tuesday evening, Dec. 14th, at the meeting of the Commece Forum, Richard J. Anton, a junior in the College of Arts and Letters, gave an interesting talk on “Wages and Hours in American Labor.”
The first point that he made was that Christian principles should be used more often by labor and capital.- Before any attempt is made.to straighten, out.labor difficulties, more co-operation .is needed between capital and-labor. This, co-.operation-could be.brought about by the wider use of certain Christian principles.
Following this, he opposed the New Deal legislation now pending in Congress concerning maximum wages and minimum hours. It has been proposed that a set of standard of wages and hours to be set which would be used universally all over the United States.
Attacking this, Anton went ahead to prove that it is not practical and very harmful. He pointed out that existing conditions in all sections of the country are not the same. Therefore, he continued, one standard of maximum wages and minimum hours would not remedy the situation. A different set of legislation would be needed for each section.
Anton then showed how it would be harmful in so much as it would tend to increase prices which in turn would lower the effect of the living wage which Congress intends to give the people. Unemployment would also set in, he points out. If a campaign was raised whereby prices were increased, small marginal companies would be forced out of business. The result being a layoff of labor and an increase in the unemployment rank.
Concluding, Anton advocated the dire need of a more centralized and higher form of unionization. He explained that the labor union could settle this maximum wage and minimum hour situation much more easily and quickly than the government could.
Women primp for the same reason that men drink—to bolster up morale, according to a psychology professor at De Paul University. They dress chiefly to make an impression on their own sex, rather than to win the approval of men, he declared.
BISHOP KELLY TO DELIVER FINAL ADDRESS OF "SAMARITAN" SERIES TONIGHT
By F. G. Barreda
Most Rev. Francis C. kelly, D.D., bishop of the Oklahoma City and Tulsa Diocese, will deliver the last in his series of four lectures on “The New Samaritan” in Washington Hall tonight. Bishop Kelly in his first lecture, given Tuesday evening in the auditorium of the John F. Cushing Hall of Engineering, related his personal confession of -------------------------------------being a disappointed apostle in the

Knights Pass ’36 Total In Seal Campaign
•
The Christmas Seal drive is being continued throughout this week in the various halls on the campus by the members of the local chapter of the Knights of Columbus. The drive is under the direction of Robert P. Leonard. Leonard has appointed a director in each hall and these directors have chosen an assistant on each floor. Twenty thousand seals have been issued to directors and assistants on the campus.
The results of the drive thus far have surpassed the total sales of last year, but they are still far below the sales of 1930, which marked the high point in the sale of seals on the campus.
J. Richard Foley was chairman of the K. of C. Annual Christmas Party, held this week at the Columbia Athletic Club. The party opened with a brief business meeting. After the meeting, entertainment was provided. Movies of the Minnesota football game were shown and “Santa Claus” Drolla distributed gifts to the members. A buffet supper was served later.
Apologetic field of conversion.
“Ever since received the calling from God while I was a student at St. Dunstan’s College, I have known that my object has been conversion,” His Excellency explained. “In my first years of the priesthood I made very few converts, but I soon learned that the main trouble lay in the field of Apologetics. My experiences in Lapeer, Mich., and in Oklahoma City, have shown that the “New Samaritan” is the Mystical Body of Christ; and you, its members, are the ones who must exercise those principles of Apologetics taught to you here at Notre Dame.”
On Wednesday evening Bishop Kelly explained that modem teachers spend too much time on Catholic Apologetics and fail to properly emphasize Christian Apologetics, the great cornerstone of supernatural religion. He commented on the simple method used by Christ in making converts. St. Paul, following the teachings of Jesus, used the same manner in bringing infidels into Christianity.
Last night Bishop Kelly pointed out how the Catholic Church, being the Mystical Body of Christ, has become the new Apologetics which answers the needs and wants of man's heart, intellect, and soul. Tonight he will speak oh “The Legion of Christ the King,” the new manner of conversion through group unions of prayer.
Bishop Kelly is the founder and the first president of the Catholic Church Extension Society, an organization devoted for the past 32 years to the maintenance of Catholic churches in rural communities. The Society was canonically established by the Holy See in 1910. hi 1906 he founded The Extension and served as the first editor of this national Catholic monthly magazine.

"The Villain Undone" or "Pitt Club Elects"
•
Bob O’Toole, presidential candidate, had just read a letter from the corresponding secretary of the Notre Dame alumni association in Pittsburgh; this correspondence was supposed to clinch the “Pitt Club” election for the “O’Toole Faction.”
O’Toole stepped from the rostrum, a gleaming smile of triumph on his face.
Voice from the club membership of 63—the largest in the history of the Notre Dame “Pitt” Club (beware Metropolitan Club of the big burg):
“Mr. O’Toole, for the benefit of my brother freshmen, would you mind telling the members just who signed that letter?”
Brother O’Toole: “Why that letter was signed by the corresponding secretary.”
Huffy Voice: “Who is the corresponding secretary?”
B. O’T.: “Larry O’Toole, my brother.” (Accompanied by derision and decision.)
Right into office Susie Q’d John McGovern, Sheedy, Tom Cronin, and Wolfarth, rivals of the O’Toole faction.

NEW LIBRARY BOOKS PROVE POPULAR
•
Recent visitors to the library have discovered a wealth of new fiction and non-fiction books. Having perused the “new book” lists carefully the visitors have selected a few of the more interesting of these recent acquisitions and marked them for future reference. According to reports one of the should-be popular is The Man Who Was Chesterton, a collection of his best essays, stories, and poems by Chesterton.
Another of these “more popular” books is I Search For Truth in Russia by Sir Walter Citrine. This is a detailed diary, kept by Sir Walter, giving statistics of Soviet wages and their purchasing power. The author confines himself to facts, giving the sources of them and interpreting them for the reader. Some students will probably ‘go for’ a book entitled, A Reporter at the Papal Court by Thomas B. Morgan. Mr. Morgan’s book describes the Vatican life of Pope Pius XI., his character, background, and policies.
Students interested in the current conditions in the East will find The Struggle for the Pacific by Gregory Bienstock, good reading matter. Others, more spiritually minded, will prefer And Then the Storm by Sister M. Monica, and Brother Petroc’s Return by S.M.C., a Dominican nun. Sister Monica’s Book is an interesting account of three years spent in travel and research in Spain. Brother Petroc’s return is based on a hypothesis that miracles can happen. It is the description of the effect, of the impact, of the modem world on a mind trained in a simple “Age of Faith.”
An enlightening book, 40,000,000 Guinea Pig Children by Rachel Lynn Palmer, exposes the misleading and fraudulent advertising claims of various companies. The Advancing Front of Science by George W. Gray, gives an account of some recent advances in scientific research, in terms understandable to the average reader. The Psychologist Looks at Art by Louis Danz, is a book not only for the layman, but for the painter, the student, the psychologist and every intelligent man and woman.
Also included on the lists are’: Hitler—His Struggle by I. Harand; Economics for Everybody by M. Cro-baugh; Yours to Venture by R. R. Updegraff; Caste and Class in Southern Town by J. Dollard; Banks, Credit and Money in Soviet Russia by A. Z. Arnold; Youth-serving Organizations by M. M. Chambers; Shakespeare’s Young Lovers by E. E. Stoll.

DR. GURIAN WRITES OF HITLER'S DISGUISED ATTACK ON GERMAN CATHOLICITY
By Paul R. Locher
To a certain group who are continually apprehensive with reference to American participation in the fine arts, the performance of the Wagnerian opera, “Die Walkure,” on this coming Saturday, should be sufficient assurance that such an attitude is entirely unwarranted. Emanating from the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, the broadcast of this opera will present perhaps the finest Wagnerian cast in the world today. Kirsten Flagstad, the reigning sensation of the Metropolitan, will sing the role of Sieglinde, with Lauritz Melchior in the part of Siegmund. Melchior, now in his twelfth season at the Metropolitan, is universally recognized as the outstanding Wagnerian tenor. The supporting cast includes such favorites as Marjorie Lawrence, Friedrich Schorr, Ludwig Hofmann and Kerstin Thorborg.
“Die Walkure” is the second opera in the famous Ring Cycle by Wagner, concerned with the tragedies that follow upon the theft of the Rhine gold, and the forging of a ring which confers complete power over gods and men. Siegmund, the mortal son of Wotan, god of the heavens, is apparently the hero who will slay the dragon and restore the treasure to the Rhine maidens. But he arouses the wrath of Fricka, protectress of marriage, when he flees with Sieglinde, Hunding’s wife. Bruennhilde, favorite Valkyr of Wotan, fails in her attempt to intercede and save Siegmund. For her disobedience, she is condemned to sleep until a hero shall penetrate an encircling wall of fire, and claim her as his bride.

In their only joint radio appearance of the season, Hephzibah and Yehudi Menuhin will appear with the Ford Symphony on Sunday evening as guest soloists. Hephzibah, who does not plan “a great career” for herself, is content to play Caesar Franck’s “Symphonic Variations” with the orchestra, and to accompany her famous brother in the Rondo from Sonata No. 32 by Mozart. Yehudi will play the difficult E Minor Concerto for violin by Mendelssohn with an orchestral background. The two Menuhins are unique in the concert world for they insist on “music for pleasure” and. do not follow a hard and fast routine of practice.

Buffalo Club Will Stage Christmas Formal
At the meeting of the Buffalo Club, which was held during the past week, President John C. McKendry announced that the annual Christmas formal dance would be held on Tuesday evening, Dec. 28, at the Hotel Fillmore. Robert F. Magee, a senior in the College of Commerce was appointed general chairman. He will be ably assisted by Messrs. Ball, Rep-penhagen, Nagel, Batt, McKenna, Maloney, Kiefer, Feeney, Mago and Ryan who will see that everybody has a good time. John G. Moir, one of Notre Dame’s contribution to AllAmerican basketbailers was named as honorary chairman.
The members of the club and their friends will truck and shag to the syncopated rhythm of Harold Austin’s orchestra. The price of a bid is to be $2.50. The proceeds of this affair will be turned over to the Buffalo Alumni Scholarship fund.
Daily Item
In a certain French class last week, a certain professor was relating the marriage custom of the French people. This is what he was saying: “When a French girl wishes to marry she gets permission of her father etc., etc., ... At the marriage she gives a dowry to her husband. ...”
At this point the professor was interrupted by a waving arm in the front row. Asked the inquisitive (but not so attentive) student: “But what if she doesn’t keep a diary?”
(Pas du tout, Monsieur—, pas du tout!)
concerns, Dr. Gurian noted, “It is very interesting to hear that the Catholic Youth association in Germany is forbidden in the Rhineland, because it has been accused of being Communistic. Of course, this persecution is not the same as in Russia, Mexico, or by the anarchists in Spain; churches are not burned, but step by step Christendom is more and more being eliminated from public life, and the Nazi government’s particular method of strangulation is difficult to see.”
Dr. Hjalmer Schacht, Reichsbank president and recently resigned minister of economics in Germany, gave the Nazi point of view in a previous issue of Foreign Affairs.
In his article Dr. Gurian makes a careful, detaled analysis of the relationship between the Catholic Church and the Nazis previous to and principally since the inception of the present Concordat between the Papacy and Germany. “In 1930 and 1931,” he begins, “the Catholic bishops of Germany issued warnings agianst the rising National Socialist Paarty. The essence of what they said was that the party program ‘ placed a Germanic feeling of race above religion.”
Continuing, Dr. Gurian relates that the first Hitler attack on the Church since the Concordat was an accusation that members of the Catholic orders were violating the exchange laws. In 1936 the “morality trials” were used by the National Socialist State “to establish the general immorality of the Catholic clergy and the Catholic orders.”
One of Hitler’s chief weapons has been the gradual suppression of the “confessional schools” in Germany, which permitted the teaching of religion in German public schools by Catholic priests. In this connection, “The attack on the confessional character of public schools now became more acute. In, various districts, Wurttemberg for example, the question was disposed of by so-called parents’ elections. In advance of these elections all propaganda on behalf of the confessional schools was forbidden and in the elections themselves it proved practically impossible to vote other than one way.”
This action lead to the publication of the Encyclical, Mit brennender Sorge by Pope Pius in the spring of 1937. This stressed four points: “(1) the Third Reich’s constant use of the

VINCENTIANS END SUCCESSFUL OLD CLOTHES DRIVE; SELL BUS AND PLANE TICKETS
MUSICIANS PRESENT FIRST RECITAL
Over in the basement storeroom of Lyons hall lies a great heap of used shoes, shirts, suits, and other pieces of clothing. That pile is the result of the recent clothes drive of the St. Vincent de Paul Society. It represents Christmas cheer for many of South Bend’s less fortunate citizens. The clothing will be
turned in, and then refers needy under its care to the Good Will Industries. There they can obtain anything in stock as far as the society’s credit goes.
Large signs with rhymes were placed in all the halls announcing the clothes drive. All members of the Vincentians helped to canvass the halls. The Student Mission Crusade gave valuable cooperation in this work. Students of the University are thanked for their generosity in the clothes campaign.
The Vincentian Society is campus representative of the Greyhound Bus Lines, and of various air lines. All week, bus tickets have been sold to almost every state in the Union. And not such a small number of students are going home by way of the airlanes, according to advance ticket sale. It is reported that Notre Dame students will occupy an entire plane on the Chicago-Kansas City run.
As in the past, the society will give several Christmas baskets to worthy families.
Recently the sophomore and freshmen religion classes were told of the scope of the Vincentian’s work by several of their members.
Club Announces Prize
The Notre Dame Aeronautical Society, under the presidency of Robert W. Huether, held a meeting Dec. 10, in the auditorium of the John F. Cushing Hall of Engineering.

Combine Spanish Clubs To Hold Breakfast
•
Boasting a record attendance for their Communion breakfast in honor of the feast of “Our Lady of Guadalupe,” the Spanish clubs of Notre Dame and St. Mary’s can look admiringly at their meeting of Sunday, Dec. 12.
Following Mass in Sorin Hall chapel, celebrated by Rev. Peter Forrestal, C.S.C., chaplain of the Spanish club, the group left for breakfast at the LaSalle hotel in South Bend.
Professor Pedro de Landero, faculty advisor for the Spanish club, acted as toastmaster for the gathering, following breakfast. After introducing Professors DuBois, Langford, Riley, Corona, and Langwell, faculty members who were present, he presented Patricia Shouvlin, Charles Kolp, and Jaime Gomez; Presidents of the Santa Teresa club, Spanish club, and La Raza club respectively; each of whom gave a brief address in Spanish.
Father Forrestal was the principal speaker for the occasion, basing his talk on the great Mexican feast of “Our Lady of Guadalupe” in whose intention the meeting was conducted. This is an annual feast day among the Mexican people, and one which incites much pomp and celebration.
The first student musical recital sponsored by the music department of the University was given last Wednesday evening, Dec. 15, at 6:45 p.m. in the Music Hall.
The performance was opened by the rendition of Speaks “Sylvia” by tenor, Dave O’Brien. Karl Hunn, pianist, then followed with his interpretation of the Hungarian Rhapsody “Mignon” composed by Koelling. Next on the program, a baritone, John Denton gave his version of “When Song is Sweet” by San-Souci.
A duet featuring George Sauter, pianist, and Professor Ingersoll, violinist, presented the “Largetto” and “Scherzo” from Dvorak’s “Sonatine Opus 100” following the Hungarian Rhapsody. Then Frank Cielino rendered with a well-balanced tenor voice Metcalf’s “Absent.” With Charles Butler at the piano, a presentation of the popular “Prelude in G Minor” by Rachmaninoff was given next.	'
A selected solo by the tenor Tom Murphy completed the evening’s vocal portion of the recital. The instrumental section of the program was concluded when the violinist, Professor Ingersoll, assisted by George Sauter, pianist and Bernard Gero, violinist, gave an interesting exhibition of the artistry of a trio by performing Dancla’s “Symphonic” for two violins and a piano. Accompaniments for the vocal numbers was by Professor Elton Crepeau.
Cracow Club to Sing
Assembling in Cavanaugh Rec last Friday, the members of the Charles Philip Cracow club, campus Polish society held their regular monthly meeting. Rev. Stanislaus Lisewski, C.S.C., presided.
After the members of the club had sung several of their native Christmas carols, Stanley Partyka read a paper on Christmas customs in Poland. The speaker delved into history in relating the origins of the customs, tracing their development and explaining their present-day significance.
Father Lisewski revealed to the club that they had been selected to present a program of Polish music over station WSBT on Jan. 19 and announced that practice for the event would begin immediately.
After the meeting was adjourned, an intra-club ping pong and billiard tournament was held in' the Rec.

PROF. PEDTKE REPLIES TO MUSIC CRITIC
•
Ed note: Replying to Don Currier's letter of inquiry about the facilities for music loving students here on the campus, that appeared in last week’s scholastic, Mr. Daniel H. Pedtke, head of the department of music, replies:
“Mr. Currier’s article was not a surprise to me as I believe he voices the opinion of a number of students, some of whom have approached me on the same subject. Mr. Currier is expecting extraordinary things in his aificle. I know of no school in the country that places studios free of charge for the use of students.
“The studios of Music Hall are let for a rental fee of less than half of those of all other schools and we have in them the best pianos available. Other pianos are available in recreation rooms of various halls.. Contrary to- Mr. Currier’s conclusion, Notre Dame leads the way in giving these and other musical advantages to its students. As for leaving the studios open on Sundays and evenings, this situation existed until a few years ago when sounds emanating from the Music Hall were anything but Bach and Beethoven—truly music for the soul.
“There are surely no objections to the playing of good music but the playing of St. Louis Blues, Tiger Rag, Twelfth Street Rag, etc., pounded out in drum-like fashion particularly on Sunday would desecrate the atmosphere of the campus. Notre Dame encourages the development of good music and gives every opportunity for individual expression among the students. History repeats itself. Aristotle emphasized the influence of music on the morals of youth and forebade the use of lower types of music. The singing or playing of certain tunes in ancient India was a major offense punishable in many cases by death.
“All great leaders used music for their own advantage—in encouraging patriotism to a high pitch among the populace. The “Marseillaise” was an important factor in the French Revolution which undoubtedly proves the power of music. We might even point to popularity of certain types of music as a thermometer of economic conditions. Who cannot detect the difference of music before and after the last great war?
“We are in the midst of a campaign for decent literature which is proving as effective as a previous campaign for decent movies. Why not apply the same effort to the field of music, and blot out the indecent there.

"It's a Nice Place You got here," Says the Ghost of Washington Hall
Donald A. Foskett ❖
By
Hamlet has his ghost and so did MacBeth. “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” with Ichabod Crane and his headless horseman, is as familiar to every American schoolboy as the stories of the banshees are to the boys and girls of Ireland. On the modern stage the producers of a Broadway hit, “The Ghost Train,” even went so far as to reduce a whole train—locomotive, cars and all—to the aspect of a phantom, and send it
“They tell me that the ghost rides the horse in this picture.”
roaring and shrieking through the night under- a spotlight moon. Not to be outdone by playwrights, authors, and publishers, Notre Dame stepped out and got itself a ghost of its very own many, many years ago. Now someone told the news editor of The Scholastic about this eerie fellow and he, in turn, told me. And here we are.
The ordinary procedure in writing a story of this sort is familiar to everyone who has sat through a double-feature dealing with what is supposed to go on behind the sacred doors of the city room of a big metropolitan newspaper. The grumbling victim assigned to the story grabs a shirt and tie, a package of cigarettes, and a railroad timetable; then he hopefull sets out for the scene of the crime or the boyhood home of the trans-Pacific aviator. The reason for this is to absorb that invaluable something called “local color,” which seems to be an integral part of the feature story.
With this in mind, a trip to Washington Hall early Saturday evening was planned to let a bit of this atmosphere sink in, since this place, I was informed, has been known for years as the headquarters of the famous Ghost of Washington Hall. It
was a simple matter to get in and, once in, I slouched into one of the wooden seats for which the hall is famed from Notre Dame Avenue to Clark Street. Two minutes of deep thought followed, my eyes shifting from Demosthenes to Cicero, up to Washington, and back to Demosthenes. Suddenly there rolled into my ear a deep, jovial voice, “A little early for the first show, aren’t you?” Naturally I started a little; bu then, after reconsidering a second, I decided I had been concentrating too vigorously on that statue of Demosthenes.
“What’s the matter, son? No blow?”
Aha! I had it! That old familiar phrase, the trade-mark of a Notre Dame man, slapped me right between my two bushy eyebrows. The Ghost himself was speaking to me. Now, take it from me, my friends, the next fifteen or twenty seconds were mighty, mighty hectic seconds; your bewildered correspondent was in a quandary. Which would be worse— to slight a ghost, or to talk to him and have the good Brother saunter in and decide that I should continue my studies at a state-supported school at Logansport? Logansport won, and I talked.
“How long have you been hanging around here?” was my first query.
“Well, son, that’s quite a story. Several years ago, when Sorin Hall was the “gold coast” on the campus, and the Chapin Street trolley cars were the pride of the Silver Fleet, I first made myself known on the campus. The particular occasion? At this time there were three undergraduates living here in Washington Hall. One night the boys took a midnight, and didn’t get in till pretty near 11:45; they were very tired and very sleepy; so I decided to go to work on them. Of course I was a very young and unsophisticated ghost then, so I resorted to the rather ancient, but quite effective method of dumping over beds and throwing water. None of this moaning and chain-clanking for me. That’s storybook stuff! Only kids fall for that! At any rate the result of my little escapade was just what I figured it would be; the three boarders left in a hurry, and the hall, because of new rooming facilities, wasn’t used for this purpose any more. It’s all mine now.
“And have you plied your trade here ever since?” I asked.
“No, I have been retired all these years,” replied the Ghost. “I come here every Saturday night to the (Continued on Page 22)

NOVENA FOR PARENTS COMES TO CLOSE
•
The Christmas novena for parents, one of the most popular novenas held during the schoolyear, will end with Benediction in Sacred Heart church at 5 p.m. today. Starting on Dec. 9, the novena consisted of Holy Communions, Masses heard, visits either to the Blessed Sacrament or to the Grotto, Rosaries, ejaculations, and periods of adoration.
Over 1200 students signed up for from three to nine one-half hour periods of adoration during the nine-day period. The Connnunion record shows some 1700 are making the novena. These periods, extending from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., as well as the novena services, have been excellently attended. At times the supply of vestments was not sufficient to meet the demand, but more surplices and cassocks were obtained late this week. /1 the five o’clock novena services there has been an overflow of adorers from the Lady chapel into the main part of the church.
The Rev. Cornelius Hooyboer officiated at exposition, the novena ser-vices, and at reposition.
The novenas for purity and for parents have always been popular, but the response to this novena is greater than usual. This may be attributed partly to the fact that the Religious Bulletin distributed the spiritual bouquet cards directly to each student this year.
Several schools throughout the country have sent requests for these novena cards, among them Central Catholic High school, South Bend, which asked for 120. Students there are making a similar novena.
Each day notification cards are sent to students reminding them of the time of their adoration periods. In fact the religion department helps the student in every way possible to lead a thorough religious life. Requests are received from all over the country asking about the methods used by the Religious Bulletin. Just recently the department answered a query from as far away as China.
Met Club Fixes Plans
At a Communion breakfast held in West Dining Hall last Sunday morning the Metropolitan club held dress rehearsal of their holiday plans. As previously announced the Met clubbers will “swing out” in their Christmas Formal at the Hotel Roosevelt Dec. 27, with Bill McCune’s synco-paters swinging the music.

John Lawrence Buckley transferred to Notre Dame from Georgetown U. in his freshman year and, upon his arrival, set about campaigning for the Chicago Club presidency for his senior year. Last Spring he had the honor of winning the closest election in the school’s history: final tabulation, 125-124.
This smiling, energetic Gold Coaster is known to many as “Baldy,” but Buck insists that he isn’t losing hair; the individual strands are merely getting thinner. He enjoys profes-
sional hair treatments, but can’t notice any results. Perhaps his baldness is caused by the lassie at Rosary College who is wearing his pin. Certainly she is the cause of his constant commuting. Cagy “Buck” took advantage of Founders’ Day and the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, and to date has a record of more “weekends” than there were weeks.
In preparation for Law, John chose the A.B. course with a major in Philosophy. Admission is freely given that certain subjects are rather mysterious to him, but nevertheless he has a remarkable scholastic record. In addition to his regular schedule of classes, John assumed the extra duties of auditing and participating in a debating class. Recently in a debate on Labor Unions he clinched a victory for his side by relating personal observations about the labor leaders and gangsters in his home town, Cicero, Illinois. The professor labeled his speaking as “colorful.”
That word aptly describes his wardrobe, his fawn Buick convertible with the red body stripe, and John himself in all his activities.
DOME PLANS SECOND HONOR AWARDS
•
The editors of the Dome have again received permission from the University officials to honor four seniors, whom the Dome recognizes as being the most outstanding in the field of extra-curricular activities, with the coveted Dome Award of Recognition.
In view of the fact that the scholarly students reecive their recognition at graduation and that the athlete is acclaimed through the medium of the press, the Dome feels that the average student who not only has a good average in his studies but rounds out his college life by active participation in extra-curricular activities, should gain some form of recognition.
It is for this purpose of inciting students to more active participation in the various extra-curricular activities that the Dome Award of Recognition is given.
The selection of Seniors for this award is made by a committee composed of eighteen Juniors repressent-ing all branches of campus life. They are members of The Scholastic, the Dome, the Student Managers Association, and ' one representative from each of the five colleges.
After careful consideration of each candidate, four are finally chosen during March. The winners are officially notified in May immediately preceding the Publications banquet. At this banquet they are presented with scrolls and keys.
These four Seniors also have their pictures in a special section of the Dome where the award is explained and reasons are given as to why each man was selected.
The Dome Awards of Recognition were won last year by Paul F. Barker, James A. Waldron, Paul E. Foley, and Richard H. Meier.
Detroiters to Statler
The Detroit Club has selected the Hotel Statler as the scene of their Christmas Formal to be held Monday, December 27.
Two large ballrooms have been secured for the occasion as a large number of students and alumni are expected by Chairman Donald Currier.
At a meeting held on December 10, in Badin Rec, President Joe Moore announced the committee for the Christmas dance. Committee chairmen are: Tom Kavanaugh, music; Pete Martin, tickets; Walter Hagen, publicity; Tim Cruice, decorations; and Dick Foley, entertainment.

THE WEEK
By Harold A. Williams
PHILOSOPHY CLUB TO STUDY MODERNS
Advs.
Various unique schemes for making money have appeared during the past few weeks. Curious enough, most of these schemes are promoted by the cultural A.B. men who claim that they find their greatest sales among the practical minded Commerce students. Our old friend “Pelican” Phelan, the goldfish swallower, has found business terrible so he is selling his fish at a very low price (attention Mr. Connolly). Bill Tunney, current holder of the tardy record, is selling something new in the calendar line. He calls his calendars “Notre Dame in Portrait,” each month being illustrated with campus view. (Thanks for the free copy, Bill.) A fellow in Badin, his name escapes us, rents candid cameras for classroom purposes (see item headed Camera) and also takes any type of picture. Bill O’Toole has written a verse about Elmer Layden. The verse is printed over a picture of Elmer and set off in a grey frame. A fellow named Vogel from Walsh will wake you up any time every morning, closing the window and turning the heat on before he disturbs you. And a chap from Carroll, who neglected to tell us his name, will attend any class for you (provided the class numbers over 30 and you are not too well known by the professor). He takes notes and does anything else the professor might require. He’s planning on doing a big business before and after vacation.
One of the neatest things we have seen around here in some time is Ed Hickey’s “Notre Dame a la carte,” a map of the campus which contains buildings, characters, and traditions. The best touch, we thought, was our old friend Schlitz standing outside of Zahm (he lives in Cavanaugh, Ed) holding a sign, “Visiting hours 7-9.” The trickiest, we thought, was the piece of wood lying outside of Lyons titled “Forgot something — Saint Mary’s.”
Romance
In this age of yellow journalism, vulgar magazines, sophisticated movies, and drug store libraries, when the sweet flower of romance is crushed and trampled upon and thrown in the gutter, it is consoling to find a magazine that can still present romance in a proper manner. Frank Hamilton Spearman, a Lae-tare medalist a few years back, writing in the Ave Maria last week concluded chapter 36—The Moment, of “Carmen of the Rancho” thusly:
“He swept her into his arms. He
imprisoned her lips ruthlessly -within his own. It was long before either spoke, or wished to speak. They were moments not meant for words—moments when longing held back for years, bursts its barriers and sweeps the senses with an ecstasy that gives way only in swoon. She pushed herself from him and stood with averted eyes. Both were breathing passionately.
“No, Carmen, my queen, you need not tell me in words. All I have ever hoped for in my life, I may read now in your glorious eyes. I know from your beating heart, that all has come true, my Carmen.”
Christmas
This little item was supposed to be all about the Christmas vacation, how everybody was looking forward to it and what they were going to do, etc. But somehow or other we can’t express what we want to say—we guess we are too excited or something. About the only thing we can do is repeat the little couplet written by one Thomas Tusser in 1557 (we didn’t find it among Tusser’s works, we saw it in a liquor ad, but that doesn’t make much difference).
At Christmas	•
Play. . . . and
Make Good Cheer For Christmas comes But once a year.
And so to the students of Notre Dame, their parents, their friends, their girls, we say Merry Christmas. To Father Broughal, the rector, the prefect, the roommate, the editor, the managing editor, Mr. Armstrong, Mr. Dooley, Bob Cahill, the waiter at table 110, our professors’ correctors, the Scholastic staff, the mailman, the maid, Ollie, and anybody else we happened to forget, we say happy new year. To our professors, we say peace on earth to men of good will.
Carols
If we remember correctly, two years ago the Monogram club a few days before the Christmas vacation caroled their way around the campus and over to St. Mary’s and back. Last year, if we still remember correctly, a group did the same thing. We think that it would be a good idea if the carolers got together again under the direction of the Monogram club or some other organization, and, in addition to the usual route, include Du-jarie, Holy Cross, and Moreau.
“The Schoolmen,” philosophical club, at its last meeting Nov. 15 in Badin Rec, was divided into three groups, each assigned a different phase of a problem in modem philosophy, in the light of scholastic principles.
William T. Mahoney, president of the organization, announced that the
Crollard and Keenan Head study groups.
following men will supervise their respective groups; George Keenan (Philosophy of Communism); Fred Crollard (Philosophy of Natural Law); and Jerome Ledvina (Philosophy of Science).
Each group within the club will have its respective topic to discuss, and further investigation of the particular questions concerning the problems of modern philosophy, will be the subject for the entire club.
“To apply the principles of philosophy to modem life,” is the object of the organization; and membership in the Schoolmen, other than charter members, is restricted to those with at least six semester hours of credit in philosophy.
G/ee Club Tours
During the past week the Glee Club, under the direction of Professor Joseph Casasanta, completed three extensive trips throughout northern Indiana. On December 7th the organization journeyed to Fort Wayne where a concert was given for the Apha Beta Sorority in the Catholic Community Center.
December 7th found the club in Indianapolis for the presenting of a concert at the Murat Theater. This was under the sponsorship of the Cathedral High School which is directed by the Brothers of Holy Cross.
At the request of the Catholic Men’s Guild of St. Mary’s Church in Muncie, a concert was given at the Ball State Teachers’ College. This appearance of the club marked one of the important social events of the .year in Muncie.
Several short trips have been scheduled for the near future. These include concerts in Chicago on Jan. 25, at Culver on Feb. 4.

SNOW CARPET SHOWS CAMPUS AT BEST
By John J. Kohn
There will be no speculation about the possibility of a white Christmas this year. The premature dress rehearsal had already enveloped the campus in a deep coat of white. That winter is here we are certain. The cold and biting west wind has been blowing with its usual sharpness and is particularly offensive to the ears. All this, it seems, serves as a subtle, if not somewhat cold reminder that the Christmas holidays are at hand.
Under a blanket of white.
A good snowstorm brings out manifold types of dress whereby the students keep warm. Some, still wishing to retain their collegiate appearance, refuse to don hats. However, they do condescend to wear ear muffs. Others are quick to use the headgear attached to their winter coats. Whether they look like eskimos matter little; they are keeping warm.
Seldom does the campus present a lovelier picture than after a winter snowstorm. The flowering magnolias and daily budding tulips bring a phantasy of color in the spring. But the snow whitened branches of the pines, the ice-caked lakes and the spotless countryside all bring an inimitable beauty to the winter scene. Toward evening the many buldings cast silhouettes to make multi-patterns in the snow. Students move along hurriedly, the new snow crunching under their step. The only discernible break in the snow being the paths between the buildings. As the moon is reflected on the snow, the entire campus seems to glow with brilliant whiteness.
We find, however, beneath the beauty of a white Christmas, a far

WRANGLERS ARGUE ON NEUTRALITY
“The fundamental issue. in the world today is ‘Can peace be protected?’ and it should be the policy of the United States to see that the answer is ‘Yes.’ ” Charles Osborn, secretary of the Wranglers, thus summed up the speech on the foreign policy of America, delivered before the club Wednesday night, Dec. 15.
The speaker proposed four things which this country ought to do because “the only way to stay out of a European war is to prevent it.”. The proposals were: that the United States scrap the Neutrality Act; that we make an alliance with Great Brittain; that we once more attain our position of world prominence; that we act as an intermediary in the Chinese - Japanese Far-eastern troubles; and that this nation establish boycott and prohibitive tariff policies against nations that are culpably aggressors.
Open discussion followed the speech, and most of the members dissented. Points that were questioned in particular were: “Have we ever entered into a foreign treaty without losing our shirt?” and “Would not a boycott and high tariff against other nations have an evil effect on our own people?”
Most of the club members were in agreement with Osborne in his statement that Fascism is as great, or greater, a menace to the peace of the word today as Communism. The wars that are being carried on at present are Fascistic wars; although Russia and Communism has some part in them, it is not as important as that of the totalitarian, socialistic states of central Europe.

• Christmas Cheer.
Tomorrow the big push starts and the howling pack leaves for all compass points. . . . But promoters are now dashing around the halls, getting the lads who can’t afford the train, or those who can but want to give the jewelry salesmen a break with the difference. . . . City club dances are looked forward to, “hot stove” sessions with the local gentry are anticipated, and a general good time is in the offing. (Provided, of course, that the “pink slip” storm has lulled. . . . Ah, it’s a great season, fellows, and think of what it brings! . . . Christmas Day packages will be opened and the “wall-paper” ties from Aunt Minnie and Uncle Gus will be displayed in all their tinctorial vividness, making the spectrum look like “Blue Monday.” . . . The kid sis- • ter, taking home economics in high school, will have knitted you a sweater, the shoulders of which start at the elbows, and the waist of which begins at the knees. You’ll be called an unappreciative lout because you said she should keep it and send it out a little later after the proper adjustments have been made. . . . You’ll give this year’s flame that bit of Notre Dame jewelry and she’ll exclaim in her -cute way, “Oh, it’s too, too ducky! I’ll wear it to the dance tonight. All the girls will be simply green with envy.” ... At the dance you’ll see last year’s heart wearing her “too, too ducky” gift. The perspiration will begin to ooze and you’ll futilely pray that the girls don’t wind up together in one of those nose-powdering sessions. . . . The seniors, poor chaps, are in for it. . . . After contemplating gifts to buy them, relatives will suddenly realize that Joe and Bill get out next June. (“Get out” are the words for it). Dollars will be conserved on the Christmas gift so that it won’t be a burden on the budgets to buy graduation gifts. Bill and Joe will get about a dozen pairs of garters and an assortment of earmuffs. The sound of snapping elastic will send quivers up and down their spines for years to come. They’ll be able to use earmuffs for Saturday evenings in Washington Hall. . . . Speaking of Washington Hall, the freshmen at last Saturday’s first show should leave their rattles with the neighborhood babies and put those gift mufflers to more than one use when they get back. . . . Before going home, there are some things that should be done. Roommates, to begin with, should follow that old Scandanavian Christmas custom of placing the shoes of
the family together a few days before Christmas so that they will live in harmony during the next year. ... In the west of England cattle are given double rations on Christmas Day so that misfortune will not follow. We’re not exactly cattle, despite some opinions to the contrary, but the dining hall staff could take a little hint from this, now couldn’t they? . . . You’ll want to be known as keen fellows, won’t you chums, when you leave home to come back to the place you did all the bragging about? Of course; so we’ve prepared a list of question to toss the noncollegian hecklers who like to show us up. (And if you say they can’t, you’re wasting even more of your time). These are known as “bafflers” and guaranteed to throw a smalltown yokel on his ear every time:
Q. What is an abscess?
A. Abscess makes the heart grow fonder.
Q. What is the meaning of err?
A. Something I’ll probably get for writing this. The err I mean.
Q. What is the meaning of finny?
A. That’s French, like "too finny,”— everything is done.
Q. What is the meaning of writhe? A. Well, you’re either writhe or you’re wrong.
“My girl wants a he-man for Christmas !n
Q. What is a gnu?
A. That ain’t the way you spell it, dope, it’s c-a-n-o-e.
Q. What is a lout?
A. You see it on signs, like, no smoking a lout.
Q. What is a dullard?
A. Right now they figure it’s about 59 cents.
Q. What was the size of Caesar’s shirt?
A. Boy, have you got him on this one!
Wrong Number
They tell the one about Mario Tonelli being introduced to a fair young thing of twenty springs in the lobby of the Hotel St. Paul. After the “How do you do’s” and “Pleased to meetcha’s” had wilted, the lassie started to put on the chocolate frosting with:
“Gee, you played a marvelous game against Minnesota this afternoon. I liked that long run you made.”
Motts fidgeted, crossed one foot over the other, and assumed an apple complexion.
"Well, you see,” he blurted, "the truth is that I didn’t play in today’s game.”
That’s feminine courtesy for you —anything for a conversation.

War Scare
SECULAR journals this week are filled with flaming stories of death and destruction in the Far East. Bombastic editorials demand that the government secure immediate and complete satisfaction for the bombing of one American gunboat and several tankers during a foray in the present Chinese-Japanese crisis. It reminds one of the days of the “Maine,” of the “Lusitania,” and of the hideous days of unrestricted submarine activities.
In both instances the United States demanded complete satisfaction, failed to get it, and so were “forced” to recourse to sending millions of American citizens abroad at a cost of billions of dollars, thousands of deaths, and irreparable and unaccountable losses of an immaterial nature. Are these days to come upon us again in this season of good will to men and peace on earth?
They will not if campus chatter may be taken as any criterion of the pulse and tempo of our times. Student
opinion is bent towards the obtaining of satisfaction of some sort, but is irrevocably opposed to war. This is as it should be. Such opinion levels war scares down to their proportionate value. Surely a loss comparable to the losses sustained in the*World War is a price too high to be paid for a gunboat and three tankers.
Too, such opinion stands in the way of those who seize upon little pretexts of this type to initiate a general human catastrophe in the furtherance of their own base motives. People are no longer to be hurried into situations in which they have no desire to participate nor obtain any particular honor to their nation. They tell us the last war was to save the world for democracy. It is hoped that the world has not degenerated in the past twenty years or so to the belief that it is now time to make the world safe for gunboats.
Christmas Spirit
FLORIDA and California publicity men begin informing the world of the proximity of the Yuletide season about the time the Thanksgiving turkeys make known their arrival in “the happy hunting grounds.” For us on the campus though, the fact does not become a reality until on all sides is heard the annual question of: “When ya leavin’?”
Some may leave early, and some on time. But all, with an exception here and there, are bound for home and good times. And why not? It is the season of joy! Have a good time, and come back ready to “hit the books” in preparation for those not too distant examinations.
Yet since it is the occasion for good times, there is no reason to take a selfish attitude. Do things, such as little small courtesies, that will make your family and your friends enjoy a more happy Christmas. You’ll be spending a fair amount of money entertaining the girl friend, buying presents, taking in dances, sporting events, etc. This year try also to contribute a dollar or two to some Christmas charity fund and find the inward pleasure to be received from so doing.
When graduation comes and it’s time to begin your own individual battle, to a certain extent at least, you’ll be depending on the prestige and name of Notre Dame-to help you in getting started. Did you ever stop to 1’ealize that the prestige and name enjoyed by Notre Dame in your particular community is raised or lowered as a result of your own actions while at home during the vacation periods. And while on the subject of employment, why not make it a point, while home, to see all the bank presidents and corporation heads that you have on your contact list. Perhaps they are looking for another executive. You might also look up such members of the business gentry who might be able to give you a job some day.
The spirit of Christmas is one of joyous good will. Let us see that the spirit of Notre Dame is held in similar repute by the world at large. And now, not because it’s the customary thing to do, but because we really mean it, we wish, you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

A Rose For Notre Dame
Winter walked slowly into the Canadian woods that year. Mid-November still found the trees fringed in green and vying with the golden pattern of Autumn. The afternoon breeze which breathed through the open doorway of the St. Leger cabin was crisply pleasant, and the sunlight still pierced the windows to snarl sunbeams across the long front room.
Antoinette St. Leger sat straight on the edge of the rough wooden chair by the fireplace, her chubby legs dangling well clear of the floor. A pensive thumb made frequent audible excursions to her small mouth as she wached her mother busily transfer dirt from a large pan to the small, brown flowerpot dotting the long table in the center of the room.
The live coals of curiosity burned in ’Toinette’s eyes for almost two minutes. She watched her mother pick brown bulbs from a glass jar and push them deep down into the dh-t-filled pots; then, when the mother had transferred the pots to the window sill, Antoinette removed her thumb from hex- mouth long enough to ask the question: “What are you doing, mother?”
The mother turned from the window. She was slight, slim, and she mirrored Antoinette’s oval face and black hair. “Planting lilies, ’Toi-nette,” she answered, “so that we shall have them to place before the statue of Notre Dame on Christmas morning.”
Lilies roused a flicker of memory in ’Toinette. She was just five. Last Christmas the long white sentinels guarding the dancing white light before the small statue on the mantle .had been only a small wonder, and not one to compare with the black bear her father had carved from pine. She sat still for a moment simultaneously digesting the thumb and the information; then she slid off the chair and ran outside.
When she returned ten minutes later she carried a thorny twig in her left hand. Evidently, the twig had not been acquired casually. A long rent bisected the front of a once-white dress; a skinned patch bobbled on her bare left knee; and a smudge lined her nose and smeared her cheek. Disregarding these acquisitions as well as the ominous gasp of disapproval from the mother, she skipped across the room to the table and began to fill one of the remaining flower pots with dirt. This accom-

plished, she stuck the twig down deep and surveying the finished product with pride, she bore it triumphantly across the room to the window sill and deposited it in the sunlight along side the lily bulbs.
“See, mother,” she explained, turning about, “more lilies for Notre Dame.” The motive for her activity thus revealed did alleviate the punishment contemplated by the mother, but it could not allay the consequences of the deed. Leaving for a later time an explanation of the extreme unlikelihood of ever growing
A Worthy Experience
He reached for stars — They seemed so near;
His heart teas young And kneiv no fear.

So soaring high, He left the sod
Of earthly things To talk zvith God.

lilies from rose bush trimmings, the mother gathered up soap and towels in one hand and Antoinette in the other and set about bringing the two into immediate and intimate association.
Later, glowing with the honest shine of soap and water, Antoinette again sallied outdoors and followed the sloping path which wound down the hillside from the cabin to the toolhouse by the spring. She approached the toolhouse silently and stepped inside the open doorway. The sunlight falling through the windows revealed her father kneeling within a circle of tangled steel. As she watched he bent forward and touched something. Clang! Two pieces of steel flew together like teeth closing. Frightened, she fell sideways and came down seated in a spot damp with the slithery seepage from an oil barrel.
“So!” the father held her high in
his thick arms up close to his black beard, “So! The first time I have caught a little rabbit in my traps. The fox, yes; but the rabbit, never . . . and look at your dress! What will mother say? . . . He laughed. . . . “Tell mother the oil was my fault. Along home with you now . . . and tell mother I’ll be home soon for supper.”
Supper was a cheerful meal. Antoinette was bedecked in another clean dress, immaculately clean for the entire forty-five minutes preceding supper, and commendably clean even after the trial of eating the dessert of rice pudding. The mother was cheerful and inclined to overlook the pudding stains. Her biscuits were the barometer to her heart, and tonight the biscuits were warm and light. The father was cheerful, too. There had been a colder hint in the evening air, and he spoke jovially of the snow to come.
“When the snow comes the trapping will be good,” he said, “and the pelts will be sleek after the long autumn. With luck we’U have a fur coat for Little ’Toinette this Christmas.”
But the morning air was warm again, and the following days continued fair- as a snowless November lengthened into a brown and green December. And strangely enough (perhaps it was the continued warm weather) the rose trimming began to grow in its sunny spot by the window. And finally, the eighteenth of December—the same time the lilies began to bud—saw a little green shoot pop forth on the rose trimming.
The following morning snow clouds piled like grey gauze over the trees to the north. But they unfurled by noon, and the sun came out warmer than the previous day. Antoinette slept briefly after lunch. She awoke at two and wandered down the hill to the toolhouse. Again, she surprised her father who was sitting on the toolhouse steps. Tiny curlicues of wood shavings lay about him, as he chipped away at a pine log with his big knife.
Her step crackled on a wood shaving and he turned and saw her. “So! You again! I’ll have to set one of my traps for you. I can’t have you spoiling all my secrets!”
“What is that, father?” asked Antoinette, pointing to the log.
“That ’Toinette is a surprise for mother, a big statue to take the place of the little white one on the mantle.

PURPLE CAGERS MEET IRISH HERE TOMORROW IN TRADITIONAL AND COLORFUL CONTEST
INTRA-SQUAD MEET HELD BY THINLIES
By Robert B. Voelker
Tomorrow night the Northwestern Wildcats invade the Notre Dame Gymnasium for one of the biggest games of the basketball season. There is always plenty of rivalry when Notre Dame meets Northwestern, and this year promises to be no exception. Last year the lads from Evanston lacked team speed but were able to win one of their two ____________________________________ contests with Notre Dame. This year *
there is a faster Purple quintet on the floor.
Like Wisconsin, the Purple squad bases its scoring attack on set plays, including the block system executed from out of bounds and from the quarter-court position. Due to the new ruling which eliminates the center jump, we will find Northwestern relying on a fast-breaking offensive which calls for men in better physical condition than has been previously required.
The problem confronting Coach Dutch Lonborg is the guard post. Four of the six lettermen lost by graduation were guards: Duke Vance, Guy Mercer, Hi Bender, and Chet Gargas. Dutch also wishes he had Tug Blume at forward and Don Worland at center.
■ The Wildcat team is built around the seven returning lettermen. Among them, Mike McMichael, star forward, will probably be lost to the squad because of leg injuries occurred in a touch - football game. McMichael placed second in Big Ten scoring last year.
Captain .Fred Trenkle will be at one of the forward posts, while the other will probably be filled by Charles Melchior, a sophomore from Jasper, Indiana. Charles weighs 150 pounds, is but five feet two inches tall, and has speed and a good shooting eye. Another sophomore who is making a strong bid for the front court consideration is Lester Harman of Chicago. Cleo Diehl, another forward, was a letterman last year and has just turned in his football equipment.
Jean Smith and Jake Nagode will alternate at center. Both boys are six feet two and have shared the pivot honors for the past two years. Smith, from Logansport, Ind., will probably start.

handler. Ad Vance, brother of Duke Vance who was captain of the team two years ago, will be the other guard. Other guards include Bob Voights, Jack Woy, Perry Feaman, and Bob Sampson, all squad men last year, and Robert Saley, a sophomore from Iowa.
The two schools have met 20 times since 1927. Notre Dame won ten games and the Wildcats have taken nine, and one resulted in that famous 20 to 20 tie, through a scoring error.
Coach John P. Nicholson held an intra-squad track meet in the Fieldhouse last Saturday to make sure that his boys are progressing as he desires in the business of getting in shape. Although the Blues eventually beat the Reds by a score of 39 to 31, very few of the runners cared or even knew on which team they were competing.
Ted Leonas won the high jump with a not-too-hard 5 feet 8 inches, and Dan Gibbs eased himself over a crossbar at 12 feet 6 inches to win the pole vault. Since Bill Faymon-ville was tossing the iron ball with his left hand—his right one is in a plaster cast—Dick Mizerski had little trouble in winning the shot put at 40 feet four inches. Tom Shields barely beat Bill Clifford in a 6.5 60-yard dash, but Captain Bill Mahoney had a rather easy time in the hurdle races.
To develop each individual runner’s sense of pace, “Nick” ran the longer distance men in relays. And because no one of them is fit yet for an “all-out” race at his full distance, only three quarters of the regular distance was run for each event from the quarter mile up. Johnny Francis, veteran half miler who probably has the most effortless running form of anyone on the squad, turned in the most thrilling performance of the afternoon when he gradually cut down the 25-yard gap that confronted him at the start of his anchor leg, and beat out Curt Hestor in a home stretch sprint. His time of 1:22 for 660 yards is exceptional at such an early point in the season.
The team is just about in shape now to begin really intensive work. It will take a week or so in January to eliminate the lethargy of the Christmas lay-off, but from then on the pressure will be increased constantly in preparation for the opening meet of the indoor season, tentatively scheduled as a home meet with Marquette during the first week in February.

THREE CAGE GAMES DURING HOLIDAYS
There will be no Christinas holidays for the Irish eagers for they will be kept very much occupied during the next two weeks by opposing netmen from. Xavier, Illinois, and Northwestern.
The Irish should be a bit wary of these Christmas season games. Last year they lost but three games during the whole season, and two of these tilts during the holiday season. These games were lost to the very teams the Irish will meet again within the next two weeks, Illinois and Northwestern.
The first opponents on the Christmas schedule are the netmen of Xavier, coached by Clem Crowe, 1925 captain of the Notre Dame football squad. The Irish will journey to Cincinnati for this game the day after the University closes, Dec. 22.
On Dec. 28 the Irish will meet the Illinois eagers at Urbana. Last year’s Illinois team tied Minnesota for the Big Ten title. This year, as advance information would have it, the squad is green, small, and “fairly fast.” They will not doubt be pointing for another victory over Notre Dame.
On New Year’s Eve the Irish play Northwestern in their annual battle. The Wildcats upset the Irish last year in this game. Of the last 20 games played, Notre Dame has won ten, lost nine, and tied one. Fourteen of these 20 games have been won or lost by four point margins or less. Experienced players were available at all positions at the beginning of the year, but a trio of sophomore stars have been able to break into the line-up. Charles Melchoir and Walter Vance, forward and guard respectively, have been very prominent in the Wildcats early season victories. Les Harman, the third sophomore, has also been going very well.
Mike McMichael who placed second in Big Ten scoring for two years, has been kept out of play by a leg injury, but he should be back for the game with the Irish. On a whole, the Northwestern team is supposed to be a much faster team than last year. This will make it all the more difficult for the Irish to wipe out last year’s defeat.
The Irish close their holiday schedule the day before classes will be resumed, Jan. 4. They meet Minnesota in Minneapolis on this day.

HALL CAGERS START PRACTICE TILTS
The first round of warm-up games in both the Heavyweight and Lightweight divisions was held last Sunday. Twelve teams in each division saw action, and from all indications the interhall fan can look forward to the Sunday contests during the cold winter months. While all the teams looked exceptionally strong in every department, two heavyweight outfits can be ranked with the favorites because of Sunday’s showing. Carroll, headlining Lloyd Thompson, is the favorite at this writing but the Bad-inites, featuring Peter Arboit, are a very close second.
The second practice round will he run off Sunday and Monday, and the regular season will get under way immediately after the holidays.
The following practice games will be played:
Sunday, Dec. 19.—8:30 a.m., Badin vs. Sorin; 9:30 a.m., Old Infirmary vs. Howard; 10:30 a.m., Carroll vs. St. Edward’s; 1:30 p.m., Freshman vs.-Morrissey; 2:30 p.m., Zahm vs. Alumni; 3:30 p.m., Off-Campus vs. Walsh.

Joseph Edward Beinor of Harvey, Illinois consistently won All American honors this season. Joe (or Ed) was selected for one of the tackle berths on Christy Walsh’s “Official” All American. A number of prominent coaches aid Mr. Walsh in picking this team. The team selected is usually held in high regard by fans throughout the nation. The NEA news service also placed Joseph Edward on their first team. Many other football experts have placed him on their first team and thus substantiated his claim to All American honors.

country over. In the newspaper field Chuck was picked for first team honors on Hearst’s All United States team and on All American picked by the Associated Press, the United Press, Neivs-Week, the Boston Post, the New York Daily News, and many others. On the radio he won first team positions on Kate Smith’s All American, Paul Douglas’ Chesterfield All Star team and on Ted Busing’s All American. Chuck also was picked by Paramount News for an end post and thereby got his semi-classic profile projected on the silver screen.
Sweeney is also destined to be Notre Dame’s representative in the East-West game at San Francisco on New Year’s Day. Chuck was one of the wingmen selected by the coaches of the East squad, Dick Hanley, Bernie Bierman, and Andy Kerr. This is a signal honor, for he is the first Notre Dame player to be in this contest of stars since Ed Krause was selected in 1933.

INTRODUCING
By Mark J. Mitchell
James Francis Carson, basketball and baseball player, is another little fellow. Perhaps his 5 feet 9 inches and 165 pounds are the answer to his reticence. In any case Mr. Carson “wouldn’t talk” when accosted in the dressing room the other day. But then Mr. Carson really didn’t have to do much talking. His record is there in black and white for anyone to read who so desires.
which won the National High school
His home is in Indianapolis, Indiana. He grew up in St. James parish where —to quote one of Jim’s admirers—“he played all the sports they had.” He is one of a family of eight which includes a brother Bill, now a freshman here.
His high school was Cathedral of Indianapolis. For three years he played football and basketball there, and lamented all the time that the school did not have a baseball team. To make up for this he played in an amateur league during the summer, and ended up with an offer from the Indianapolis club of the American Association. Jim declined this, of course, to stay in school.
His high school football was devoted to quarterbacking. He played on the same team with Johnny McMahon two years, and was highly thought of for his work as signal-caller.
But basketball was really Jim’s field. As a sophomore, he understudied Johnny Ford. In his junior year' he was alternate first string forward on the team championship at Loyola. Cathedral was
invited back the next year to defend its championship, and though it was unsuccessful in this endeavor, little Jimmy came home from the tourney with All-Tournament honors tucked away in his duffle bag.
It was in this tournament that Jim received one of the greatest surprises of his life. Returning to the dressing room with the Cathedral team, he literally “smelled something burning.” Upon investigation, it was found that the team of Indians from St. Francis’ Mission in North Dakota had built a bonfire in the dressing room to celebrate their victory.
Carson has roomed with Johnny O’Connor for four years at Notre Dame. O’Connor, it will be remembered is quite a politician, and the affliction must be contagious. For it is rumored on good authority that Carson is the guiding hand, the power behind the throne of no less organization than the Indianapolis club.
Last spring, despite a painful shoulder injury which crippled him early in the season, Carson won his monogi-am at first base on Jake Kline’s varsity baseball team. He’ll be back there this year, and Mr. Kline will indeed be able to find use for him.
Jim is enrolled in the school of Commerce. His major is business administration, and we’ve heard that he has a job with the telephone company awaiting him when he graduates.
Thus taking leave of Mr. Carson, and his hoops and his hickory, we wish him luck in his athletic endeavors. And this is not a tongue-in-cheek remark. For considering Mr. Carson in an allegorical sense as representative of the Keogamnen, it will be easily seen that the favor of Fortune is going to be very necessary. Should these gentlemen happen to meet on a dark night, something which plays like a Badger.
IRISH TAKE EASTERN POST-VACATION TRIP
By Clarence T. Sheehan
Coach George Keogan and his national collegiate basketball champions will give the followers of the Eastern cage sport a taste of mid-Western basketball during the early part of January. On Saturday, Jan. 8, they will encounter the University of Pennsylvania quintet, Eastern Intercollegiate Athletic Association champions. The Griffins, of Canisius, will be then* hosts in Buffalo on Monday, Jan. 10. Although neither of these teams can boast of a victory over the Irish they have always offered them the stiffest brand of competition.
As in former years, the Quakers, are one of the East’s ranking teams and are favored to repeat their feats of ’34, ’35, and ’37 and annex another E.I.A.A. banner. When the Irish invaded the “City of Brotherly Love” last season the Pennsy lads were riding high on the crest of a ten-game winning streak, but the Keoganmen, who had just halted the victory march of Syracuse, showed the same contempt for this string of victories. As a result the Quakers were dropped from that select list of undefeated teams. The invaders were hard pressed throughout the battle but the scoring prowess of Moir and Nowak was too much for the U. of P. boys who ended up on the short side of a 41-36 score. Notre Dame must be a her full strength for this fray or the result may be unpleasant to her adherents.
The following Monday the Irish will stop over at Buffalo long enough to do battle with the surprisingly powerful Canisius quintet. Last year’s contest, which marked the first meeting between the two institutions, was nip and tuck until the finish. With but a minute to play the visitors were leading 37-36. When Johnny Moir, who was playing before a delegation of loyal fans from Niagara Falls, his home town, was fouled while trying to sink a short shot. The attempt was good, however, and he tossed in the free throw to give Notre Dame a total of 40 points and himself 21 markers for the evening.
At the outset of the current campaign Coach Allie Seelbach, of the Griffins, was rather pessimistic because Captain John Cavanaugh and Joe Dudzick were the only lettermen on the entire squad. Three sophomores, Marganello, Chapple, and See-berg, teamed up so well with this pair that they overwhelmed a highly touted Western Ontario aggergation, 47-26, in the season’s curtain raiser.

Brushing Up
Adolph Amiably Administers Appetites As Avid Adherents Admire Athletes
By Ed Brennan
Of all the bi'others famous in Notre Dame athletics, the three Bergman’s, Albert, Arthur, and Joseph, have won more monograms than any others. During then* years at Notre Dame this trio gathered 18 major letters. Albert, eldest of the three, won more major letters than any one man in the history of the school. In four years he collected three in football, two in baseball, four in track, and two in basketball, for a total of eleven. Arthur Bergman, now head football coach at Catholic University, won three in football and one in track, while Joseph, the last of the three, made two in football and one in baseball. . . .
Next to the Bergman’s are the five monogram winning Crowe brothers. Clem is first among this quintet with six; Francis, Norb, and Leo had three each; and Mike, now in his third year of varsity basketball, has one.
Coach George E. Keogan, now in his fifteenth year at Notre Dame, is a graduate of the University of Minnesota. He gave up dentistry for coaching.
Fourteen years at Notre Dame have seen him win 232 games, lose 68, and tie one, the tie having occurred during the 1935-36 season through a scorekeeper’s error which left the Irish deadlocked with Northwestern at 20-all. Keogan’s percentage as mentor for the Irish is .773.
He came to Notre Dame as baseball coach, basketball coach, and assistant football coach through his friendship with the late Knute Rockne. Keogan’s Valparaiso football team held the Irish to a 28 to 3 victory in 1920, when George Gipp was leading Notre Dame to an undefeated season. . . .
When he assumed the role as coach of Irish quintets in 1923, Notre Dame had won 32 games and lost 64 during the previous six seasons. He immediately put the Irish on a winning basis, taking 15 out of 23 games his first season and 11 out of 21 his second year, his worst at Notre Dame. The Irish have never had a losing season under Keogan. . . .
His 1931-32 team was among the greatest he has ever coached. The team broke even in its first four games, then won the last 16 in a row, for a season’s record of 18 out of 20. His 1933-34 team, two years later, won 20 out of 24 games. . . .
The 1936-37 team won 20 games and lost 3. This team, badly crippled at the start of the season and minus reserved strength, lost to Illinois and Northwestern, defeating both in return games.

Everybody knows “Joe, the Good Egg.” His name is legion. Then, too, we all know “Freddie, the Freshman;” the “All-American Girl!” “Betty Co-ed;” “Sweet Varsity Sue;” and the “Goldenrod of Notre Dame.”

lina and Arthur Murray to popularize the “Big Red Apple,” food delicacy at Notre Dame basketball games.
Adolf, you see, is Mr. Adolf De-Clercq, personal representative of the Messrs. Meyer and Wukovits who operate the refreshment concession at the Notre Dame field house. Adolf has been representing a pair of Notre Dame monogram men for twenty-three years. For more than a score of years Adolf has been throwing strikes at apple munchers and peanut crunchers for five-cents a strike.
About forty-eight years ago, Adolf was bom in the town of Ghent, Belgium. Ghent, therefore, has become famous for two reasons: it was on the receiving end of the poetic gem, “From Aix to Ghent;” and it was the birthplace of a peanut and apple pitcher.
Adolf calls his country land by the classical name of “Belgie.” “I was a candy maker there,” he recounts to his interrogator, “and when I came here I became a machinist with the O’Brien Lathe Works in South Bend.”
With cheeks as rosy as his trade in stock, Adolf worms his way among the Fighting Irish, “Here they are, boys, ‘Ahh-pulls.” His ever-gracious disposition is a better tag line for his sales talk than any finish-line that a George M. Cohan might write. Adolf
dispensed “Ahh-pulls” at old Cartier Field when the stand lacked a back drop, and he had to be good to hit the target, his customer. He had to be just as efficient in catching the return throw of a nickel. Today he works with the smiling assurance of a Hart-n e 11 catching Hubbell. Constant smiles and a little “old-world” politeness make the nickels jingle flowingly into Adolf’s ever-handy pocket. He never omits his merry “Tankyou” as he goes among the crowd.
He attributes his rare success to nothing more than the ancient golden-rule psychology. “Be good to the boys and they will be good to you. I can leave my basket at any time, depend on the boys to help themselves, and always come back to find a nickel for each ‘ahh-pull’ that has disappeared.”
Adolf used to carry a spare towel over his shoulder with which he added a luster to his wares. This is no longer necessary, for now the “ahh-pulls” go much faster than formerly. During an ordinary basketball game Adolf sells about five hundred apples. Friday night games, for obvious reasons, sell more apples than are sold on other game-nights. Peanuts are less in demand on Friday night for the same obvious reason.
The big “ahh-pull” man likes to watch Pitt and Northwestern play in preference to any other team on Irish schedule. These two clubs usually play to a full house and Adolf finds that he sells as many as seven or eight hundred apples when the Golden Panthers or Purple Wildcats come to the field house.
Prior to Notre Dame’s home finale with Minnesota last year, Adolf called Paul Nowak and Ray Meyers to the edge of the floor and whispered: “Call plenty of time-outs tonight, boys, it’ll keep the customers here longer.”
“You bet,” replied Nowak with his boylike grin, “Ray and I have three apiece and we’ll talk to the rest of the boys.” Adolf was dumbfounded when the boys double-crossed him by taking only three time-outs in the forty minutes.
Adolf has been using an underhand toss akin to the submarine pitches of a Carl Mays, but he promises to get his fast ball right down the groove for the Northwestern and Pitt games. Jake Kline, varsity baseball coach, has Al Kovzelove, varsity catcher, warming up already and Al will be in readiness to catch Adolf’s fire ball next week.

SPLINTERS FROM THE PRESS BOX 1 _____________________________________________________________________'
By John F. Clifford
YULETIDE
New Year’s Eve, 1935, was indeed a memorable night in the precarious but exciting life of a Notre Dame manager. It was on that ne’er-to-be-forgotten evening that the Northwestern-Notre Dame game ended in a 20-20 tie, because of a mistaken count in the free throws by the Irish managers. Since that time managers have been haunted by the ghost of “Twenty-Twenty,” hoping against hope that theirs would not be the fate to have a game end in a deadlock. In the spirit of New Year’s good cheer and the Wisconsin squeak on Monday, we offer this little ditty memorializing that incident. (Our humblest apologies to Clement Clarke Moore)
’Twas the night before New Year’s and all through the stands The icild fans were cheering, while George wrung his hands. The scorer was counting to twenty with care
In hopes that Gillespie’s count would not be there.
He sat at the table and shivered in dread,
While visions of free throws danced in his head.
“Is that clock running right; have I missed any baskets?
It happened before and the coach blew his gaskets.
“On Moir! On Noivak! On Brownie and Meyer!
The score’s getting close—you’d best make it higher.
One more tie score in these Northwestern games
And this manager’s heart will be fed to the flames.”
Along the hardwood there came such a clatter
That he jumped to his feet to see what teas the matter.
The final pop of the gun cut through the night,
“Happy Neiv Year for me—the score came out right'.” FLUKE
The following juicy squib, appearing in “The Saunterer’s” column in the November 26 issue of The Evanston Review, came to our attention during the past week: “. . . When we remember the extremely narrow squeak by which Notre Dame squeezed into the win column and the two or three squeaks by which the Wildcats were crowded out of it, we realize there wasn’t much gloating material skidding around that icy gridiron. Such as it was could be detected only by a Notre Dame, cheerleader or press agent. We got a snicker out of seeing the able Arch Ward . . . step out of character in his enthusiasm for even a flukey Irish victory.” (Italics ours)
When one stops to consider in unbiased retrospect the facts of the Irish-Wildcat game, one finds it difficult to arrive at the “flukey” conclusions of the “Saunterer.” Notre Dame outplayed the Wildcats, whose claws found no hold in the “icy gridiron,” for three quarters, outgained them in total yards net 239-182, and in the final tabulations outfought them 7-0. The closest Northwestern approached the Notre Dame goal was in the first quarter when Eby caught a pass and then fumbled the ball into the arms of alert Chuck Sweeney.
Arch Ward—and Notre Dame, for that matter—does not gloat over the victory, realizing that no fewer than five scoring chances of the Irish netted only seven points for the afternoon’s work. We detected but one fluke all afternoon—the score should have been twenty points higher.
THAT MAN AGAIN
You just can’t keep these Irish down. The indomitable Charles Alexander Sweeney, already the recipient of no fewer than thirteen All-American nominations from Kate Smith to Ted Husing, is headed for another national honor during the holidays. Selected by Dick Hanley to play with the East’s representatives in the annual East-West game in San Francisco on New Year’s Day, Chuch will leave for Chicago tomorrow to join the members of the Eastern team and entrain for the Coast.
p. Coaches Andy Kerr of Colgate and Bernie Bierman of Minnesota have assembled all the power and deception in the East and Midwest, including Wojciechowicz of Fordham, Souchak and Matisi of Pitt, Bershak of North Carolina, Corbie Davis of Indiana, Kovatch and Heap of Northwestern, and Zarnas of Ohio State. With Chuck in there at end, raising havoc in characteristic Sweeney style, things look good for another East-Irish win. Members of the squad will air their views on the game over WGN tomorrow night at 8:15.
CAGERS SQUEAK OUT WIN OVER BADGERS
•
Notre Dame and Wisconsin last Monday played the most exciting game seen in the Notre Dame fieldhouse in three years, with the Irish flying helter-skelter into a 33-31 victory. The last-season 25-24 win over Butler in the home gymnasium was one point closer in score, but not at all comparable with this game in suspense and wildness.
The Badgers plainly showed what a fair team full of fight could do to an almost great team with “senior-itis” — casual fluency of play that comes with experience, and lack of aggression that comes with winning too many games in a row. A batted-in rebound by Sadowski and a long, clean set-shot by Nowak were directly responsible for the home team victory, but the red men from Madison assisted by missing six out of nine foul shots. Notre Dame sank seven out of 11, Mike Crowe missing one intentionally a minute and a half from the finish. Wisconsin scored 14 goals from the field to Notre Dame’s 13.
For 35 minutes the Irish were stodgy and unimpressive, while the men in cardinal played hard, aggressive ball, scored amazingly on any number of crazy, leaping two-handed shots, recovered all rebounds, and suddenly had a three-point lead with four minutes to play. The whole Notre Dame team was unsettled and hard-pressed. Gene Klier, Earl Brown and even the nonchalant Nowak were so taut they completely missed the backboard on three consecutive setshots, and the “National Champions” were on the verge of blowing apart.
Coach Keogan substituted Mike Crowe, smallest man on the squad, for Johnny Moir, with the score 31-27. Moir, always erratic on defense, was playing too deeply and conservatively when the situation called for close following of the ball at all times. Little Mike proceeded to rag the Badger guards steadily, popped in a long shot for 29-31, then ■with 90 seconds to go drew a foul from Left Guard Mitchell. “Miss it!” was the cry, so he bounced it high off the backboard toward Nowak. Nowak tipped it off Wisconsin fingers back down the middle of the floor where Earl Brown recovered and started the Irish shuttle-offense working. A scramble under the basket— Sadowski’s hand tapped in a rebound, tying the score. Retaliating Badger shots bounced all over the rim of the Notre Dame basket in a frantic flurry, then the white shirts moved downcourt, passed to Nowak at a deep angle, and Long Paul threw it high and in.

Years ago at St. Anne, ’Toinette, I saw a statue of Notre Dame. I have always wanted to copy it. See! Here are the feet, the mantle, the hands— with a tiny hole where you can place violets when spring comes . . . but the face, ’Toinette—the face on that statue was very beautiful, and I cannot remember it ... a model, perhaps? . . . ’’Toinette step over there into the sunlight . . . stand sideways ... a little more . . . there . . . and ’Toinette, say the little prayer that mother taught you. ...”
The snow still held off. The statue was finished Christmas eve, and that

evening the father placed Notre Dame on a small rock altar in the pine grove behind the cabin. Then ’Toinette ran inside to tell the mother. The last sunlight deepened the red and blue tints of the mantle and softened a golden halo about the calm face.
“Notre Dame is very beautiful,” said the mother, and she looked at ’Toinette.
When darkness came up reluctantly from the valley the mother gathered up the lilies and placed them in a bowl. ’Toinette’s rose was a red heart in the center. In the darkness the rose bled in the darting white light which lapped at the feet of Notre Dame.
The wind came that night, and
with it snow which lanced in from the north. By morning, while billows lay becalmed against the cabin sides; the wind died, then; but white silt still sifted down. '
The three went together to the pine grove. The lilies were gone, the basket blown away. Notre Dame lay toppled over in the snow, and when the father knelt to pick her up a tiny red rose fell from her hands. . ..

Race-God-myth as a concept of Deity; (2) the National Socialist concept of justice as defined in the sentence ‘Right is that which is useful to the nation’; (3) the misuse of sacred terms for National Socialist purposes; and (4) a National-Racial ‘religion.’ ”
Dr. Gurian observes an interesting point about Hitler, which seems to account for the Fuhrer’s circumvented attacks on the Church: “. . . the Fuhrer is a born Catholic who knows the Catholic mentality, and as such has no desire to repeat Bismarck’s psychological error of the Kulturkampf. He knows that frontal attacks, such as the arrest of bishops and interference with religious services, can only help the Church. For this reason he uses indirect methods.”
“The fate of the Concordat,” says the author in his conclusion, “the first important agreement made by Hitler, which was intended to prove him a reliable partner and one capable of observing a contract, is an object lesson in the methods of National Socialist policy. By that method National Socialism claims the right to regard agreements as binding on the other party, but not on itself, except insofar as to do so serves its purposes at the moment. The conflict between the Church and National Socialism arises from the latter’s claim to control every phase of life. Religion and morals must become instruments of National Socialist policy.”
Because the president of Georgetown, Kentucky, has been baptized only once, he is in danger of losing his job. A conservative element of the Baptist council which controls the college contends that one immersion may be sufficient for a layman, but that a minister should be baptized at least twice.

WISCONSIN GAME (Continued from Page 18)
The calm, worryless Irish seniors seemed to have attended but carelessly to the defensive drills they were put through against Wisconsin set plays, run off by the freshmen. Coach Keogan emphasized especially fastbreaking plays down the center in which the Badger guards cut past their center in the bucket, who blocks off the defender allowing the guard a straight dribble-in and layup. A shifting defense was arranged to stop them, but Mitchell and Frey kept working past the bucket all evening, breaking under the basket or passing across to Rooney or Powell, who leaped up and shot.
Wisconsin was definitely not a smooth team, but a rough, “hot” team, which wore off whatever polish Notre Dame had. It passed often wildly, used rigid set-plays which had to be carried through in spite of changes in defense — which should have been easily broken up by a cool, alert team — blew two-thirds of its free throws, and still missed the greatest basketball upset of the early season by only two points. Encouragingly the Irish at the last possible second were really able to rouse themselves, and by good sense and suddenly restored long-range accuracy beat off an always-pressing opponent.
No other Christmas present for S5 equals this value! Four genuine Yello-Boles, al) different—a “pipe collection" in itself, each with a special smoking feature and distinctive satisfaction I All cured with honey! $5.

(Continued from Page 7) movies; second show all the time— I’m not classed as a freshman these days, you know, and Father Molter’s known for his ability to spot us upperclassmen; I just can’t seem to keep out of his way.
“You know — through the years I’ve seen practically everyone here at Washington Hall. Yes, indeed; there were Carideo and Rockne, Layden and Crowley, Eggeman and Gipp, Brill and Metzger — they were the boys! Corduroys, sweatshirts, and hob-nail shoes; an afternoon on Cartier instead of an afternoon at Wal-green’s!”
All at once our conversation was interrupted by a low rumble, growing louder, louder, louder—like the charge of a thousand thirst-mad grey elephants. Shrieks of cowboys, growls of bears!
“Well, so long,” said my friend, the Ghost. “The gang is coming now! Better sit where you are; you’ll never get out now.”
“Oh, yeah! I guess I can beat them to the door.”
But then—in they burst! Black hair, blue hats, red hats; glasses on red faces; puffy breaths and staggering gasps; green coats, brown shirts, black sweaters. The swarm rolled and tumbled down the aisles. They were on me. I couldn’t move. The Ghost, as usual, was right;

Yt’s simple arithmetic that the more cars General Motors sells the greater this organization grows. And the solid fact back of that growth is this: General Motors cars must continually offer more in terms of extra value to win those sales. It is only because General Motors is great that it can maintain the research and improvement program responsible for such modern betterments as the Turret Top, the Unisteel Body, No Draft Ventilation, Knee-Action and advanced Hydraulic Brakes.

dance music may not be more objectionable than the reading of Collier’s ’ and the like; but to thrive on that class of literature or music is neglecting the higher intellectual education which is the primary purpose of Notre Dame. When assurances of the desire for better music on the campus are evident, the doors of Music Hall will be wide open at all convenient and appropriate hours for the lovers of music who desire to use them.”

Dudzick, six-foot-ten inch center, will play opposite the comparatively diminutive Nowak. Coach Seelbach is very enthusiastic over his giant center whom he claims is worth at least 20 points a game, 10 on offense and 10 on defense. Marganello and See-berg will try to run up the Griffin score from their forward posts.

football season finds Adolf lending assistance at the main gate of the stadium where he checks receipts and crowd totals. Almost any athletic event in South Bend attracts Adolf and his basket, making him a part of the entertainment. His machinist trade with the lathe company provides consistent livelihood, but he likes to mingle with the sports mob on game nights.
With his many activities arousing curiosity, the reporter was led to inquire, “What do you do in your spare time, Adolf?”
He was not stumped even momentarily as he replied, “Oh, I have the basketball boys drop down to home for an evening of fun. And the next time, Ray, Paul, and Johnny (this time, Moir) come down, I want you to be along.”
Many lasting friends has Adolf among the old and present monogram men, but he best remembers George Ireland, sturdy defensive player of two years ago. “I even predicted that George would marry the sister of one of his teammates,” he added as we parted.
