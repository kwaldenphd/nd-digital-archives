NOVEMBER 26. 1963 SCHOLASTIC EXTRA

Illi HII

At the news of John F. Kennedy's tragic death last Friday, the staff of The Scholastic decided to publish this extra edition in his honor, stressing the particular aspects of his life that related to Notre Dame. He is the only man to have received all of the three highest awards that Notre Dame bestows: the Laetare Medal, an honorary doctorate, and the Patriot of the Year award of the senior class. He was also a member of the Advisory Council for the College of Liberal and Fine Arts.
We dedicate this issue to his memory.

The Road
By Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C.
Notre Dame, like other famous universities, is one of the cross roads of the world. Many of the great men of this world, among them President John F. Kennedy, have passed this way and have become members of the Notre Dame family. As a fledgling Congressman, only 33 years old, John Kennedy came here to deliver the Commencement Address and to receive an honorary degree in 1950. As a Senator, a few years later he returned to receive the Patriotism Award from the Senior Class. He also became a charter member of our Advisory Council for the College of Arts and Letters. Just two years ago, on the same fateful date of November 22, he accepted at the White House, Notre Dame’s highest award, the Laetare Medal.
The words of that last citation spell out the promise of his young life, as the first Catholic to hold the highest post in our land:
“You have our admiring realization that your words, embodied in your deeds as Chief Executive, carry the candor and the urgency of the ablest contemporary thinkers in the Church, men whose thought, like yours, is crystallized in this expression: ‘Do everything that is to be done with respect for truth, and do it in freedom of spirit, in spite of the obstacles within and without, and in the teeth of selfishness, sloth, cowardice, popular opinion. And do it with confidence! When one so acts Tie paves a road which, followed with sincerity and courage, leads far into the realm where the great things of time are decided.”
And now he is dead, cut down in mid-stride along the road. There is no answer, outside the inscrutable Providence of God, to the question on everyone’s Ups: Why? But there is an understanding that can mean much more to each of us than a clear-cut answer. In this very real world of shining good and blackest evil, everyone who works for what is good and noble can expect to unleash against himself, all of the dark irrational power of evil — anger, hatred, and violence. John Kennedy, in a very reed sense, was a martyr to these evil forces because he stood without compromise for their opposite realities, peaceful understanding and constructive human fellowship, here and abroad. The evil does not now disappear with the evil deed; it is only starkly and cruelly visible in his tragic death. The road too is still there, still leading to' the realm where the truly great tilings of time are yet to be decided, a road still beckoning to each of us, a road yet to be walked with sincerity and courage.
If John Kennedy’s death has any message for America and all the world, it is this: Get on the road, because the hour is late. Tom Dooley’s message, borrowed from Robert Frost, was no less urgent:
The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep
And miles to go before I sleep.
They both sleep now. One can speak of memorials and medals for them, but what greater memorial can Americans, young and old, construct for their heroes than to take up the torch of light that slips from their
mortal hands, and to continue the immortal work to which their lives, all too brief, were dedicated?
Too few travel this high road today because few men indeed live lives characterized by commitment and dedication. If this community of Notre Dame men is touched today by the tragic event, let us see it for what it is and be convinced that there is room for all of us on this road that require high commitment and deep dedication if the great things of time are to be triumphs of good, not evil travesties.
Human rights and human dignity require new champions today and tomorrow. These causes have lost a great champion. Are there new champions in our midst? The Alliance for Progress, the Peace Corps, world-wide and for developing nations require new human talent, rare conviction and personal dedication to become realities. Are we willing to get on the road, or at least prepare well for the day when the road will be ready for us?
Every trip along this road is dangerous, because it is the high road. Tragedy lurks at every turn; the moment of truth appears each hour of the journey. The truest tragedy is not that some like John Kennedy fall victim along the way, but that so many others lack both the commitment and the dedication to get started. Those who fall along the way do indeed become great beacons of light for all who follow them. May this sad day be not one of darkness, no triumph for the powers of evil, but the birth of a great new light that will for years to come inspire others to great deeds, come what may.

"For without belittling the courage with- which, men have died, ive should not forget those acts of courage with which men . . . have lived. The courage of life is often a less dramatic spectacle than the courage of the final moment; but it is no less a magnificent mixture of triumph and
tragedy.”

These closing words of John Kennedy’s “Profiles in Courage” serve as a warning against any disproportionately dramatic consideration of his death. One can produce a valid portrait of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, not in terms of a few violent moments on the streets of Dallas, the assassination of a Chief Executive, but only in light of a forty-year span of struggle and achievement. A man of the late President’s vitality would ask no more than to be judged as one who lived to the full extent of his capabilities.
A short life by modern standards,
public figures. His father, Joseph P. Kennedy, served as Ambassador to Great Britain and as Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. His maternal grandfather, John F. Fitzgerald, was elected Mayor of Boston and also was appointed to a short term in the U.S. Senate. On his father’s side, Grandfather Patrick J. Kennedy represented East Boston in the Massachusetts Assembly and State Senate.
The future President attended elementary schools in his home state and later entered Harvard University. This institution graduated him cum laude in 1940, whereupon the young man decided to join the war effort. After several months of work to build up his injured back, John finally passed the Navy physical and received his commission as a PT boat commander. While carrying out a mission in the Solomons, his boat was cut in half by an attacking Japanese destroyer. Kennedy, seriously
injured, towed disabled members of his crew to a nearby island and led them back to friendly territory after nine days behind enemy lines. His efforts merited him the Navy and Marine Corps medal, and after treatment of his injuries the young lieutenant was discharged for physical disability in March of 1945.
Back in civilian life, the late President worked for a while as a newspaperman. He covered the San Francisco Conference for Chicago’s Herald
than reporting it, John Kennedy ran successfully for a seat in the House of Representatives in 1946. The National Junior Chamber of Commerce noted that the new Congressman was one of the “most outstanding young men in America.” In a year of Republican successes, Kennedy had been elected on a platform of “allied cooperation to hold world leadership for the democratic nations of the world.” He also stood for a defense policy, one year after the conclusion of peace, that included armaments development and a strong standing army. On the home front, the Congressman “followed the dictates of his conscience ... as against sectional political pressures,” making enemies in New England while impressing the Midwest with his support of the St. Lawrence Seaway project.
Supported by an amazing growth in popularity, John Kennedy was elected to the Senate in 1952. This was a double miracle as 1952 saw General Eisenhower sweep the nation’s electoral and popular votes; also, the man defeated by Kennedy was none other than the respected Henry Cabot Lodge. Additionally surprising was the margin of victory — 70,000 votes.
The late President’s years in the Senate produced impressive results. His unsuccessful battle for adequate unemployment compensation benefits, and a successful fight against illegal

lobbying prompted the St. Louis Post Dispatch to label him “a vigorous friend to the less fortunate.” Also on his Senate record were a large number of other “firsts.” He proposed a bill raising the minimum wage to one dollar per hour; it was later passed. He also brought up debate on closer relations with France in Indo-China, leading to independence for the peoples of this area. In his approach to economic problems, such as the St. Lawrence Seaway, John Kennedy said: “Of course we should not ignore the needs of our area — nor could we easily as products of that area — but none could be found to look out for the national interest if local interests wholly dominated the role of each of us.”
At the 1956 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Mr. Kennedy showed further popularity and political potential when he was nominated for the vice-presidential candidacy. He lost the nomination by 2CP/2 votes to Estes Kefauver.
Then, in 1958, the Senator from Massachusetts again ran for his Senate seat. This time his majority was overwhelming — 870,000 votes. He was the first candidate in the history of Massachusetts to carry every city and county in the state.
Mr. Kennedy was author of two books: Why England Slept, published in 1940, and Profiles In Courage, published in 1956. The first is an explanation of England’s lack of preparation for World War H. The second, a Pulitzer Prize winner, demonstrates the pressures encountered by Senators who speak out for their beliefs.
On September 12, 1953, the Senator married Miss Jacqueline Lee Bouvier. Jackie, as the whole world was later to call her, studied at Vassar and George Washington and had worked for a time at the Washington, D.C., Times Herald. Their two children, Caroline and John, Jr., are aged six and three.
The deep and fierce pride of an Irish immigrant family gave birth to the Presidency of JFK: nurtured in its early stages by his multimillionaire father, it was brought to fruition through the distinguished career of Kennedy himself on a tortuous and twisting campaign road.
The campaign for the Presidency began during the 1956 Democratic convention and continued headlong, vigorously, tenaciously until the election in which he achieved his goal. The years from 1956-1960 show a Senator striving to achieve nationwide support to accomplish a goal on the basis of Congressional success.
“We should not be too hasty in con
demning all compromise as bad morals. For politics and legislation are not matter for inflexible principles or unattainable ideals. It is compromise that presents each set of reformers — the wets and the drys, the one-worlders and the isolationists, the vivisectionists and the anti-vivisectionists — from crushing the group on the extreme opposite end of the political spectrum.” These Senate years, the extensive nationwide tours, were directed to one goal — the election of the first Catholic, the youngest elected President, against an opposing party that could campaign on a record of eight years of “peace and prosperity.”
The campaign began to heat up when, on January 2, 1960, the Senator announced his candidacy for the 1960 Democratic nomination. Senators Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey of Wisconsin were the two leading contenders for the nomination, but Kennedy, campaigning furiously, swept the board in all the primaries he entered, including Humphrey’s own back yard, Wisconsin. Nominated
on the first ballot of the convention, he added Lyndon Baines Johnson of Texas as his running mate to unite the party’s liberal and conservative factions.
The ensuing struggle for the election to the Presidency was expensive, vigorous, and historic. Featuring Kennedy-Nixon TV debates, the religious issue, and accusations of identical platform programs, the two candidates fought one another for the nation’s highest office. In regard to his position then, he had said, “We shall need compromises in the days ahead, to be sure. But these will be, or should be, compromises of issues, not of principles. We can compromise our political positions, but not ourselves. We can resolve the clash of interests
without conceding our ideals.”
John Fitzgerald Kennedy won the election, but just barely. His move to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue was accomplished by a bare 100,000-vote margin in an election that featured the largest voting turnout in history. Only a few hours before the close win was assured, the family patriarch, Joseph P. Kennedy, confidently voiced his satisfaction that one of his four sons had made it “to the top.”
The picture of the campaigning Kennedy is sometimes thought of as less “humane” and more political (in the ugly sense of the word) than the Kennedy of the early Congressional years. But, to explain this apparent change we can go back to Profiles In Courage where he stated, “. . . years in Congress have taught me the wisdom of Lincoln’s words: There are few things wholly evil or wholly good. Almost everything, especially government policy, is an inseparable compound of the two, so that our best judgment of the preponderance between them is continually demanded.” And he believed, in
his own system of values, that it was important for him to be President. He carried into the Presidency the attitude that the compromise of ideas was necessary to accomplish practical ideals. “Sure it’s a big job,” Mr. Kennedy once said, “but I don’t know anybody who can do it any better than I can. I’m going to be in it for four years. It isn’t going to be so bad. You’ve got time to think — and besides, the pay is good.”
Later he realized and admitted that he had grossly underestimated his task. But it is extremely doubtful that he ever swerved from his belief that he was the best man for the job. An admission qualifying, compromising, or refuting this idea would have been a negation of his whole life.

JOHN F. KENNEDY: THE PRESIDENT
By Frank Smith
6 4 t do not shrink from this responsibility — I welcome it.” With these words, John Fitzgerald Kennedy began his term of office as the 35th President of the United States and thus took upon himself the leadership both- of this country and of the whole Western World.
Kennedy’s rise to prominence was a political phenomenon. In 1956, the senator from Massachusetts first appeared in the national public eye as a candidate for the Democratic vice-presidential nomination. From that time on, the young World War n hero launched a drive that was to make him the youngest man and the first Roman Catholic ever elected President. To many, Kennedy was a symbol of a new generation of American political leaders—youthful, hard-driving, and factually and statistically oriented. Kennedy himself touched upon this idea in his inaugural address. “Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans — born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace and proud of our ancient heritage.” In this same inaugural address, the new President described a spirit of self-sacrifice which both he and the American people would be required to adopt to insure the spread of the principles of liberty throughout the world.
Kennedy entered office on a towering pillar of popularity. He, his attractive wife and their two small children captured the imagination of the nation. Slowly his policies evolved into concrete legislative proposals. The New Frontier was here, and even undisputed personal popularity was not able to protect Kennedy from the
sharp lash of criticism that accompanied some of the efforts of his administration. In the first few months of this administration the President sent wide-sweeping legislation to Congress concerning care for the aged, federal aid to education, a farm program and minimum wages, only to see his proposals experience severe defeats or secure narrow victories. The President’s harsh education in executive political reality had begun. But yet these early months did produce proposals which excited widespread public support. The Peace Corps was established. The Alliance for Progress was announced and the first steps were taken in the field of civil rights with an enforcement of equal rights to employment in federally contracted jobs. Kennedy began building up his prestige with our allies by impressing Prime Minister Macmillan at their first meeting late in March of 1961. But disaster lay just around the corner.
Early on the morning of April 17, anti-Castro rebels landed on the swampy beaches of Cuba’s Bay of Pigs. The ensuing fiasco is only too well-known. The United States emerged from the affair looking like a ravenous bear trying to devour a helpless little 90-mile-long island. Anti-U.S. demonstrations were touched off throughout Europe and Latin America. Kennedy, as Eisenhower before him in the U-2 incident, was forced to accept full responsibility before the whole world. Already the youthful President had reached the low-water mark of his administration.	-
Nevertheless, Kennedy continued to build his prestige abroad with a state visit in the spring of 1961. He convinced the elder statesmen de Gaulle
and Khrushchev that he was a man who was determined to provide effective leadership for the West. In other words, Kennedy succeeded in presenting himself to the world as a man to be reckoned with.
This image proved to be extremely valuable in the politically hot summer of 1961. For it was at this time that the Berlin crisis reached its height in moves calculated by Khrushchev to test this new American President. The USSR ordered a military buildup in Berlin and Khrushchev demanded that the Western Allies get out of Berlin or he would sign a separate peace treaty with East Germany. Replying a few days later, Kennedy declared that the Soviet ultimatum was completely unacceptable and that the West would defend its position by force if necessary. The various political maneuvers continued throughout the summer and were only culminated by the building of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 19, 1961. Thus Khrushchev emerged the winner of round one.
The first year was drawing to a close. It was a year of training for Kennedy. It was a year in which the President learned the political realities and pressures of holding the nation’s chief office. It was a year in which he suffered more setbacks than j victories but, above all, it was a year which forged Kennedy into a President who was now so tempered j as to face the years ahead with experience and confidence.
The year 1962 proved to be the most significant of Kennedy’s tenure of office. During this year, the man’s courage and determination were put to test. Three times during this year Kennedy exerted powers of his office

seldom seen in peacetime, and all three times he made his antagonists change their course of action.
In April, the steel industry, under the leadership of U.S. Steel, enacted a price increase averaging $6 a ton. The President responded quickly and decisively. Calling the price increase “a wholly unjustifiable and irresponsible defiance of public interest,” the angered President initiated antitrust proceedings and threatened to boycott the Big Steel companies. The President viewed the situation as involving “a tiny handful of steel executives whose pursuit of private power and profit exceeds their sense of public responsibility.” Thus, by bringing all his powers into the fight and by massing widespread favorable public opinion behind him, Kennedy succeeded in forcing the industry to retract the increase. Although there were many who criticized his actions, the President was now recognized as a man who would back his convictions with every means at his ability.
This new image of a powerful President was again tested in September of 1962 by another segment of the American population—the Southern white segregationists. On September 30, a young Negro, James Meredith, attempted to further the cause of civil rights by entering the University of Mississippi. The consequence of this entrance was to make the serene campus of that university the battleground on which the forces of segregation and integration clashed. Governor Ross Barnett challenged Kennedy to use his office as President as a means for furthering integra-tionist causes and to fulfill his executive capacity in enforcing the law as interpreted by the Supreme Court in 1954. Barnett hoped the President would back down in the face of violence and the very distinct possibility of losing many valuable Southern votes. But once again the President acted courageously and decisively. Saying that “Americans are free to disagree with the law, but not to disobey it,” he instructed the Federal marshals to avoid violence but above all to insure the entrance of Meredith. He asked the students of Old Miss “to preserve both the law and the peace, so we may stand united as one people in our pledge to man’s freedom.” The result? By virtue of the President’s determination, James Meredith entered the University and an impressive advance was made toward guaranteeing equal rights for all American citizens.
These extremely important domestic issues merely served as a prelude to the drama which was to be en
acted on the world stage in October. On the twenty-third of that month, a major confrontation of Soviet and American power took place over the Cuban issue. Mr. Kennedy addressed a television audience estimated to be over 50 million people the evening before. At this time he informed the American people that the Soviet
Union had begun a missile buildup in Cuba which could have for its only purpose “to provide a nuclear strike capability against the Western hemisphere.” Kennedy declared that the United States would not permit such a threat to U.S. security, and that this country demanded an immediate dismantling of the Soviet bases. To enforce his words, the President called for an immediate blockade of Cuba. The courage and the decisiveness that Kennedy had shown in domestic issues was now thrust forward for the world to see. Khrushchev, obviously taken aback by the President’s bold course, proceeded to quickly dismantle his bases and to withdraw his missiles. These events marked the high-water mark of the Kennedy administration. By talking softly but carrying the big-stick of nuclear retaliation, by ordering a blockade but not sinking ships, he had forced the Soviet Union to withdraw the missiles it had placed in Cuba and thereby secured one of the greatest Western triumphs of the cold war.
Kennedy carried his strong prestige into the year 1963. Early in that summer the President made a European trip to demonstrate that the
United States was ready to back its allies. The reception he received all over Europe was astounding. Millions of Europeans turned out to give their sincere and enthusiastic tribute to the President of the United States and to acknowledge his leadership of the Western World. This was no longer a man who had to sheep
ishly admit a major blunder in attacking a small Caribbean Island but rather a man who stood as a symbol of freedom the world over.
It was also in the summer of 1963 that Kennedy took what he considered to be a major step in easing cold war tensions. After many years of negotiating, the nuclear test ban treaty was signed in Moscow. The President considered the pact “not as a victory for either side but as a victory for the people of the world.”
Meanwhile, on the home front, Kennedy continued to display his determination to destroy the image that the Negro is a second-rate citizen. This summer saw what was called the revolution of the American Negro. Kennedy, by means of legislation and, when necessary, by force, lent the backing of his office to the drive for equality.
Thus, after a somewhat shaky start, Kennedy gradually evolved as a refreshingly dynamic president. No matter what one’s political philosophies may be, it is impossible to deny that this man gave to his office an aroma of courage, dignity and decisiveness. This was John F. Kennedy the President.

JOHN F. KENNEDY' AND NOTRE DAME
By Jack Pope
The late president's associations with the University of Notre Dame extend back to the January graduation exercises of 1950. The graduation Mass was celebrated Sunday morning, January 29, by the Reverend Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., then Executive Vice-President of the University. At the commencement exercises that afternoon, Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree and then delivered the commencement address.
Four years later, when the Notre Dame Lay Advisory Council for the College of Liberal and Fine Arts was formed, Senator Kennedy became a
Edgar Hoover, Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, and General Curtis LeMay.
His acceptance address reflected this difference. After modestly questioning whether the choice of the senior class was truly “evidence of the outstanding judgment and wisdom the University has tried to instill in four years,” Senator Kennedy reflected upon the appropriateness of dedicating the award to the first U.S. President. Facing the denunciations of his Congress and of his countrymen, Washington approved the extremely unpopular Jay treaty with England. “The patriot hero” had become “the American Caesar . . . the American King George” to citizens
charter member. The members of the Council meet on campus twice a year for a series of talks with faculty and students of the University to get an idea of the mainstream of Notre Dame student life. The Council members then return to their particular sections of the country and to their particular professional fields, as Rev. Charles Sheedy, C.S.C., Dean of the College of Arts and Letters comments, “to become articulate representatives of Notre Dame throughout the country.”
Senator Kennedy’s next association with the University, again to receive an award, was in February of 1957, when at the Washington Day Exercises he became the fourth recipient of the Patriot of the Year Award. As the choice of the 1957 graduating class, he became the first politician to receive the award, the first three “patriots” having been J.
still heady with the “victory” over England. Washington accepted personal abuse rather than devastation of his nation in a futile war with a powerful Great Britain. Thus, for John Kennedy, Washington was a model of the true patriot who seeks the welfare of his nation despite the “slings and arrows” aimed at him even by his own countrymen.
Senator Kennedy urged the members of the senior class: “regardless of your chosen occupation, consider entering the field of politics at some stage of your career,” thus offering to return “the talents which society has helped to develop in you.” Recalling that in the early days of the nation it was the most capable and best educated persons who took on the task of governing — the Washingtons, the Jeffersons, the Websters, the Hamiltons, the Franklins — he asked the students to restore the noble tra-
Thc Scholastic
dition of the Congress, a body too often and too incorrectly seen as a conniving mob of manipulators and deceivers.
It was not until 1960 that Kennedy returned to Notre Dame, and this time he came in force. It was the year for the student Mock Convention, and the Kennedy of political potency was there to watch. But not only to watch: the Convention began on April 8, and that same night the Senator from Massachusetts was attending a dinnei’ in the new dining hall as part of a fund-raising campaign for Democratic Congressman John Brademas, 3rd district of Indiana. Also on his schedule were tours of the Studebaker-Packard plant and the Ball-Band Shoe factory, receptions in La Porte and Plymouth, and television appearances on WSBT-TV and WNDU-TV.
In the Mock Convention itself Kennedy was the prominent contender.
eventually being selected as the Democratic candidate on the fifth ballot with 934 votes. He received the Convention votes of New York and of every Western state.
Analyses of the Convention varied, even within the Scholastic itself. Student reporters saw it as a victory of political skill:
Why and how did Kennedy win? This is perhaps the most basic question one could ask about the convention. There was too much determined opposition to him to label the nomination a case of “Catholics voting for a Catholic.” There are many factors that were important, beginning with Kennedy’s considerable popular support and including the superior pre-convention work of his campus forces, the profusion of their campaign material, and the leadership of Senior
Class President Dick Corbett and Senior Class President-elect Pat Nee.
An editorial on the Convention, however, took a different view:
the political contest must be judged a failure. It was neither a true indication of what will happen in Los Angeles this summer nor a true expression of the political opinions of students on campus. . . . An overwhelming endorsement of a Catholic candidate at a Catholic school by Catholic students has little meaning . . . regional considerations were flagrantly ignored. Southern, Protestant agricultural Oklahoma is a case in point. It went, on all five ballots, to Northern, Catholic, industrialist Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy of Massachusetts.
Yet the Convention, to the amazement of the editors and other students, did accurately reflect the political influence of the Eastern Senator who went on to win not only the Democratic nomination but also the Presidency.
On November 22, 1961, exactly two years before he died before an assassin’s gunsight, John F. Kennedy received the highest and proudest honor Notre Dame can bestow: the Laetare Medal. The award, given each year to an outstanding Catholic layman, was presented to Mr. Kennedy by Father Hesburgh in tribute to the President’s position as “a kind of landmark for the place of young men in our time, as a symbol of the new energy, vision and dedicated service of youth to the public welfare” — the very qualities Senator Kennedy had called for from Notre Dame students more than eleven years before. The deeper significance of that tribute was to come two years later, when John Kennedy met the full and tragic force of “the slings and arrows of politics.”
The President is dead. The world is stunned, as it is at the passing of all great men, and it also feels a little emptier. Notre Dame shares in the common grief, not because of her honors to John Fitzgerald Kennedy—other schools have conferred degrees, other schools have awarded medals, other schools have thought of him as their own — but because of his reflection of what Christian education seeks to produce: selfless contribution of one’s talents to the improvement of all mankind.
November 26, 1963
	/tihere was real horror and disbelief that in our 1 times, at our stage of civilization, that such a thing as the assassination of the President of the United States could take place.
z^omplete inability to comprehend the event was the nearly universal reaction of all who heard the news last Friday that President John Fitzgerald Kennedy had been struck down by an assassin’s bullet in Dallas. This was an event that went beyond the mind’s conception of the power of hatred. It was not merely a man who had been killed. The assassination was felt as a blow against our country, and the idea of a single man jeopardizing the United States, as an entity, as an idea, as an ideal, is almost beyond comprehension. The initial shock is gone now, as the fear for the country recedes with the realization that the life of the nation will go on. But the memory of these first few hours should remain, so that we cannot forget the undeniable harm that has been done. The murder of a chief of state is the ultimate horror—before the destruction of the state itself—of a political body in turmoil. The murder of our own chief of state is the most dramatic symptom of the tension between the extremes of political beliefs in the United States in our time. The political disagreements have extended, along the same lines, into the social, intellectual, and even religious ideals of segments of the population. Consider the position of the men who have opposed the President’s stands on civil rights, governmental power, foreign policy. Consider those who have criticized his supposed betrayal of liberal ideals. Political criticism has lately been characterized by a bitterness that must now make every critic of the late President examine his soul to determine whether he had so used the right to free political criticism that he is liable to be judged guilty of propelling the hand that held the 7.65 Mauser. That John F. Kennedy realized the perils of his life can be seen by the passage he chose as an epigraph to his book, Profiles in Courage. It was taken from Edmund Burke’s eulogy of Charles James Fox for his attack on the tyranny of the East India Company: “He well knows what snares are spread about his path, from personal animosity . . . and possibly from popular delusion. But he has put to hazard his ease, his security, his interest, his power, even his popularity ... he is traduced and abused for his supposed motives.” There are many who will say that Kennedy never showed the kind of political courage he praised in his book. But it is undeniable that in accepting the position of President of the United States he was placing himself in a position where his every act would be criticized, vilified, ridiculed by some political wing. He was placing himself in a position where his decisions and actions carried more responsibility and possible consequence than any other man of our time. And in the end, of course, he did in fact die for those principles which motivated him and which propelled the country under his leadership. Perhaps the tribute that would have been most pleasing to John F. Kennedy would be the most obvious one: that he was a man of courage. 10	“I keep hoping that it is some sort of joke—some big, horrible joke,” was one comment. “It might be like that Martian thing in the thirties,” was one vain hope. But, regrettably, it is no joke; it is no hoax. Expression of such hopes could only be found in extreme despair and in the inability to respond to the tragedy and horror of the situation. The personal involvement that all felt illustrates the unique position that the President occupied in the hearts of all. From the grim silence that gripped the country to the voiced statement from a lawyer in Britain that “It was the worst thing that could have happened,” it was brought home to all that the death of John Kennedy was much more than the death of a man; it was the death of the representative of the American people both to the nations of the world as the official spokesman of the United States, and to the citizens of our country as the representative of the spirit and tradition of the highest office in the land. Much of his political appeal, particularly among the youth of the land, came from the fact that he himself was so youthful. There was confidence, certainly borne out by his term of office, that he would not be subject to traditional and hidebound political ideals. His vigorous method of attack showed that this confidence would be justified. Kennedy brought to the nation’s capital new ideas and an active manyfaceted program. Not every statement or act pleased all, but rather often met with strong opposition and denunciation. Yet all observers of the national and international scene had to admit that Kennedy was doing something—that he had given the office of President a vitality and willingness to act that had not been witnessed since the early (and also controversial) days of Franklin D. Roosevelt. It was this that appealed so much to the youth of America. Not content with the methods of the past, Kennedy was willing to accept the challenge of “defending democracy in an hour of national danger,” with all the implications of the statement. His administration could be summarized as one of "doing” —from the Peace Corps and the physical fitness program to Medicare and federal aid of education. He was not afraid to meet the civil rights question head on. Here was a man of ideas and vitality—a man not afraid to try. John Fitzgerald Kennedy had accomplished much that was said to be impossible: “No one so young can be elected President.” He was. “There isn’t a Catholic in the country who can overcome prejudice and bigotry to become President.” He did. The man that did overcome supposed disadvantages of youth and Catholicism brought to the Presidency a dynamic image and personality that endeared him to the hearts of hundreds of millions around the world. Here was the man who, by his life, left the key with which to face his death: courage and confidence.

You were expecting maybe romance . . . glamour? Then forget about the Peace Corps. Glamorous it’s not.
You’re going to be right in there with monotony, illiteracy and an army of bloodthirsty mosquitoes. Helping people who have asked for help. You’re going to work 16 hours a day and sometimes some of the people won’t even know what you’re doing there in the first place. And you will see one fraction of the results you’d hoped for. But it’s worth it when a kid in Nigeria understands what an alphabet is and some day will be able to use it. When a farmer in India gets chickens with some meat on them for a change. Or when Colombian villagers learn to work together for the first time—and this new spirit of unity builds a health center. The
Peace Corps works in 48 countries—not changing the world dramatically, but not leaving it the same, either.
It’s tough to get into the Peace Corps. But we’ll be glad to check you out. Just write to: The Peace Corps, Washington, D.C., 20525.

Assignment: design a car tor tomorrow... that could be built today!
Result: Allegro, an experiment in advanced automotive ideas that are practical for the near future
Allegro means “brisk and lively,” which certainly describes Ford Motor Company's new dream car, a handsome fastback coupe. More than that, Allegro has unique functional features that could be adapted forfuture production cars. (This has already occurred in the case of retractable seat belts!)
A major innovation is a cantilever-arm steering wheel with an electronic “memory." The steering wheel is mounted on an arm that extends from a center-mounted column. The wheel swings upward for easy exit, returns automatically to its former position at the touch of a button. Power adjustment enables it to be moved three inches fore and aft and five inches vertically. This, plus power-adjustable
foot pedals, permits use of a fixed seat design for low overall height.
Basically a two-seater in present form, Allegro has rear floor space that could be converted to carry two additional passengers. The car could be powered by either a V-4 made by Ford of Germany or by the domestic 144- or 170-cubic-inch Sixes.
Allegro is one of a series of Ford-built dream cars which will be shown at the New York World’s Fair to test consumer reaction to styling and mechanical innovations. This will help determine which of their forward-looking features are destined for the American Road—as further examples of Ford Motor Company's leadership in styling and engineering.

SALUTE: KEN HUCK
It’s been a busy first year for Wisconsin Telephone’s Ken Huck (B.A., 1962).
In less than a year’s time. Ken has filled in as Business Office Supervisor in Janesville, and as Manager both there and in Watertown. Wisconsin. Besides managerial duties, he made studies on manager security checks and orderwriting discrepancies, and compiled work volume forecasts for Janesville and Beloit
Few men in any field of work begin their careers with as much responsibility as Ken Huck has found at Wisconsin Telephone. His company is well aware that managerial muscle, if it is to grow, needs exercise.
Ken Huck, like many young men, is impatient to make things happen for his company and himself. There are few places where such restlessness is more welcomed or rewarded than in the fast-growing telephone business.

The time has come to think of Christmas shopping, for the Yuletide will be upon us quicker than you can say Jack Robinson. (Have you ever wondered, incidentally, about the origin of this interesting phrase “Quicker than you can say Jack Robinson”? Well sir, the original saying was French—“Plus vile que de dire Jacques Robespierre." Jack Robinson is, as everyone knows, an Anglicization of Jacques Robespierre who was, as everyone knows, the famous figure from the French Revolution who, as everyone knows, got murdered in his bath by Danton, Murat, Caligula, and Al Capone.
(The reason people started saying “Quicker than you can say Jacques Robespierre”—or Jack Robinson, as he is called in English-speaking countries like England, the U.S., and Cleveland—is quite an interesting little story. It seems that Robespierre’s wife, Georges Sand, got word of the plot to murder her husband in his bath. All she had to do to save his life was call his name and warn him. But, alas, quicker than she could say Jacques Robespierre, she received a telegram from her old friend Frederic Chopin who was down in Majorca setting
lyrics to his immortal “WarsawConcerto.” Chopin said he needed Georges Sand’s help desperately because he could not find a rhyme for “Warsaw.” Naturally, Georges could not refuse such as urgent request.
(Well sir, off to Majorca went Georges, but before she left, she told her little daughter Walter that some bad men were coming to murder Daddy in his bath. She instructed Walter to shout Robespierre’s name the moment the bad men arrived. But Walter, alas, had been seabathing that morning on the Riviera, and she had come home with a big bag of salt water taffy, and when the bad men arrived to murder Robespierre, Walter, alas, w7as chewing a wad of taffy

and could not get her mouth unstuck in time to shout a warning. Robespierre, alas, was murdered quicker than you could say Jacques Robespierre—or Jack Robinson, as he is called in Englishspeaking countries.
(There is, I am pleased to report, one small note of cheer in this grisly tale. When Georges Sand got to Majorca, she did succeed in helping Chopin find a rhyme for “Warsaw” as everyone knows who has heard those haunting lyrics:
In the fair town of Warsaw, Which Napoleon’s horse saw.
Singing cockles and mussels, alive, alive o!)
But I digress.
We were speaking of Christmas gifts. What we all try to find at Christmas is, of course, unusual and distinctive gifts for our friends. May I suggest then a
carton of Marlboro Cigarettes?
What? You are astonished? You had not thought of Marlboros as unusual? You had regarded them as familiar, reliable smokes whose excellence varied not one jot nor tittle from year to year?
True. All true. But all the same, Marlboros are unusual because every time you try one, it’s like the first time. The flavor never palls, the filter never gets hackneyed, the soft pack is ever a new delight, and so is the Flip Top box. Each Marlboro is a fresh and pristine pleasure, and if you want all your friends to clap their hands and cry, “Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus!” you will see that their stockings are filled with Marlboros on Christmas morn.

THE COVER
Notre Dame’s single moment of glory for 1963 came in the upset of Southern California. Quarterback Frank Budka, the game’s hero, sets his line.
11
And What of 1964?
Notre Dame’s 1963 football season has been, in many respects, unique: it has seen Notre Dame score a major upset and be beaten in a major upset; it has seen a game cancelled because of the tragic death of the President of the United States; it has been a season with clearly defined periods of hope, of confidence, and of utter despair. And, like all losing seasons, it has been a year of ifs, of games almost won, of unanswered questions. What then, is the significance of this past season, and what are its implications for 1964?
The season opener against Wisconsin seems an eternity ago, so often has its pattern been repeated. The sun was shining brightly, the temperature was in the mid-eighties, and Notre Dame fans had high hopes for the season ahead. Their confidence soon appeared justified: the Irish scored early on a 24-yard sprint by Jack Snow, and added two more points when Tom Goberville blocked a Badger punt and it rolled through the end zone for an automatic safety. Jim Kelly’s five catches played a key role in Notre Dame’s limited offense.
The defensive unit—led by Captain Bob Lehmann, who had 14 tackles — clung to the slim lead, but Wisconsin scored twice — the second time with only 67 seconds left in the game — and won 13-9. Though they lost, the
December 6, 1963
Irish hit hard, hustled, blocked and tackled well, and pursued enemy ball carriers with verve. Hope remained high for the Purdue game.
Again, Notre Dame scored first, this time on a bomb from John Huarte to Kelly, but the extra-point try failed. Again the defense held, but Purdue scored a single touchdown — and extra point — and won 7-6. Halfback Ron Bliey was the game’s offensive star, gaining 55 yards in ten carries; on Notre Dame’s last, desperate drive, he ripped off consecutive gains of 15, 11, 13, and five yards.
At this point, as Chicago Sun-Times columnist Dick Hackenberg pointed out, Notre Dame was “the best twice-beaten team in the country,” and was primed for an upset of Southern Cal.
And primed for an upset the Irish were. The Trojans were checked by a tough defense which held them to 42 yards rushing in the second half, and allowed them only 55 offensive plays to Notre Dame’s 67. And they were surprised by Frank Budka, starting his first game of the season at quarterback. Budka ran for 84 yards himself, completed two of five passes — one a clutch 14-yarder to Kelly, and scored one touchdown. Tommy MacDonald scored the other for Notre Dame on an interception and a 62-yard return. Bill Pfeiffer, the roving linebacker, made 17 tackles for the Irish, and sophomore halfback Bill Wolski came into his own to give Budka the running support he needed.
Coach Hugh Devore summed up Notre Dame sentiments: “If someone
had asked me before the season which i of our first three games we were least ‘ likely to win, I’d have had to say Southern Cal.” The team, with a ma- i jor upset and its first win behind it, , found new confidence.	■
This confidence was readily ap- : parent as the Irish almost effortlessly	;
demolished UCLA. Budka directed all	■
four touchdown drives, passing to	:
Kantor and Kelly for two scores, keep-	:
ing for one, and handing off to Wol-	■
ski for the other. He also completed	’
seven of ten passes for 86 yards, and	;
gave evidence of being the complete	’
quarterback. Charlie O’Hara and Paul	•
Costa, two halfbacks who hadn’t even	•
played previously, completed the de-	?
molition: O’Hara gained 54 yards in	i
just four carries, and Costa ran for	;
49 yards in seven attempts.	i
It now appeared that the Southern	’
Cal game had been the turning point	;
of the season, that Notre Dame was	;
on its way to a successful year. Cam-	;
pus talk was of winning seven or eight	’
games — or, among conservatives, at	;
least of having a winning season.	J
Then it happened. Had anyone j asked Devore before the season which ; game Notre Dame had the best chance । of winning, he would undoubtedly • have said Stanford, and reasonably ‘ so. But Stanford had other ideas. The : Indians played magnificently and, at ; the same time, the Irish gave their £ worst performance of the season. The ■ combination was disastrous for Notre f Dame, and the Irish left sunny California in a very un-sunny mood. This, in retrospect, was the real turning	f
13	£
point of the season, from which Notre Dame never recovered.
Navy sunk the Irish a notch lower. Heisman Trophy wanner Roger Stau-bach was pressured hard by the Notre Dame defense, and had one of his worst days. Still, taking advantage of such runners as Pat Donnelly and John Sai, he directed the Middies on five touchdown drives. That the Irish spent most of the afternoon on defense is reflected well by the fact that Bob Lehmann had 20 tackles; Jim Carroll, Tom Kostelnik, and John Atamian gave Lehmann good support.
This was the beginning of the period of despair: there seemed to be hope for a recovery from the Stanford debacle, based on Notre Dame’s previous showings against USC and UCLA, but now many began to fear the worst.
The Pittsburgh game did little to restore the confidence of either players or fans. Notre Dame drew first blood, scoring on a one-yard plunge by Budka. But Paul Martha ran the ensuing kickoff back for a touchdown, and Pittsburgh dominated the rest of the game. Offensively, Jim Kelly made three difficult catches, one for a touchdown, to run his career total to 66; John Huarte completed five of eight passes for 71 yards; and
Bill Wolski averaged seven yards per carry. Defensively, Lehmann and Pfeiffer were again the standouts, with 18 and 17 tackles.
This game prompted Frank Leahy to remark that Notre Dame’s players were out of shape, that they were no longer capable of playing a full hour of tough football. The Irish refuted Leahy’s words with a magnificent performance against Michigan State. Notre Dame held the Spartans to 233 yards total offense — none passing — in comparison to State’s 296-yard average; the Spartans began only two play series in Notre Dame territory, one after an interception and one after a long punt return. The defensive unit, led by Tom Goberville, John Meyer, Lehmann, Pfeiffer, and MacDonald, jealously guarded Notre Dame’s 7-6 halftime lead, but the offense was unable to score again, and an 85-yard run by Sherman Lewis late in the fourth quarter gave State the game and plunged the Irish deeper into despair.
Notre Dame’s scheduled game with the State University of Iowa was cancelled, along with most of the country’s other major athletic events, as the nation mourned the death by assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy (see page 33). It was
an event — and a weekend — which will be remembered by most Americans far longer than any mere football game.
On Thanksgiving Day, the Irish had little to be thankful for — except that the season was over. The Syracuse game itself might well have been a re-run of the Michigan State — or Wisconsin, or Purdue — game. Syracuse scored early in the second quarter, but the extra-point try was blocked; Notre Dame came back to score on a halfback pass from Frank Budka to Tommy MacDonald, and the Irish led 7-6 at the half. Again the defense played exceptionally, but again the offense was impotent. Syracuse scored a last-minute touchdown, and won 14-7. It was a finale which, in every respect, typified the 1963 season.
One of the mysteries of Notre Dame football is how such a poor team can have so many outstanding players, for Notre Dame certainly had them in 1963. Very unmysterious-ly, however, many of the stars were defensive players.
End Jim Kelly, chosen as a first-team All-American by the National Association of College Football Coaches, caught 18 passes this season for 264 yards and two touchdowns, and ended his career with 68 receptions and a bevy of records. Captain Bob Lehmann, a quiet and intense leader, finished the season with 95 tackles and was chosen by the coaches as third-team All-America guard; safetyman Tommy MacDonald, with fifteen interceptions, broke the career record (13) previously held by Johnny Lattner; and senior linebacker Bill Pfeiffer became the first Notre Dame player of recent seasons to break the 100-mark in tackles.
The professional football drafts justified the confidence of many a Notre Dame fan. Kelly was picked on the second round of the National Football League draft, Frank Budka and Paul Costa on the fourth round, Jim Snowden on the fifth round, George Bednar on the eighth, MacDonald on the thirteenth, and Dave Humenik on the eighteenth. In addition, the Ameri can Football League drafted Lehmann. Clay Stephens, and John Simon.
A number of underclassmen als< played key roles for the Irish thn season: backs Wolski and Kantor, anG linemen Nicola, Carroll, and Arrington.
Football Revie'
Why, with players like these, was Notre Dame able to win only two of nine games? Mere mortals will probably never know the real answer, but at least three reasons suggest themselves: 1) lack of depth in the line; 2) lack of a breakaway runner; and 3) lack of an all-around quarterback — who could run, pass, handle the ball, and select his plays intelligently.
The preseason loss of tackles Dave Humenik and Gene Penman and guard Wayne Allen, and the later loss of guard Mike DiCarlo, necessitated considerable shifting of interior linemen. Although the result was a sound first line and several competent second-line personnel, Notre Dame often needed — but didn’t have — two, or even three, solid lines.
Though Joe Kantor and Bill Wolski are excellent, tough, hard-driving runners, neither has the broken-field speed to get away for the long gain. As a result, opponents’ defenses were able to play quite conservatively against Notre Dame’s rushing attack; had the Irish had an explosive runner of the caliber of Sherman Lewis — or even Angelo Dabiero or Don Hogan — the inside running would have been much easier for Kantor and Wolski.
But Notre Dame’s most desperate need was a complete quarterback, a field general who could consistently move the offense. John Huarte was able to throw, Sandy Bonvechio handled the ball well, and Frank Budka was excellent at running and play selection — and even, on occasion, at passing. But none of the three was ever able to do all at the same time or for any extended period.
Even considering Notre Dame’s inadequacies at some key positions, however, the Irish were capable of far more than they accomplished. One reason for this, I believe, was an appalling waste of talent. Such professional draftees as Paul Costa, Jim Snowden, Clay Stephens, and John Simon played hardly at all. Frank Budka, if not being used as a quarterback, could certainly have been used as a defensive back, a running back, or a flanker — but he ought not have been sitting on the bench; Charlie O’Hara, who averaged 6.3 yards for 15 carries, played considerably against UCLA and Stanford, and was never seen again. And even Jim Kelly, an All-American and a second-round professional draft choice, was terribly under-played {e.g., eight minutes and 45 seconds against Michigan State).
Another reason was Notre Dame’s ultra-conservative attack: even Woody Hayes’ Buckeyes seemed by compari-
son to be playing radically wide-open football. The Irish disdained the pass except in obvious situations, ran their plays up the middle or off tackle almost without exception, and ran with third down and long yardage. Even when opponents jammed their lines to stop this medieval offense, Notre Dame refused to pass for a needed first down or to loosen up the enemy defense. And, unfortunately, it is difficult to play ball control football when one must punt on each fourth down.
I ontinued losing can be only bad — bad for Notre Dame as an institution, bad for the players, the coaches, the alumni and students. Because this is true, the University administration has open to it three possible courses of action: 1) continue to play big time football, assuming
that athletic excellence is indeed compatible with academic excellence; 2) play a schedule restricted to schools of comparable academic standing; or 3) rather than continue losing, and rather than further sully this school’s once lustrous athletic reputation, discontinue football entirely.
The first alternative is, of course, preferable, for big-time football has been and should, if possible, continue to be a part of the Notre Dame tradition. But if this University is to continue in big time football, it must no longer delude itself that everything possible is being done (without violating the University’s principles) to promote winning football.
Notre Dame must commit itself to a new football excellence, whether under Hugh Devore, an entirely new staff of assistants, or a new head coach. If Notre Dame is ever to break the shackles of mediocrity, it must take action now, before the 1964 football season.

Close, but not quite
Notre Dame, Indiana., September 28—Wisconsin’s swift, erratic, and very offensive Badgers scored a lastminute touchdown to eke out a victory over a defensively tough but offensively ineffective Notre Dame team here this afternoon. A one-yard scoring plunge with just 67 seconds left to play gave last season’s Big Ten champs a 14-9 edge over the Irish, playing their first game of 1963.
Rushing yardage and first downs were nearly equal, and the outcome of the game balanced—literally—on the fingertips of Badger end Jim Jones, whose one-handed catch of a crucial third-down pass kept alive Wisconsin’s final drive.
Notre Dame halfback Jack Snow scampered 24 yards to post Notre Dame’s lone touchdown, and end Tom Goberville blocked a Wisconsin punt, which rolled through the Badgers’ end zone for an automatic safety.
During the first quarter, Notre Dame almost took up residence in Wisconsin territory. The Badgers took the opening kickoff and drove to the Irish 43 before they were forced to punt. There the drive stalled, and they punted dead on Notre Dame’s 14. Fullback Pete Du-ranko and halfback Joe Farrell got ten yards in three plays, then quarterback Denny Szot threw to Jim Kelly for ten more, and a personal foul against Wisconsin put the ball on the Badger 45.
Duranko gained five, and another pass to Kelly carried to the 24. Szot then pitched out to Snow, who skirted left end, got a good block, and outran four other tacklers for the score. John Huarte’s conversion was good, and Notre Dame led, 7-0.
December 6, 1963
Near the end of the first period, Wisconsin intercepted a Notre Dame pass on its 12-yard line, and failing to move elected to punt. The pass from center was off and Tom Goberville caught the ball with his elbow as it left the kicker’s foot. The ball bounded ahead of frantic Badgers, and dribbled through the end zone for a safety. The Irish led 9-0 just 47 seconds into the second quarter.
Wisconsin stormed back with left-hander Harold Brandt hitting Jones with a sideline pass, good for a 35-yard gain to the Notre Dame 21. Five plays later and with the ball on the five-yard line, Brandt again rifled a pass to Jones, who was slanting across the end zone, and the Irish lead was cut to 9-7.
Wisconsin threatened twice in the third quarter. They were thwarted the first time by defensive halfback Tommy MacDonald’s fine end-zone interception and the second by a twenty-yard field goal attempt which fell short, hit the crossbar, and fell back onto the playing field.
A fine 30-yard run by Notre Dame fullback Joe Kantor was nullified by a Wisconsin interception, but the clock was running and victory seemed near.
With 6:48 left in the game and the ball on their own twenty, Wisconsin began to move. Crashing over and through a tired but struggling Irish team, the Badgers pressed goalward. The 83-degree heat took its toll, and the greater Wisconsin line depth became evident as the Badgers pushed back the scrambling, stubborn Irish. Jones’ catch put Wisconsin in scoring territory, and Ralph Kurek barreled over from the one.

Closer
Lafayette, Indiana, October 5 — The day began like any typical fall football Saturday. Warm weather had prevailed throughout the state during the past week, and the Indian summer atmosphere had enlivened spirits at both Notre Dame and Purdue.
At Lafayette, the pregame scene was one of mass frenzy. Ross-Ade Stadium, set against the early Georgian architecture of the Purdue campus, was beginning to fill slowly. Outside in the parking lots, late-coming buses were churning up dust, and thousands were huddled, eating and drinking, around parked cars. As usual, boastful small talk filled the air everywhere.
For Notre Dame and Purdue partisans, the game was of equal importance: both teams were searching for their first win of the still-young season. As it turned out, it was a perfect football afternoon — perfect, however, for Purdue, as the Boilermakers regained their composure in the second half and downed Notre Dame, 7-6.
Most distressing was not the fact that Notre Dame lost, but the way in which it lost. As in the Wisconsin game, Notre Dame fell prey to its opponent’s fourthquarter passing attack. Particularly disturbing also was the fact that Purdue was fielding its weakest team in years. In short, it was a game the Irish should have won; Notre Dame won the battle of statistics but lost the war on the field as its tired and inexperienced line folded late in the game.
The first quarter set the format for the entire contest. Time went quickly, and both teams went scoreless as the evenly matched defensive lines gave ground reluctantly. Penalties hampered both teams’ drives, but the quarter, though scoreless, was far from dull.
Purdue dominated the second quarter — but not the scoring. A Purdue drive was halted on the Notre Dame 13, as a field goal try went wide to the right. Then, with John Huarte quarterbacking the Irish, Notre Dame started to move. Huarte flipped a short pass to Alan Loboy in the right fiat, and Loboy raced 39 yards to the Purdue 41. On the next play, Huarte dropped back and arched a 26-yard pass to Jim Kelly, who caught the ball on the 15 and darted into the end zone; it was Notre Dame’s only tally. Huarte, who injured his ankle on the play, decided not to kick the PAT, and a two-point pass play failed.
In the third period, neither team could muster any offensive momentum, and the quarter resembled a punting match between Notre Dame’s Dan McGinn and Purdue’s Ron DiGravio.
At the outset of the fourth period, however, Purdue came to life. DiGravio rifled a 26-yard pass down the middle to Bob Hadrick, then threw to Hadrick for ten more. A defensive holding penalty against the Irish moved the ball to the Notre Dame 19, and after a penalty against Purdue, DiGravio hit Jim Morel on the ten. The Irish defense stymied three running plays, but on a fourth-and-seven play, DiGravio hit Hadrick in the end zone for the touchdown. Gary Hogan added the conversion and Purdue led, 7-6.
Hugh Devore has said, “A dying man can lunge twice.” At Purdue, Notre Dame made one last lunge towards the Purdue goal; it was, unfortunately, a futile one. With Huarte directing the attack and Ronnie Bliey rolling up yardage on end sweeps, Notre Dame advanced the ball to the Purdue 10. But the Boilermakers held, and a field- goal was blocked. . . . The game was Notre Dame’s second defeat, and the future against such teams as USC seemed bleak.

'^'otre Dame, Indiana, October 12—October 12 is a ’ day known for upsets. Almost 500 years ago Christopher Columbus, with the odds against him, discovered America. And today the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame, 16-point underdogs to the University of Southern California, toppled the Trojans 17-14 in one of the major upsets of the football season.
To the delight of a sun-bathed crowd of 60,000, Notre Dame crashed into the win column after two consecutive losses. It was the poised quarterbacking of Frank Budka, the power running of backs Bill Wolski and Joe Kantor, and the exceptional play of Notre Dame’s defensive secondary which enabled the Irish to gain their first win of 1963.
Tommy MacDonald brought the crowd to its feet late in the first quarter. Picking off a Pete Beathard to Hal Bedsole pass, the Irish defensive ace raced 62 yards for Notre Dame’s first score. Sophomore Ken Ivan added the extra point and gave the Irish a 7-0 lead.
The Trojans immediately marched 74 yards in nine plays for the tying touchdown. Beathard alternately ran and passed, and capped the drive with a plunge from the three. The successful extra-point try tied the score.
But with Bill Wolski leading the way, Notre Dame bounced right back to take the lead. The husky halfback returned the Trojan kickoff to the Irish 37, and then picked up 39 yards in two plays from scrimmage; Budka picked up two more yards, and Wolski went in for the score untouched. Notre Dame led, 14-7, but not for long.
With 33 seconds left in the half, USC again tied the score. Beathard hit his All-American end, Hal Bedsole, with a 43-yard strike to the Notre Dame 37; the same combination was good for 13 more yards. Fullback Mike Garrett bolted over for the score on a screen pass from Beathard. Half-time score: Notre Dame 14, Southern Cal 14.
The third quarter was a scoreless defensive struggle. After a Notre Dame drive was blunted by a fumble, and after an exchange of punts, Beathard’s passing got the Trojans moving again. USC completed two in a row and moved to the Notre Dame 12. Beathard again dropped back to throw, but was nailed by Norm Nicola and John Simon for a 14-yard loss. The next play was the turning point of the game: Beathard rifled a pass goalward, but Bedsole dropped it in the end zone and the Irish gained possession on the 17 as the third quarter ended.
The final 15 minutes were electrifying. After the Irish got one first down, Kantor smashed off left tackle for nine yards, and Budka rolled around left end for 11 more and another first down. Notre Dame advanced all the way to Southern Cal’s 20; there, however, three line plunges netted only four yards. With fourth down and six yards to go, Ken Ivan came off the bench. His field goal from the 25 was barely inside the left upright, but it was good, and it gave the Irish three of the most important points of this or any other season. The clock showed 6:28 remaining, and the score Notre Dame 17, Southern California 14.
Notre Dame’s defensive line and rover back Bill Pfeiffer combined to stop a Trojan penetration; keying on Beathard, Pfeiffer made 17 tackles, the most this season for a Notre Dame player. Notre Dame regained control of the ball, and banged for three more first downs as time ran out.
The defeat was as bitter for the Trojans as the win was sweet for Notre Dame. Just as Christopher Columbus had upset the odds, so had the Irish; the Notre Dame victory may not occasion a national holiday, but Irish fans will remember it for a long, long time.

Two in a row
T^'otre Dame, Indiana,, October 19—The Fighting Irish of Notre Dame, in their first meeting ever with the University of California at Los Angeles, made Coach Bill Barnes’ Bruins wish they had never set foot on the damp, historic turf of Notre Dame Stadium. In this second game of a triad with West Coast opponents, the Irish completely dominated play, even more so than the 27-12 score indicated.
Touchdown drives in each quarter—engineered by senior quarterback Frank Budka—and rugged line play which held the Bruins to only 72 yards rushing, were the principal ingredients in Notre Dame’s victory.
The Irish drove 72 yards in ten plays the first time they had the ball, and scored on an 11-yard screen pass from Budka to fullback Joe Kantor. Ken Ivan kicked his first of three conversions, and Notre Dame led 7-0 midway through the first quarter.
A poor UCLA punt early in the second period gave the Irish possession on the Bruins’ 30-yard line. Six plays later halfback Bill Wolski took a pitchout from Budka, sprinted four yards around left end, and dove headlong into the end zone. Ivan’s PAT attempt was good.
Later in the second quarter, UCLA quarterback Larry Zeno—the heir to a job once held by such greats as Paul Cameron, Bob Davenport, Ronnie Knox, and Bill Kilmer —got the Bruins moving. Though their first drive was thwarted when rover Bill Pfeiffer’s jarring tackle caused a fumble on the Notre Dame two-yard line, the Uclans befuddled the Irish secondary on the next series of downs, and scored on a 12-yard tackle-eligible pass play from Zeno to Mitchell Johnson. The touchdown came with but 38 seconds left in the first half; Zeno’s extra-point try was wide, and Notre Dame left the field with a 14-6 advantage.
The second half began with four penalties in the first three minutes, and action bogged down considerably.
Eventually, however, the Irish were able to mount another attack: sparked by the running of Charlie O’Hara and the clutch pass catching of Jim Kelly, Notre Dame marched the 54 yards from its own 46 to UCLA’s end zone in only six plays. Kelly’s nifty fake left the two Bruin safetymen as little more than spectators to his 17-yard scoring catch. Ivan’s kick failed, but the Irish led 20-6 with little more than a quarter to play.
The tough defensive line—led by Bob Lehmann, Norm Nicola, Jim Carroll, and Richard Arrington—continued to suppress the UCLA ground game and harass the Bruins’ passers, and UCLA was again forced to punt. Notre Dame took over at the Uclans’ 45.
After two routine line plunges gained eight yards, Budka gave to O'Hara on an off-tackle slant. In a run very reminiscent of his scoring scamper in Pittsburgh two seasons ago, O’Hara broke through the line, caught the secondary bunched-up, and went outside and down the sideline for 33 yards. From the four, where O’Hara was run out of bounds, Budka capped the drive with an off-tackle dive into the end zone. Ivan’s perfect kick was the twenty-seventh and last point of the afternoon for the Irish.
UCLA’s second touchdown culminated an 80-yard drive which was highlighted by a 42-yard pass play from quarterback Mike Haffner to All-American end Mel Profit —who lived up to his advance billings by snaring seven passes for 104 yards. The touchdown pass, however, was a nine-yarder to Kurt Altenberg. The extra-point attempt again failed, and the Bruins finished the day with an even dozen points.
Notre Dame’s complete control of the game is best indicated by the fact that Coach Hugh Devore used four full teams—44 players—against the Bruins.

Ambushed
Palo Alto, California, October 26 — It was a bad day at Stanford’s Red Rock for all the Irish, especially for Coach Hugh Devore, some 40 Notre Dame players, and the Four Horsemen (who were guests of the Stanford alumni).
The Indians, 14-point underdogs to a team which only two weeks earlier upset the 19S2 National Champions, stunned Notre Dame with two second half scores to win, 24-14. The combination of Dick Berg’s pin-point passing and the superb running of Steve Thurlow accounted for the Indians’ three touchdowns. Junior quarterback Berg completed four of six passes, while halfback Thurlow smashed for 75 yards in 15 carries. The latter figured in all three Stanford scores, rushing for two and passing for the third.
Notre Dame exploded for the first touchdown of the game as the Devoremen took full advantage of an early Indian fumble. Alternate plunges by Joe Kantor and Bill Wolski produced four first downs before quarterback Frank Budka sneaked over from the one-yard line. Ken Ivan’s conversion made the score Notre Dame 7, Stanford 0.
Gary Pettigrew, a Stanford defensive back, got the home team back in the game when he intercepted a Budka aerial on the Indian 36. Coach John Ralston’s offense proved its effectiveness at once. Alternately running and passing, Berg showed the poise and finesse of Stanford’s All-American signal caller of 1959, John Brodie. It was the raw-boned Thurlow, however, who hit pay dirt for the Redmen. The lean Californian bellied deep to the left and then cut off tackle for four yards and six points. Southpaw kicker Broden Beck made it
Safetyman Tommy MacDonald makes his 13th interception, tying the record set by Johnny Lattner. MacDonald subsequently intercepted tiro more passes to set a new mark.
7-7, and soon put Stanford ahead 10-7, with a 30-yard field goal.
Helped by a 15-yard holding penalty, Notre Dame began its second and last touchdown march. Budka scampered around end for a first down and then hit Jim Kelly with a 12-yard pass for another. With first and ten on the Stanford 17, Budka pitched to Dave Pivec to give Notre Dame six more points and a 14-0 halftime lead.
The next 30 minutes, however, were all Berg, Thurlow, and Stanford. Thurlow could have done the job by himself. Notre Dame was able to manage only four first downs to the Indians’ 13 in the second half. The Irish were also outrushed in the final two quarters, 130 yards to 55.
Halfback Dan Conway opened the second half by returning the Notre Dame kickoff 17 yards to the Stanford 30. Berg cracked right guard for eight yards, Thurlow followed with eight, and after a four-yard gain, Thurlow picked up 15 yards with the aid of two good blocks. Glenn Myers plunged for four. Two plays later, Thurlow went over untouched from the five-yard line to give Stanford a 17-14 lead.
To prove their last drive wasn’t a fluke, Stanford marched for another score early in the fourth period. Again it was Thurlow who did the damage. With a fourth-and-goal at the seven, Thurlow swung to his own right and fired a hard pass to Bill Hundley, just within the end-zone sideline. This was the last score of the afternoon.
Penalties cost the Irish a golden opportunity when the score was Stanford 17, Notre Dame 14. Inside Indian territory, the Irish were penalized once for roughness; after Notre Dame got a first down on the Stanford 35, another 15-yarder was marched off. Had it not been for these two penalties, plus two more for offsides, the Irish might yet have won.	—Rex Lardner

Notre Dame, Indiana, November 2—The skies, cold and gray, were depressing. And so was the game for 59,362 homecoming spectators, who watched in horror as Navy scored four second-half touchdowns to defeat Notre Dame, 35-14.
Though fullback Pat Donnelly scored two touchdowns and rushed for 127 yards in 14 carries — an average of nine yards per try — and though Gary Kellner also scored twice, it was quarterback Roger Staubach who detonated the Navy offense.
Late in the first quarter Notre Dame had the ball, fourth down and two, on its own 30-yard line. Punter Dan McGinn, straining for a bad pass from center, was tackled for a 12-yard loss and Navy took over on the Irish 18.
In trotted Staubach. A quick hand-off to his left halfback gained five yards; a good fake and another hand-off — to second team fullback Nick Markoff — brought the Middies to Notre Dame’s five. A line plunge failed to gain, and Staubach rolled out around left end to the three as the quarter ended. On the opening play of the second quarter, Staubach rolled out to his right and the Notre Dame defenders, alert for the run, neglected right end Gary Kellner; Staubach hit him with a perfect end-zone pass. Fred Marlin converted.
After an exchange of punts, the Irish took possession on their own 35. From there, Frank Budka flawlessly directed a drive which covered 65 yards in 15 plays. Relying on Paul Costa, Pete Duranko, and Joe Kantor, Notre Dame moved ponderously but relentlessly downfield, until Budka scored on a two-yard keep.
Navy halfback John Sai returned the second-half opening kickoff back to the 30, and Staubach again jogged onto the field. Nine plays, three and one-half minutes, and three passes later Navy has its second touchdown. The key plays were Staubach to Donnelly passes. After a two-yard gain and an incomplete pass (the receiver slipped), Staubach pitched to Donnelly for a 30-yard gain that carried all the way to the Notre Dame 26. Several plays — and a Navy offside — later, Jolly Roger rifled a pass to Donnelly in the end zone.
Late in the third period, Navy’s Ed Orr ran a punt back to the Navy 44. Eight plays later the Middies scored. This time Donnelly did most of the work himself: he covered 47 of the 56 yards to the goal line in five carries — including runs of 20 and 21 yards. John Sai scored from the two.
Thirty seconds later Navy scored again. On Notre Dame’s first play from scrimmage, Frank Budka was hit just as he released a screen pass intended for Bill Wolski. Kellner intercepted the pass on the dead run, and continued to the end zone untouched. The conversion was successful, and Navy led 28-7 with twenty-two minutes left to play.
Early in the final quarter Navy again had the ball, this time at Notre Dame’s 41. Staubach rolled out, almost crossed the line of scrimmage, and stutter-stepped for what seemed like minutes; at almost the same instant he was swarmed under by a gang of Notre Dame tacklers; he pushed a basketball-like chest pass to Donnelly, skirting left end. No one laid a hand on Donnelly as he sprinted the 41 yards for the touchdown.
Notre Dame scored last. With only minutes left, the Irish recovered a fumble at the Navy thirteen-yard line. They scored in two plays, the second a ten-yard smash by Joe Kantor, whose determined second effort carried him into the end zone.
Notre Dame’s two touchdowns were too little and too late, for Navy had Roger Staubach.

Martha and Mazurek
"^Totre Dame, Indiana, November 9 — Coach John ’ Michelosen turned his Pittsburgh Panthers loose in
Notre Dame Stadium today, and they proceeded to maul their way to a 27-7 victory before a slim crowd of some 41,000. The strong Pitt offense, led by Paul Martha and Fred Mazurek, thwarted any Irish hopes of winning the season’s last home game: Notre Dame was outrushed 158 yards to 87, and gained only 80 yards passing to 130 for the Panthers.
The loss made more painfully obvious Notre Dame’s lack of a quarterback who could lead a sustained offensive effort. Frank Budka started the game, but by its end Bill Zloch, Sandy Bonvechio, and John Huarte had all seen action. None was really effective, although Huarte completed five of eight passes in the fourth quarter, and accounted for 71 of the 80 yards the Irish gained in the air.
Notre Dame played Pittsburgh on even terms in the first half, and threatened from the very first series of downs. Jim Kelly fielded a short kickoff on the 39; runs by Wolski, Kantor, and Budka, plus a pass interference call, took the Irish to the Pitt nine, where the Panthers took over on downs. The Irish got the ball back quickly, however, when Tom Longo intercepted at the Pitt 38.
Exceptional running by Bill Pfeiffer, a pass to Kelly, and a one-yard keep by Budka spelled touchdown for Notre Dame. Ken Ivan’s kick was good, and the Irish led 7-0 with 2:10 left in the first period.
That touchdown held up for only 13 seconds. Paul Martha took the ensuing kickoff on his eight-yard line, cut right to the sideline, and sped 92 yards down a perfectly executed blocking corridor. John Meyer blocked the kick, and Notre Dame held a slim 7-6 lead.
The teams exchanged punts, and then with fourth down and ten, McGinn punted from the Notre Dame end zone to Eric Crabtree on the Pitt 30. Just when it
looked like Crabtree was trapped, he broke loose, down the sidelines to the Notre Dame 25 where he was finally shoved out of bounds by McGinn. From there Mazurek quickly engineered a touchdown, with Rick Leeson going over the one-yard line. Dave Pivec intercepted a Mazurek pass on the try for two points, and with 6:45 left in the half the score was Pittsburgh 12, Notre Dame 7.
The Irish offense sputtered, but the defense — primarily because of interceptions by Pivec and Charlie O’Hara — was able to hold the Panthers till half time.
Notre Dame was very much in the game until late in the third quarter, when Leeson picked off a pass intended for Kelly at the Irish 40. Even though a holding penalty on the play set them back to the 49, it took the Panthers only two plays to score. A pass to Martha for 40 yards set the stage for a 10-yard touchdown run by Mazurek. The crowd saw more Mazurek magic as the quarterback sprang from the holding position on a fake kick, and ran for an easy two points. With 1:58 left in the third period, the Irish found themselves trailing 20-7.
The game’s most spirited moment came for Notre Dame in the fourth quarter when Hugh Devore stormed out onto the field, amid cheers from the student body, to protest the ruling that a Huarte pass attempt was a fumble. His protest was to no avail, and the Irish received a 15-yard unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty. Pittsburgh took the ball on the Notre Dame 41, and a touchdown was only nine plays away.
The passing of John Huarte sparked the strongest Irish drive since the first quarter, as Notre Dame marched from its 26 to Pittsburgh’s 13 on two passes to Jack Snow and a 26-yard run by Wolski. But a ten-yard loss in a third and ten situation stalled the Irish attack, and Pitt took over on downs. The clock ran out with the score 27-7.

Tp very year has its epithet, and for -*-y college football, 1963 was the “Year of the Quarterback.” Across the nation, leather filled the air, passing records fell, and pro scouts sat in wide-eyed disbelief watching the display of offensive fireworks which characterized the 1963 season.
Every section, every conference, had its passing wizard. The Deep South continued to play its own maverick hell-for-leather type of football, and its super-quarterbacks were many; among the most prominent were Billy Lothridge of Georgia Tech, George Mira of Miami, Joe Namath of Alabama, and Larry Rakestraw of Georgia.
The West contributed Pete Beat-hard of Southern California, Terry Isaacson of the Air Force Academy, and Craig Morton of California to the select group. And the Southwest had “play-genius” Don Trull — a twenty-one-year-old Baylor senior who called an astounding twenty audibles per game at the line of scrimmage.
In a radical departure from the current trend, the Midwest continued to play comparatively conservative football. With the exception of Tommy Myers of Northwestern, Ron Di-Gravio of Purdue, and George Bork of Northern Illinois, most quarterbacks were content to play grind-it-out, Woody Hayes football.
In the East, however, the picture was different. At Pittsburgh, Chancellor Litchfield ordered Coach John Michelosen to open up the offense; with Fred Mazurek running the attack, the result — as Pitt publicist Beano Cook put it — was “the greatest reversal of form since Dublin elected a Jewish mayor.” In the Atlantic Coast Conference, Maryland’s Dick Shiner was the primary headache for opposing linebackers and safetymen. But at the Naval Academy, the Middies
possessed the greatest wizard of them all in Roger Thomas Staubach — Navy’s “one man army,” Heisman Trophy winner, and the 1963 College Sports Editors’ Player of the Year.
Some quarterbacks may have been better percentage passers in 1963, but none was a better scrambler. If any one of his talents was pre-eminent, it was Staubach’s ability to elude onrushing linemen (see cut), maneuver in the least-expected directions, and somehow pick out — and hit — his receivers in the defensive secondary. Oftentimes the result was peculiarly impressive: a thirty-six-yard pass netted a mere six yards.
At the outset of the 1963 season, most remembered Roger Staubach as the spunky sophomore who singlehandedly destroyed Army the year before. It was said that Staubach was a good quarterback, but not the caliber of Mira or Myers, who were tabbed as the best in preseason polls. His critics pointed to Navy’s weak schedule, and added that spectacular efforts would be less regarded because the Naval Academy played lowly VMI and William and Mary. Michigan, Pittsburgh, and Notre Dame, they insisted, would offer the supreme tests for Jolly Roger.
Happily for Staubach, and unhappily for the opposition, Roger concocted his own brand of backfield magic, and silenced the unbelievers as Navy torpedoed all its opponents except SMU.
As Navy’s fortunes rose, accolades mounted. VMI Coach John McKenna said: “Reviewing Navy’s movies has been like watching horror films. There’s just no way to stop Roger Staubach.” At Ann Arbor, Bump Eliot — after watching Staubach run and pass for 307 yards against the Wolverines — could only mum
ble: “He’s the greatest I've ever seen.”
When Navy met previously undefeated Pitt at Annapolis in a battle for the Lambert Trophy, Staubach was faced with the most difficult test of his career. It was a meeting of Atlantic giants: Pitt had Paul Martha and its heralded “razzle-dazzle”; Navy had Staubach and a quick but light line. Needless to say, the difference was simply Roger Staubach; the Middies bagged the Panthers, 24-12, as Staubach completed 14 of 19 passes for 168 yards against a usually stingy Panther secondary. Excluding his performance against Army the previous year, it was perhaps Staubach’s finest hour.
It would appear that Staubach is a one-man show, yet he is not. As a quarterback, he is an intelligent signal caller, and wisely takes advantage of such power runners as Johnny Sai and Pat Donnelly when a Navy drive is under way. Unlike others, notably Hal Bedsole of USC, Staubach at no time lets cockiness be a substitute for confidence. Off the field, he is a soft-spoken, introspective man, and a devout Catholic.
Few realize it, but football is not Staubach’s only forte. At Annapolis last year, he won a basketball letter and earned the distinction of holding Army’s top sophomore eager to one field goal in the Army-Navy game. Staubach also won a baseball monogram; during the season, he hit .420 in 15 games, and in Eastern League play, he hit .481.
For us at Notre Dame who watched Jolly Roger pick apart the Irish defenses, there was a special irony: here was a boy who wanted' to come to Notre Dame, but could not and hence did not. It’s a sad thought indeed.

Heartbreak
Tp ast Lansing, Michigan, November 16 — Notre Dame’s still-fighting Irish played their finest defensive game of the season, but lost 12-7 to Michigan State on a gamebreaking 85-yard run by Sherman Lewis with only minutes to play. Lewis' electrifying run epitomized Notre Dame’s frustration: victory, like Lewis, was always within reach but never firmly in hand.
The Irish line was never sterner, as it smothered the battering thrusts of Roger Lopes and Dewey Lincoln, and — with a single exception — contained the speed of Lewis; Spartan backs were able to gain only 138 yards in 45 carries, Lewis' run excepted. State’s passing attack proved completely futile, with one completion in eight attempts for no net yards. Tom Longo and Tommy MacDonald each intercepted a wayward Spartan aerial; MacDonald's, a diving catch, was the fourteenth of his career, and set the all-time Notre Dame interception record.
But Notre Dame’s offense was never more impotent. Four times it failed to score from within the Michigan State 30-yard line, two of those times from within the 15. Not once did Notre Dame mount anything resembling a sustained drive. The Irish running backs, handicapped by the obvious lack of a passing attack, were fed like Christians to Michigan State’s lion-like line.
Early in the first quarter. Dan McGinn’s punt put the
Spartans deep in their own territory, Sherman Lewis fum
bled, and George Bednar recovered for Notre Dame on the MSU 15. Fullback Joe Kantor drove up the middle for
four yards, and then Sandy Bonvechio sent Denny Phillips on a sweep of right end. Phillips was sprung by Jim Car-roll’s devastating block on Dewey Lincoln, and went into the end zone standing up. Ken Ivan’s placement was good.
On its next series from scrimmage, Michigan State netted nothing on three line plunges, and was forced to
but two plays later Bobich picked off a Bonvechio pass and returned it four yards to his own 27.
MSU quarterback Dick Proebstle, after being thrown for a two-yard loss by Goberville, decided to throw. MacDonald intercepted and was tackled immediately at the Spartan 38-yard line. Four plays netted the Irish only seven yards, and Michigan State took over on downs.
The Spartans scored their first touchdown after Dewey Lincoln returned McGinn’s punt from the Notre Dame 40 to the 26. Linebacker Tom Kostelnik knocked down Proebstle’s pass on the next play, but Lopes ran left end for ten yards and a first down. Lewis got 13 yards off left end, then three more at right end for the score. Michigan State chose to try a two-point conversion, but it failed and Notre Dame led 7-6 at the half.
The third quarter found both teams running plays at the middle of their opponent’s line; neither team was deceived by these medieval tactics, however, and as a result neither gained significant yardage.
Notre Dame got an opportunity when Bobich was thrown for a loss while attempting to punt, and the Irish took over at the Spartans’ 18. Three running plays gained only five yards against the jammed defenses, and Bonvechio ’s fourth-and-five pass fell incomplete.
Again the Irish threatened, this time when Tom Longo
intercepted the pass of State’s second-team quarterback,
Dave McCormick, at the MSU 11. Farrell gained one up the middle, Duranko lost three at right end, and Bonvechio
carried for no gain on a rollout. Bonvechio’s fourth-down pass, intended for Farrell, went incomplete and out of bounds — while Dave Pivec motioned frantically, alone in the end zone.
One play later, Lewis turned right end, danced tan-talizingly away from Notre Dame tacklers in the second-
punt. The pass from center was bad, and Lou Bobich — pressured by Tom Goberville — barely managed an eight-
ary, and raced 85 yards for the game-breaking touchdown. Gone with him was Notre Dame’s chance to score a major

TVT ew York,, New York, November 28—The place seemed strange, an unlikely setting for college football:
Yankee Stadium’s towering stands dwarfed the players, and all but blocked the struggling sun from the playing field.	’
But the game seemed all too familiar, almost a capsule summary of the season: just as against Wisconsin, Purdue, and Michigan State, the Irish scored an early touchdown to take the lead, and the defense struggled valiantly to preserve it, but the opponent’s last-minute surge snatched victory from their grasp.
Syracuse scored with less than three and a half minutes left in the game, slamming the door on any Irish hopes for winning their third game of the long season.
First-quarter play was dominated by Syracuse, and it came oh-so-close, but never scored. The first time they had the ball, the Orange burrowed deep into Irish territory, but a 16-yard field goal attempt by John Paglio was wide. Syracuse again mounted an attack on the Irish goal, and Wally Mahle’s 32-yard naked reverse to the one-yard line made a score seem imminent. On the next play, Jim Nance barreled into a wall of green jerseys, fumbled, and Tom Longo pounced on the loose ball for Notre Dame.
The Irish were able to get out of the hole, only to lose the ball at the 36 on a fumble. Four quick plays later, Mahle passed six yards to Billy Hunter for a touchdown. Dick Arrington blocked the extra point try, and with 12:51 remaining in the half, Syracuse led, 6-0.
Irish offensive attempts were stymied once again, and Syracuse began a rapid movement toward Notre Dame’s end zone. Five fast first downs took the ball 74 yards to the Irish five, but Notre Dame’s back-to-the-wall defense held, and Paglio’s short field goal attempt was blocked by
All-American end Jim Kelly leaps high above a Pitt defender to make the 66th catch of his career.
Same old story
Bob Lehmann. The Irish had the ball on their own 14 with 4:15 in the half.	'
At this time, Notre Dame began an 86-yard touchdown advance, out of the left-field sunlight into the famous shadows of the south stands. Nick Rassas swept right end for twenty; Jim Kelly snagged a Sandy Bonvechio pass for 15, and Tommy MacDonald scooted around left end to the Syracuse twenty. On the next play, Bonvechio pitched to halfback Frank Budka, who in turn rifled a touchdown pass to Tommy MacDonald, alone in the end zone. Ken Ivan’s place-kick gave Notre Dame a 7-6 lead, and with 1:00 left in the half, the moans of subway alumni turned to cheers.
The third period saw the Irish offense smothered, and the Orange’s frustrated. Bill Pfeiffer halted one Syracuse drive with an interception on the Notre Dame 43. Tommy MacDonald snuffed another drive with the fifteenth aerial steal of his career. The seesaw quarter ended, and with a repetition likely in the fourth, Notre Dame’s 7-6 lead looked almost adequate.
Early-quarter play saw the pattern continue. After the Irish fumbled on their own 42, a subsequent Syracuse march fizzled when Lehmann intercepted on the 31. It happened again, when Dick Bowman fumbled after racing 33 yards to the Irish 25. Ken Maglicic corralled the ball on the twenty-two.
Then came the inevitable. Starting on the Notre Dame 47 Rich King, in a third and three situation, passed 12 yards to Bowman on the Irish 35. Here King dropped back once again, and with Irish linemen swarming around him, arched a pass to Mike Koski who raced into the end zone. A pass to Bowman added two points, and ended the scoring at 14-7. John Huarte tried to accomplish the impossible with “the bomb,” but the luck of the defense was not with the offense, and the clock ran out.

Football Review
December 6, 1963
Vor Coach Hugh Devore and his " staff, next season will bring ten major headaches: Wisconsin, Purdue, Air Force, UCLA, Stanford, Navy, Pittsburgh, Michigan State, Iowa, and Southern California.
Still, the over-all outlook for a successful season is encouraging. The reasons for this optimism are threefold: three of the teams on the ’64 Irish schedule lose their top quarterbacks — Purdue (Ron DiGravio), Air Force (Terry Isaacson), and USC (Pete Beathard); the Irish will have experience and depth at every position but quarterback; and Don Hogan, the leading ground gainer in 1962, will return.
Only five of Notre Dame’s top 13 players will be missing: All-American end Jim Kelly, who holds most Notre Dame records for pass-receiving, will be the most sorely missed; the team leaders in tackles, All-American Bob Lehmann and Bill Pfeiffer, will also be significant losses. Defensive halfback Tommy MacDonald — holder of the Notre Dame record for interceptions — and end Tom Goberville will graduate, too.
A significantly improved pair of ends, Jack Snow and Dave Pivec, will return for their senior year. Other ends who will be back include placekicking specialist Ken Ivan, juniors Phil Sheridan and Tom Talaga, and top freshman prospect Jim Lynch.
Twelve experienced interior linemen should bolster Irish chances considerably. John Atamian, who showed
Prospects for sixty-four
much promise late in the season, leads the guards; other veterans are Ken Maglicic, Mike Wadsworth, and Tom Sullivan. Starting tackle Dick Arrington and guard-tackle Jim Carroll will be back, along with John Meyer, Jim Snowden, Herb Seymour, and Mike Webster. Alan Page, 6-5, 250-pound freshman, may also be a factor.
Two experienced centers, Norm
Nicola and Tom Kostelnik, will be seniors next fall. Both are proven linebackers, and better-than-adequate blockers.
Lack of a consistently good quarterback could again prevent Notre Dame from having a successful season. John Huarte, Dan McGinn, Sandy Bonvechio, Bill Zloch, and Tom Longo all return, but none has significant game experience and none is a proven signal caller. Huarte is the best passer, Longo and Zloch the outstanding runners. Any of the group could win the job.
This season’s leading rusher, Bill Wolski, heads a deep and experienced halfback corps. Paul Costa will also return, as may in-and-out (of school) Ron Bliey; Joe Farrell will be a senior in 1964, and the return of a fully effective Don Hogan could make the halfback corps one of the country’s best. Fullbacks Joe Kantor, Pete Duranko, and Alan Loboy will lend considerable authority to the Irish running attack.
In the defensive secondary, Longo and Farrell will most likely replace top defenders MacDonald and Pfeiffer, and Pete Duranko may fill in for graduating Denny Phillips.
All things considered, and with the possibility of 25 monogram winners returning, 1964 may be a happier year than this past one for Notre Dame fans, both students and alumni.

FRESHMAN TEAM
!
(“This year’s squad is sound if not spectacular, and we feel that many of our team members will help the varsity during the next three seasons.” This is Coach George Sefcik’s resume of the 1963 freshman football ; team.
§ “Because the freshmen don’t play ' actual games,” he says, “it’s hard to । single out a first team.” But, he adds, several freshman players will figure in varsity plans for 1964.
Of the 49 squad members, nine are § ends. Here the top prospects are Dan ‘ Gibbs (205, Oak Park, Hl.), Don ; Gmitter (215, Pittsburgh), John Hor-‘ ney (195, Youngstown, Ohio), and 1 Jim Lynch (210, Lima, Ohio). Lynch - is the brother of this year’s Navy \ football captain.
Tackle Kevin Hardy of Oakland, the biggest man on the squad at 6-5 and 260, is among the top tackle can:	didates; others are Harry Alexander
:	(240, Wilmington, Del.), Tom Regner
(250, Kenosha, Wis.), Vic Paternos:	tro (245, Lyndhurst, N.J.), and Alan
Page (250, Canton, Ohio). Page has missed much of the season with a sprained ankle.
:	The leading guards are Tim Gor-
{	man (215, Hoboken, N.J.), Ron
■	Jeziorski (203, South Bend), Joe
i Marsico (210, River Forest, Hl.), and Dick Swatland (225, Stamford, Conn.).
:	The team’s only three centers are
John Lium (235, Bronx, N.Y.), Jim Kuritz (250, Milwaukee, Wis.), and Dave Magnotta (215, Albion, Mich.).
There are five freshman quarter:	backs. Tom Klump and Allen Sack
i are the tallest at 6-3, and both weigh 1	195; Klump is from Belleville, Hl.,
Sack from Boothwyn, Pa. The other signal callers are Ron Cimala (200, Beckley, W. Va.), Jim Kelly (195, Rutherford, N.J.), and Hugh O'Mal* :	ley (178, South Bend).
Defensive expert Larry Kuharich, son of the former Notre Dame coach, - heads a rich halfback unit; he is 5-11, 175 and now lives in New York City. The top runners of the group are Dave Odlaug (190, St. Paul, Minn.), 1 Tim Wengierski (190, River Forest, Hl.), and Joe Azzaro (190, Pitts-| burgh).
J Much-publicized Jim DiLullo, the '	6-0, 195-pound star from Fenwick
High School in Chicago, is among four freshman fullbacks; Bob Hagerty (240, Mingo Junction, Ohio), Larry I Conjar (200, Harrisburg, Pa.), and j Ernie Ray (235, Hobart, Ind.) are the i others.

Freshman Team

1.	Now that I’m a senior I have to start thinking about my future. Will vou manyr me?
Will vou be able to mve me all the things I crave—like pizza pie and chow mein?
3. Equitable—it’s Equitable.
It certainly is. It’s also fair, square, and just But I would still like to know the name of the company.
5. Can it be you never listen to my words? Is it possible that what I thought was a real relationship was but a romantic fantasy?
Is it conceivable that what I took to be a solid foundation was just a house of cards? That what I thought was a bright flame was merelv an emotional flicker?
2.	I’ve lined up a terrific job. There’s a choice of training programs, good starting salary, challenging work, and the chance to move up. That’s Equitable.
I agree—but what’s the company’s name?

4. We’re not communicating. 1 keep telling you it’s Equitable—and you keep asking what’s the name.
I keep agreeing your job sounds good. But you stubbornly refuse to tell me who you’re going to work for.
6. I’d hate to lose you, but at least I’ll still have my job with Equitable—The Equitable Life Assurance Society’ of the United States.
Oh, The Equitable.
Why didn’t you say so? We’ll have a June wedding.
