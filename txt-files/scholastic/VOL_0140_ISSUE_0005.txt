Made in Heaven 
The mothers ofthe bride were the worst. Mauve-clad matrons with bad haircuts and worse makeup who would invade the kitchen every five minutes to complain about the bill or complain about the DJ or complain about the flowers or just to cry over the dishes. Everything had to be just right, or the whole thing would be a failure. My mother's catering business taught me a lot. Like how to wash 200 plates in half an hour and how 300-pound steelworkers react when you spill coffee on their lap. But mostly it taught me about wedding recep­tions. Everything about wedding receptions: when to cut the cake, when the dancing starts, the fact that every DJ plays "That Old Time Rock and Roll" twice at every wed­ding and, of course, how neurotic mothers of the bride can be if everything isn.'t per­fect. My experiences with weddings turned me off to the whole thing (I'll be joining the seminary next semester). But lots of Notre Dame graduates haven't had my experience and every year they.head willy-nilly into the hell that is the wedding reception. Kate Jacques reports on the trend ofNotre Dame graduates who marry each other on page 16. And while we're on the subject of love 
and marriage, see Lisa Virani's story about current Notre Dame students who have to juggle textbooks and diapers. That one starts on page 20.

Keeping the Ice Nice 

For 10 years Pat Klaybor has worked as a maintenance assistant atthe Joyce Center, but most Notre Dame hockey fans know him sim­ply as "that Zamboni guy." Klaybor, a 34­year-old South Bendnative, wheels gracefully around the rink in between periods at hockey games. Scholastic sat down with Klaybor to discuss the finer points of the Zamboni and why hockey players are always fighting. 
How did you get into the Zamboni busi­ness? Igotthejobthroughmybackgroundinheating and air-conditioning. Plus, I like working on the Zamboni. It keeps you on your heels. 
Do you know where the word "Zamboni" came from? Zamboni is actually the last name of the guy who invented it: Mr. Frank J. Zamboni. 
How does the Zamboni work? 
When it goes out you lower the conditioner, the back end of it, which cuts and scrapes the ice to give it a smooth surface. All this time you're laying water down, which fills in the skate groves that the players have made with their skates during the game. 
Do you need a license to drive it? 
No, you don't need a license, just a lot of hands-on experience. I was driving the zamboni within the first year I was here, probably three months after I started. 
How fast can the Zamboni go? 
I thinkthe top speed is somewhere between 30 and 35 miles per hour. You could actually take it out on the road if you wanted to.

Have you ever crashed the Zamboni? I've never actually crashed the Zamboni, but once during a game I hit a goal peg that had frozen solid into the ice. 
Have you ever done any donuts out on the ite with the Zamboni? No, no, no. My boss wouldn't go for that. But maybe on mylast day ... I'll do a couple 360s. 
How would you describe the hockey play-· ers you see? Hockey players have to have a little bit of craziness and daring behind them, they're always lookingfor achallengeinlife.... Idon'r think there are too many cheerleadertypes out there. If you get banged up, so be it. 

Why are hockey players always fighting? I just think competition is raised on every level, so that from high school, to college, to the NHL ... guys want so much more to win. 
Ifyou had your choice of seeing any person 
ride the Zamboni, who would you choose? 
Maybe we should do someone good looking, like Kathy Ireland. My wife wouldn't mind if I said that, she's got a good sense of humor. Well, no, actually let's do Joe Montana in­stead ofKathy-Imight get afow catcalls for that. · · · -ZacKulsrud

The university's donors seem to be unaware of the biggest issues facing campus 
BY Scorr CULLEN 
t was barely noticeable on a gorgeous

I
Saturday at the stadium, and most of the crowd was too wrapped up watching a victory over Michigan to take notice, but 
there it was. Soaring high above the crowd in the crystal clear afternoon sky was a small airplane toting behind it a banner 
proclaiming "ND-Dump Sen. Bill Brad­ley." A few people around me groaned, others were moved enough to mutter, "shut up." Quite a few did not notice or care. But there was ageneral apathy toward this state­
ment. 
In the week that followed, it came to light that the banner was paid for by .the Notre Dame Alumni Right to Life group, an orga­nization that calls for the university to re­move Bradley from his position teaching a one-credit government course this semes­ter; The moment highlighted a sharp dispar­ity between Notre Dame students of the past and present. 
No orie doubts the love or loyalty of Notre Dame's alumni community. They pay for the buildings we work and study in, they flock back on football weekends and they excitedly stop by the dorms to tell you theylivedinyourroomin 1964. Theideaof the Notre Dame family cannot be under­stood without an appreciation of this com­munity of alumni who want nothing more than to see Notre Danie thrive and grow. 
But having said that, there is a: gap be­tween the alumni and the current student body at Notre Dame. The most obvious change is that women now attend the uni­versity. But it is also a simple fact ofnature that generations often fail to understand one another. 
The students oftoday have come ofage i~ a world shaped by trends such as the infor­mation explosion. It stands to reason that someone who ·graduated in the· 1950s is going to share neither our experiences nor our worldview. 
And while our current campus is by no means a model of multiculturalism, it is light years ahead of where it was 30 years ago in terms ofdiversity. The fact is that the older alumni, the ones who've been enjoy­ing success the longest, accruing the re­sources to reinvest in our university, tend to be white, male and fairly conservative. 
This presents a difficult· situation for a university trying to come to grips with an evolving identity. Notre Dame is more di­verse than it ever has been. Even so, the campus is striving to come to grips with the needs of its minority and homosexual stu­dents and to improve relations between genders. Do alumni realize these issues even exist? 
Certainly our alumni wish to see a Notre Dame that continues to develop in positive ways and will continue to offer their help­ing hands and dollars in the years ahead. After all, they will provide the support that will make the further development of this university possible. 
But one must wonder if the people who knew a university so different from our own and shared such a different experience here can truly understand what the Notre Dame of tomorrow needs from its alumni. 
Only those who are here now can truly give an idea of what Notre Dame is today. A common criticism of th~ university is that the administration fails to listen to the 
student voice. While increased dialogue on the state of Notre Dame is necessary be­tween students and admistration, it makes sense that the alumni should also take part in such a discussion. All three entities are crucial parts of our community. 
It only makes sense that all three should

,, dents. They discuss alcohol, driving privi­leges and finally, parietals. Though most 
students follow the 12 a.m. weeknights, 2 
a.m. weekends and 10 a.m. morning rules, 
many students question their purpose. 
As a result of student concerns about parietals and the µifferent ways they are 
enforced among dorms, the Residence Life 
Committee ofthe Student Senate has formed 
two task forces to research the issue, the 
parietals subcommittee and the dorm incon­sistencies subcommittee. 
Sophomore Student Senator Susan Gloss 
heads the parietals subcommittee. "We want to do a lot of research and know how stu­dents feel before we take any action, and 
also so we know what actions to take," she says. According to Gloss, two task forces were created in the senate because both parietals and dorm inconsistencies required more research and work than the smaller issues that the Residence Life Committee usually deals with. 
The parietals subcommittee wants to cre­ate a survey to get information from stu­dents about what they would like to change. The senate would distribute surveys through the Hall Presidents' Council or e-mail. 

"We just want people to know there are different options," Gloss says. She suggests extending parietals to 3 a.m. Parties would still end at 2 a.m., but the last hour would be a quiet hour in order to extend conversation and interaction. "This is for those who op­pose extending parietals because they want to sleep, but these quiet hours would allevi­ate this problem," she says. 
Junior Student Senator Krista Guziec heads the dorm inconsistencies subcommit­tee. Although the subcommittee is still in the preliminary process of deciding how to handle the issue, Guziec says, "We, would like to suggest each dorm have a handbook of rules detailing the specific fines and ser­vices. We feel that this would alleviate some of the miscommunication." The sub­committee will research the way different dorms enforce parietals and consult with the_ university's Residence Life Office about university policies on how the dorms should be run. According to Guziec, the committee wants to work with the university's judicial 
board to make certain that each dorm has its own effective judicial board. 
Guziec adds that the committee expects it to be difficult to approach rectors about the issue. "Wehopetosendalettertotherectors at their meeting with some of our positive suggestions on how to run the dorms bet­ter," she says. 
Rectors and RAs have had different reac­tions to the issues that the subcomittees are examining. "I'm glad each hall has some leeway to respond to violations that are still within bounds of regulation," Dillon Hall rector Father Paul_Doyle says. "Ihandle it as common sense dictates. I like to talk about the reason for an ideal and then hold that ideal up. We are trying to establish [a] Christian community." 
Lyons Hall Rector Sister Kathleen Beatty has found that the parietal system helps students. "Parietals are about privacy, clos­ing down and letting people have their own space," she says. 
Pasquerilla East Rector Mary Ann Mu~ninghoff agrees. "The perception is that many students dislike parietals, and I sim­ply wonder about that as they make their way through the university," she says. "I really work to have students choose to fol­low the guidelines they know are there." She believes parietals quiet down the halls and give students an opportunity to end their social engagements. 
But not all students feel they benefit from the rules. RA Tre , Gaither says students constantly ask him about the purpose be-

hind parietals. 
"It has its positives and negatives," he says. "I think the intent is good. It's for a quiet time in the dorm. It can be a negative, though, for example when people are watch­ing a movie." He feels that dorms are for communal living and that most "people really respect the rule. They might not like it, but they understand it's something they have to follow," he says. Unless the latest committees' proposals pass, they will have to follow them for some time to come. D

A Facelift for Hesburgh 
From the Pit to Father Hesburgh' s office, the' brare is looking at 

renovations by 2000 
BY JAKE MOONEY
C.·
oeducation. The rebuilt stadium. A 
new university president. Changes 

have been abundanton campus over the past 35 years. 
But one thing has remained the same: the Hesburgh library, constructed in 1963. The library has never been renovated, and until three years ago still held much ofits original furniture. 
The next few years, though, will be far moreeventfulforthelibrary. The university has hired a Boston architecture firm to evalu­ate the building and, with the help of stu­dents and faculty, prepare a plan for a reno­vation tentatively slated to begin in the year 2000. 
Architects from Shepley, Bullfinch, Richardson, and Abbot were on campus over fall break to meet with the library's space planning committee and to ask groups of graduate students what the library could do to better serve them. In mid-November the architects will return to campus to hold similar discussions with undergraduates. 
According to Director of Libraries Jenni­fer Younger, who is also chair.of the space planning committee, the project is still in its early stages. The committee's present goal is to find out as much as possible about library. users' needs. "We 're getting input

from students of all kinds as well as faculty and people around campus," she says. 
Marsha Stevenson, head of reference at the library and another member of the plan­ning committee, is working with student organizations to plan the focus groups that will meet with the architects. "We're really just trying to get ideas at this point," she says, stressing that the groups are loosely structured to encourage discussion. She also points out that the library's website includes a page which contains information on the .renovation .and allows students to send in comments or suggestions. 
Stevenson says that the discussions with graduate students yielded a variety of ideas that led planners to a conclusion. "We need to provide a variety of study spaces," she says, "Inthis relatively small group ofpeople they were all over the place on what they like for studying." 
Stevenson tells of one student who typi­cally goes to the library to pick up what he needs to study and then leaves for Border's book store for the night. "Academic librar­ies like this one could learn a lot from good public· libraries and bookstores, where they've made an effort to have a warm,. welcoming environment where people want to spend time," she says. 
Changes toward this end could be as ex­tensive as renovating the building from top 
OCTOBER 29, 1998 
to bottom or as simple as putting carpeting on the first or second floor. Many of these decisions will be based on the amount of money available for the renovation. After the architects complete a master plan at the end ofthe spring semester, they will present it to the university, which will either ap­prove it or recommend changes. 
"We 're not working with a strict budget at this point, so we don't really know what is possible," Stevenson says. 
One thing that is already certain is that the renovation will not involve any changes to the building's exterior. The "Touchdown Jesus" mosaic will remain the same, and there are no plans to build any additions to the current library. Younger says, though, that planners will review mechanical sys­tems like heating and air-conditioning. Over 35 years, "systems just basically wear out," she says. 
Whatever changes do occur, planners hope to avoid major interruptions to library ser­vice. "It is our belief that we will keep library services open," Younger says. 
Stevenson agrees, but worries that the renovation will be more disruptive than the recent installation of sprinkler systems, which workers completed mostly during the hours the. building was closed to stu­dents. Depending on the scale ofthe renova­tion, parts of the library could close tempo­rarily. "We'll probably go through an un~ comfortable spell," she says. 
Whether the changes to the library are worth that discomfort depends largely on the information that the· planners receive from students. Student Government Vice President Andrea Selak is impressed with the efforts to solicit that information. "They really want to get a lot of student opinion," she says. "They're going out of their way." 
Selak has already spread word of the No­vember focus groups at student government meetings, and is in the process of finding students to participate in the groups. "We're really happy that they've honored our request to have input," she says. "The library has huge potential. So many students use that space, and there's a lot that can be dorie to make it 
more user-friendly."  0

semester, heating up competition for the bookstore 
purchase textbooks, as well as all other merchandise. Students can purchase books online with a credit card or reserve them with payment at the bookstore. Bookstore director Jim O'Connor says that the site's directory of books is updated weekly, and then daily as the end of the semester ap­proaches. "We're going to start advertising it more towards the end of this semester," O'Connor says. "Some students ordered their books online for this semester -that was the trial period. The new bookstore will have the facilities to handle the service even more effectively." 
But the bookstore's website offers the same prices as the bookstore itself, and students will not be able to deal directly with each other like they will on the Student Senate's website. In the battle for shares of the used book market the student govern­ment website seems to hold the advantage considering the student-negotiated prices. 
0 'Connor disagrees. "We've done a very effective job in the last year of increasing the availability of used books -availabil­ity is up 38 percent," he says. As for book pricing, O'Connor is similarly confident in the bookstore's methods. "I think our books are appropriately priced," he says, adding that the bookstore's used-book buyback pro­gram, with sufficient development, will be able to save students more money. 0 'Connor does not feel that the student government's online used bookstore will hurt the bookstore's business. 
Both alternatives are potential money­savers for Notre Daine students. But the wild card in this mix may be the professors. When professors are timely in submitting their lists of required books for the follow­ing semester, the bookstore is able to offer students 50 percent off of the original price of used books. 
O'Connor says that the faculty has done well recently in submitting their lists on time, but the Student Senate thinks other­wise. "A lot of professors just don't send in their lists soon enough for the discount to be offered," Mamak says, adding that a pros posal is currently being drafted calling for better buyback compensation for students. "We sent a letter to the college deans re­questing that the lists are submitted in a more timely manner." 
Whatever the outcome, with this increased competition for booksales, students may have a little more spending cash next semes­ter, and they may never have to see the · inside of the bookstore again. D

Welcome back, readers. The Gipp hopes you all had a relaxing break, and didn't get knocked on the head by any fish, like that guy in the Gipp's section during the Army game. The Gipp hopes that his last column had at least some 
small part in inspiring the large numbers of foot­ball fans who brought various wildlife speci­mens to the stadium. 
In keeping with his job as a responsible campus role model, the Gipp also wantsJ~ mention to those mischief-minded stu­dents that somebody one-upped them all by tossing horse manure. Not that the Gipp is try­ing to-encourage that kind of thing. 
Curiously, No Missionary Position 

While the Gipp is dwelling on past glo­ries, he wants to update you on a tale he told last time. When the Gipp exposed the infir­mary for blatantly flouting the university's Catholic character by encouraging students to use their beds for sexual activity, he was sure there would be an outcry ofindignation from Right Reason and the rest of Notre Army game. 

It all started when a female fan spotted one of the male cheerleaders looking at her throughout the first half. After confirming with her friends that he was indeed making eyes at her, she shrugged her shoulders as if to ask, "Who, me?" 
· Big mistake. In front of God, people's mothers and everyone else in the stadium, the guy started rubbing himself in an impure manner, all while maintaining eye contact with the poor fan. 
The Gipp is trying his hardest to find something about this story that doesn't sicken him. He'll let you kn_ow if he comes 
r up with anything. 
r I
n the meantime, readers, try not to let Dame's Army of God. Perhaps the Gipp overestimated their dedication to Catholic teaching. Perhaps they will find this story more interesting. 
One Gipp tipper recently visited the infirmary looking for cold relief, not advice 
on how· to spend a Saturday night. But advice was what she got. Inside a pamphlet on back pain, under the heading "Sex," she read of "two possible positions -both partners on their sides facing the same di­rection (front to back), or the person with back trouble lying on his or her back with the other partner on top." · 
Thanks to our sniffling friend, we now know that Hinduism is not the only religion with a sex manual. Catholicism has its own Kama Sutra. It's available in the infirmary, and it's called "Oh, My Aching Back!" 
Library Renovation Idea: Lap Dance Room 

This next story comes from a tipper who was perusing the library's website, presum­ably because he was bored out of his mind by The Observer's constant rehashing of eight-month-old Scholastic stories. Our friend found the site much more exciting than usual, though, and not just because of his book fetish. 
For a few brief, shining moments, the page contained a link to an internet porn site. The link was quickly removed, but it stayed up long enough for library aficiona­dos to broaden their horizons a bit. 
The Gipp can't help but wonderifthe link should have stayed. Anyone spending too much time looking at the library home page could use a little www.nastygirls.com. 
Is That A Bullhorn in Your Pocket? 

Someone should have told the men's cheerleading squad about the library's web­site. It might have helped relieve the tension that led to some strange behavior during the 
the cold weather get you down. The Gipp 
knows it's a bummer when you have to stop wearing that CBLD T-shirt for the winter. But look on the bright side. In just a few weeks it will be time once again for Darners to engage in that most magical of campus rituals: throwing chunks of ice at the windows of each other's dorms. D

GHOSTSTORIES 



BAJS SPIRJJS GOBLINS AW~VWW? 
W... TAP,,. J)jp W!I'CHES SHADOWS 
As two brave souls found out, the dead are alive and dwell at Notre Dame 
BY ZAc KULsRUD 

few weeks ago Jim Yannakopoulos and I resolved to find out once and for all whether the legendary Ghost of Washington Hall was fact or fiction. We entered Washington Hall at 9:00 p.m. and vowed not to leave the building until either we saw the ghost or heard the Basilica bells ring at 9:00 a.m. the next day. What I have submitted is a factual journal of our stay, and I believe it will ultimately be judged by history as all accounts of ghosts are, that is, as fiction until the account resurfaces with a new generation, whereby it is taken as fact. 
Q; i 5 p.m. 

Jim talks to wandering theater students while I review a copy of the "Ghost File" that I had acquired earlier in the day from Building Manager Tom Barkes. Together we piece together the roots of the ghost story: 
It was around the end of December 1920, and the campus was still mourning the death of George Gipp, who had died days before of a streptococcic throat infection. At the· time Washington Hall housed nine student­professors, among them Clarence Manion, 
14 SCHOLASTIC

the Ghost's first victim. As he was getting, ready for bed one evening, he heard the sound of a French horn accompanied by an eerie moaning. As a 1921 Dome article put it, the sound Manion heard was "a prodi­gious blast," the trumpet's note a perfect B­flat. 
For the next four months, Manion and the otherresidents heard the blastalmostnightly, and their futile efforts to find the crafty prankster or architectural nuance in Wash­ington Hall (both were initially suspected to have caused the sounds) only served to irritate the ghost. Strange events began to precede the noises: doors slammed, people felt cold hands on their backs as they went upstairs and unidentified voices would shriek at the earliest of hours. 
The story spread around campus and cre­ated quite an uproar, causing dozens of curious students to stay in Washington Hall overnight in hopes of seeing the ghost or locating the prankster. Visitors witnessed the same strange events, but no one could find an explanation. That is, until ... Pio E. Montenegro confessed to the Dome that he had seen from his room in Science Hall (LaFortune), "a stalwart figure mounted · upon a beautiful white charger galloping up the steps of the hall and through the front entrance." The figure, Montenegro insisted, was the Gipp's ghost. 
Why the Gipp? On a cold night in Novem­ber of 1920, the Gipp had been out carous­ing and failed to come back before his dorm, SaintEdward'sHall, was locked. The Gipp, not wanting to be caught breaking his dorm's curfew, slept on tli.e back steps of Washing­ton Hall that night, where he contracted the virus that later killed him. 
10:00 p.m. 
I wander into the costume room and en­counter Roger Allee, night custodian of Washington Hall, who tells me of his en­counter with the ghost three years ago. Allee had no knowledge of the ghost when he began working three years ago, but it didn't take him long to find out firsthand; One night Allee noticed that the lights were flickering outside of the hall and that the elevator began to move up and down on its own. Allee was shaken, but not scared ­yet 
Later that night, while mopping in the third floor lab theater, he noticed a shadow moving on the wall in front of him. 
Allee said to the monstrous shadow, "Lis­ten, sir, if this is your place, I'll just stay out 
OCTOBER 29, 1998 

of your way. I only want to keep my job ... and Casper the ghost was my favorite pro­gram as a kid. I like ghosts." Allee swal­lowed hard and turned around, but there was nothing there. Allee is now sure it was the ghost of the Gipp. 
i 0: 2 i p.m. 

We move into the main auditorium and onto center stage. Jim suggests we per­form a seance, and I quickly admonish him, relating to him this story that I had heard from junior theater major Laurie Lodewyck: 
A number of years ago some theater students sneaked into Washington Hall and began using a Oujia board on center stage. They brought candles, which eerily cast their light on the board as it spelled out, "SG, SG, SG, GET OUT GET OUT." The students flipped and began running for the exits, and as they exited they saw a security guard (SG) running toward the building. 
The students now credit the ghost for saving them. 
i 0:45 p.m. 

Jim talks to junior theater major Sean Dwyer who tells him to look for a bat flying in the main auditorium. "The bat flies around the theater sometimes before a show, and if it does it's a good luck charm," Dwyer says. Jim insists that this is proof that we need not fear the ghost, even if it exists, because it's a good luck ghost. I again chide Jim and tell him that not all encounters with the ghost have been pleasant. 
In addition to the Gipp, another spirit resides in the uppermost regions ofthe build­ing. The ghost is the restless spirit of a steeplejack who fell from his construction perch to his death in 1886. The ghost is blamed for several strange events. Four years ago, Jeff Dodson '96 was pushed by invisible hands to within inches ofhis death. while working on an overhead light fixture in the main auditorium. Cherry pickers and ladders have inexplicably been shaken and even toppled within the auditorium. Also, a longtime housekeeper of Washington Hall has said that she regularly heard a violent crashing sound from the center stage area in the early hours of the morning. 

As we sit on center stage, the lights sud­denly dim and we hear footsteps. I grab my wooden stake, silver cross and garlic. Jim asks me what the hell is going on and what the milky shade is that we see coming towards us from the rows of seats. I say a rosary. 
"Um, excuse me, you guys were sup­posed to be out of here at 11 :00. The building's closed now." I thank the girl holding the building key as Jim and I sheep­ishly head for the exit. 
"Are you sure you 're not the ghost?" Jim says as we're leaving, but when we tum to face her she is gone. 0 
CREEPING AROUND. No one in recent history has claimed to have seen the ghost, but many theater students and visitors swear they feel its presence. 



·s Rebecca Christensen stood at atten­tion for routine band inspection last October, she expected alumni to try to 
·makeherlaughorlosehercomposureoButher boyfriend and 1997 graduate Marcus Curl had a different idea. As Christensen's eyes focused forward, Curl presented her with an 
engagement ring and proposal. 
The Noems believe that reli­
gion holds an enriching position 
in their relationship. It allowed 
them to become more comfort­
able with each other. "I was as 
comfortable goil).g to a dance 
with him as I was praying with 
him," she says. 
Still others attribute alumni 
marriages to the distinct nature 
of the courting process that oc­
curs at Notre Dame. "[The stu­
dents] may have differences on 
the intellectual level that encour­
age relationships because it en­
courages discussion," Lennon says. "That's what courting is ­. you're trying to find out what 
your likes and dislikes are." 

Scenes ending with a ring and a guy on bended knee are com­mon at colleges across the na­tion, and Notre Dame is no different. So it's no surprise that many alumni get married each year. What's striking is the number of alumni who marry other Notre Dame alumni. 
According to Lucy Sears of the Techni­cal Group in the Development Office, 17,430 out of the total 40,515 active alumniwho. have graduated since Notre Dame went coed are married. Of these 6,490 are married to other Notre Dame graduates. 
l 
NotreD~mealumni who marry each other also seem to defy the national divorce sta­tistics. According to the United States Cen­sus Bureau, in 1997, 19.3 million adults, or nearly 10 percent of the entire population were divorced. But the number of Notre Dame alumni who register as divorced, 1,526 people, account for only 1.6 percent of those registered with the alumni office. There are many theories on why Notrel Dame alumni tend to marry each other and why their marriages are generally more 
successful than the national average. The similar value system and Catholic charac­ter that Notre Dame fosters is a common explanation. "I think tl_le aspect of tradition and the Catholic background have some­thing to do with it," Charles Lennon, direc­tor of the Alumni Association, says. "It certainly gives a person the opportunity to stretch in their religion." 
Senior Alex Scheidler says Catholicism

who I probably would have sifted out," she says. Her husband Larry agrees. "Like minds are drawn together," he says. "Those who make similar choices have similar pur­poses." 
The Williams' analysis introduces an and its development at Notre Dame played a pivotal role in his engagement with 1998 graduate Tamara LaBrecque. "You come in with the same tradition of Catholicism but • that is picked up and cradled. They [the university] put it in your hands," Scheidler says, citing the prevalence of the celebra­tion ofMass as one way in which the univer­sity cradles Catholicism. 
Many alumni couples also cite similar values as part of the initial attraction draw­ing them together. Stacey Stough N oem and her husband Josh, both 1998 graduates, agree that a common value system was an · important aspect in their relationship. "It was shocking to see how his values were the same a.s my family's," Stacey says. "It was our strong faith and making decisions from that value system [that made us so compat­ible]." 
Moira Donahoe Schrader, who graduated in 1997, feels that living on campus helps. The dorm atmosphere, as op­posed to other schools where students move off 
man year, allows people to 
meet and socialize, she says. 
Laura Williams, a 1985 graduate, views the appli­cation process itself as influential in 

important point. Beyond the common thread of sharing an alma mater, there is a notice­able trend in students who are involved in the same campus activities dating and mar­rying each other. One ofthe leading groups on campus for engagements and marriages is the Folk Choir. "We've had marriages in the Folk Choir dating back as far as 1984," Steve Warner, director of the Folk Choir says. "We joke around now that we think it is in the water." The collaboration that oc­curs in an intense environment such as the Folk Choir fosters these relationships, Warner believes. The high number of couples in the organization does not sur-

prise him because they work together side by side, week after week, giving students the opportunity to really get to know each other. 
Lennon agrees. "It would make sense because ofthe tradition ofstudents here that those structures that have a coed type of practice and performance schedule may equate to their social life," he says. 
Scheidler, who met his fiancee in the Folk Choir, believes that the organization's religious nature has an effect. The time the choir spends on tour singing together is a time of ministering, he says. He describes how the development of a person's faith coincides with that ofthe other mem­bers of the group. "We'd sing on tour and therefore get a chance to pray together. You all be­come vulnerable to­gether," he explains. 
Schrader and her husband Jonathan, a 1996 graduate, also met through the Folk Choir. Schrader believes the religious aspect of the organization pro­vides a common thread for the members. "I think [religion and faith] lead to communication 
and sharing that fosters re­lationships," she says. 

The folk choir isn't the only group at Notre Dame that cultivates relationships. The marching band is an­other example. Although the Curls recognize the spiritual im­portance of their relationship, they feel the amount of time they spent together in band and the respect they had for the other's work played the most sig­nificant roles in their bur­
Marcus Curl '97 geoning relationship. "In , band, you're spending two Rebecca Christensen 98 hoursofyourdaytogether, 
Lany Williams '85 Laura Lee '85 
every day," Marcus Curl says. The band 
became more than just a club for the couple. 
It formed their social lives as well, since 
they found common friendships with other 
members of the band. 
The appreciation that each had for the 
other's dedication also played a meaningful 
part in their relationship. "It was more than 
just a passion for music, but [a connection] 
with people who are willing to work hard," 
Rebecca says. 
There are also a fair number of couples who were once Notre Dame varsity athletes. Lennon sees more of these couples dating than actually marrying, but it surprises him -that more athletes don't date each other.

Bringing Up 
Baby 

Raising a child adds new challenges to the already hectic schedule ofNotre Dame students 
BY LISA VIRANIFootball Saturdays, classes, parties and papers. Does this hectic schedule sound familiar? Now add 2 a.m. feedings, visits to the pediatrician and con­stant parental supervision to the picture. Adrienne Noelle and Maria Perez Balladares have. The two juniors are full­time Notre Dame students with children of their own. Noelle, a French, fine arts and psychol­ogy triple major, is the single mother of Bethany, seven, whose father died about a year after her birth: Perez Balladares, a finance major, married last year and is the mother of one-yearold0 lsabella. Manymay wonder how parents deal with the demands of college life while raising a child at the same time. "I just do it," Noelle says. "I am not sure exactly how.... The details and the everyday bits of life are a blur." Not only does Noelle successfully man­age her crazy schedule; she does it without a support system ofother student parents. "I don't know anyone else with a child," Perez Balladares says. "It would be nice to be able to invite another family over for dinner once in a while." In addition to lacking access to a network of student parents, Noelle feels alienated from her classmates. "I feel like the prover­bial Hester Prynne ofthe Notre Dame fam­ily," she says. Noelle thinks the lack of a support system for students with families is a result of a contradiction that exists be­tween the university's pro-life stance and its treatment ofthe students and community members who actually choose life. · "It is wonderful that Notre Dame Right to Life Club members are giving a baby shower foranexpectantmotherinHannah'sHouse," (a house in Mishawaka for women who are pregnant and choose to keep their baby)

Noelle says. "But where will all the students be in five years when the same woman requires help in finding a decent paying job so that she may support her family?" 
She feels that despite initial support, stu­dents with children are quickly forgotten about. "Nobody wonders what happens when the Notre Dame students graduate and no one is bringing Pampers anymore," she says. 
Noelle suggests that the university de­velop a student-parent program. "Notre Dame needs more resources for parents like the student-parent programs offered at UC­Berkeley," she says, referring to the Student Parent Project which is sponsored by UC­Berkeley's Women's Resource Center. The program supports student parents through several projects, such as a co-op childcare exchange, a student-parent orientation class and a Parent Locator program that will lend beepers to parents so that schools and daycare centers can contact them while they are on campus. 
Although there is no such organization at Notre Dame, on-campus married student housing is available to both married couples as well as single parents. University Village houses 132 student families, including over 100 children. 
Though she acknowledges that it is diffi­cult for off-campus parents to meet other parents, Sister Jean Lenz, the assistant vice president for Student Affairs, says, 'The students living in the Village have a won­derful community environment. There is a mixture ofethnicities and religions and that provides students with a more multicultural atmosphere." According to Lenz, Campus Ministry tries to support · families in the . Village through guidance, supporting com­munity events and helping new parents ad­just to life at Notre Dame. 
The Village also has the Rev. Paul E. Beichner Community Center, which opened in 1997. It provides families with social space, organizes activities and allows for interaction between families. For parents who live in the Village, "It is like there is a built-in baby-sitting service and people re­ally try to help each other out," Lenz says. 

Another option is the Early Childhood Development Center, which provides child care for faculty, staff and students at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. The Center has rates that fluctuate according to income. "That allows parents to obtain quality child care that is at the same time affordable," Lenz says. 
But even with the option ofdaycare, play­ing the roles of parent and studerit remains a difficult balancing act. Balladares has a live-in nanny to help take care ofher daugh­ter. Noelle struggles similarly. "I don't have time to go to the weekend football games," Noelle says. "I spend my Saturdays with my daughter and try to get as much work done as possible. Bethany stays with her grandfa­ther on Tuesday and Thursday nights be­cause I have to get my study time in." 
For these women, the typical collegiate world of balancing study time with party time doesn't exist. They must add feeding time to the equation as well. D

Rising·Above Mediocrity 
The Irish may secure a major bowl berth this year, 
despite weak competition 
BY COREY SPINELLIAfter stumbling to a 7-6 record in his first season at the helm of the Notre Dame football program, Bob Davie faced the daunting task of tackling one of the nation's most treacherous schedules in 1998. Preseason prognosticators picked three squads on the Irish slate to finish in the top 10 (Michigan, Arizona State and LSU) and chose three others to crack the top 25 (Michigan State, Purdue and USC). Notre Dame's firstfouropponents in '98 defeated the Irish convincingly a year agci, and the fifth contest in the desert against the explo­sive Sun Devils was arguably the toughest game on the calendar. In August, even op­timists were_ resigned to a 3-2 start for Davie's sophomore campaign. Well, nearly two months later and six games deep into the '98 season the Irish stand at 5-1 and are ranked 16th in the nation in bothmajorpolls. Barring an upset, Notre Dame will enter its final home game on November 21 at 8-1, staring a previous! y unthinkable_ trip to Pasadena over Christ­
mas squarely in the face. All this less than a year after Davie had to win his last five games .of '97 just to qualify for a bowl berth in sun-drenched Shreveport. Yet the Irish needed a 48-yard field goal to avoid over­time against a 2-5 Army team that boasted half the athletic ability of the home team. 
There are many factors that have put this Notre Dame unit in a position to secure its first major bowl berth in three years. The Irish have shown marked improvement along the offensive line and fullback position, and the defensive front is considerably stronger than it was a season ago. The primary reason the Blue and Gold may enter January at 10­1, however, is the shocking level of under­achievement displayed by all 11 teams on the Irish schedule in '98. Aside from Michi­gan, the remaining 10 Notre Dame oppo­nents have ·amassed a total of 42 losses before Halloween, with at least three losses apiece. Michigan, with only two defeats, has narrowly avoided two others at the hands of Iowa and Northwestern, teams who are an abysmal 5-12 combined on the year. The Wolverines are the only Irish opponent in 
WHAT, ME WORRY? With a surprisingly weak schedule, sophomore Anthony Denman and the rest of the Irish may be congratulating themselves on securing a major bowl berth. 

the top 25, having reentered the poll at number22following an unimpressive home victory over a mediocre Indiana team. 
Notre Dame has played its two best games so far against Michigan and Arizona State, two of the most overrated teams in the nation according to the preseason polls. They dominated a pitiful Stanford squad that stands at 2-5, eked out a 20-17 win over the Cadets and were basically handed a 31­30 victory by a Purdue team that marched up and down the field at will in the Notre Dame Stadium. Thelrish'slone defeat came at the hands of a Michigan State team that needed overtime to beat Indiana at home and has lostfour games already, including one to Minnesota. The Spartans led Notre Dame 42-3 with seven minutes left in the second quarter. · 
The beauty of the '98 Irish is that we may never truly find out how good this team is. The Irish still have weaknesses on both sides of the ball. The offense is devoid of a break-away threat and at times becomes too reliant on Autry Denson, but they have thrown the ball well when they had to (the final Purdue drive) and diversified their attack successfully when necessary (Ari­zona State). The defensive fronthasn 'tpres­sured the quarterback too often and has had glaring problems in the secondary (Purdue and Michigan State), but Greg Mattison's group has created tumover.s at critical points (Michigan, Purdue and Arizona State) arid kept the Irish alive with big second-half stops. 
. Notre Dame does ·not have the manpower or talent to dominate football games like OhioStateorKansasState,butitalsodoesn't have to. The Irish simply have to be better than the team across the line of scrimmage for five more Saturdays. They don't have to play over their heads to win any of their i:emaining games. If Notre Dame wins its next three games (in which it will be heavily favored), the excitement will be palpable on campus around Thanksgiving for the first time in recent memory. And with two wins over a4-3 LSU and a 5-3 USC team, the Lee Corsos of the college football world can knock this team and wonder how a squad with wins over "mediocre" competition could possibly be lodged in• the top 10 all they want. I doubt the players and coaches will care too much when they're sitting poolside at some tropical destination over the holidays. By then the Irish may have won 15 of their last 17, a pleasantly surpris­ing feat regardless of the opposition. 0

BACK TO BASICS 
Jamie Spencer and Joey Goodspeed are reviving a Notre Dame tradition 
--the fullback position 
BY CHRISTOPHER HAMILTON ast season, the Irish offense offi­
cially hit rock bottom. In an at­
tempt to "modernize" its offen­sive scheme, Notre Dame tried to establish an aerial attack and decided to de-empha­size its running game. As a result, they posted a disappointing 7-6 record and aver­aged a paltry 22. 75 points per game, ranked 67th among the 112 NCAA Division I schools. 
This year, the Irish have changed their tune and have focused on their ground at­tack. Notre Dame has benefited immensely from the switch, as seen in its 5-1 record and the increase in its scoring output per game, which is now at 28.8 points. 
The team's recent success has been aided immeasurably by the resurgence of an old Notre Dame stronghold: the fullback posi-
L

tion. Junior Joey Goodspeed and senior Jamie Spencer platoon the position that one year ago was virtually a nonexistent compo­nent of Notre Dame's offense. In fact, Irish fullbacks carried the football a meager 77 times last season, the lowest total dating back to 1979. 
Following a long line of great Irish full­backs that includes Anthony Johnson, Jerome Bettis, Ray Zellars and Marc Edwards, Spencer and Goodspeed have made their presence felt in the Notre Dame offense this season. Despite their limited role running the ball last week against Army, after six games, the two have combined for 329 yards rushing on 52 carries. 
While the two combined boast an as­tounding average of 6.3 yards per carry this year, running back coach Desmond Robinson still sees room for improvement. "I'm happy with some of the things that 

they're doing, but I'm not entirely satis­
fied," says Robinson, who is in his second 
year as running back coach at Notre Dame. 
"We still have a long way to go." 
Spencer, a 6' 1 ", 245-pound senior from 

Monroe, La., is a player whose vast poten­
tial is just starting to be realized this season. 
In high school, Spencer was a Parade All­
American and was considered by recruiting 
analysts to be one of the top fullbacks in the 
country. Because he was designated to play 
a backup role behind former star Marc 
Edwards during his first two years and was 
bothered by a nagging, season-long injury 
last year, the senior has yet to truly exhibit 
his abilities. 
Though Spencer may not have been given the opportunity to really shine until this season, he was by no means inexperienced · entering this year. In fact, he appeared in every single game in his sophomore and

junior seasons and displayed a glimpse of his talent over that period, recording an average of 4.9 yards per carry. 
Joey Goodspeed also hasn't yet shown his true colors on the field. The 6'0", 240­pound junior was highly sought after high school, with the Chicago Sun-Times rating him as one of the nation's top 100 recruits. Although Goodspeed saw limited playing time as a freshman, his performance im­pressed the coaching staffenough for him to be named the starter as a sophomore. Unfor­tunately, the native of Montgomery, Ill., suffered a season-ending injury in the third game of the season against Michigan State. But, if any positives can be drawn from his experience last year, it is that Goodspeed was not stripped of a year of eligibility. He has two years remaining with the Irish after this season. 
The injuries that plagued Spencer and Goodspeed last year, while hindering their progress, also showcased just how commit­ted these fullbacks are to seeing the Irish succeed. When Joey Goodspeed endured a third-degree shoulder separation early last season, he worked overtime to get back on the field, even though he knew he hadn't fully recuperated. "I feel I may have tried to come back a little too early last year because I hated not playing," reflects Goodspeed, who essentially tore everything in his right shoulder. "I hated just watching the games and notfeeling like I was a part ofthe team." 
Goodspeed, who was temporarily moved to linebacke~ during his recovery, partici­pated inpractices during the season, but was never able to fully bounce back from the injury. "lt'hurt me last year trying to come back early....When I changed positions, I had to deal with the constant pounding at the linebacker position. It was really frustrat­ing." 
Jamie Spencer was also hampered by an injury that occurred early in the season. In fact, Spencer badly sprained both his knee and ankle on only the second day of fall practice. The injuries ended his preseason prematurely and when he came back to play in the regular season, he had still not fully recovered. 
"[Theinjury to my leg) never really healed throughout the season because I was always on it, trying to fight through things, just to get back in playing shape," Spencer says. "And I couldn't give up or just say forget it because Joey went down with his shoulder." 
Butthis season, both fullbacks are healthy. Combine that with Notre Dame's renewed commitment to smash-mouth football and

you have two happy campers who are finding little trouble ripping apart oppo­nents' defenses. But Spencer and Good­speed are both quick to point out that their success this season has been aided by the pres­ence of two other "backs" in Notre Dame's offense: namely quarterback J arious Jackson and :l

MAKING PROGRESS. Goodspeed feels that blocking is the facet of the game that he most needs to improve. 
sition belongs to the fullbacks themselves. Coach Desmond Robinson sees two top-flight performers in Goodspeed and Spencer and believes they each bring a unique package to the posi­tion. 
"Joey and Jamie are really different, even though they are both guys who are big and strong," comments Robinson. "Jamie is a powerful guy who has great vision when he carries the ball. ... He is an excel­lent pass bloc~er. Joey is kind ofdeceiving because he runs like a tailback.... He is very mobile on his feet and can make people miss [tackling him]. He can go to a power game if he has to, but his biggest asset is being able to make people miss." 
If there's one area that both Goodspeed and Spencer feel needs the most amount of improvement, it's blocking. Robinson could not agree more with their assess­ment. 
"We put a lot ofemphasis on improving in the area of blocking," says Robinson. "And I think we're getting better in that area. We've done some things physically with strength and conditioning and getting them to work on their quickness, which has helped them carrying the ball. But the biggest emphasis is to improve with the football not in their hands." 
Spencer and Goodspeed have been able to improve all facets oftheir game, includ­ing blocking, in part because of the close yet businesslike relationship they have de­veloped with Robinson. "He realizes that all ofus have talent and he tries to make the most of it," says Goodspeed regarding Robinson. "He coaches you like a man.... 
He's the type ofcoach that makes you work hard and at the same time he makes football fun." 
"Coach Robinson has instilled a spirit in us that tells us no one is guaranteed anything and nothing should be taken for granted," remarks Spencer; 
Given the fact that Goodspeed and Spen­cer take nothing for granted and have been vigorously competing to claim the starting role, it is a bit surprising that the two show such good will toward each other. "We're real good friends," says Spencer. "We help each other out, we cheer each other on. I thinkI'm probably his biggest fan when he's on the field. We've been through a lot to­gether." 
As both Spencer and Goodspeed are vet­erans, they have both assumed leadership roles on the team, which are about as distinc­tive as their styles of play. 
"Jamie is like a big brother to a lot ofthese kids on the team," notes Robinson. "He's a guy that will cut his right arm off for any of these guys .... He's a leader in the respect that he's very sensitive to what's going on with the football team and he's always con­cerned with keeping things upbeat." 
"Joey's also a leader in his own way," says Robinson. "But Joey's more of a silent 
. leader because he leads by example. He's a 
no-nonsense kind of guy and he believes in 
working hard and getting the job done." 
No matter how Goodspeed and Spencer display their leadership skills, Irish faithful hope that by bringing glory back to the fullback position, they will help lead Notre 
Dame back to national prominence.  .

beginning to settle in the new South Dining Hall, ·the wave ofreconstruction and renovation is hitting South Bend's Morris Center for the Performing Arts. 
Originally built as a low-dass vaudeville and movie house in 1922, the Morris Center has served a variety of entertainment ven­ues. Ithas been the home ofworld premieres for the films-Knute Rockne: All American and Rudy, and has housed stars such as B.B. King, Tim McGraw and The Righteous Brothers. The movie house was renamed the Morris Civic Auditorium in 1959, after .a large donation· from_ Mrs. E.M. Morris saved it from financial min.

collectively renamed the Morris Performing Arts Center. Along with this new name comes a complete renova­tion. "We are still early in the project," says Cleo Hickey, executive director ofthe Mor­ris Performing Arts Center. "At this point, the stage house is demolished and the con­crete has been poured." 
Preserving the historical and cultural heri­tage of the building is the commitment of the Morris· renovation, which is funded through private contributions, community fund-raising efforts and public funding. Hickey says, "From the beginning [financ­ing] has been a very collaborative effort between the public and private sectors. We have raised over $5.2 million from the pri­vate sector, and the rest will come from a city bond issue." 
To assure that the center is restored to its original glory, a historic paint consultant and numerous theater consultants have been hired to oversee the restoration. Areas in the historic interior of the theater, lobby and ballroom will be completely restored to 
their original color and design. In addition, 
the chandeliers and grand staircase will be 
refurbished, and a replica of the original 
historic marquee sign will be added along 
the building exterior. 
The dimensions of the house will also 
increase by 50 feet, allowing for a greater 
number of seats and an enlarged stage. To 
provide for more efficient scene set up and 
removal, the theater will house three new 
loading docks for equipment and scenery. 
These improvements will allow the center 
to accommodate more complex theatrical 
productions like Miss Saigon and Phantom 
ofthe Opera as well as various symphonies. 
According to Hickey, the Morris has "a 
concept for the grand opening [scheduled 
12 months from now], but no shows nailed 
down at this point." However, there is al­
ready a committee of community volun­
teers ready to decide the shows for next 
season. 
The committee will work in cooperation 
with the Broadway Theater League, a north­
ern Indiana-based promoter and sponsor of 
nationally touring Broadway musicals and 
plays. The Broadway Theater League's 
Executive Director AnitaBoordasays, "The 
shows are getting progressively bigger and 
more technical, and in the past we haven't 
been able to accommodate [those types of 
productions]." However, the Broadway 
Theater League board of directors will re­
main in the develpoment stages ofselecting 
shows until a completion date is available. 
There's an old cliche that life begins at 40. 
If that's true, then the Broadway Theater League, now in its 40th year, may help bring · new life to the South Bend entertainment. With the renovation of the Morris Center, the league will have a place to work its magic. And when the historic marquee lights up next year, it may signal an end to the extended intermission of Broadway perfor­mances in South Bend. · D

the ghosts that are said to linger inside. But this Halloween there's a new site for fright. 
The Niles Haunted House inNiles, Mich., has moved from its Bell Road location of 19 years to its new one on Mayflower Road 


OCTOBER 29, 1998 
acres and has a 9,600 square foot building filled with horrifying scenes that are sure to scare the yell out of you. 
Most of the scenes include adrenaline­boosting horror elements rather than gory splatterings ofblood and guts. Live actors in costume intermingle with mannequins to keep patrons guessing. 
"Every year the house is completely dif-· ferent. There are more than 100 possible paths to take, and the displays and routes [change] every year," says Peter Karlowicz, a member of the organizing committee for the Niles Haunted House. "We have an exit poll at the end ofthe house where people can vote for their favorite things in the house." 

Ope favorite, according to Karlowicz, is a contraption affectionately known as the puke barrel, or the star tunnel. 

Some of the other terrifying sights include a Psycho bathroom, a 
guillotine and an electric chair named Old Sparky (don't worry, 
Amnesty International members -neither was actually used), an 
exploding mine, a mad scientist room, a Children ofthe Corn room 
and as a grand finale, guests get to meet a friendly group of 
pyschopaths with chainsaws.· This weekend several psychics will 
do readings and fortune telling for the visitors. 
The Haunted House is staffed largely by community volunteers 
from more than 30 area non-profit charitable organizations. The 
groups receive donations based on the number of hours they 
provide. 
The Haunted House keeps a score board of people who wet their pants. 
Last year the Haunted House gave away over $40,000 in dona­
tions to charities and non-profit groups. 
The Niles Haunted House College Scholarship Fund awards 
several partial college scholarships to selected high school seniors 
from Brandywine and Niles high schools who have donated consid­
erable amounts of their time to community service. 
Pet Refuge, The Volunteer Center and over 20 different public 
school sports teams and clubs from Northern Indiana and South­
west Michigan also contribute to the Haunted House. 
The haunted house, which keeps a score board of the number of 
people who wet their pants, also offers an alternative for the 
younger ones, called the Small Scares Fun House and Hayride. 
Small Scares is open for children 12 and under who want to go to 
the Haunted House, but don't want to be scared. 
This attraction is filled with plenty of light, story-book and movie-theme displays, as well as rotating tunnel and moving floors. The children_may trick-or-treat while visiting the various rooms in the fun house. The visit ends with face painting, a hay ride and a free mini-pumpkin. 
Back at the Haunted House, though, attendance proves that most people are opting for the scary thrills this Halloween. 
"We've already [broken] last year's attendance record of36,000 patrons, and we've set a single night attendance record of 4,500 visitors," Karlowicz says. 
He estimates that around 98 percent of the Niles Haunted House patrons recommend the attraction to friends. "And most of the 'nos' are followed with, 'It was too scary,"' Karlowicz adds. 
According to Marty Smith, another member of the organizational board, Beetlejuice, the famed greeter at the Haunted House, will provide a free admission pass to any Notre Dame football player who wears his jersey. 
"But so far we've had no takers," she says, "which means they must all be too chicken to come." 0

Due to infractions at West Virginia University football games, students will no longer be able to sit anywhere they want. A recent outbreak of students littering the field during the games necessitated a new reserved seat system. Among items pitched out onto the field were a golf ball, an empty liquor bottle and a dead, bloated hillbilly. This new plan should help authorities pinpoint troublemakers. The adminis­tration, however, is leery about the new plan because in order to find their ticketed seats, students must be able to count.

Harvard University is up in arms against the Lowell Bi;ew­ing Co. for the introduction ofits new lager, Harvard. The beer is a reissue of Harvard Lager, which was produced by the Harvard Brewing Co. between 1898 and 1964. Harvard offi­cials are disturbed by the bottle's crimson label and any connections that might be made between the school and the beer. The.Lowell Brewing Co. said the reintroduction was no gimmick, although it did admit Harvard had been chosen over one previous idea: Purdue Malt Liquor.

, ~ BY 
K. MAxwELL MURPHY y mother just got into town after a 15-hour drive from the 
w 
East Coast. While driving past Pittsburgh on 1-80, she 
w 
was listening to KDKA on her AM dial, and she re­
~ counted a conversation on a radio call-in show. If you were tom between attending either Notre Dame orCarn.egie-Mellon Univer­sity, may I assuage your fears ... you have chosen wisely. 
A gentleman caller, identifying himselfas a representative ofthe Young Republicans of CMU, informed the listening audience of a rally that he had planned, which was to take place on the following day. Take about lOseconds, and see if.you can guess the cause that he and his comrades are to rally behind. Betcha 100 bucks you 're not even in the ballpark. It was to be a rally u{ support or°plants' rights. That's what I said, plants' rights. 
It is an outrage, he goes on, for groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to condemn eating meat and to revile the makers and wearers offur coats. For, you see, humans are the most important ]?eings in the universe, and we therefore have the right to do as we see fit with the lesser and smaller creatures. If anyone's rights are being overlooked, it's the plants'. 
These people have a hall prepared for the rally and everything. They were going to cook burgers and 

maybe a few steaks ..There will be no lettuce and no tomatoes. So it is writ­ten, so shall it be done. Honestly (un­less my mother is delusional, which is a possibility), no vegetables whatso­ever. No-plants of any kind are to be destroyed for man's enjoyment. 
Of course the burgers will be served onbuns. I repeat, as did my mom to me, he said there will be buns. What about the wheat? Thousands of years of the oppression of wheat, anci still nothing is done. Please, dear God, spare the 
sesame seeds. 
After avoiding the pickle situation altogether (I guess they were having a hard time deciding whether the pick­ling of a vegetable impinges on its rights), they moved on to mustard. No mustard. Mustard seeds are people too. · I had never thought of it before, but I guess that itis wrong to destroy unborn mustard. 
But wait, what have we here? Ketchup will be flowing in rivers at this function. In fact, ketchup is their version of a compromise. After what must have been days ofintense debate, these young Republi­cans decided that ketchup must exist for the happiness ofall parties concerned. Furthermore, as he put it, it's a valid stand on the 

, Ketchup Controversy. It's like (him talking) a person being pro-life for other women but pro-choice for herself. 
This was a gap-bridging revelation for them. The freedom of ketchup, just like speech and all those other ones in the Bill of Rights, is sacred. Kudos to them on extending the olive branch to the flora feeders. 
Another thing which really tweaks these guys is when people throw red paint on fur. It is our prerogative to destroy and wear whatever animal we need, regardless,of the reason. To their credit, 
'' they are tolerant of all viewpoints, anµ they promise not to throw paint on your cotton clothes. But for now I'm busy working on my own equal rights group. I callitPeoplefortheEthicalTreatnientofPlaque.Countlessbillions of germs. which cause plaque are mercilessly destroyed every day by senseless brushing. Three weeks from today, I will be holding my own midnight raliy at Stonehenge. Only true believers in the cause need show. Our-slogan: "Ifyoqr teef ain't green, they're too clean." 0

lowed through years of slide regurgitation and sleeping with my eyes open because I felt a business degree would land me a job. That was my only purpose. 
But over the past six months I've noticed something scary. I've seen over half of my group of alumni friends leave the same type of job I've been counting on. · In a way, they are all trying to start over. They were mostly college business majors and had accepted these jobs before graduation. They took the positions with the best monetary offeh, sat back and put their feet up for the rest of their time at college. The pressure was off. 
But after a year of monotony, they were suddenly struggling. Spring came and they awaited change, as if their jobs were just boring classes that were finally over. But they were stuck. There are no semesters, DART times or"cool" professors in the real business world. I had to do something. The change, for me, was major. · 
Senior year, from what I expected, meant tying a Windsor and donning a business suit, rehearsing answers to generic questions and spending way too much time in the Office ofCareer and Placement. Butthings have gone a little differently. I haven't worn a tie yet this year. 
Because I left the college of business, I ended up spending my summer away from the shore and in the Bend taking extra classes. I also had to explain to my parents the value of an Arts and Letters education and convince my CPA father that I would still be able to get a job when I graduate. 
And searching for that job is going to be a timely and painstaking process. But I'm no longer thinking about starting salaries, signing bonuses and dealing out resumes to companies, suggesting with a little insincerity that I've been waiting to work for them all my life. 
Somewhere along the line we were all told that having a job by December ofour senior year is the benchmark of a successful college career. I don't believe it anymore. Rushing to tell mom and dad that you've got a job is more fun but a lot less important than asking yourself the big question: "Is this really what I want to do?" . 
I'm glad my revelation came before I was stuck in a job 
I hated but was afraid to leave. A lower starting salary or 
a student loan is a small price to pay for happiness. .

So there I was. Missing classes, borrowing notes and cramming the night before ex­ams. I couldn't care less about school. Why was I so unhappy at Notre Dame? At first I thought it was the university's fault. It was too conservative, too Midwestern, maybe, definitely not for me. At this point, I had gone through two and a half years as a business major and the only thing I learned was that 50 minutes was a long time to stare at the clock. I hadn't been happy about academics since high school. Freshman year I just followed the majority of my friends into the business school.

While I was at home I happened to come across a copy of my Notre Dame application essay. I had written that Helt Notre Dame would best afford me the opportunity to continue my spiritual and academic growth. But about the only things I had taken from Notre Dame thus far were a new nickname and a crew offriends. Spiritually and academically, I had regressed. 
Before acting on the idea oftransferring out of the university I decided to see an educational counselor. The first thing he asked me was whether I was happy in my major. That's when I became a business student refugee. I had wal­
