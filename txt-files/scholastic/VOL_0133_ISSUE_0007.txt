An Announcement
Like it or not (not), midterms are approaching, and soon after break, we’ll all be choosing courses for the next semester. Navigating through DART is only part of the daunting challenge of picking classes. Students at Notre Dame often have no more information about a particular course than what time it meets and its title, and decisions made with so little information are always dangerous ones. But this time around, Scholastic will try to make class selection a slightly more informed process.
In 1984 student government wanted to use Faculty Course Evaluation surveys to give students more information about their class choices. Students were asked to evaluate their courses, and the results were to be printed in a guidebook. But the 1986 FCE booklets were never printed, since few questionnaires were returned.
What the FCE committee tried in the 1980s, Scholastic had accomplished in 1969 and through the mid-’70s. The magazine, often with financial support from student, government and logistical support from college academic affairs councils,published a biannual series of course evaluation guidebooks that relied not on surveys, but on selected students reviewing the courses they took.
On November 7, at least on some modest scale, die magazine will be reviving that tradi tion. The project began in spring of last year, when members of the editorial board began asking students to complete a unique writing assignment: evaluating their own classes. To ensure accuracy, reviewers were asked to turn in their evaluations after their final exams, and before they received their report cards.
When we returned in the fall, we counted , up the reviews we received and realized we ; needed more contributors, so additional	i
writers were recruited. In its final form,	;
about 50 students have taken on a difficult job, and our thanks go out to all who helped.
The resulting course evaluation booklet is far from perfect. In an effort to concentrate ! our resources, we had to limit the scope of our reviews; in this first booklet, no engineering or Saint Mary’s courses are included, and only about 200 courses are reviewed at all.
I will be the first to admit that the course evaluation book is limited, but I also think this first booklet is an important start, and I hope other campus groups (at Notre Dame and Saint Mary’s) will assist us with ideas on how to approach and expand future issues. Scholastic will print more information about the course evaluations in the weeks to come.

LETTERS
GLND/SMC Does Not Violate Catholic Teaching
Dear Editor:
A letter in your Oct. 3 edition says that Gays and Lesbians atNotre Dame/St. Mary’s College (GLND/SMC, pronounced “Glenda-Smick”) goes against the 150-year tradition of Notre Dame. It also says that GLND/SMC goes against Catholic teaching. Yet, the letter does not tell us how GLND/SMC contravenes Catholic teaching or the Great Sesquicentennial. The contradiction is simply assumed.
The assumption holds no water whatsoever.
Let me show you why it doesn’t hold up. First, we must examine Catholic teaching. It affirms the worth of persons with a homosexual orientation at the same time that it finds sexual activity among homosexuals to be outside the standard of sex in marriage for procreation.
The Oct. 3 letter shows some familiarity with this Catholic teaching. Yet, the writer does not fully apply the teaching. For, when it comes to dealing with a group of homosexuals, there is no allowance that they could be meeting for reasons of orientation: to support each other, or to help educate each other about the difficulties surrounding being gay, lesbian or bisexual or to simply enjoy the mere presence of others like themselves in respite from an officially unsympathetic and sometimes hostile environment.
Those who deny us official recognition think that we meet for reasons of sexual activity; when lesbians and gays get together, we must always be having sex or arranging for time when we can. This stand forgets the distinction between orientation and activity. It is heterosexism at its worst, and it contravenes Catholic teaching, not our group.
On the one hand, you have orientation. On the other, you have activity. Are you following nie? Can you repeat the distinction? Being lesbian and acting on it are two separate things. Being bisexual and acting on it arc two separate things. Being gay and acting on it are two separate things. (This is paragraph six. Just remember.)
GLND/SMC is here to help students, faculty and staff with their sexual orientation.
At our first general meeting on Sept. 15 we talked about the “Safe Haven” resolution so that all of our members would understand that attempt in the Halls. We talked about dues. We talked about difficulties with the administration. We reviewed the ridiculous, censorious administration advertising policy that was created to destroy the power of our Queer message (a simple one, that it is nothing less than incredibly fantastic to be lesbian, gay or bisexual). We talked about a newly improved social calendar and worries that we are perceived as being too political (an important concern because it distances us from those who are just coming to terms with themselves). That was our meeting.
I challenge anyone anywhere to explain to me how the meeting I just described goes against Catholic teaching.
Of course, nobody can. They just dumbly repeat the assumption: Homosexuality is against Catholic teaching. Go back to paragraph six if you find yourself saying this.
If GLND/SMC does not contravene Church teaching, then why is
OCTOBER 10, 1991
GLND/SMC still officially unrecognized by the university after seven years? The answer is that this university and the Catholic Church only pay lip service to the teaching on homosexuality. Notre Dame, despite its (very few) words is not committed in action to the fundamental dignity of its lesbian, gay and bisexual students, faculty and staff. Otherwise, the idea of prideful, undisturbed lesbians, gays and bisexuals talking about this semester’s dues would not be so unsettling and forbidden.
Is this the great tradition that Fr. Sorin started 150 years ago? You tell me.

Language Department Image is Award-winning
Dear Editor:
I am certain that I speak for the entire department of romance languages and literatures when I write to point out and take issue with your editorial sloppiness. I refer to the September 26 issue of Scholastic when in a piece entitled “Notre Dame’s Image”—not an unimportant subject, to be sure — you offer up uncomplimentary remarks made about the department of modem and classical languages in the Fiske Guide to Colleges. That those frisky Fiske writers are out of touch with the current status of the language departments at Notre Dame may be attributable to the breadth of their project That an on-campus publication would reprint such a remark in a piece dealing almost exclusively with generalities, is curious and galling. Now, you may argue that you were merely harvesting quotations from other publications, that you are not responsible for the content of those quotations. Such an argument would smack either of bad faith or a grave misunderstanding of the mechanics and structure of expository writing. For my part, I would like to set the record somewhat straight First of all, the department of modem and classical languages ceased to exist two years ago. The department of romance languages and literatures, one of the three new departments spun out of the old, can boast of a 100 percent increase in majors and a 144 percent increase in the number of students taking major level courses. It can point to the fact that in national fellowship competitions the faculty of this department has distinguished itself: five of the 18 National Endowment for the Humanities grants awarded to the college in the past five years, eight of the 19 NEH summer stipend nominations. It can also point to TCE ratings that are significantly higher than either the college or university averages.
Am I suggesting that the department of romance languages and literatures is perfect? Of course not. Am I suggesting that you be more responsible in your writing? You better believe it

Information, opinion, attitude and outright innuendo
The Forbidden Floor:
The Adventure Continues
The Gipper’s query last week brought quite a few responses. Various Junior Campus Watchers called or wrote in to report on the mysterious fourteenth floor, unreachable by stairwell or ‘vator. The eyewitness testimonies by those who have actually tred on the sacred level seem to rule out some of the wilder theories about what’s really up there. “It’s just a lounge with views to the south and east. Because the windows are so far back from the edge of the building, the view isn’t spectacular, but it is very nice,” reports “Robert” (mysteriously, no last name). No less a personage than Melville Dzialak, manager of WNDU, called to report that theFloor Above Thirteen contained “nothing spectacular,” and was, disappointingly, not Hesburgh’s secret residence. A likely story.
All right, so the Big One-Four isn’t some sort of secret nightclub for priests or a laboratory trying to clone Rocket Ismail’s genes for future teams — the Gipp would still like to send a photographer up there to snap the proof needed to put all these rumors to rest. If you know the person to talk to for permission for this venture, pass this article along. If you’re that person, please contact the Gipp. And if any more Junior Campus Watchers want to report in, information on reaching the ghostly gossip is at the bottom of this page.
It’s All Greek to the Gipp
One alert Junior CampusWatcher wrote in to pick a nit. Specifically, grad student John Klentos typed, “Life, Sweetness, Hope” (the English translation of the university’s Latin motto) are not the first three words of “Salve Regina” (“Hail Holy Queen”). Rather, they are the fifth, sixth and eighth. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.

A CampusWatch Investigation
First the Gipper held a contest to see who spent the most at the bookstore. Now there’s a new target that some Junior Cam-pusWatchers want investigated: the Huddle Deli. Two different correspondents wrote in to complain about being overcharged at that little convenience store. (One complained at length (and alliteratively) about the Deli selling individual packages that the manufacturer labelled “not for individual sale.”) While the Gipp hasn’t had time to send out the crack CampusWatch Team to investigate the merit of the claims, he’d like to hear from others with beefs, praises, or just general info on the Deli. Remember, if you have a problem you can’t settle peacefully, don’t take the law into your own hands ... tell the Gipp!
Exam Information
As midterms approach, the Gipper thought the following information would be of interest to those victims of the all-nighter out there. But first, the Gipp must caution that using too much caffeine is not a good idea; if you’ve got to pull a ‘round the clock study marathon, the Gipper recommends brief naps, cold showers and an occasional breath of fresh air as the safest methods of staying awake. That being said, the information at right is from Discover magazine.

640AM WVFI brings college radio legends to Notre Dame
by Kevin Flaherty
If you think the hottest thing to come out of North Carolina is the Duke Blue Devils, you have a lot to learn. Raleigh is home to one of the South’s most successful young bands, The Connells.
The quintet, led by guitarist Mike Connell and bassist David Connell, has released four albums since 1986 and garnered Top 10 positions on the alternative charts for two of them. Their 1987 release, Boylan Heights, peaked at #4 on the Gavin Report/Rolling Stone National Alternative chart, and the 1987 release Fun & Games spent three months on Billboard’s Top LP chart, breaking the Top 10 in every modem rock chart in the nation.
The debut, Darker Days, secured The Connells’ following and set the tone for a truly dynamic sound. The single, “Seven,” caught the attention of TVT Records and MTV, which gave the video regular rotation and opened the door for the group’s second effort, Boylan Heights.
A majestic collection, Boylan Heights meandered through a series of topics, focusing at certain points on the band’s struggles with the topic of war (“Choose a Side,” “Over There”). “Scotty’s Lament,” scored on MTV’s “120 Minutes.” The song boasted an Celtic influence lost on later albums and showcased vocalist Doug MacMillan’s wispy tenor. Guitarist/key-boardist George Huntley had a chance to show off his skill on the album with tracks such as “Over There,” which features a silky base of synthesizers beneath MacMillan’s hushed vocals. Huntley also contributed to many of the harmonies that gave songs like “Home Today” and “Just Like Us” their distinctive sound. Drummer Peele Wimberly rounded out the lineup.
Before long, the public was beginning to take notice, and The Connells were no longer one of North Carolina’s best-kept secrets. Fun & Games, the foHow-up to
Boylan Heights, allowed the band to continue on its course as one of college radio’s most beloved children and saw The Connells reaching for a larger, more accessible sound. MacMillan’s vocals were beginning to stand out from the mix, and songs like “Motel” not only demonstrated their ability to bring their sound to a stately roar while keeping the acoustic base of their music intact, but also showed a continued dedication to insightful lyrics. The album also saw a broader expression of Mike Connell’s jangly electric guitars and delicate acoustics. After selling out venues nationwide, the band returned home
to play a sold-out show at the 4000-seat Raleigh Civic Center.
By the time the group released 1990’s One Simple Word, they had supplemented their large and devoted following in the South with national acclaim. Their music had become a staple of college radio playlists, and their live performances proved to audiences that they were not products of the image-making machinery that is so much a part of the music scene today. The songs translated well onstage, and the album’s single, “Stone Cold Yesterday,” quickly surpassed its predecessors in both radio and video airplay.
Having completed their tour for One Simple Word, The Connells are back out on the road to bring the music of their first four albums to audiences nationwide. This time, they have brought with them another great southern band, TVT recording artists Seven Simons. The group hails from Athens, Georgia, a town famous for its multitude of
contributions to the world of music (R.E.M., the B-52’s, Widespread Panic). The Simons’ new release, “Four Twenty-Four,” has been described as belonging in the realm of The Inspiral Carpets, and the first single, “And She Falls,” is currently receiving moderate airplay on college radio.
Courtesy TVT Records
The Connells will rock Theodore's tonight at 8.
WVFI presents live performances by both bands on Thursday night, Oct. 10th, in Theodore’s. Doors open at 8 p.m., and the show will begin at 9 p.m. Tickets are available at the LaFortune Information Desk, and are $5 in advance or $6 at the door. Notre Dame or Saint Mary’s LD. is required for purchase and entry. WVFI will feature live interviews with both bands on Thursday the 10th, the day of the show. Watch for WVFI ads for the time.
This is your chance to see a great show by a renowned band ... practically on your doorstep. Don’tlet it slip by; true talents like The Connells are few and far between. If you are already a fan, this is the opportunity you have been waiting for. If you are still unaware, this is the opportunity that has been waiting for you.	□

Fugazi’sSteady Diet of Nothing
by Bob Ederhardt
T)raise the Lord! I nearly dropped to my i knees in thanksgiving when I heard that the new Fugazi album had finally been released. Guitarist/vocalist Ian MacKaye could not give a set release date as of this past June, but this hungry fan was templed enough that I have been unable to sleep until the record was in my hands, ready to be playing on my stereo, filling my room.
It’s been about two years since their third release, Repeater, hit the shelves, and it has been far too long. Fugazi is the sort of band that either you fall in love with, having a deep, give-and-take relationship, or you don’t find special at all. I admit that I am a junkie, and this new slab of vinyl (or chunk o’ plastic for you hip CD heads) is enough to pump through my veins for quite a while. At
this point you probably realize I love them (Joe, Guy, Ian and Brendan), but you’re probably wondering what they sound like. Fugazi can be slow and twisting or fast and in-your-face, but they are always more powerful than your philosophy professor in getting you to think about who you are and what you are wearing. They are controversial and always arouse strong feelings in people, be they positive or negative. Joe Lally’s bass lines are hypnotizing; Ian’s and Guy’s voices are always beautifully rasping. This is not dance music.
The new album is entitled Steady Diet of Nothing and features eleven tracks including a monumental, spine-tingling Fugazi instrumental (in the tradition of songs like “Joe Number One” and “Brendan Number One”). Fugazi has not ventured far from its
own emo-core style, but they make a few adjustments in subject matter. The lyrics on Steady Diet of Nothing arc strong, emotional and honest, as illustrated in one of the album’s best tracks, “Long Division.” Other good cuts include “Reclamation” and “Nice New Outfit,” a song about drug dealers with expensive, elaborate apparel.
Fugazi is one of the best bands to see live. Every concert advances the fan to a higher plane of being. It sheds some light upon why so many people worship Ian MacKaye as the ultimate hardcore god. With his bands (The Teen Idols, Minor Threat, Embrace and Fugazi), he always has something worth hearing. Steady Diet of Nothing is a warmer, less preachy release that reaffirms my belief in their all-powerful deism within the genre
of emotional hardcore music.

Super Sex Magik
with Red Hot Chili Peppers
by Bob Eberhardt and Joe Adams
These are the times that try men’s souls, and here are 17 new tracks from a band „	„
that has forever Super Sex Magik made its mark in the music world. We be talkin’ ‘bout the Red Hot Chili Peppers and their newest album Blood Sugar Sex Magik. After two long and painful years of waiting for a chunk of new material from these funk/ thrash gods, we can relax and enjoy this new platter o’ tunes. However, the newest album consists largely of funk with a minimum of thrash.
Those familiar with their earlier albums could equate it with Freaky Styley, their 1985 release. Flea, the Peppers’ bald,
goateed and hyperactive bassist, performs bass lines that are much less flailing and psychotic, developing the band into a more relaxed, mellow and funky groove. Incidentally, funky is meant in the positive sense of the word, unlike in the context of, say, a funky smell. This unique sound can be gleaned from such tunes as “If You Have to Ask” and “Apache Rose Peacock.” Perhaps this album’s music is a reflection of the talents of the newer additions to the Chili Peppers’ lineup: drummer Chad Smith and guitarist John Frusciante. On the last album, Mother’s Milk, John and Chad were added mainly for playing in live shows, while the album was written entirely by Anthony and Flea.
Their lyrics often reveal a deep-rooted affection and respect for the opposite sex. Songs such as “Suck My Kiss,” “Breaking the Girl” and “Naked in the Rain” are just a
few of the tracks that hold a certain Chili Peppers’ magic (not unlike their 1987 song “Special Secret Song Inside”). They are thoughtful, sometimes soul-searching, always adding a great deal to the song’s presentation.
If you’re looking for something new to add li fe to your musical collection (no matter how finite or extensive), these two musical gurus advise you to grab hold of the new Red Hot Chili Peppers’ disc; you may never want to let go. Coefficient of Funk: 9.73	□

Student-run radio station attempts conversion to another frequency
by Margaret Kenny
A bout 45 years ago, WVFI was xV started in a small room of the football stadium, broadcasting On the AM frequency as it does today, under the call lettersWSND-AM. After abrief period of broadcasting from the tower of O’Shaugnessey Hall, as WSND-FM currently does, WVFI moved to its current location on the second floor of LaFortune in the early 1980’s. At this time, according to current station manager Kevin Flaherty, student government allocated the money necessary to set up the AM frequency carrier-current system that is still in use at present.
This system employs the use of antennas in the basement of each building on campus, said Flaherty. Yet the reception is poor in some buildings, while certain buildings are
unable to tune into the station at all. Sophomore disc jockey Joe Adams said, “If you have a radio station, it would be nice to have people hear it.”
Elizabeth Graner is a senior at Saint Mary’s College and a DJ at WVFI. “The reception of WVFI at Saint Mary’s vacillates. If it’s the clearest day, you can even then barely hear it through all of the static,” she said. “Women with really good stereos who live bn the fourth floor of Holy Cross facing the Avenue can, if they’re lucky, get WVFI.”
In September of 1985, Radio Systems of Edgemont, Pa., inspected WVFI and made a report for the station’s proposal for improvement on the carrier-current system. The main conclusion of the report was that most of the system was outdated and in. need of replacement Only live of the 25 buildings’ reception was deemed "good,” while eight were consid
that’sthenature of tlie music; itappeals:-to!people
ered to have “poor to none” reception. The report concluded that the system was “at best in fair condition.”
The final conclusion of this report was that, “System performance appears to have been deteriorating almost since the original installment of the equipment.”
WVFI, the “Voice of the Fighting Irish,” is located at 640 AM, and it has recently begun a quest to switch over to the FM frequency. Flaherty calls the format of WVFI “alternative because it has a broader meaning, I think, than progressive of new wave... it’s an alternative to
other kinds of music demanded by the popculture.”
Another way to describe WVFI’s format. Flaherty said, is as “college music” since this type of music starts out on college campuses and is primarily supported by college students.
WVFI’s listening audience spans the 16 to mid-20’s age group, with a relatively large area high school following. Yet Flaherty said that the college audience is responsible for the largest percentage of the station’s listeners because “they have pretty much formed their [musical] tastes by now, and there are a lot of kids who see this as something that is unavailable elsewhere.”
WVFI is serviced by over 100 record labels nationwide, with the label’s popularity ranging from the relatively unknown labels to highly recognized
major labels like Capitol, MCA or Warner Bros. These companies automatically send their new releases to college radio stations as free promotions, but because of the waning interest in AM radio, some labels overlook WVFI, forcing the station to purchase music out of its own budget. The DJ's also bring music from their own personal collections to implement their shows.

ously, especially those involving an AM carrier-current system. Flaherty said they feel it is a waste of their time and money. Therefore, some labels have dropped WVFI entirely or often forget to send out their new releases.
Music director Jeff Jotz said he has already had to convince music labels to continue supporting WVFI this semester. “It’s hard to convince labels that an AM carriercurrent station will generate sales...Smaller labels are hesitant to send stuff because they find it hard to compete with the larger labels.”
Jotz also said that these labels would much rather send releases to FM stations than to an AM carrier-current system with a maximum listenership of only 5,000 people
Furthermore, the AM signal is much harder to tune in on a stereo than a FM
station, necessitating the use of an AM antenna. Also, Flaherty said, people want to be able to listen to WVFI on their walkman stereos, which is virtuallly impossible for an AM station.
Junior deejay Patrick Finn echoed Flaherty’s sentiments. “Basically,” he said, “it [AM carriercurrent] is a waste of media. source. If they’ve got it here, they may as well do what they can to make it the best they can.”
Flaherty also lists the reputation of AM radio as a hindrance to WVFI. “I think a lot of listeners, in our age group especially,
don’t take AM that seriously. They consider AM the home of talk radio and sports radio, and they don’t think that’s where a rock-and-roll station or any kind of music station belongs.”
In the past, other station managers have attempted to initiate the switch to FM, yet they abandoned the idea because it seemed such a colossal and time-consuming effort. Flaherty does not think that he has any more free time than past station managers, yet he has dedicated himself to the cause, even though it may seem impossible. “I just think it’s imperative,” he said.
Jotz pointed out Flaherty’s dedication and credits him for taking the project this far. He said, “Without him, we’d still be wallowing
• in obscurity.”
Flaherty has opted for the jump to theFM frequency rather than merely upgrading the system to AM stereo for several reasons. “To upgrade the station to AM stereo, which would be the middle step between AM carrier-current andFM, is not worth the money. It is very little sound for a large investment,” he said. This middle step would also fail to improve the station’s reputation significantly becuase it would still be on the AM frequency.
Production manager Bob Eberhardt also believes that the system has become obsolete, and he completely supports the FM bid. “If we keep the system the way it is, we’re probably going to spend more money in the

long run than we would upgrading it, if only through repairs," he said.
WVFI’s aim is to provide music for the Notre Damecampus. Flaherty hopes that the station will be able to reach off-campus students with a FM signal, yet this action is dependent upon FCC regulations. He said, “It’s also up to the administration, how far our signal will reach. The FCC determines what is the legal limit for our power, and the administration determines what is a reasonable limit for us.”
If given permission to go ahead with the project, WVFI will purchase a transmitter
with the appropriate kilowatt power to reach as far as the station is allowed, Flaherty said. Ideally, the station hopes to provide the students who reside off-campus as well as the area high school students with the opor-tunity to listen to WVFI, which would require the signal to reach a few miles off-campus.
The FCC is responsible for outlining the regulations concerning all radio stations. New releases are previewed by members of WVFI's board and certain songs are labeled “Not for Airplay.” In the past, WVFI was broadcast in the dining halls, yet, about one and one half years ago, a song was played that had been labeled “NFA,” causing this service to be eliminated. To the best of Flaherty’s knowledge, this has been the only infraction committed by WVFI against FCC regulations.
If WVFI were to be granted permission by the administration to switch over to the FM frequency, the switch would not go into effect until the 1992 school year. Flaherty said that it would take at least one month to fill out the FCC application and, after that, there would be an eight month waiting period while the FCC processed the application.
Both Flaherty and several of WVFI’s deejays have asserted that if the station were to make the switch over to FM, the alternative format would remain the same.
Patrick Finn, who broadcasts his show
8
SCHOLASTIC
with “partner in crime” Jim Maloney on Thursday nights, said, “People like hearing new things. We have 80-some different DJs who play different shows. It’s not like we have a format, per say. We play alternative music, which means you’ll hear music you’re not going to hear on U-93 or WAOR.”
Another DJ, Louis Flores, whose show is Saturday afternoons, also believes that the format will remain intact. “The whole point is that we want to put out something that everybody can hear on the format we have.”
Flaherty said there has been.an overwhelming amount of student support. The student senate passed a resolution last week to support WVFI’s bid for FM stereo.
This resolution recognizes the cause as worthwhile, “with the understanding that it would not bind them financially.”
The Hall President’s Council also has a resolution pending in support of the station, which was slated for discussion at the October 8 meeting. He said, “If the indication of the individual members of HPC is any indication of their station, the resolution should be passed without a problem.” Apparently some individual dorms have circulated petitions in support of a switch to the FM frequency, as well as havin discussed the topic at various hall council meetings.
The co-president of
Pasquerilla West, Jennifer Avegno said, “HPC recognizes the vital service that WVFI performs for the Notre Dame/Saint Mary’s College community."
Pasquerilla West's other co-president, Jennifer Martin said," The student response in our dorm has been overwhelming. The matter has been discussed in our hall council meeting, and the council strongly supports the changeover.”
As for the students in general, Flaherty said he has found that WVFI is supported by a larger number of students than anyone ever thought. “We did a survey last year through a task force conducted by Lynn Ramsay of SUB ...the results of that were very good. A lot more of the students than we thought would like to listen to the station, but they
don’t have the opportunity..”
He thinks the station has a strong, silent support group. “They’re not the kind of people who are going to come out and rally around us and.make big noise. I think that’s the nature of the music; it appeals to people who don’t express themselves in public too often.” Jotz also said that he has received support and enthusiasm from the record companies he has contacted when he mentions WVFI’s plans to switch over to the FM frequency.
Flaherty was slated to meet with the administration earlier today. At press time, he had only spoken with Joe Cassidy, the Di
rector of Student Activities, who had expressed concern over the acquisition of the funds necessary to purchase the new transmitter and actually initiate the switch to the FM frequency. Funding for this project, which WVFI expects to cost approximately 30,000 dollars, will come from WVFI’s budget
Flaherty was unsure about the nature of any other concerns that the administration would present in their meeting. “I think that they are afraid of what this music represents. A lot of it [alternative music] has been given a bad rap by the PMRC [Parent’s Music Resource Center] and other parents’ groups who have singled out a lot of bad apples, basically, to condemn the whole genie.”
Jotz said he really couldn’t predict the
administration, but he is optimistic. He feels that the station has “momentum on our side” due to the overwhelming support by the students. Jotz said that to the best of his knowledge, WVFI has never had so much attention on campus.
WVFI is taking this process on a day-to-day basis. Flaherty commented on how all of those involved are new to this and are unsure of exactly what to do. They are more than willing to accept input from students. At this time, there are no concrete plans for fundraising, although any ideas are welcomed by Flaherty and the rest of the board.
Flaherty feels that few people realize how important the student-run WVFI is to the Notre Dame community. Not only does the station provide the campus with an alternative to the music broadcasted on South Bend stations, he said,but it also announces advertisements of campus events, weather forecasts and hews broadcasts.
Jotz also pointed out several ways in which WVFI would help the university’s image if it were to switch to the FM frequency. He said it would further integrate the university in to the South Bend community, as well as enhancing WVFI’s reputation in the world of college radio. He also stresses the benefit of the students who have committed themselves
with extreme dedication to the management of the station.
If this bid for a switch to theFM frequency fails, Flaherty said that he will be “very happy that we have all tried as hard as we have, and if nothing else, we’ve gotten a lot of free publicity.”
Concerning the future of WVFI, Eberhardt said, “At least through all of the turmoil of us trying to go FM, people have learned that WVFI does exist.” He noted that many more people have tuned into 640 AM if only to see what WVFI’s all about.
Rores concluded, “The whole point is that we want to have fun, and we want others to be able to hear it”	□

THE SWARM OF THE YELLOW-GREEN JERSEYS
The Notre Dame cycling team “won t be stopped by the wind or the rain”
Matt Cashore
by Maricelle Ruiz-Calderdn
None of them may resemble Greg Le
Mond or be up for the “Tour de France”—yet. But the Notre Dame cycling team is definitely on the right track.
It all started last year when Jon Puskas, a transfer student from Claremont McKenna College in Southern California, arrived at Notre Dame. Puskas, an avid cyclist from Lake Oswego, Oregon, decided to start a cycling team after discovering that Notre Dame didn't have one.
Too busy to get the club organized during his first semester at Notre Dame, he decided that it “was going to be his Christmas Break sort of project.” Jon Puskas came back to Notre Dame in January and, after making the pertinent calls, sought recognition from the club council. After the Notre Dame cycling team was officially recognized, they held an
10
extremely successful first meeting. Puskas excitedly recalls, “I was expecting 12 people; we had 30.” So the club bought yellow-green jerseys and hooked their first local sponsor, Pro Form Bike Shop.
In the beginning, Puskas relates, it was basically “ a bunch of die hards going out in the cold, freezing their butts off. A lot of people I’d called that had race experience just wouldn’t take me seriously ... because we were so unorganized. We held our first meeting three weeks before the first race. That’s not a lot of training time to get ready for a bike race.” In spite of their inexperience, the cyclists successfully completed their first season. As a member of the Midwest Collegiate Cycling Conference, the Notre Dame cycling team achieved second place in the novice division and seventh
and eighth place in the intermediate division.
This year the Notre Dame cycling team as a whole has over 60 members. The team is divided into “the elite squad” or “the roadracing team” and “the mountain-biking team.” Puskas explains that there are 12 positions on the elite squad, 10 of which have been filled and two which have been left open until the spring. Kathy Black, a native of New Mexico, is a valuable member of the elite squad. This “top-notch rider... has ridden with thebest in the country,” says Puskas, who believes she will greatly benefit the team. “Women are extremely important for the team score; Kathy Black brings us a consistently competitive woman who will allow us to score points in the women’s races. This will make a big difference in our
SCHOLASTIC
overall placement in the region.”
The mountain-biking team “was just started this fall because we saw the interest,” says Puskas. Last weekend, the team sent four of their top riders to race in the competitive Indiana State Mountain Biking Championships. The road-racing team, on the other hand, is going to Indiana University on Oct. 13 to race in the Indiana University Sprint Championships.
Puskas describes this race as “kind of wild; it’s going to be sort of like a gladiator or something in chariot races.” He further explains that during this race ten cyclists will slowly ride behind a car. Later on the car will pull to the side and the riders will have “300 meters to sprint all out, as hard as [they] can, through the heart of Indi
ana University’s campus.” The winner of.this race, a fund-raiser for Indiana University’s popular “Little 500,” will get $500.
The aforementioned activities will be the Notre Dame cycling team’s main activities for the fall. Puskas explains that they basically spend the fall on training and gelling financially organized. “The spring is when the collegiate racing season exists. We race from the last weekend in February through the middle of April.”
In terms of training, the Notre Dame cycling team unbelievably tries to race outside all year round. Puskas says, “Most of the time, at least last year, we were pretty lucky that South Bend keeps its roads pretty dry. We’re not going to be stopped by the cold or the rain. If the roads are slippery, like icy or snowy, then will be weight training as well as have indoor wind trainers.”
Puskas explains that a regular bike is placed on top of a wind trainer, which creates a kind of stationary bike system. “Your wheels are still spinning ... you still have to work on your balance and all that, except for the fact that you’re not moving anywhere... You bore yourselves to death an hour and a half or two every night.”
But, Puskas stresses, wind trainer work-

outs are only necessary when the roads are icy, snowy or slippery. If its only cold, they dress up in their winter gear and head out for their daily 35-to 45- mile-a-day race, or even for a “century ride,” a 100-mile ride.
The Notre Dame cycling team is open to any Notre Dame, Saint Mary’s or Holy Cross student, faculty or administrator. The only requirement is that the cyclist wear a helmet. According to Puskas, the club has “every ability level represented, from absolutebeginners who have no interest in racing to ... people that want to be competing and possibly qualifying for nationals.” Puskas has identified three goals for the club: to introduce people to any level of cycling; to provide them with financial backing to practice the sport and to organize rides and instructional clinics. “Pro Form Bike Shop,” Puska mentions, “does instructional clinics. They teach people how to do mechanics on their bikes.”
As Jon Puskas excitedly concludes: “We are always looking for riders; the more the merrier. It looks really cool when you have 50 people hit the road together all in the same jersey.”	□

UP IN ARMS
Principal Joe Clark takes a tough stance on tough schools and raises heated controversy
by Jenny Tate
Today’s school systems reflect a world that is plagued with seemingly unsolv-able problems. Notorious for its graffiti-covered walls, an unruly, predominantly minority student body, and rampant drug abuse, Eastside High in Paterson, New Jersey was no exception—that is, until former army drill instructor Joe Clark brought in his ideas about discipline.
Clark assumed the role as principal of Eastside High in 1982. Having spent the last twenty years as an elementary school teacher and principal in Paterson, he arrived at Eastside with first-hand knowledge of the district and its residents. The changes that the former Army Reserve Sergeant initiated in this 3,200 student high school were immediate and drastic.
After implementing a plan of action that included chain-locked doors to keep out drug pushers, a dress code prohibiting gang-related clothing, and structured corridor movement, Clark’s authoritarian, hardline approach was evident. His administration style stressed discipline and obedience to authority, and gave the students no option but to fespond or be dismissed.
Clark’s most visible symbol of authority was a thirty-six -inch Willie Mays Big Stick bat he carried and still keeps in a comer of his office. He also gained recognition for communicating with a bullhorn and for the enforcement of punishment that found students cleaning latrines or scrubbing graffiti off the walls for the slightest infractions.
Clark did not only make superficial changes at Eastside. He also emphasized a better curriculum, parent participation in school functions, and the individuality of students in a large urban school. Clark personally believes that his greatest accomplishment at Eastside was the “installation of morale amongst students, parents, faculty, and staff’ (Time, Feb. 1988).
Although Clark’s innovative hard-line approach won much support, he also met
14
Joe Clark in a 1988 issue of Time
criticism for his unorthodox tactics. Many of Clark’s opponents found his treatment of the students and his intolerance for insurrection overly harsh. "If the students were not poor black children, Joe Clark would not be tolerated," said Los Angeles Prepatory High principal George McKenna (Time, Feb. 1988). Clark also alienated many faculty members during his tenure as principal, with over one-hundred faculty members departing in a six-year period.
Despite the criticism, those who believed in Clark’s motives stuck by his actions. Jack Berdy, Chairman and CEO of On-Line software, pledged $1 million dollars in scholarships to Eastside over the next ten years if the School Board would resolve their conflicts.
Throughout all the publicity, Clark remains stauch in his opinions concerning the inadequacies and needs of public school systems, particularly the nation’s inner city schools. “Education in America is not that good. Education in our inner city schools is horrendous,” said Clark in a telephone interview with Scholastic.
Clark cites the high illiteracy rate, drugs, and violence in these inner city schools as evidence of the grave state of education in
America. “Our young people are roasting in cesspools of inadequacy and impotence,” said Clark. He insists that the potential of our youths is not being utilised. “Public education as we know it today is brain dead and muscle bound.”
The school administrator stresses the importance of education as the key to the betterment of society. He fears that America is on route to becoming the only existing third world industrialized nation; a myriad of unskilled workers employed by other nations. “A weakened educational system means unproductive lives as opposed to productive lives,” said Clark.
He emphasizes that the blame of a failing educational system should not rest upon the shoulders of our nation’s teachers but upon the beaurocracy of a nation that encourages monopolistic, monolithic systems of public education. “We must understand that the present status quo is socially and economically unaffordable,” says Clark
At the economic level, Clark stresses the necessity ofallocaling tax dollarsaway from the government and bcaurocratic officials, and into the hands of parents. He believes . that the implementation of such a voucher system would erase existing inequalities of education. The bulk of education aimed at low-income households is of a lesser quality than that offered to children of higher-income homes. “I do know that inner city schools are inferior to suburban white schools,” says Clark.
Having been commended by President Ronald Reagan and appearing on segments of Donahue, Nightline, and 60 Minutes, Clark has achieved national acclaim for his achievements. The film Lean On Me documents Clark and his experience. The former principal currently serves as Assistant Su-perintendentof Schools. He will be presenting a lecture in Stepan Center sponsored by the Notre Dame Student Union Board on Thursday, October 11, at 7:00 pm □

Enjoying their fastest start since 1982, the 5-0 Pittsburgh Panthers are looking for revenge against a Notre Dame team, that has beat them up over the last three seasons
By Jim Kaser
“This is an emotional Pitt Panther team. IVe have been playing well, and we will continue to do so”
— University of Pittsburgh coach Paul Hackett
The last time that the University of Pittsburgh defeated Notre Dame on the gridiron was in 1987 when the Panthers beat the Fighting Irish 30-22. Since that time, Notre Dame has been on a roll, beating Pitt 30-20 in 1988, 45-7 in 1989, and 31-22 in 1990. Of these three consecutive victories, Notre Dame’s 45-7 blowout in 1989 did the most to damage Panther pride because Pitt entered that contest ranked in everybody’s Top 15. Thus the stage is set for this Saturday when a 5-0 Pitt team will storm the field in South Bend to take on a 4-1 Notre Dame team.
The Panthers are again ranked in everybody’s Top 15 and arc certainly looking to avenge three consecutive losses to the Fighting Irish, Notre Damecoach Lou Holtz will have his team mentally and physically prepared for a grudge match, given that game films show Pitt’s poise
and power in its victories over opponents such as West Virginia and Southern Mississippi. This is a much improved Pitt team over last year’s 3-7-1 squad that, despite losing to Notre Dame, banged up the Fight

ing Irish pretty badly (Pitt sidelined Notre Dame’s All-American noseguard Chris Zorich with a dislocated knee cap). Pitt is al ways physical, and this Saturday will be no exception. This game will be won by the team that hits the hardest, and for hard hitting watch twin brothers Devon McDonald, a starting linebacker for Notre Dame, and Ricardo McDonald, a starting linebacker for Pitt. It is a sure thing that the fraternal spirit will not prevent these two from packing a punch.
As for an outlook on Pitt’s team: This team is tough. Pitt will be led by 20 seniors, none of whom have beaten Notre Dame and all of whom are determined to do so.
“The seniors are the ones with the mostatstake,” said coach Hackett. “They want a win over the Irish before they graduate. It is now or never.”
The bulk of Pitt’s experienceshows upon the offensive side of the ball where 41 lettermen and 14 starters return, including one of the nation’s premier quarterbacks, Alex Van Pelt. Van Pelt has been one of the
OCTOBER 10, 1991
15
most proficient passers in Panther history.
“Alex has many attributes as a quarterback/’ said Hackett. “He may be the best ba 11 hand 1 i ng quarterback in college football. He has great accuracy as a passer; he is fearless; he stands in the pocket under pressure as well as any quarterback I have ever coached. He knows who to throw too, and how to get the ball to the open man.”
Van Pelt has an excellent supporting cast with him on offense. The backfield consists of seniors Jermaine Williams and Glenn Deveaux, both of whom will split time at tail back and fullback. The most troublesome runningback for Notre Dame, however, will be sophomore Kevin Williams who, in the words of coach Hackett, is “a smart, tough, elusive back with breakaway speed. He can make you or break you. He is a special talent.”
Van Pelt has tremendous tightends to
whom he throws the ball early and often, “Our tightends may be the best all-around players on our team, given their talent, depth, and experience,” said Hackett. The return of seniors Eric Seaman and Dave Moore along with the arrival of junior col-
lege All-American Rob Coons may prove a “So can Sean Gilbert, an immensely gifted
blessing for the Panthers this Saturday. Van Pelt also has speedsters at the widcouts to whom he throws early and often. Senior Chris Bouyerand juniors Clifford Moncrief and Junior Green can be counted on to perform. Van Pelt receives good protection from a monstrous offensive line ranging in weight from 275 tb 305 pounds.
As for the defense, coach Hackett has no hesitations about naming his main men. He said, “On the defensive line, we have two of the most-physically imposing forces in the country. Junior end Keith Hamilton, a 6-7, 280-pound pass rushing terror, spent the offseason preparing himself for his best season yet.”
Courtesy of University of Pittsburgh Sports Information
Pitt linebacker Ricardo McDonald will try to outdo his twin brother Devon, who plays linebacker for the Irish.
Hamilton was The Sporting News Dcfcn-
sive Freshman of the Year in 1989, a sopho
more All-American in 1990, and a 1991 preseason first-tcam All-American. He has led Pitt in quarterback sacks in each of his last two seasons and is the type of player that can take control of the battle in the trenches.
“Keith can dominate,” continued Hackett.
junior end who Hanks Hamilton on the right side. Gilbert had just begun to make a serious impact last year when he suffered a knee injury that caused him to miss five games. He came back late in the year and turned in his finest performance against Penn Stale. At 6-6, 300 pounds, Gilbert is quick, ferocious, and mighty hard to handle.”
Along with these two, there is junior nose tackle Jeff Esters, who at 6-3, 277 pounds has earned his nickname, “Big Daddy.”
The only position where there is senior leadership on the defensive side of the ball is at linebacker where three seniors, Ricardo McDonald, Nelson Walker, and Curtis Bray, fill out the roster. Coach Hackett is
high in his praise of McDonald, “Ricardo is our main man at linebacker, one of the finest in the country. A three-year starter on the outside, he is an explosive player who is capable of dominating a game. He applies good pressure on the passer, shown by his 7.5 quarterback sacks last season.”
The Panther linebackers will have to rise to the occasion by picking up the slack for a secondary which, Hackett admitted, “probably has more question marks than any other position on the team.” Juniors Bobby Boykin, Vernon Lewis, and Lex Perkins are all big hitters, but they lack game experience because the entire Pitt secondary graduated last spring. This shortcoming should help the RickMircrand Co., aerial show to shine.
Pitt is one of those
leams that is tough to call. Sometimes ac
cused of not showing enough emotion and
sometimes accused of showing too much emotion, the Panthers have a history of playing to the level of their competition, whether they win or lose. So far this season, this team seems to be different. With the exception of its secondary, this team has experience, it
has poise and it has confidence. But, this
Saturday, it has Noire Dame. The Fighting Irish will be the Panthers’ first true test. Piu will put its undefeated record on the line and will play physical football to preserve it. But when push comes to shove, this game will belong io Notre Dame.
The Fighting Irish have owned the Panthers for three years and there is no forcsec-ablecnd to this trend, barring a letdown after beating up the Stanford Cardinal. Both teams have talent, strength, and speed, but Notre Dame has Lou Holtz and Notre Dame will be better prepared for this game.
Pitt is a good team, hot a great team. But talk is cheap, and the final say will belong to the players on the gridiron.	□

Carnegie Mellon hopes to inform the participants of the various civic and cultural centers at their disposal. Free food and transportation are included to make the deal sweeter. Plans are underway for a similar tour of the riches of the greater Michiana. The tour offers visits to area favorites incl udi ng Fat S hirley ’s Truckstop, The World ’ s Only Five Comers, and the Supreme Court celebrated Kitty Kat Lounge. In addition, participants will be introduced to local customs such as velvet painting and leaf burning and the proper way to say “pop” (paahp) and “cash” (caish).
Batting Averages vs. The Periodic Chart
Kids in Oregon are throwing away their boring baseball cards for something a little more stimulating. The Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology began printing “scientist trading cards,” in hopes that scientists will one day be as valued as baseball players. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, the cards feature photographs of faculty members and a synopsis of the professor's specialty. The card on professor Richard Johnson, for example, outlines his studies on groundwater contamination, while that on David Grainger details his artificial membrane design. The kids in Oregon better be ready for this much excitement. Never let it slip your mind that'geek’only contains two e’s as opposed to engineer.
Does This Have Anything To Do With Fahrvergnugen?
Students at the College of Wooster get more than they bargained for when they register for a class called, “Volswirtschaftslehre.” The course focuses on economics and German — simultaneously. Professor John W. Sell states that the title simply means“economics,”and the class is nothing more than a standard introduction to the basics. The clincher, however, is that it's taught in German. According to The College Press Service, an English textbook is used, but all classes, homework and exams are in German. Sell claims that. “This course couln't have happened at a better time,” because German is a primary language in Eastern Europe. Possible crossbreedings of courses in the future may include Daoist Auto Repair and!7th Cenutry Amish Warfare.

What Would You Do
Without Upperclassmen?
A quote from The New York Times on the college beer siuation reads, “With fake I.D. cards and the tribal loyalties of a close-knit campus, under-age drinking persists at fraternity houses (Rutgers), eating clubs (Princeton), off-campus residences and dormitory parties. A vigilant student can can stay within the letter of the law and still get a drink from a sympathetic upperclassman.” □

Squirrels are Domers Just Like You and Me
? Dear Mr. Manners:
f:	I have a few good questions about the squirrels. First...how
long do they live, and how come I don’t see squirrel corpses on ! : campus? I mean, the squirrel density on this campus is a high I one, and thus, therefore, there must be dead ones. They must die. Who picks them up?
| Andtheymustpoop;howcomeldon’tseesquirrelpoop? Are j these actually surely little remote control maintenance-free mechanical beasties guided by the hand of the administration in j	an attempt to make, therefore, the campus more friendly, con-
.	sequently? I mean, one sat on my foot the other day!! (no joke
Mr. Manner Guy, no kidding, 100% truth, no cheese, one solid block of truth, no quivering Play Dough.) Real squirrels die, real squirrels poop, and real squirrels don’t sit on my feet, and they - aren’tthesizeofsmalldogs,and theystay in the gosh dang trees, and there aren’t 18 million of them in one quad!! I mean what the goshdarn dang heck is*going on here? Do you know what I mean Mr. Manner thingy?
ii	Just a kid,
Brian
j	Sophomore
Step into the shoe of moral thought, carry the bag of loyalty, and ride the horse of ethics into the bam of the community. Yes, everyone and everything at Notre Dame is part of the community. Even the little squirrels abide by the standards of our community. True, they do not poop; true, they are a little more friendly; yes, they are immortal.
They are model domers. We are all special in our own little way and all contribute to the community. So just hug yourself for being you, and hug the squirrels for being them.
Now that I have set you straight, do not refer to me as Mr. Mariners thingy. I am Mr. Manners to you, immature dittybag.
Dear Mr. Manners:
I have this problem. Whenever I go out drinking with my boyfriend and overconsume, I get in the car with him. In ten minutes, I start clawing at the window and proceed to toss my cookies. The first time I ralphed on the pavement of a Shell station. The second time I hurled a plate of spaghetti on the landscaping of Lafayette Square. Mr. Manners, how can I learn to hold my alcohol better?
PS. I love the little guys, but I am curious!
Dear Brian:
Obviously, you drink Comet cocktails and don’t get many dates. But may I step back from the harsh onslaught of insults that is poised on my tongue and introduce to you an idea you may not have considered:
Community.
Signed,
Loose, P.W.
Dear Loose:
I didn't know quite how to deal with this situation, so I took the liberty of forwarding your letter and pictures to your parents. You should be getting a call soon.
Anyway, must you be so graphic? Most of my readers will be eating as they read this and are not interested in your Technicolor sprays. Hey, it may not be your tolerance. Maybe it's your boyfriend.	• □

WEEK IN DISTORTION
Summer of My Deliverance
A Late But Worthwhile Examination of Summer With The Clampets
Summer: a magical season meant for plucking verdant blades of grass between your toes. It’s a shimmering daydream, lost somewhere in a Norman Rockwell calendar, filled with hometown baseball, sunburned shoulders, and skinny-dip-Ping-
Or... a nightmare plagued by the demonic forces from the stinking bowels of Hell itself.
As the Pharoah had locusts, I was besieged this summer by a clan known as “the Clampets.” They go by many names—Red Necks, Grits, Mall Rats — but all share similar traits in this prestigious club. The males eat Spam on Wonderbread and refer to their shotgun and/or penis as “Thumper.” The females, in hair rollers, beat their kids at K-Mart. The teenagers cruise the malls in Tesla t-shirts, driving black Camaroes with airbrushed license plates reading “Bobby ‘n Tammy 4-cvcr.”
They ’ re the Clampets, and they want your sanity.
This summer I savored moments of freedom like a tankard of frothing mead. I spent much of my free-time with my friends at a swimming hole in the Tennessee mountains. Two miles off a winding road, through beastial shrubbery teeming with ferocious mongooses, one stumbles upon Eden. Here wo battled rapids like Tarzan of the Apes, thinking our oasis would not by defiled by heathen infidels. Yet one Sunday morning, we came upon the dreaded Clampets.
The leader of the tribe stood on the crest of a large boulder; tattered cut-offs his only covering, his tangled mane cascading down around a woolly beard. He held alofta “Red,
White, and Blue” beer, drained it in one mighty gulp, and let outa harrowing warcry. At Molly Hatchett’s feet lay his harem, chain-smoking Marlboros. The children climbed on every available tree, rope, and rock, throwing small aquatic animals at one another.
“Boy, you got a purty mouth,” said the leader, loosening his belt, as “Dueling Banjos” was heard in the breeze. Like Marlin Perkins of “Mututal of Omaha’s Wild Kingdom,” we retreated making no sudden movements. We then encountered a Clampet young’un named “Little Harold,” who, holding up a squealing mammal, proudly announced: “mole.” As blood trickled down
■■Grits,
his hand, he added, “Sucker sure can bite.”
My friends then planned a grand Florida journey of mirth and debauchery. Cruel fate chose to once again cough a huge ball of phlegm into my life. The second day there we discovered the Clampets lived in the hotel next to ours.
As I dug out my eyes with a rusty spoon, my friend murmured “They are Legion, and they are. many.”
The men-folk, all wearing camouflaged
baseball hats, charged into the water like rabid possums, yelling “I’ll show you a Moby Dick.” The family unit moved en masse between volleyball, spearing fish, and drinking large quantities of RC Cola.
“You lookin’ for something?” asked one pup,as my friend Jeff and I waded in the afternoon tide.
“No, why?” I naively responded.
“You lookin’ for this?” asked the lad, now holding up some sort of large bone.
“No! What is that?”
“You want it?” he asked, grinning broadly.
Before I could dash his head against a rock, he threw the object, which landed between Jeff and me.
“Good Lord, I think this is cartilage ... from a shark,” stammered Jeff.
I wondered if it was Loki, the god of mischief, who had cursed me. This was the final blow; I could fight no more. It was time to become a member of the White Trash aristocracy.
I presented the dripping growth to a Clampet female, who in tum offered me a plug of Red Man. Our courtship complete, the Clampet chieftain slapped a “Harley Davidson” hat on my head, gave me a bear hug, and named me “Earl.” I now look forward to working on one of twelve cars rusting in their front yard, inbreeding, and eating plenty of beef jerky.
Summer sure is grand.	□

Glancing Back
A history of the airwaves
By Mary Murphy
An announcer and technician at the WND station In 1954.

T ikemany56-year-oldsintheentertain-AJment business, WVFI has faced death, undergone surgery, and moved several times. It is a station with a colorful history.
Student radio at Notre Dame began in 1935 when the Notre. Dame Radio Club presented dramatic, musical and campus news shows over the South Bend station WBST. The club continued in this format until 1946. World War II sharply reduced the Radio Club’s activity, but student interest remained strong.
The Radio Club came back to life early in 1947 when Frank Cronan, an electrical engineer, purchased a radio transmitter with the remaining funds in the club’s treasury. The club members transmitted a sporadic broadcast to the campus from Cronan’s
room in Walsh Hall, tagging themselves WND. This marked the start of independent student radio at Notre Dame.
Cronan kept the station alive by convincing the administration of the promise of a student station. He also pointed out that local advertising could make this venture self-supporting. The administration and the F.C.C. approved of the station, somewhat begrudgingly, and WND had officially begun.
In the fall of 1948, Cronan and his friends set up their studio in the band room in Washington Hall. Soon afterwards, the administration informed Cronan and his crew they had to move the whole operation. They patiently moved their station to the windy stadium press box, determined to
make this idea work.
The administration gave the students a $300 grant and promised them permanent facilities.
The money went toward acoustical paneling and an improved carrier current system installed in the steam tunnels. With their new instruments, the Radio Club was able to start consistent broadcasting on February 9, 1947.
The “facilities” turned out to be in the Notre Dame fieldhouse. The studios were located directly next to the gym which was frequently used by many indoor athletes, particularly the Bengal Bouters. With the movement and noise in the adjoining room, the WND engineers would see their record levels leap several grooves with each loud

thump audible from next door.
Despite these difficulties in getting started, WND grew rapidly. The station originally broadcasted two hours a day, five days a week. The student body reacted favorably from the start, so the station branched out to do remote broadcasts of home basketball and basebal 1 games, as well as Bengal Bouts and other on-campus events. Through increased advertising, the ! station bought new equipment and expanded the record library, thus extending its broadcast time. WND had quickly established its “Voice of the Fighting Irish” and its commitment to serving the student body.
By 1953, it was clear that the station had outgrown the fieldhouse facilities. The administration offered WND a place in O’Shaughnessy Hall where the station remained until 1986.
Soon after WND moved to O’Shaughnessy, a sister station was formed. In 1959, Thomas Musical helped to form Channel II, a classical music radio station. It shared WND’s resources and location in O’Shaughnessy, but its identity was completely separate from its AM sister. In 1962, Channel II acquired an F.C.C. license and was able to broadcast to the South Bend community as WSND-FM.
The University presented WSND-FM with a $25,000 grant through the Ford Foundation. This enabled the station to boost its power and broadcast to a 45-mile radius around the northwestern area of Indiana. By 1986, WSND had the largest record library in northern Indiana.
During WSND-FM’s growth, WSND-AM made many improvements. It innovated its programming, adding special news and dramatic programs while expanding its news and sports coverage. In the early 1980’s, the WSND-AM began a drive for better equipment, because it viewed the original carrier current system as out of date and useless.
In 1984, WSND-AM put in a bid for an FM frequency. However, the station could not find an open frequency that would not bring on competition to weaken the station’s position. The bid was withdrawn, but a name change had occurred. WSND-AM
A staffer reading the newswire in 1954.
became WVFI-AM, the Voice of the Fighting Irish.
At this time, Kurt Holzberlein, the station manager and program director instituted new F.C.C. logs and strengthened WVFI’s progressive/new music format. Holzberlein also helped to establish the station as a leader in sponsoring campus events and concerts.
When the administration proposed that WVFI move to LaFortune in 1986, there were many concerns of the current senior staff at WVFI. With the move of the AM record library, they worried that the popular FM program “Nocturne Nightflight” would cease to exist. They also feared that since the stations shared staff and facilities, the stations could not financially afford the burden of splitting their resources.
“The quick-fix model of doing something is the reason that WVFI-AM is in its present condition ;— once more — and WVFI becomes part of Notre Dame history,” said Reginald Daniel, the station manager and program director, in 1986.
The move to LaFortune did occur, and WVFI is still broadcasting. One problem that has plagued the station since its inception still remains: poor reception. This is
partially why WVFI is interested in switching to the FM band.
WVFI is presently operating on a carrier current system (CCS). It uses a multiple transmitter/multiple building process that operates through a central transmitter within a group of buildings. It is split-fed into a coupler in each building in the group. Each transmitter then splits networks into multiple outputs. These outputs are then run through lengths of coaxial cable in the steam tunnels to each building that needs broadcast ■ coverage. Each cable is then run through a coupler wired into each building’s electrical system.
WVFI is currently an alternative music station located at 640 on the AM dial. Il boasts seven specialty shows each week, a sports show and syndicated shows. It also announces campus news and events several times each hour. The staff is made up of students from all colleges of the university.
Today WSND remains a public broadcasting radio station featuring mainly classical music with special programming for public affairs, jazz and Celtic music. Reggae and rock are featured nightly from midnight to 2 a.m.
Although some feel campus radio serves only a small segment of the population, apparently the radio station has had a history of attracting eccentric students as seen in the May 11,1962 issue of Scholastic: “Last Friday the warm weather brought out some of the usual phenomena: water hoses, sunbathers, noisy crowds of freshmen in search of something to get excited about. We note also that two retiring senior WSND announcers tried that evening to stage a 36-hour marathon broadcast, having barricaded 'themselves in the studio and announced their intentions over the airwaves. The listeners apparently thought it was going to be a good show, and kept the lines busy with encouraging calls. Unfortunately, the broadcast was abruptly terminated at 12:30 a.m;, after only two and a half hours. The harried station manager, after hearing the ebullient pair dedicate a “twist” number to President Hesburgh, armed himself with wire cutters and brave the heat of the steam tunnels to cut the transmission line.” □

FINAL WORD
The Ecological Crisis as a Moral Crisis
Jon Peppetti urges some reconsideration of environmental attitudes
How often have you unconsciously cleaned a paint brush in a sink? Have you ever sprayed a garden with chemicals to kill unwanted insects? Do you remember leaving your car running for “just a second” while you ran into a store? Undoubtedly, we are all guilty of these and other thoughtless acts. Nevertheless, by answering “yes” to such questions, we must accept responsibility for today’s ecological crisis. Unfortunately, I believe too few people have identified the ecological crisis as a true crisis of morality. Instead of relying on scientists to completely solve our problems, each person must recognize his or her moral obligation to initiate attitudinal change and promote environmental awareness.
Admittedly, I am not an environmental expert, nor am I an authority in matters of morality. However, I believe that anyone with an appreciation for nature is entitled to speak out on th is issue. It is no secret that today’s human society is characterized by its wanton disregard for and manipulation of the fragile environment. Mankind has elevated itself to a position above the rest of creation; a position which exalts human “intelligence” and justifies the manipulation of nature and its resources for social and economic gain. We have disrupted a carefully balanced exchange of energy because we have attempted to live as independent creatures within a dependent environmental system.	»
Rather than exercise dominance over
24
the creatures and resources found on earth, we must serve as stewards, caretakers of this planet for future generations. Unfortunately, the argument that we must protect the environment exclusively because it is God’s handiwork appears ludicrous in today’s materialistic and consumer-driven world; such a plea most often falls upon deaf ears. And yet above all, as students at a Catholic university, we must ask the fundamental question: What is the relationship between our basic Christian faith and our reverence and responsibility for the environment?
In addition to having obvious ecological repercussions, today’s environmental cri-' sis also carries social justice implications. Environmental concerns must naturally lead us to consider the exploitation of undeveloped nations by those with advanced resources and technology. Additionally, a balance must be achieved between ecological concerns and the need for employment, just wages, decent living conditions, and economic advancement. If current trends continue, what will the long term effects of our present behavior prove to be? Ultimately, is maintaining our high standard of living worth destroying the earth?
Certainly, it is absurd to believe that any individual could solve these immense environmental problems alone. As companions in creation, however, all people have an obligation to prevent further damage to our environment. While the importance of recycling and conservation cannot be un
derestimated, perhaps what is most needed is a return to a lifestyle of simplicity, moderation and discipline as well as a spirit of sacrifice. Realistically, do I believe such a transformation of attitudes is possible? I don’t know. As far as it is possible, however, the effort must begin with you, the individual. In this matter you have to believe you can make a difference.
Admittedly, perhaps I am too much of an idealist regarding human nature and the prospects for change. Even though the world population’s awareness of the seriousness of the environmental issue has never been higher, abuse is just too prevalent in our culture today. Luxuries, such as clean air and water, are not just taken for granted, but wasted without concern. Humanity’s carelessness and environmental domination has disrupted natural processes which have been ongoing for millions and millions of years. Certainly, final solutions to the ecological crisis will not be easily achieved. However, the challenge is not insurmountable. Ultimately, what is needed to initiate a vigorous response to the environmental issue is not a focus on the scientific aspects of the problem, but rather a focus on the moral and ethical dilemmas encountered through society’s abuse of nature. The ecological crisis today is truly a moral crisis. □
Jon Peppetti, a senior history major, hopes to one day confront these issues as an environmental attorney.
