NOTRE DAME, INDIANA, AUGUST 5, 1882.	No. 1.
A Vestal.
“ Take back thy words, go past and let me be. Fond praises come too late, O man, to me!
I chose thee. Pain, for bridegroom, when I saw That in thy hands were honor, life and law. Weak as a wand that strikes the stream apart. Chill as a death-touch laid against-the heart, Vainer than friendship when the world is old, Seem love-gifts to the heart that has grown cold.” Marion Muir.
The Influence of Literature upon the Mind.
It has been said that all animals are determined as to nature and appearance by their places of habitation, and the food on which they subsist. Thus the fish reflects the silvery waters, or catches the golden tint imparted by the setting sun. The humming-bird, sipping the nectar from the cups of delicate flowers, is graceful and beautiful like the floral gem that supplies its nourishment. While, on the contrary, the repulsive appearance of the vulture but corresponds to his disgusting diet. As with animal nature, so, too, is it with the spiritual, when united with the material, as in man. The human individual is a compound of soul and body, and during the present life, because of the intimate union existing between these two sub-stances, a mutual influence is exercised, the one acting upon the other; so that the appearance as well as the habits of an individual may often enable us to determine the character and bent of his mind. But, independently of this, there is a food for the soul as well as for the body; and it is according to the quality of this intellectual food that the mind of the individual is, we might say, like material things, framed and fashioned.
How different is the mind that has been nurtured on scientific knowledge from the one filled with romance! how different the intellect imbued with ideas suggested by a pm Christian literature from the one poisoned with n religious sentiments! Sometimes we find individuals from whom it is impossible to extract a reverent thought; their minds have been fed by flippant, irreverent literature until they have become distorted. There are also individuals of unbounded curiosity, whose minds have become fickle and unstable,—rthe result of promiscuous, badly-directed reading.
Again, we meet with individuals, men of .talent, even genius, evidently sent into the world for a grand purpose, but whose minds, through the effect of vicious literature, have led them to despise the law of God. The effect of such minds on society is like the odor of the Upas, fatal to all who breathe its poisonous exhalations.
But consider the wonderful influence which an individual can exercise for good over his fellow-men when his intellectual powers have been developed, through proper and judicious study. Such, among the ancients, were the rich minds of Aristotle, Socrates, Plato, who gave an impetus to science which will last through future ages!' It was the excellent mind of Pericles that enabled him to ex-ercisc such an influence over the Athenians that the golden age of Greece is called the Age of Pericles.
But grander and more sublime is the effect of o	__
the intellects of the early Christian Fathers. How carefully have the productions of a Chrysostom, a Nazianzen or a Poly carp been studied by Christian philosophers and theologians! In our own times we could never estimate the good accom-______________________________	o
plished by the writings of a Faber, a Newman or a Manning; men whose works are the choicest consistent with truth and graced with rhetorical beauties, directing the mind of man to its highest and noblest aim. In the words of Father Faber, “What is grander than to lead one soul to God?” It cannot be denied that much of the literature in circulation is a great incentive to crime. It mag-nifies and holds up to admiration the valor of the criminal, the shrewdness of the robber, and the wit of the outlaw.
The great evil caused by the light romance of the day is due to the veil of deception it throws over the mind, concealing vice under the appearance of virtue. This is most artfully accomplished through a fine covering of flowery language and plausible arguments, which flatter the self-love of the reader, and intoxicate his brain, filling it with pride and vanity. The intellect, failing to realize the injury which it receives from such literature, continues to indulge therein and finds useful and profitable reading tedious and distasteful. The merely sentimental novel may make the young reader imagine he is deriving great benefit from the morals and beautv of character described by the writer. But the manner in which such readers act when brought face to face with trials, their carelessness, indiffer

ence and negligence in the performance of the duties of life, show that the virtue they thought implanted within them was mere sentimentalism.
“ How empty learning, how vain is art, .
But as it forms the mind and improves the heart! ”
The literary world in which we live may be compared to a fruitful garden. In one portion is found the rich scientific lore that, like the healthy esculent, is the source of nourishment and strength. We find also the rich wheat of true philosophy and the refreshing grape of Christian poetry which develop and nourish the noblest part of our nature, imparting to the mind a dignity and grace that is reflected in the whole exterior.' In yet another part of this domain we find the poisonous plants of infidelity and the sleep-producing poppy of sensational fiction, wrapping the mind in a fatal, delusive slumber.
Now, as literature exercises such a great influence over the mind, and is such an important element in the formation of character, it is certainly a conscientious duty for everyone to seek that which is purest and best. For, “as out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh,” so out of the purity and richness of the mind will the memory gather beautiful thoughts and elevating sentiments with which to delight and benefit man-
kind.

Phonography—The French System.*
Phonography, or the art of writing words according to their pronounciation, with an alphabet of brief, simple, and easily formed straight lines, curves, circles and hooks, has been making such rapid progress in this country and Europe during the last decade that there is a prospect of its being soon understood and practised by all classes and ages. The non-stenographic reader will not be surprised at this when he is told that letters which in ordinary long-hand require from five to seven strokes of the pen—n and in, for instance—are made with a single brief stroke, and that the longest words are written with greater ease and rapidity and with fewer inflections than an ordinary long-hand capital letter; furthermore that hundreds of the words in most frequent use can be' written as quickly as a dot can be made with the pen-point, and that often two, three, four, and even five or six of these words are written connectively, without lifting the pen, and without impairing the legibility of the writing. Among English-speaking people the system of phonography most in use is that invented by Isaac Pitman, of England, in 1837; in Germany, Gabels-berger’s has a large following; in France the system of the Abbe Duployb—adapted by Mr. Pernin to the English language, and now before us for review—stands without a rival. Shortly after its introduction in France, about fifteen years ago,
* Pernin’s Phonographic Instructor: An Adaptation to the English of the Duployan French System. 3d Edition. Detroit, Michigan: H. M. Pernin. 1SS2. 52 pages, i2mo., paper 50 cents; cloth, $1.
Duployd’s phonography was authorized by the Minister of Public Instruction (July x8, 1872), adopted into the schools and colleges, and from the primary' schools to the universities it became a general study. By general accord it was selected as the standard and exclusively French system of phonography, all other methods being discarded. At the Universal Exposition in 1878, the Abbb Duploye received the only gold .medal awarded to stenographic inventors. At the same Exposition, school-boys thirteen years old are said to have reported speeches verbatim, for which they received gold medals—a feat that should make our American and English boys blush, so far as stenography is concerned. Duployd’s phonography has not been confined exclusively to France; Lc Ture, at Constantinople, is printed in its characters; so also is the Anglo-French Stenographer, at Dundee, Scotland; it possesses a paper in Switzerland, and one in Africa. France alone prints sixteen journals in Duploye stenography, and in addition to the shorthand matter furnished by these, a stenographic library has been established which now contains about 1,000 volumes and is rapidly increasing. These books embrace a variety of subjects, from the Fables of Lafontaine to the scientific works of Descartes and Cuvier; works upon religious subjects, history, chemistry, botany, astronomy, political economy, poetry, etc., are to be found upon the shelves, and are widely read. In the long list of stenographic books published by the Abbd Duployb at Le Grand Stenographe, 12, Rue N. D. de Nazareth, Paris, are many that are familiar in an English dress to English readers; among others the Little Catechism of Christian Doctrine; the “Imitation of Christ,” by Thomas a Kempis, the “Way of the Cross,” “Prayers for Mass,” “ Vespers and Complin,” “ Morning and Evening- Prayers,” and other devotinal books; the Lives of St. Catharine, St. Barbara, etc., and among a large number of story-books, Fenelon’s “Telemachus,” “Robinson Crusoe,” “Henry of Eichenfels,” “Rose of Tannenbourg,” etc. In sad contrast to this wealth of literature is the paucity of stenographic matter in our English systems, with the exception only of Mr. Isaac Pitman’s, which has a respectable list, but contains not a single Catholic work. The fact that many of our most famous stenographic reporters are Catholics, both in this country and in England, and that phonography is taught in many of our Catholic schools and colleges, should induce Mr. Pitman and others to bring out books that would not only be well patronized but also give an impetus to the study of the art. That our French brethren should have run so far ahead of us in fifteen years seems strange, .especially as phonography originated with us, and has now been in existence for nearly half a century. The cause of this is the absence of united effort on bur part, owing primarily to the desertion of Mr. Pitman by his brother and others, who many years ago refused to follow him in his improvements, and have since continued the original Pitman system, with a few modifications and additions of their own.

THE NOTRE bAME SCHOLASTIC.
Whether DuploytS’s system .will meet with a measure of the success here that it did in France, where it had the field to itself, is doubtful. The book before us being but a primary one, going as far only as the corresponding style, no comparison can be made between it and Mr. Pitman’s for brevity; but for both simplicity and brevity it is far superior to any of the other connective vowel systems that have come to our notice. The characters have but two lengths, those for cognate sounds being paired by difference of lengths,- instead of shade as in Pitman’s and Everett’s there are no shaded strokes, and but one position—on the line. The system is written with connective vowels, like Lindsley’s and Cross’s, and possesses all the advantages, without many of the. more serious drawbacks of its competitors. The numerous and fearfully overloaded positions of- Cross’s Elcectic are especially objectionable, and leave it no chance of competition with Duployd; but whether the latter can obtain sufficient brevity for verbatim reporting without sacrificing simplicity is for time and the appearance of the Reporter’s Manual to decide.

Godfrey de Bouillon.
Among the names which grace historic lore, Of times when Christian chivalry gave birth To valor fraught with zeal for things Divine, And love of places sanctified by Him Whose life for us was spent, for us was given, Shines that of Godfrey—noble son of France. He, hearing from the fervent hermit saint The woes of Christians in the Holy Land, Was touched in heart, soul-fired with high resolve, To free the Holy Sepulchre or die!
His ardor scarce could wait th’approach of Spring, When, with his brave young knights and numerous men, He sailed from France to meet the Saracen.
’Twere long to tell of battles not a few, Of perils, sickness, treachery, thwarted hopes, Surmounted by the power of living faith,— Godfrey, at last, before the sacred walls, With Christian host the Turkish foe engage. They fight, despair—then fight again, and hope. For Godfrey in the heavens sees a sign, A warrior, clad in white, who urged them on.
The day is won; the soldiers of the Cross, Their armor cast aside, with humble mien Before the Holy Sepulchre pour out, With tears repentant, prayerful gratitude. This task of love performed, they now resolve To choose for king the noblest, bravest knight. “ De Bouillon! ” shout they all with one accord,— “ Youth, valor, piety in him combine, To form the fittest king. Then offer him
The golden crown, to mark his worth and power.”
“Nay, stay ye, friends,” the noble knight exclaims;
“ Dare I presume a crown of gold to wear
When God in human guise was crowned with thorns ?
Henceforth let me be known, not as your king, But by the title far more glorious, “ Strong Defence of God’s most Holy Sepulchre.” “So be it!” cried they all again with joy.
Scarce ten months passed. The Autumn sun had set; O’er Syrian mountains evening’s robes were thrown; Rose-tinted clouds to purple merged,—and sweet The distant sound of Vesper-bell. But hark!
’Tis tolling now; a white-robed train advance.
With reverence follow. Silver tongues proclaim. Sweet Sacrament, that Thou art borne to soothe Death’s terrors in some weary Christian heart Whose time on earth is full, whose crown is won.
Aye, noble Godfrey! meet that thou shouldst die
' Thus, ere the laurels faded on thy brow,—
Exchange them for the heavenly crown. “ Go thou In peace, brave Christian soul,” exclaims’ God’s priest,— The shadows deepened—Death the conquest made.
Since then long years have passed, but Godfrey’s name Still lives in Christian hearts, and oft it fires
Youth’s emulation. Thus our humble verse,	'
A modest violet on -his tomb we place.

St. Mary’s Academy, Notre Dame, Ind.
A Visit to St. Mary’s Academy.
In the latter part of June I was returning- from a prolonged visit East to my far-distant Western home, accompanied by a young lady who had suddenly been bereft of both parents. My object was to assuage by a change of scene her great sorrow.
We had travelled slowly, stopping wherever the surroundings gave promise of cheerfulness and repose. At our return, about the time of the closing throughout the country of most educational establishments, the morning papers brought by the newsboys on the train were eagerly bought up by the passengers, many of whom were going to attend such closing exercises; while others, with their happy sons and daughters, were already homeward bound. The gentlemen were soon comparing and discussing the various descriptive accounts, and the advantage schools in retired situations had over those kept among the distracting turmoil of city surroundings. It was a source of amusement to watch the look of satisfaction on the faces of the young students when their Alma. Mater was in turn the subject of comment, and we were beginning to feel quite interested in these matters when the conductor called out, in a stentorian ' voice, “ South Bend” As the" train slackened, we looked out with a feeling common to travel-lers—a vague hope of seeing a known face, even when they are certain of the impossibility. What a scene met our gaze! The long platform literally jammed with persons waiting to board our train, to which were quickly attached as many carriages as the locomotive could draw; but to no'purpose,— for as we glided slowly from the depot, we saw still a crowd who must wait for the next train.
THE NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC.
During the buzz of excitement caused by finding places, all eyes were turned on the new-comers, and had ample time to admire the healthy, happy faces of the merry throng of maidens and the evident complacency of papas and mammas intent on disposing carefully the elegant baskets of floral offerings presented to their children by loving friends to compliment their success.
In a few minutes our car presented the appearance of a decorated hall, and was redolent with rich fragrance. Fortunately for my curiosity, a lady and her daughter found a seat opposite us, and a bevy of her companions very near.
Apologizing for interrupting their [conversation, I inquired from what institution they had come. The lady answered, smilingly, “ From St. Mary’s Academy, Notre Dame, Indiana, under the charge, of the Sisters of the Holy Cross.” My exclamations of regret on finding we had been so near this school, whose fame had reached us in the far West, was the opening to a pleasant conversation. She introduced her daughter, whom I found charming, possessing that refined gentleness of manner at once indicating a perfect lady. We exchanged cards, and were soon on social terms.
Noticing several of the young ladies wore handsome gold’medals, I inquired if they were all graduates. “No,” she replied; “not all; those are mostly prize medals for Christian Doctrine, Domestic Economy, History, Languages, Drawing, Painting, etc. The graduates receive a larger medal; but those worthy girls remain a few days to pack up their accumulated treasures of past years ere leaving, perhaps forever.”
A slight shade passed over the faces around at this remark. I saw they, too, were beginning to feel that that day would also come to them. To divert them from the passing pang, I asked to examine the beautiful medal of the young lady.; her mother unclasped it from a heavy chain of chaste workmanship,—the gift of her father, who had not been able to witness his daughter’s triumph. The medal was of elegant design. On reading the inscription, I found it was the graduating medal of the Conservatory of Music. She said another young lady received one for the harp— which was of a lyre form, encircled by a laurel wreath, in lighter-colored gold. Being a great lover of music, at once the whole party launched . forth on this most congenial theme, and I was astonished at the high standard demanded before obtaining the coveted medal. We discussed music, history, different styles of composition, the merits of composers ancient and modern, and their intelligent remarks on these subjects were just and critical. I was informed also that the training in the Art School was equally thorough. They expatiated so on the beauties of their loved St. Mary’s that our regret returned to such a degree that we at last determined to delay our journey, and after a few days’ shopping and rest at Chicago we retraced pur journey as far as South Bend and drove. out to the Academy, which is about two miles distant from that city.
On the way, the driver descanted on the late
Commencement, remarking that we should find things very quiet, and we began to fear our impressions would be of a sombre character, quoting the lines of “ the banquet-hall deserted.” By this time, we entered a long, shaded avenue inclosed by neatly trimmed hedges, which was truly grateful after our warm, dusty ride. The foliage was thick. We were entirely unprepared for the scene of restful beauty which burst suddenly on us as a graceful curve in the road brought us in full view of the lovely park, with the Academy peeping through the trees in the distance. Our imagination could never have pictured this sudden transition to another world. We dismissed the carriage, and, perceiving a rustic seat on the river bank, we sat down, in silent enjoyment of this new Eden. Vases of immense size, filled with rare exotics and tangled vines, dotted the road on both sides as far as the eye could reach. Fountains, evergreens, statuary, mingled between lordly forest trees, whose thick branches sheltered numerous singing birds trilling forth their glorious songs— all these combined beauties would charm even the most fastidious landscape-gardener. At last we rose and walked leisurely along the winding river to catch the charming views of varied grandeur or simple beauty. Our tongues loosened as we emerged from this scene, and exclamations of delight succeeded to that feeling akin to awe which had held us before. Through an opening vista we beheld the Academy—velvet lawns—rich-hued flowers,—and at this point the river dashes by in ' sunlit wavelets, appearing to threaten leaving its high inclosure for the meadow-land below,—the hazy clouds of the far horizon seeming like a chain of majestic mountains hiding this from the outside world. As we gazed, the clouds vanished, and our hills fled, leaving a circlet of blue, which was in still greater harmony with this transcendent vision of brightness.

With such surroundings, no wonder the girls we met a few days past in the cars had the glow of health on their cheeks and merriment in their hearts. We saw the cause at one glance. Here was religion, art, and literary pursuits—all together framed, as it were, in the most glorious natural scenery, where the soul and heart, the understanding and the eye, were alike satisfied.
A few steps brought us to the Academy. Our previous imagination of “deserted halls” flitted. Here were no traces of the immense influx of guests; all teemed with life, and was in perfect order. We found no hesitation, at our kind reception, to reveal our desire to see the three departments of the Academy, for it seemed a pleasure to the Sister to gratify our curiosity. We visited the study-halls, recitation-rooms, and dormitories of the Senior, Junior, and Minim departments—each under separate supervision, with separate classes, etc.,—then the fancy-work and plaimsewing rooms; next, the Conservatory of Music—divided into vocal and instrumental departments. A large and efficient corps of teachers is constantly employed. . I had an opportunity of conversing with several of the Sisters, who gave me full details of the course

of study and methods of teaching. I was soon convinced - music was taught here for the love of the art, and nothing spared to make St. Mary’s i	rank with the first conservatories in the country,

[	vision of the Sister charged with the discipline

J.'-	Beyond the Conservatory is the Museum and
I Library. Here we lingered, examining specimens, so useful to the geology classes, and also the rare curiosities brought here from every land. The Library is separated according to the class to which . i	the tempting volumes belong—Historical, Scientific,
‘	Encyclopaedias, Literature, Musical works, and
•	books of reference pertaining to every branch of ed-
I ucation. Actually we had to tear ourselves away, । —for’the Art Department claimed our attention.
Like the others, this is also divided—into an art gallery, and the studio proper. We first ascended i	to the art gallery, which contains all finished work
in drawing, painting, crayon, etc. Most of the oil paintings, portraits, etc., were already packed, to ,	be sent to the young artists to adorn their own
homes,—but enough remained to show this must :	have been a place of great interest to visitors when
filled with works of such intrinsic worth. All around the large hall, in recesses formed by the many windows, in lockers, are a huge collection of engravings taken from the treasures of the Old „	World. These are most valuable as guides to the pu-
f	pils who will make the grand tour after their studies
are completed. They will know where to find ’	the originals by the great masters, and the places
where these monuments of architecture, painting, । statuary, and antiquities may be found, without I the almost useless study of guide-books. In this hall is also a special library of art. Crossing a large corridor, we entered the Studio. Here an exciting unpacking -was going on. Professor Gregori, from Rome, Italy, but now residing at the University of Notre Dame, had sent a donation to the School of Design—a large case of models for study, of every description—heads, eyes, . noses, arms, feet, hands—in every imaginable position. These, in addition to the abundance of models already possessed, will afford great pleasure to the young artists, and aid them to delineate the human form. On the easels and walls we saw excellent work in various stages of progress. But we had at last to yield to the unwelcome thought that we must leave the half unvisited, or miss the train. Passing with regret from these halls of 71 intellectual culture and every graceful accomplish! ment, we paid a flying visit to the Chapel of :	, Loreto, a facsimile of the Holy House of Naz-
: areth. We had revelled in mediaeval art, but this ‘	holy spot formed the culminating point. We saw
1 I	now the cradle of Christianity. On the altar-steps
j!	still rested the magnificent floral offerings received
*	by the graduates, who had deposited them there as
'	they poured forth their acts of thanksgiving to God,
who had given to them their talents with the i	•
; grace to cultivate them- While kneeling in this
holy sanctuary I learned the secret of the feeling which took possession of us that morning. It is this: “ The holy hush of Nazareth ” is over all.

The Herald says he “ has succeeded most admirably in his attempt to present all the important things connected with Longfellow?s life, in a very attractive form. While the book possesses none of the garrulity or impudent inquisitiveness of minor affairs that makes biographies so popular nowadays, (a thing which would be impossible in the present -instance, however,) one can find, in it all that a reasonable reader can desire to know of the poet.

born in London on March 21, 1812. He was graduated at Oxford. In 1S45 he quit the Anglican Communion and joined the Catholic Church. Pope Pius IX conferred upon him the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. In 1863 he became the editor of the Dublin Review, which position he held until 1S78. He devoted the last years of his life to the task of revising his essays on theological subjects, and published in book form several collections of them. His death was beautiful in spite of the pain he suffered. He was heroically patient. “ God kndws,” he said, shortly before his death, “ that, with all my faults, I have had no stronger desire than that of loving Him and promoting His glory.” On the octave of the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul he peacefully expired. May he rest in peace.
—“ Mr. William W. Starr, whose successful efforts have so much aroused the enthusiasm of lovers of art in this city, has just finished the monument and bust of the late Bishop Foley, ordered by the Catholic clergy of the diocese of Chicago. The artist has succceeded beyond all anticipation in giving a lifelike representation of the deceased prelate. The bust strikes one at the first as a most correct likeness: the pose of head, the decision lines of the mouth disclosing the will-power, with the genial smile, all commend themselves as admirably and truthfully depicted. ’ The monument is of the Gothic order, of Italian and Columbian marble. The Catholic clergy, with Archbishop Feehan at their head, are one in their expression of delight and admiration, and loaded the artist with commendations of his work. While the bust was on exhibition at 299 Huron St, it was.visited by hundreds of the Catholic and Protestant laity, the unanimous verdict being that Mr. Starr had produced a wonderful work of art. The monument and bust will be placed in the Cathedral, and cannot fail to excite the admiration of the thousands of visitors thereto.”—Chicago Tribune.
Mr. Starr is the nephew of Miss Eliza Allen Starr, whose productions, both in poetry and painting, have earned for her a wide reputation. • Miss Starr has at times graced the pages of the Scholastic with contributions from her pen.
—In a late issue of the London Weekly Register there appeared an interesting sketch of the famous naturalist and philosopher, St. George Mivart. Mr. Mivart was born in 1827, and, like many celebrated English converts, his early training was subject to Evangelical influences. But his study of Catholic art, to which he early gave his attention, naturally led him to the study of Catholic doctrine, and thence, by logical process, to conversion. In the year 1844, when over little more than sixteen years of age, he was received into the Church. Natural history , had been his life-study, and many valuable works were written by him; it was not, however, until the year 1870 that, he became famous by his opposition to the system and theory of Darwin. The list of Mivart’s books would fill a large space; as already stated, he is most famous for those works written since 1870, including the Defence of Liberty of Conscience^ the Examination f Mr. Herbert Spencer's Psychology (both originally published in the Dublin Review), Contemporary Evolution,. Men and Apes, and The Cat. To the previous period belong, among others, papers On the Zoology, Anatomy, and Classification of Apes and Lemurs,
On the Myology of certain Tailcd-Batrachians, On the Estcology of Birds, The Sciatic Plexus of Reptiles, The Structure of the Fins of Fishes, A Memoir on the Insectivora, etc., etc. Mr. Mivart was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1867, vice-president of the Geological Society in 1869, secretary of the Linnajan Society in 1874, and professor of biology at the late University College at Kensington, also in 1874. He received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Rome) in 1876. Some of his works have been translated in French scientific publications.

Books and Periodicals.
The Household Library of Catholic Poets from Chaucer to the Present Day. (1350-1SS1.) Edited by Eliot Ryder. Notre Dame, Ind.: Jpz seph A. Lyons, publisher.
We have noticed editorially the subject matter of this work, and lauded the purpose of its editor. The mechanical points of the book are excellent. It is printed in clear and legible type, on good paper, each page framed in a red-line border, the whole covered with a durable and not inelegant binding. We are glad that Mr. Ryder has not presented us with a new hymn book, but with an anthology of poetry written by Catholics. Designedly didactic poetry is very wearisome reading. We remember being detected by our Latin professor reading Cowper’s “Task,” which was artfully concealed under a Livy; he excused us the otherwise inevitable imposition, on the score that the task of reading the “Task” was greater than that of tackling Livy. It is true, however, that the religious poetry of Catholics is brighter, better, and in everyway more readable than that of Protestants, and such of it as Mr. Ryder has introduced will serve to illustrate the fact. Compare Cowper, Young, and Montgomery with Crashaw, Calderon, and Lope da Vega. Again, the secular verses of Catholic poets compare favorably with those of Protestants. Take the raciness of Dryden, the satire of Pope, and the music of Prout, with the bestiality of Byron, the atheism of Shelley, and the prosiness of Southey. The fatal fascination which surrounds, for instance, the poems of Shelley, whom De Quincey aptly styled a “ lunatic angel,” should be counteracted wherever possible by the purer influences of Catholic literature. Of course it is claiming too much to expect that every Catholic has written “no line which, dying, he could wish to blot,” a sycophantish statement which was made by Tickell about Addison, who, by-the-by, published a translation of Petronius Arbiter. It is a comforting reflection that objectionable lines are few among Catholics, and none at least appear in Mr. Ryder’s book.
We must confess to feeling a little discontented at the scanty space afforded to Chaucer in this volume. We were reminded of the chapter itemized in the index to Van Troil’s. work on Iceland— concerning the Snakes of Iceland—upon turning to which, at its proper place in the book, the
THE NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC.
reader is simply informed “ There are no Snakes in Iceland,”—nothing more. Mr. Ryder tickles our palate in the index but treats us to Sancho Panza-like plates in the text. We are not told absolutely that there are no beauties in Chaucer, but if this book were our only source of information we should be inclined to think so. We are almost inclined to fancy that Pope might have been omitted without detriment to the work. . . .
More than two-thirds of the book are devoted to selections from the poets of our own century. The first is from the inimitable Father Prout—his beautiful “Bells of Shandon,” a poem that will never die. Next come Cardinals Newman and Wiseman, then poor Clarence Mangan, Gerald Griffin, and our own Father Edward in the lovely “Autumn Leaf.” We are glad to meet our friends Miss Conway and Maurice Egan, at their best, and a long line of American and Eng-lish Catholic poets. The book is an excellent fireside friend and companion___Catholic Telegraph.
—We find upon our table, with other publications, the July and August numbers of The North-American Review. In the former, Edwin P. Whipple discusses “Emerson as a Poet”-; Richard' Grant White shows up in a most unenviable light “The Business of Office-seeking”; “Hydraulic Pressure in Wall Street,” from an anonymous writer, or rather one who doesn’t choose to give his name, for he undoubtedly has one,—raises the curtain and gives us glimpses of the manipulations and wire-pulling of the bulls and bears of ' that noted locality. The other articles of the July number are “The Ruins of Central America— Part XI,” by Ddsird Charnay; “The Things Which Remain,” by Gail Hamilton; “False Taste in Art,” by F rancis Marion Crawford.
The August number opens with a characteristic paper from Henry Ward Beecher on “ Progress of Thought in the Church.” The word “ church ” with Mr. Beecher has a very vague and indefinite meaning, and he seems to feel that this is so. To him it is more of an abstract idea than a tangible reality, embracing, as it seeks to do, multidudinous sects that cannot agree upon a single point of Christian Doctrine. The Church proper he views only at a distance. “ As a human institution,” he says, “ it has as much right to live as any Protestant Church. Its ceremonies, its liturgies, its governments, its claims and theories, are for those who like them, but are imperative on none but those who choose them.” He trusts to the spirit of the age for its gradual reformation, or rather corruption. In this he judges by what has been going on in the sects for the last fifty years, and notably of late in a well-known Protestant theological Seminary. “Andover, next to Princeton the very Jerusalem of Jerusalems of orthodoxy, triply guarded by a creed made tight and strong beyond all breaking or picking, and to which the whole body of its professors were sworn to reswear every five years, has, alas 1 with some levity and merriment, shown to the world with what agility good men could fly
over it, walk around it. They interpret the Creed of fifty years ago, not by what its makers meant, but by what the professors think they ought to have meant, and would have meant if they had received a full Andover course.” This is but the old story of the sects over again; mutatis mutandis. Ever changing; nothing stable. How different from the Catholic Church, which for nearly two thousand years has been always the.same in doctrine and in practice I Mr. Beecher’s paper is followed by one on “ The Organization of Labor,” by T. V. Powderly. The well-known British military correspondent, Archibald Forbes, writes of “ The United States Army,” dwelling more particularly on those features of bur army management which appear to him to be most worthy of imitation by the military governments of Europe. “Woman’s Work and Wom;pi’s Wages,” by Charles W. Elliott, is a forcible statement of one of the most urgent problems of our, time. The author sees no advantage to be derived from the employment of. woman in man’s work, whether of brain or of hand: such employment, he insists, only reduces man’s wages, and does not really add to the total resources of the whole class of workers. 'In a highly-interesting essay on “ The Ethics of Gambling,” O. B. Frothingham analyzes with rare ingenuity the passion for play. “The Remuneration of Public Servants,” by Frank D. Y. Carpenter, gives matter foi" serious consideration, both to the civil service reformers and their opponents. Finally, there is a paper on “Artesian Wells upon the Great Plains,” by Dr. C. A. White, of the Smithsonian Institution. The Review is sold by booksellers generally.

EDITOR NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC,
Notre Dame, Indiana.
—With this number the Scholastic begins its sixteenth volume. In regard to the work before us during the coming- year, we must state that the maintenance of the established literary excellence of our journal will greatly depend upon the valuable aid which we expect our friends to give us. We know that all our old friends will rally once again around the flag and, when school opens, be reinforced by an army of new contributors who will do all in their power to secure the success of their college paper.
This issue is sent to all our subscribers of last year, and we take this opportunity to inform them that now is the time to renew their subscriptions for the coming year.
—We feel certain that our readers will be pleased with the new heading which is used for •the first time this week. It was designed and engraved by Messrs. Manz & Co., of Chicago, from a rough draught furnished by this office some time ago. The representation of the College grounds is copied from the bird’s-eye view sketched for the Catalogue by Shober and Carqueville, also of Chicago. It will add to the interest of our lit-tie paper, for old students and others abroad, inclu-. ding many who have never visited Notre Dame, to see a miniature picture of a spot, of which we hope the Scholastic will always be a pleasant reminder. The design and its execution are highly creditable to the firms above mentioned, and prove that Chicago is not behind Eastern cities in artistic skill. The Scholastic with its complete new dress now presents a fine appearance, and we have every confidence that the efforts of contributors will continue to make its contents correspond.
This new heading, it is fair to say, was not the . least among the many improvements effected in our college journal by the editor of last year.
—The annual retreat of the Community, which this year was conducted by the Rev. Father Gleason, C. S. C., terminated on Sunday, July 16th. The next event in interest to all at Notre Dame was the meeting of the Provincial Chapter, to whom it belonged to make the appointments to offices and duties in the Community for the following year. The capitulants met on Monday, the 17th, and for three days deliberated together; on Thursday morning their labors ended, and in the evening the religious assembled in the church, and the “ Obediences” were distributed.
Of course, what is of special, interest to the student of Notre Dame regards the appointments of the officers of the University and the Prefects, with whom they are so intimately associated. All will be pleased to learn that this year but few changes have been made. • Father Walsh continues in office as President,—a position which he so ably filled during the past year—and will, as before, be assisted by Father Toohey as Vice-President and Prefect of Discipline. Very Rev. Father Granger will retain his time-honored office of Prefect of Religion and care for the spiritual interests of the students, as he has done, we may say, from the establishment of the University. Bros. Emmanuel and Leander will continue to preside over their respective departments as heretofore, assisted by Bros. Paul, Luke and Hilarion in the Seniors, and Bros. Lawrence and Walter in the Juniors; while Bro. Francis Regis will hold his position as Prefect of the Minims, assisted this year by Bro. Bernardine. This latter appointment has become necessary, owing to the large increase in the number of the little charges.
The South-Bend Tribune says:.
“The selections have been made with a wisdom learned by experience. Not only pupils but all who have an interest in Notre Dame will be rejoiced to hear that Rev. Father Walsh is to continue at the head of the Institution as President—his able lieutenant, Rev. Father Toohey, to aid him. And Notre Dame would hardly be Notre Dame without Father Maher.”
The Seniors and Juniors of last year will, however, regret to learn a change in the positions of Bros. William and Thomas. They have been assigned to different missions, which will, during the coming year, receive the benefit of their efficiency in directing the young. Among the Faculty, Messrs. Sullivan and Irman leave us in. order to enter upon a new field of labor as Professors at St. Isidore’s College, New Orleans.
With these few changes, the personnel of the University remains as before, and the students, upon their return, will be greeted by the same kind officers and directors, who will continue, as in the past, to do all in their power that will con tribute to their comfort, and serve to further their progress and perfection in the acquisition of ;knowledge.‘	.	..
THE NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC.
—“ Excelsior,” has always been the motto at Notre Dame, and “improvement all along’ the line,” is to be the pass-word, we hear, during the coming year. Study-halls, dormitories, and recreation-rooms have been made to look brighter and more cheerful than ever before; reading-rooms will be fitted up for both Senior and Junior departments; the play-grounds will be re-divided; in a word, neither trouble nor expense will be spared to promote the comfort of the students. The authorities are also resolved that intellectual advancement shall keep pace with material progress. An effort will be made to raise the standard of studies in many of the courses, but the closest attention will be paid to the English classes; medals for essay-writing will be for the first time offered, and the Scholastic, which is in thorough sympathy with the movement, wishes it a cordial God-speed, and will, as usual, seek to fulfil the end of its establishment, and hold its columns in • readiness to encourage the efforts of the vouthful aspirants to literary distinction.	(
I	—The New Minim Hall, which was-begun
last April, is now rapidly approaching completion, and by the end of the present month will be ready for occupancy. The beautiful engraving in the Catalogue admirably represents its external appearance, !	and, at the same time, gives a partial view of the
i	fine, large campus, where the festive Minims may
jump and run and walk and drill. The building is in the form of an oblong square, four stories in 1	height, with a frontage of 95 feet and a depth of
j	45 feet; the front is relieved by a projection in
J	the centre, terminating in a sort of alcove, formed
in the roof, which will receive a magnificent painting from the brush of the famous Luigi Gregori. This painting will represent an angel with hands extended, as if in protection, over a group of Minims, while over them is hovering the Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove. The walls are of brick, very thick and solid, with trimmings and ornamentations of stone and galvanized iron; the ,	o	7
interior is perfectly adapted to the purposes for . which it is intended, and will afford sufficient ac7 commodation for 100 Minims. On the ground floor will be located the lavatories and clothes-rooms; on the upper or main floor will be situated • the study-hall, recitation-rooms, and the meeting.	room of the Sorin Literary Association; in the
upper stories will be found the sleeping-rooms. All the rooms on each floor, except the basement, arc very loftv, being each more than 15 feet in ? height, and are well lighted and ventilated; numerous windows admit the light of the sun by day, and at night the rooms are illumined by gas; flues run through each floor- from basement to . roof, with openings into each room, thus keeping the air in every part of the building constantly pure; the apparatus used for heating, lighting, ventilating, have all the modern improvements; in a word, everything has been employed that '	could be thought to contribute to the comfort of
i	’	©
the happy little princes, as they are called.
We must congratulate the Minims upon ‘the ‘Palace’ which they have secured through the happy thought of their venerated patron, Very Rev. Father General; and we have no doubt that they will find in their splendid quarters, a new incentive to study, and to play, too, and thus lay the foundations of future greatness. Vivent les Minims!	'
—A fair field and no favor is the demand of Catholicity. Not an excessive demand, surely, only a reasonable one; rarely conceded, however, as may be easily seen by a cursor}' glance over the pages of modern Encyclopaedias.	.
To specialists are entrusted special sciences; a Huxlev writes on Biologv; a Fumivall-or a Hudson treats of Shakespeare; and to a Morris, a Skeat or a Max Mtiller is assigned the subject of Philology. It seems only natural, then, that a Catholic should be chosen to write on Catholic subjects; thus only can accuracy, the primary quality, be secured. To do so, were a bold thing even in these much-belauded days of freedom; foreven now, in matters that concern our Faith, flattery or prejudice, rather than manifestation of truth, is the rule. Whether all the articles on Catholic subjects, in the new edition of Appleton’s Encyclopaedia are from the pens of Catholic writers, we know not, some assuredly are; and for this fair, honest dealing the publishers deserve the thanks, not only of Catholics, but of all real students and lovers of truth.
There are many topics which it seems impossible for writers to treat with even an approach to impartiality; the consequence is, outsiders rarely have an opportunity of learning the truth, for of course it would be too much to expect them to seek information from purely Catholic sources. The subject of the Jesuits is one of these topics. Their rule of manifestation, in accordance with which all the members of the order lay open their conscience to Superiors, is a principal point of attack. Opponents fancy all the ill that in unworthy hands might arise from this practice, and then charge it all to the Jesuits and Catholicity. Nota word is said of the fact that no use can be made of knowledge thus acquired without the revelant’s consent; not a word about the natural secrecy which binds the lips of -the Superior; not a bit of ’ evidence of its misuse, is furnished. Whatever might be, is; that is enough for such writers. Or again, with regard to the vow of obedience. Persistently the assertion is made that the members are bound to obey their Superiors’ orders, lawful or unlawful. Were such a rule in existence, not a Jesuit but knows its incapability to bind. Furthermore, their miles do not recognize any "such obedience, and the history of the Order gives the accusation the lie. Or, again, they are damned -with faint praises. To no body of men are learning and science more indebted; it would not do to say so, and men like Suarez, de Lugo, de. Ravignan, Bourdaloue, De Vico, Secchi, and .hundreds of other eminent preachers, philoso-

ft
phers, scientists and scholars’ are either not mentioned at all or spoken of with disdain.
Or, again, in the matter of the Inquisition. What a name this to conjure with! what scenes of cruelty and bloodshed!—all the fault of the Catholic Church. Not a word about the fact that the Roman Inquisition, a purely religious one, is admitted by the best historians, Ranke, etc., to be guiltless of the blood of a single human being; not a word of the fact that the excesses of the Spanish Inquisition as Guizot and even Llorente declare, are due to its being a state and political tribunal. Of these two points, of indulgences, of the Pope’s Infallibility; and of many other articles which we have carefully read, this edition of the Cyclopaedia gives a cool and impartial .account. There is nothing exaggerated, nothing set down in malice. It is the sign of a healthier feeling towards Catholic topics. To Messrs. Appleton belongs the credit, no slight praise.
—A telegram received some weeks ago con© . ©
veyed the sad news of the death of Mrs. Kuhn, of. Nas'hville, Tenn., mother of Ferdinand E. Kuhn, who has been for the past two years one of the most highly respected and deservedly popular students in the University. Mr. Kuhn may be assured of the heartfelt sympathy of his many friends at Notre Dame, in the great affliction which has befallen him.

Augustine, Ill. We regret to learn that death has lately visited the family, and that a brother and sister of George’s have departed this life,— though, undoubtedly, theirs is the better and happier lot, it is sad to our human nature to be thus early parted from the loved and dear ones of one’s family circle. George was one of the gold-medalists of ’81.
—Frederick J. Williams of ’66, attended the University Commencement in June and wrote a long account of it for his paper, the Lafayette Sunday Times. It took up two columns and a half of the Times, but Fred says he could write five columns and probably be cramped for room to describe all he saw. He had not been at Notre Dame for sixteen years, and of course the place had undergone wonderful changes since he left it. We regret that space forbids the reproduction of his article, or extracts from it, in this issue.
—The many friends of Notre Dame’s architect, W. J. Edbrooke, will be pleased to hear of his success in the far West. He has just completed in Denver, Col., a block of buildings;—among which is the best appointed opera house in America—for Gov. Tabor, at a cost of over $900,000. Besides a number of other buildings he has on hand, he has just been awarded the contract for the National Mining Exposition Building to be erected in Denver. It is to be a large and substantial structure, five hundred by three hundred feet. Mr. Edbrooke is so highly appreciated and has so much work to do in the West that he scarcely has time to even call at his office in Chicago.

—Twenty minims, seven Juniors and five Seniors are spending the vacation at Notre Dame.

—Col. Otis, to the great regret and disappointment of the “stay at home” members of the Faculty, was obliged, shortly after Commencement, to leave Notre Dame for his new sphere of duty,—Fort Meade, D. T.

—It is claimed that an attempt to burglarize B. Thomas’s store was made some time ago.

—Rt. Rev. Monsignore Fermoz, Domestic Prelate to His Holiness, Pope Leo XIII, was among the visitors during vacation; Monsignore Fermoz, who has been travelling in the United States for the past few months, is a genial and accomplished gentleman, and a visit from him is a privilege which is highly appreciated by everyone at Notre Dame.
—Masters Castanedo and Gibert spent a part of the vacation at Waukesha, Wis. They report as having enjoyed themselves hugely.

Gregori’s mural paintings, the interior of the church and Music Hall,-the new library and reading rooms, and the two society rooms on the second floor.
—Prof. Edwards generously remembered the .students spending their vacation at Notre Dame, by sending an order to B. Leopold to treat the boys—Minims, Juniors and Seniors,—to ice-cream, cake, and other dainties. It was a grand “ set up,” and the treat was greatly enjoyed. All concerned therein desire to express their thanks to the kind Professor.
—The Curator, of the Museum is at present exploring the “ far, far West ”; when last heard from, he was leaving Las Vegas, N. M., en route for Pike’s Peak and other localities even more remote and unfrequented. The rumor has not been confirmed that the stage coach on which he was travelling was attacked by a combination of Utes and Apaches, and that he laid six of the assailants low with one fell swoop.
—The large and beautiful painting, representing the return of Columbus and his triumphal reception at the Court of Spain, has been the admiration of all visitors during the past month. Prof. Gregori will, in a few days, be engaged on another historical scene in the great navigator’s life. As is usual with artists, the Professor keeps very retired, but report has it that “ Columbus in Chains,” is to be the next subject.
—The Juniors and Seniors had a delightful trip to St. Joseph’s Farm, on the 27th ult. They were accompanied bv their prefects, Bros. William and Thomas, and Bros. Philemon and Lucian, as invited guests. We have been requested to say nothing about the lemonade made on the occasion. All, however, heartily enjoyed the excursion, and speak in the highest terms of the hospitable manner in which they were received.
—Prof. Stace is spending the summer with friends at Clinton, Mo. We hear that the genial Professor has been taking a prominent part in amateui' theatricals. His greatest success was, we believe, in the role of a Calabrian brigand. His photograph in costume, which he forwarded to one of his friends, is certainly one of the most terror-inspiring objects upon which it has been our lot to gaze for months. Father Zahm should not fail to secure a negative for his next magic-lantern entertainment.	■
—“ The Thirtv-eighth Annual Catalogue of the University of Notre Dame, for the academic year of 1881—’82, is received, and is the handsomest and most elaborate ever issued by this Institution. In addition-to the usual lists of officers, Faculty and students, it contains fine engravings of the buildings, completed and projected, the most striking among which is the Minim Hall, on account of an excellent representation of Father Sorin, the venerable Founder of the University, on the lawn, surrounded by his special favorites, the Minims. The pamphlet contains 96 pages, and furnishes much interesting information concerning Notre Dame.”—South-Bend Register.
—-“We have received the Thirty-eighth Annual Catalogue of the officers, Faculty and students of the University of Notre Dame, Indiana,, for the academic year 1881—82. It is the exhibit of a very successful—an extraordinarily successful —Catholic institution. No other educational institution, Catholic or Protestant, in this country or in Europe, can show such a wonderful growth within so short a time. The bird’s-eye view of the' University buildings and grounds resembles that of a beautiful rural village, except that the buildings which present themselves to the eye, at all points of the picture, are more magnificent than any village ever seen could present. The Institution is really an honor to the Catholic Church of the United States, and indeed to the country.— Catholic Chronicle. "	•
—On Wednesday, the 2d inst.—the Feast of . the Portitincula—the Chapel of Our Lady of .the Angels, attached to the Professed House at Notre Dame, Was thronged with pilgrims from early morning until sunset. This little chapel enjoys the same extraordinarv privilege as that of the Portiuncula at Assisi:—namely, that on this festival, when the prescribed conditions are complied with, a plenary indulgence may be gained as often as the chapel is visited. This-fact every year attracts a crowd of visitors, all eager to' share in the spiritual favors which may be thus obtained. Durr ing the morning, beginning at five o’clock, Masses were celebrated at regular intervals until nine o’clock, when Solemn High Mass was sung by Rev. Father Franciscus, with Fathers Kroeger and Stoffel as deacon and subdeacon. The Novitiate choir executed, in a very creditable manner, a beautiful Mass in harmonized plain chant. We hope to have the pleasure of hearing such music frequently during the coming year. The devotions of the day concluded with solemn Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament.
The Musical Record of Boston, speaking of the Commencement Exercises at St. Mary’s Academy, under the heading of “Notre Dame, Indiana,” says: “The musical exercises at the 27th annual commencement of the St. Mary’s Academy were worthy of especial mention. Where all was so well done it would be invidious to particularize, and I will merely summarize by stating that the thoroughness of the system of instruction at St. Mary’s was finely reflected by the pupils.” We scarcely know which to admire most—now that those delightful musical seances at St. Mary’s are over, and the pleasure of listening to them a thing of the past—the excellence of the music or the energy of the editor who seems to let nothing of importance escape his notice. The music programme at St. Mary’s Commencement was a superb affair, certainly, but who would have thought that an editor at the Hub would have taken it all in, or have it chronicled! Evidently there was “a chiel among us, takin’ notes,” while the young ladies were entertaining us with those delightful notes of Garcia,- Lizst, Meyerbeer, Balfe, Godefroid, and Raff.	•
