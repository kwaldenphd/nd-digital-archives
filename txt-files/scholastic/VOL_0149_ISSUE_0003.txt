EDNOTES 
WHAT'S THAT SOUND? 
She walks into the practice room, turns on the light, and sets down her violin case. She opens the case, takes out the bow, and carefully tightens the bow hair. Pulling the base of the instrument to her chin, she takes a deep breath and prepares to tune her instrument. She will need to spend the next few minutes carefully tuning each string by ear. Next, she will probably begin her warm-up with a slower, easier piece like an etude before she moves on to more complicated finger exercises. Ifshe made a mistake in her tuning, she will need to start over from the beginning. 
Sound complicated? Now imagine going through the frustrating process with the D-flat major chords of "Clair de Lune" by the pianist in the neighboring practice room leaking through the non-soundproofed walls. It sort of makes tuning an instrument seem like an exercise in futility. 
For years, Notre Dame musicians like our cover model, senior violinist Mary Ann Lane, have struggled with inadequate practice facilities in the Crowley Hall of Music. Not only is the building missing sound-proof walls, but the non-humidity controlled rooms have caused expensive instruments to crack. Two years ago, a pair of violists attempted to solve the problem by drafting a petition protesting the facilities. The petition was signed about 300 music students. Nothing has been done. 
Music has traditionally been a priority at universities like Notre Dame that embrace the liberal arts. In fact, the Medieval Quadrivium included only four subjects: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music. In our cover story, "Out of Tune," news writer Maggie Condit investigates the state of music at Our Lady's University today. She reports on some of the weaknesses ofthe department -non­sound-proofed practice rooms, inadequate performance venues, distinct funding for sub-departments -as well as ways in which the university is trying to improve the situation. 

OUR MISTAKE 
As always, there is room for improvement at the Scholastic. In our Sept. 13, 2007 issue, we misprinted two bylines. "Kids in the Court" was written by sports writer Andy Gray, not Brittany Lash, as itwas originally attributed. "Home Away From the Dome" was written by Meagan McGinley. We would like to express our sincerest apologies to both writers. 
Scholastic wishes you a pleasant-sounding and ever-improving week,

In Facebook's earlier days, companies used the social networking site pri­marily to check up on potential em­ployees. Students, accordingly, adjusted privacy settings and un-tagged photos ofthemselves. Now, employers are using Facebook in a new way -a step beyond surveillance. Companies are beginning to take advantage of the site's potential for networking and recruiting. Douglas Pope is especially excited about the idea of using Facebook as a new medium for employee networking. His business, HotPads.com, is particularly conducive to this strategy. HotPads.com is a way for students to find roommates and apartments using their Facebook social networks. Considering that his business is already so entrenched in the Facebook world, Pope embraced the idea of using the Web site to network with recruits. HotPads.com has both a Web site and an application on Facebook. "The motiye," Pope says, "is that Facebook is a gathering place for the people we want to hire ... with all the new applications out there, people are using Facebook for increasingly different purposes." The process is still rather new, however, and Pope does point out, "we have received a fair amount of applicants from these postings, though our most successful recruiting tools have been university job boards and word-of-mouth." 
Tim Connors (ND '89), a venture capitalist involved in funding technology companies, also sees the usefulness of the Web site. "Facebook is where the audience is, so it works for recruiting too. It is a tool for networking and networking is the key to recruiting and being recruited," he says. "We post job opportunities there, but mostly students can use it as a way to connect with ND alums in geographies of interest." 
Both Connors' and Pope's careers focus on technology, so it is no surprise that they have tapped into Facebook's virtual networking system. Many other companies are beginning to jump on the bandwagon as well. The advent of the Marketplace, Facebook's classified listings, has allowed companies to list job openings, and many have gone so far as to create their own applications and groups. The accounting firm Ernst & Young has a Facebook group devoted to answering the questions of potential hires in a relaxed setting. The group even contains such things as "Career Tip of the Week," information about Ernst & Young's ideas concerning corporate social responsibility, and a section full of frequently asked questions. 
Interested students can. visit the Notre Dame technology group, a group for alumni and students interested in startups and technology. Students can also check to see if a company they are interested in has created an application or a Facebook group, or if any alumni in their area are on the site. It looks like Facebook may have deeper long-term effects than first imagined. +

War on Recruiting 
Student groups protest CIA and Raytheon 

Lisa Schultz 
Four students came into the Fall Career Expo on Sept. 19 to protest the presence of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Raytheon, a defense and aerospace systems supplier. Notre Dame Security Police (NDSP) escorted them out. They were not the first Notre Dame students to protest recruiters on campus. vVhen the CIA and Dow Chemical came to recruit in 1968, student protestors held a three-day demonstration that culminated in students lying down at the door to the office where the CIA planned to conduct interviews. In a letter to students 13 weeks later, President Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., took a hard-line stance in anticipation of another protest against Dow Chemical. Students would have "15 minutes of meditation to cease and desist" before being suspended or expelled. Today, the methods of protest have changed. The students' actions began when junior Michael Angulo, Progressive Student Alliance (PSA) and Notre Dame Peace Fellowship (NDPF) member, co-authored a letter to the editor that appeared in the Sept. 19 issue of The Observer with sophomores Alicia Quiros and Kristi Haas. They substantiated claims that the CIA and Raytheon represent practices that violate human rights. Copies of that letter were also sent to Dean Carolyn Woo of the Mendoza School of Business, the Rev. John I. Jenkins, C.S.C., and Lee Svete, director of career services. 

This letter to the editor was just a precursor to the main event. Angulo and three friends then went to the Career Expo to distribute information sheets 
. they had compiled. The PSA and NDPF endorsed the letter, as did student group Human Rights Notre Dame. PSA is a non-faith based, politically-neutral group of students concerned with social justice issues, while the NDPF seeks to promote peace and justice through prayer and action. 
The protesters argue that the CIA's and Raytheon's work does not coincide with the university's mission statement, particularly the following sentence: "God's grace prompts human activity to assist the world in creating justice grounded in love." The protestors' main problems with the CIA are accusations 
of the use of secret 
detention centers and torture. Theissueswith Raytheon stem from its profits from selling weapons contracts to the American military in what protestors consider an unjust war. 
"The whole purpose is to create awareness," Angulo says. "It's never going to be like 1968. It's just not a school purpose of the information hand­outs was to say to potential Raytheon employees, "The industry that you're involved in, the actual job you are doing, is creating a society that is part of this larger picture ofviolence." 
The Career Center rebuts such a classification. "Raytheon is also building missile defense, so it's a tough call," Svete says. 
No one from the CIA spoke with protestors. "At any campus, you're going to have a diversity of thought, and you ought to," the senior recruiter of the CIA, who requested anonymity, says. Angulo did speak with one ofRaytheon's recruiters to explain what he and his friends were doing with the information sheets. He described the recruiter's reaction as "understanding." Although the students at the fair were respectful, the student protestors did not stay as long as planned. 
"We are very disappointed in the way Notre Dame handled the situation," Quiros says. She was dismayed that the response to their presence was the use of six NDSP officers to usher her group out of the Joyce Center. NDSP Director of Security Dave Chapman noted that officers responded to a complaint from

in the room where the CIA planned to conduct interviews.  Angulo  says  the  the number of responding officers.

"The students were very cooperative," Chapman says. "They left with no trouble." Svete explained how recruiters come to campus. 
The Career Center does not allow just anyone to have a booth at the Career Expo. "We do not allow Planned Parenthood on campus because of our Catholic values," Svete says. Any employer can sign up on the career fair Web site. Participating organizations must sign an agreement to present positive career development. Svete exemplified this claim by referencing a bank that is not allowed back on campus since it reneged on an offer it made to a Notre Dame student. 
"I think you do want to look at [companies who come to the Career Expo]. It's a big ocean out there," Svete says. "The big question for possible employers is, 'Are they fulfilling their promise__ . in terms of career development?''.' 
Protestors, however, disagree on the larger issue. "Kids [from ND] can go _anywhere," Angulo says. "I'm wondering why· the: administration

QUESTIONABLE RECRUITERS The CIA and Raytheon were two of the

The senior CIA recruiter stated in 
an interview that he would not discuss 
public policy. "[Our goal is to] protect 
the American way of life by collecting 
intelligence that will be analyzed and 
then shared with policy makers," he says. 
"We don't suggest policy." 
Although the CIA cannot report who 
it hires, it has an established relationship 
with Notre Dame. "'iVe wouldn't be here 
if there wasn't a consistent excellence of 
applicants," the senior recruiter says. 
He says that integrity is essential to 
being hired by the CIA, and Notre 
Dame students have that key quality. 
A solid majority of all Career Expo 
recruiters have an alumni connection.

As of Sept. 21, there had been no response from the letters given to Woo, Jenkins and Svete. Angulo hopes he receives a "concrete position" from the university's administration addressing his groups' concerns in the near future. + 
Does your future entail a pursuit for justice? 
The CIA, while claiming to be our nation's "first line of defense," has no accountability. A new report released by six human rights groups charged the CIA with the disappear­ance of 39 individuals.Also, the CIA allegedly uses 19 forms

APPALACHIA CONCERT The Center-for Social Concerns sponsored a concert Sunday featuring music from the Appalachia region of the United States. The concert was open to the public and required for all students attending an Appalachia Seminar over fall break. It was both a 25th anniversary event for the center and a chance to kick off the Appalachia Seminars. 

GuluWalk: 
Strides in Solidari-!J 
Theresa Olivier 
On Oct. 14, Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Indiana University South Bend (IUSB) students, together with South Bend community members, will gather at IUSB for South Bend's second annual GuluWalk. The international event unofficially began in 2005 when two Canadians commuted 12.5 km for 31 days to sleep in downtown Toronto. They were inspired and troubled by the plight of tens of thousands of Acholi children forced to · commute nightly from their homes and displacement camps in Northern Uganda to urban centers in order to evade abduction by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). On October 21, 2006, the first international GuluWalk attracted over 30,000 participants in 82 cities, raising 500,000 dollars for these "night commuters." Though night commuting has ceased due to peace talks between the government and the LRA, the GuluWalk serves as a reminder of the immeasurable suffering of the Acholi children and those Ugandans attempting to rebuild their lives after 21 years of civil war. As Notre• Dame student organizer senior Joel Steiner says, "There's a lot yet to be done with resettlement and reintegration of past child soldiers." The plamiipg committee hopes to surpass the 2500 dollars raised for last year's walk through individual, team and general sponsorships. The committee's goals are also symbolic: junior Sean Gaffney described his hopes for the event to "first and foremost [express] solidarity and compassion for those suffering in Northern Uganda [ ... ] and be a community effort for one common goal of peace." ~tudents and community members are encouraged to register for the walk online at www.guluwalk.com. Participants may walk individually, join existing teams or create their own teams. +

ND ASK's anti-death penalty campaign stresses education and advocacy 
Last week, Richard Dieter, one of the nation's leading authorities on the death penalty, visited Notre Dame to discuss a national topic that he says "could become a signature issue for this university." Dieter (ND '68), the executive director ofthe Death Penalty Information Center, was the first speaker in a series of lectures this fall sponsored by Notre Dame Against State Killing (ND ASK). Aside from Notre Dame, Dieter has shared his expertise with a myriad ofmedia outlets from the New York Times to the BBC. ND ASK, a campaign initiated in the fall of 2006 and currently sponsored by Campus Ministry, strives to edu­cate and actively work toward the end of death penalty executions. Although new to the Notre Dame scene, the campaign is up and running. "Over the year we've gained many members and developed four functioning commit­tees: prison ministry, victims' families outreach, advocacy and lobbying, and conference organization," says senior political science and peace studies major 
; Andrea Laidman, current director and co-founder ofND ASK. The campaign mobilizes largely on the Internet, boast­ing a listserv of about 200 members and blog readership of up to 300 hits a day last semester on the campaign's Web site, ndask.org. 
ND ASK distinguishes itself from other student groups in its singular mission. "It is a campaign focused on one issue with a specific objective of educating the campus and working toward a moratorium on executions," Laidman says. A death penalty moratorium is a suspension of executions enacted by a state governor or legislature for a designated period 
·!Pictured Left: ND ASK president Andrea Laidman 
of time (approximately 2-5 years) during which a commission is created to examine the death penalty cases and issues in their specific state. "One of the things we believe at ND ASK is that ifyou look at the facts of the issue, they only lean to one side, that being moratorium," Laidman says. 
In order to bolster the educational goals of their mission, Laidman and the students of ND ASK organized a lecture series including Dieter and national anti-death penalty spokesman Bud Welch, the father of a victim of the Oklahoma City bombing. Welch primarily discusses reconciliation and restorative justice in death penalty cases. 
Dieter was impressed with the campaign. "[Anti-death penalty focus groups] are rare at the university lE:vel. They are much more common at the state level," he says. Although turnout was not overwhelming for Dieter's talk, he believes there is great potential in ND ASK. "This is a small group, but there's a lot more that could be done for this Notre Dame community. This campaign has a unique fit here and could become part ofa great tradition," Dieter says. 
Dieter's attendance marks the start of a building year for ND ASK. "We're hoping to engage students who approach the issue from a variety of perspectives by bringing to · campus experts on the death penalty from so many disciplines," Laidman says. 
Dieter says, "Everyone who participates in this discussion contributes to the national consensus of standards of decency. Voices of people can change the law." +

"My great-grandfather and grandfather were Jews when they came here, but not practicing Jews," Abrams says. "The priests here made my grandfather go teach Sunday school at the local synagoguet They wanted him to keep his Jewish identity here." 
Just as his grandfather developed his Jewish faith at Notre Dame, Patrick sees being Jewish in a Catholic environment as an opportunity for 
a lot of interfaith activity and dialogue going on in Los Angeles at that time. As a young professor at a rabbinical seminary, I felt that inter:faith dialogue was an important part ofwhat I needed to do." 
Notre Dame presented Signer with a unique opportunity to continue his work. "One part ofcoming here was to satisfy my own curiosity about what it would be like to participate in inter-religious dialogue, students, it's very difficult," Signer says. 
The Office of Institutional Research reports that in the fall 2006 semester, only six Notre Dame undergraduate students identified themselves as Jewish. "I don't ascribe any ill will to the lack of dialogue on campus," Signer says. "But when it's your house, it's your environment, and unless there is some immediately pressing need, people tend to do what they do." 
One initiative from the 
growth. "Interfaith dialogue also helps us students to promote a Jewish

"Right of my tradition. I can now our main goal is to identify more with my often leads to deeper understanding of create awareness that there 
religion and learn more about it," Abrams says. 
Abrams attends the Temple Beth-El in South Bend for services and says he has found a community to celebrate Jewish holidays with. "I went to services and dinner with Janet Berman, an 87-year old woman who has lived in South Bend since she was five. She has a scholarship here for a Jewish student," Abrams says. "It's nice to go to services in a different temple than my own with a different community." 
Abrams says that the university has supported him in celebrating his Jewish faith, allowing him to miss his trumpet duties in the marching band to attend services last Saturday. Another reason Patrick chose to attend Notre Dame was the opportunity to take a class in Jewish studies, a field that has a significant Abrams family mark at Notre Dame. 
Patrick's grandfather's donations to the university as an alumnus helped Notre Dame establish a more complete collection of Hebraic andJudaic books. Once the library was set .up, his donations also helped create an endowed chair position in the theology department, titled the Abrams Chair of Jewish Thought and Culture. The current Abrams Chair, Rabbi Michael Signer, has held the position since its inception in 1992. 
Signer became interested in interfaith studies early in his career. "I went to Los Angeles in 1974 just after the Second Vatican C<?uncil," Signer says. "There was 
actuallyis a Jewish Club here your own tradition." on campus," Zigman says. "Only two students showed -Rabbi Michael Signer up to our first meeting this 
not from my own community, but actually within the community with whom I was interested in dialogue," Signer says. 
Since his arrival on campus, Signer has both taught classes on the history ofJ ewish­Christian relations and founded the Notre Dame Holocaust Project, an endowment that supports film festivals, lectures and conferences in Germany and Poland. Through the project, students travel to Europe with Signer, gathering with their German and Polish counterparts to discuss the future ofinterfaith dialogue. 
Signer says he has financial backing and support from his colleagues in his efforts to promote this dialogue on campus. However, student response to such efforts is still lacking. 
"There really isn't much that goes on here in inter-religious dialogue. Students have the educational opportunities to take classes in Judaism, Islam and Eastern religions. But students do not have much chance to encounter people of the other religions in a supportive environment where dialogue is promoted," Signer says. 
Signer adds that the responsibility to promote such opportunities falls squarely on the students' shoulders. "It has to do more with campus life issues than it does with any faculty. Faculty do what faculty do. But without initiative from the 
year. Nobody on campus has the interest." 
Zigman, who comes from a half-Jewish, half-Catholic family, says, "There's a mix of reaction on campus about our club. A lot ofpeople laugh at the Jewish Club, but at the same time, we have a lot ofCatholic members. Some people are willing to reach out." 
Claudia Kselman, staff supervisor of the club and professional specialist of off-campus programs, adds that ifthe club can form a strong base, there are plans for student-run interfaith activities. "One of the members is proposing an interfaith panel along with the Muslim student organization on campus," Kselman says. 
Despite the difficulties in getting this dialogue started on campus, Signer maintains that it is a worthwhile goal. "For Christians to participate in interfaith dialogue with Jews is to encounter the roots of their own tradition. "\iVe're the ones most closely related to each other, which creates both a bridge and_ a barrier because we assume we understand one another," he says. "Interfaith dialogue also helps us strengthen our own religion. When you have to explain who you are and help somebody else understand it, it most often leads to deeper understanding ofyour own tradition." +

Notre Dame's "De-~~de of the Arts." .. Origirially, the music department was included in the plans for this 64 million dollar building. Ethan Haimo, then the music department chair, was part of a C()!llmittee. advising_ the plans for the 
future DPAC along with a consulting~ _a11d ·the rest oftli.t! !llUSic clepjri:n1entin firm .from -.-California and a · faculty Crowley Hall, musicians. are spread out member from the department of Film, · all over campus. Roche sees _this as both

"Our committee saw the DPAC as an· intensively academic building with 30 to 40 practice rooms, acoustically isolated classrooms, small auditoriums for student recitals and a music library," Haimo says. When the committee proposed its idea, it was told the administration had a different vision for the building. "The · administration wanted it to be more of a performing venue and secondarily an academic building," Haimo says. 
Despite student pnont1es, the administration decided to . go in a_ 
different direction. "We only had X amount of dollars with which to work, and the program committee viewed performance space as the highest priority," Roche says. Two years ago, current senior biochemistry major Reid Merryman and recent graduate Ailis Tweed-Kent took action ... to make . students' frustration hi.ow~ to .. the ·ad~1111stration. .They dre.w up a petition saying, "We are extremely grateful for the opportunity to perform and attend concerts in the [DPAC]; however, music students use these performing venues at most once a week." The petition continued, "Daily individual practice is the lifeblood of ensemble success, and although the opportunities that DPAC provides are 22 f SCHOLASTIC f 27 SEPTEMBER 2007

·· President Emeritus Edward Malloy, former provosi: Nathan Hatch, and Dean of the College of Arts and Letters Mark Roche. However, Merryman was let down after he metwii:h the dean and was . told that nothing could be done in the near future. "We weren't asking for that much," Merryman says. "We only asked for a few minor adjustments that the uniyersity could make t·o really improve the program." ..

With three faculty members in the DPAC, the band in the band building, the folk choir in Coleman-Morse, performances in the Snite Museum, 
an advantage and a disadvantage. "Music is everywhere on . campus, just as it is a discipline that resonates outwards," Roche says. "But pragmatically, it's a challenge." Some in the music department say that they lack a familial feeling with the DPAC and the band. A second music prnfessor who spoke with Scholastic under the condition of anonymity says, "The faculty with offices in the DPAC at times feel like tenants." 
The music department serves as an umbrella over the marching band, the orcliestra, conc:ert bands, the gl~eclub and various chorales. The.band director and assistant band directors are official faculty of the music departrrient>Still, they have a certain level ofautonomy and receive funding separately from the rest of the academic department through the O'Brien Fund, a growing endowment with tax advantages and privileges for 
·donors. ... One of the advantages tl1:e · band has is the facility in which it practices. "The band-building is one of the best in the world," Dwyer says. Students and professors in the same music department, however, have been pushing for a new building for many years-a new place where musicians can learn the history, theory and technique behind the fanfare.

quality ·practice rooms. "We have l).O small .· recital hall controlled by the music department," Haimo says. "If a · student wants to have a recital, they first need to find a space and then need to practice in that space. The large size of Leighton Concert Hall [in the DPAC] is inappropriate for student recitals. The Snite auditorium is really the only space we have and we need to get permission 
to use it." 
Decrescendos for the Music Curriculum 
"The 1nusic curriculum is currently 
undergoing some · changes," says 
Assistant Dean of the College of Arts and 
Letters Ava Preacher. Students felt some 
negative effects of these changes, adding 
to tli.E! stress of inadequate facilities and 
a fragmented department .. One change 
has been the removal of the music · 
minor. "The music minor, which was 
pretty popular, was taken away because 
the minor continued to grow but got 
no attention from the university," says 
Kevin Wangler, senior administrative 
assistant in the music department. 
. Another toll on the music department 
has been i:he removal of. the graduate 
program. "The . graduate program 
was eliminated for three reasons," 
Roche says. "It wasn't competitive with 
performance programs at schools of 
music or with academic programs in 
Ph.D. departments. We wanted to focus 
rnpre on undergraduates and we decided 
that a Masters in Sacred Music through 
the theology department would have 
greater resonance here and be an ideal 
fit for Notre Dame. Given our liberal 
arts orientation and limited resources, 
we didn't see the creation of a school of 
music as a viable option." 
Violin professor Carolyn Plummer 
says, ."The students benefited 
tremendously from the grad•. students." 
Graduate students were able to act as 
mentors for undergraduates and were 
able to teach lessons on campus. Lessons 
not only helped the graduate students 
gain experience in teaching, but also 
gave the music department a form of 
income no longer available.

. the money from lessons for various discretionary · purposes, including student performances and the purchase of instruments," Roche says. "It is a financial problem, and we are currently looking for creative solutions to solve it." 
Aside from financial changes, undergraduates feel neglected by the change in ·concentration widiin the curriculum. After-the music minor was taken away, the music department created a new major called "music and culture" to add to the "theory and history" and "performance" concentrations. Lewis' decision to pursue this major led to frustration with' changing. advisors and unclear curriculmn requirements, "I was 
·· ·a little worried that a lot of the classes 
twas. taking weren't couriting to my major," Lewis says. "Now I've taken a lot ofclasses that are sitting in my transcript doing nothing." · 
Just as Lewis struggled with changes in the curriculum, the leadership in the music department is under a transition 
· period. The current chair of the program, Lo~is Mackenzie, comes from the department of romance languages, not from music. "We· made a decision to have a.n outside faculty member serve as chair," Roche says. Many _of the professors in music had already served their time as chair or were unable to fill the position. "I am currently the point person for two prospective senior hires in music, one of whom would chair the department," Roche says .. 
Staying Upbeat· 
Despite the struggles, Lewis is happy overall with her choice of major. "Because of the size of the department, the faculty and students really get to 
· know each other," Lewis says. "It's a big musical family.,, . . . .. Roche is confident in the future of the music department. "We developed a three-part plan to make improvements. The first was an interim plan using modest resources, giving more access to practice rooms during evening hours, opening up the chapels in dorms for practice, making sound proof practice 
rooms available in the residential halls and the band building, and giving access to the chapel in Malloy [Hall] and space in the DPAC,'' Roche says. ''Thesecond part includes a phased-in investment in renovations in Crowley Hall, amounting to more than 1.5 million dollars. The third is a long-term goal of a new building." 
"The music. theory;.. performance and history professors . are top-notch, nationally recognized," Petrucci says. "It's a· shame that we don't have the facilities and clout to accompany the scholasticism and research." 
"We do the best with what we have to work with," says Plummer, a violinist who has held prestigious. positions

One graduate is currently at the Julliard School of Music. Those tied to the music department are hoping to gain facilities that correspond to the prestige of the faculty and students. +

DEPT. OF FOOD REGULATION GOLDEN GIRLS OF SDH 
She's locked in. 
She has the look ofa guard so stern, so suspicious, that it's as if she's been tracking your every movement since the moment you stepped out of bed this morning. A chillingly omniscient look, as if she knows what you're going to do before the idea even formulates in your brain. She's waiting for you, in fact, daring you to do it. You know you want to. In one hand, you're holding a cup of delightfully delicious frozen yogurt; in your other hand, you make up for it with the healthier banana. You know the rules of the game. Only one may leave. Which one will it be? Forget the rules, you say to yourself. They won't catch me this time. 
"You kids try everything," Mitzie told me matter­of-factly. "You think we can't see or hear sometimes, but we do." Mitzie is one of the Golden Girls, the nice old ladies that grant entrance to the enchanted palace of buffet lines by swiping ID cards. They are the ladies that bid you a nice day as you amble out of the Dining Hall on a full stomach, and keep the peace in the hallowed hall, ensuring that our naturally anarchistic desires remain in check. 
As students, we often joke about the looks of deathly boredom on the faces of these card swipers and hall monitors. We get the feeling sometimes that some think ofus as spoiled, ungrateful college kids. In fact, it's quite the opposite. "I love this job. My favorite part of the job a grandmotherly smile, is the junior member of the group, 
having been at Notre Dame for 11 years, and at SDH for the 
past year. 
Jo, whom I talked to after dinner one night, echoes Mitzie's sentiments. "Every day is different," she says. "I enjoy being around students. We'll joke and kid around." Jo is a Notre Dame veteran, having worked at SDH for four years and in other capacities at the university for the past 29. Most of the Golden Girls have long since retired from previous careers, and some say the students they interact with everyday remind them of the children they have long since put through college. One thing that always entertains them, though, are the wide array of excuses students have used to 
get into the dining hall, whether it's the absence of an ID card or a reason why the student showed up for Sunday brunch at 1:31. 
So you've decided to go for it. It's now or never. Her attention has turned to a conversation with another student. You briskly and inconspicuously try to whisk out the door unnoticed. Just when you think you've made it, a gentle touch on

COMMENTARY 
Video Killed the Football Star 
Chris Wilson 
When the news about white towels being handed out for the Michigan State game was released, a lot of Irish fans groaned. Like the porn-porns you'll find in stadiums across the country, this is just one in a long line of "Are you pumped up?" tactics being used to get crowds into the game. At any sporting event, simply cheering is never enough. Whether it's the wave, thundersticks, Terrible Towels, rally monkeys, cowbells or coordinated t-shirt give­aways, home teams across the country are attempting to unite their cheering sections through the latest in team-spirit accessories -the trendiest of these being the everpresentJumbotron. Is this sort of canned enthusiasm necessary at college football games? Apparently, yes. After attending the road openers the past couple seasons, it seems that in order to really focus the energies of the crowd, you need a giant, :flashing, "1984"-esque screen imploring them to "GET LOUD!" But the question now becomes -after being impressed over the past two seasons with the atmospheres in Atlanta and Happy Valley­does Notre Dame Stadium need to upgrade its in-game motivational techniques? It's not really a secret that beyond the student section, "The House Rockne Built" is not an intimidating place to play most of the time. Whether it's the proliferation of older fans throughout the stadium or the idea that a lot of Irish fans are just so focused on the 
game they forget to cheer, there's definite room for improvement. 
So is itworth it to eschew the decades ofJumbotron-less and techno­
free tradition to gain a competitive advantage? I've heard many an 
Irish fan say that if the stadiui:n ever gets a Jumbotron; they'll stop 
going to games. But the video board itself is not the actual problem. If 
a giant screen were placed in Notre Dame Stadium to show replays or 
a better angle of the action going on in the opposite corner, it might 
be a good idea. 
The problem arises in that once a Jumbotron is installed, fans are 
immediately exposed to an endless stream of"Thanks to our corporate 
sponsors!" messages. Ifthere's a big screen there just screaming to be 
used for advertising revenue, you know the university is going to use 
it. 
Is it worth trading in the heap· of tradition for a slightly louder stadium? It doesn't matter whether the band is playing "Rakes of Mallow" or a "Speaker City"-worthy system is blasting "Zombie Nation;" Notre Dame fans will usually act a certain way. While they may be considered arrogant and pompous in the office or online, the Irish fanbase takes pride in being hospitable hosts. Instead of trying to get on the big screen, the fans are focused on the game, intent on not missing anything and showing respect to the opponents, even if they know it may not be reciprocated. It's no excuse for not having an electric atmosphere week in and week out, but it's better than selling our cheering section souls to som~ flashy video god. +

Thirty-Four Years Ago 
As a seasoned traveler, I always enjoy a road trip to the fine city of Chicago. When I get the hankerin' for a deep dish pizza, there's nothing that can stop me from driving out to get it ... except for maybe the horrible smell that wafts off of Gary, Ind. when I drive by. Let's see what the fine folks at Scholastic thought about it 34 years ago: 
"Chicago. The very name has a romantic, exotic ring. Particularly to the ears ofa young boy whose heroe,s perform their magnificent feats in her arenas, or to a young man seeking excitement and the future ... Chicago has lured many ofmy friends away from their homes. She has beckoned to them and they have followed her upstairs at Im· promise oftheir chance at something more." 
Wow. They really liked Chicago back then. Am I missing something? Was there even less to do in_South Bend in the past than there is now? Was there not traffic? Did Chicago have a five-piece band and a slice ofpie waiting to greet every weary traveler? I guess we will never know.

y venerable Gipp-ciples! Sell thy possessions, remove thy ,undies, and follow the Gipp 
to pleasure town! 
Now there are two types of people at our beloved university: 1) those who have a respectful approach to the opposite sex, and 2) those who fake it well. The first type will probably lead quiet lives and end up in heaven someday. The second type will, in all likelihood, end up in the seventh circle of hell writhing in eternal agony. I guess that's not funny. But how they get there sure is. 
Meet our future child of the inferno: As the Gipp only associates with rock stars, it's no surprise that this week's party boy exhibits zero reticence in approaching, roping and duping members of the opposite sex. 
Let's just call him "morally depraved," an M.D. without the MCAT. Freshly 21 and achin' for some South Bend bacon, Dr. Debauch decided to head to a local establishment with some mates, seeking to express himself on the dance floor and perhaps be the alpha philanderer for the evening. Always game for a challenge -motivated by his hyperactive Y­chromosome -the Docta' decided to cook up a competition ... with himself. 
Initially, his intent was to coerce some vixens to this tavern to help balance out the gender pool. To accomplish this, he sent out text messages to numerous 
•innocent lasses, expressing his undying affection for each one of them. This champ does not possess the "just friends" card, and sadly, none of the fine young ladies in his phone consider themselves that either. As he had it coming, this unlucky chap received two messages in his inbox, both containing ETAs and "I can't wait to see you"s. In a dramatic glance up at his friends, he smiles, and says, "I got this. It'll be a challenge." 
Enter the debutantes, commence the insanity. Displaying a combination of skill and moxie not seen since the days of Fabio, M.D. pulls it off. BOTH girls somehow remain oblivious of the other as Debauch holds court at the bar with one on each side. He takes them both back to the table after some shots, using his friends as a buffer in order to better facilitate his amorous malfeasance. 
The more perceptive of the two girls (Girl No. 1) finally detects some tomfoolery is afoot and, upset and tired, disappointedly decides to leave. To the Docta', this is a minor operational setback. As Girl No. 1 walks out the door, M.D. goes, "Hey, I'll call you tomorrow." 
He is fine; there is one left. After last call, some parking lot P.D.A. and a hopeful ride home, M.D. finds himself in Girl No. 2 's car, but he finds out they are not on their way to her place, but to one of those chastity-laced dungeons: the dorms. She obviously had no intentions aligning with his. Thinking on his feet, the Docta' makes his move: "vVait, my roommate has someone over. I ... uh ... can't go back and ruin my mate's mojo

! 
... wh ... where should I stay?" Girl No. 2 [disappointed but resigned, still no aligned motives]: "Do you have a friend off campus you could stay with?" M.D. [glorious comprehension of what he is about to do dawning on him]: "Why ... yes! Yes I do!" So where does he get her to drive him? Where do you think? The sleepy love bungalow of Girl No. l. Girl No. 2 thinks it is a guy's house, drops him off outside, and pulls away. Game over. The Docta' wins. Hell is waiting. But so is Girl No. 1, and she is just steps away. 
In no way does the Gipp condone or approve of these actions. He just gets a kick out of them. So, in the future, the Gipp says: 
Gipper Law: Thou must keep all options open and thou shalt utilize all resources possible. Also, always bring at least one eternally suspect conservative friend. 
I'm just not sure ladies. Could one of you give me a story where you've shamed a man? Why does it seem like the guys are having all of this fun? 
Devoted readers, ifyou feel the Gip per exacerbates gender relation issues here at Notre Dame, then you need to get out more. I teach lessons. I inform the uninformed. I don't always support what I write. Always remember, discard half-empty beers, watch after your sisters, lock away your daughters, and obviously tip the Gipp at gipper@nd. edu. Faithfully yours, the Gipper. +

· Suri Cruise is overlord of celebrity infant treachery 
Elisa Suarez 
Letme just tell you all r.ightnow, I'm not a suspicious person. I don't go to sleep with a beer bottle on the door knob so I'll be alerted if someone's coming in. I like to believe what people tell me. When Charlie Weis says that we're gonna win one, I believe him. IfI found OJ. Simpson in a truck with a gun and a bunch of old baseball cards, and he said that he was innocent, I'd send him · on his way and hope for the best. Oh, you "forgot" to call me last Friday night when I was sitting home alone? That's fine; I believe you. But innocence aside -I still believe that there's a lot of sneaky stuff going on in the world around us. Conspiracies, if you will. First, there's the fact that China's been trying to slowly kill us off for the past year, and we're just too dumb to understand. I mean . . . how many times do they have to poison our food
I and toys before we realize? Then there was the time that people kept buying those small hairless dogs from Mexico. Small hairless dogs? Some guy in line at Arby's told me those were really just huge rats. There was also the time that my high school cheerleading team sold Krispy Kremes as a "fundraiser." Nice try, girls ... we all know that's just your secret plan to make everyone else in school fat. Finally, there's the time that the Disney Company bought Canada in order to turn it into a theme park called 
I. Disney Country. 
These conspiracies are good, but nothing, absolutely nothing tops the aura of mystery and the sordid smell of 
36 I SCHOLASTIC I 27 SEPTEMBER 2007 
deception that swarms around celebrity babies. This story starts in California, as all good stories start. Not that this story is good. I bet you're wondering why you're still reading. 
A few summers ago, due to a combination of the grace of God and a small pool ofpoorly qualified applicants, I received a summer internship in Los Angeles. Besides discovering a love for silicone and Sun-In, I also uncovered one of the largest orchestrated conspiracies of our age. While driving to an environmental rally in separate Range Rovers, my friend and I happened to become lost in the Hollywood area. 
If you know anything about the big city, you'll know that Hollywood is full of kooks and famous people, with those two categories overlapping about 70 percent of the time. Anyway, you'd understand why I wouldn't want to stick around. We stopped at a local Eckerd drug store and long story short, I found a hidden trap door and stumbled into a convention of Scientologists. Since I was sporting Rainbow sandals and a lot of fake designer crap, I was able to blend in. 
At this Scientology seminar I bought a bracelet, took a few wheat grass shots, picked up a flyer, and then found this out: Suri Cruise -the daughter of the infamous TomKat (a.k.a. Tom Cruise and KatieHolmes)-is, indeed, a robot. She is a robot infused with Tom's chromosomes designed as a conduit of Scientology to bring the religion to the next generation. Once this robo-tot is fully developed, not only will she be a direct conduit to L. Ron Hubbard himself, but also sporty and cute. Initial testing of Project 
S.U.R.I. (Scientology Undercover Robot In disguise) has proven to be a smashing success ... I mean, who else in the world has gotten a 20-page spread in Vanity Fair before age one? And, her hair is just too good to be natural. 
Also while in the Los Angeles area, I attempted to part the clouds ofdeception surrounding a suspicious piece of progeny: the one and only daughter of Brangelina. You know who ... Shiloh Jolie-Pitt. Although she is probably a real human child, I find it highly suspect that the two most widely acknowledged hot people in the world happened to all of a sudden have a child together. The odds of this happening by coincidence are astronomical. I suspect that the PPP (Planet's Prettiest People) had a hand in it, I also found that Brady Quinn was recently inducted into the PPP because he is, indeed, blazin'. 
Anyway ... I have a lot more theories, hilt I also_ have something called a "word limit" because this is a "serious magazine." I was going to make my own conspiracy theory Web site about all these shenanigans, but then I'd probably be chased down by the secret Scientology army (a.k.a. the Cruise­saders -ha, even evil cult leaders like puns). However, I figured it'd be safe to write-it in here because no -one actually reads this. But just so you know, if I die in my sleep it's because I was killed since I know too much. Alert someone. +
