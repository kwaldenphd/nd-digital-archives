Football in 1947—Some Observations
ATTHEN a football season comes to a close, especially one which produced such a record share of thrills and controversies T " as the season just past, one is inclined to indulge in a bit of reverie, looking back over the excitement, the issues, the bits of human interest that go to make football the great collegiate sport it is. Inspired by such a mood the Scholastic has selected two or three outstanding features from the maze of memories and recollections which even at close range appear to have dominated the season’s activities.
Foremost among these was the ability, demonstrated time and again by the Irish to turn on the power whenever it was needed. Just as in boxing and other sports one of the attributes of championship football teams is the capacity to capitalize on scoring opportunities — to spot an opening and take advantage of it rather than dissipating power in fruitless, sustained effort. Notre Dame convincingly laid claim to championship status in this regard as in others — for the caliber of — the opposition almost always determined the caliber of Notre Dame play. A comfortable margin of victory seemingly was ^all that was desired. For not until the Tulane game did the score mount to the proportions of a rout. In this instance skeptical critics necessitated such a result, forcing the Irish gridmen to prove they had the power to overwehlm an opponent at will, and thus were entitled to top position among the nation’s football machines. Previously, however, Notre Dame power was turned on only long enough to establish clear-cut decisions. Nor is the Northwestern game an exception — as a glance at that game’s statistics will show. When a series of breaks allowed the Wildcats (who played magnificently, let it be understood) to dangerously narrow N. D.’s winning margin, the Irish promptly proceeded to reverse the process with a convincing power drive. Although halted by a goal-line fumble it left no doubt as to Notre Dame’s supremacy.
This, then, was the 1947 Notre Dame football team — truly a championship aggregation. But what of the future — especially in regard to opposition for the Irish juggernaut? Here the outlook took on a bleak aspect this past fall. The termination of the long and honored Army-Notre Dame series undoubtedly was responsible for focusing such widespread attention on the situation. Briefly, it boils down to the inescapable conclusion that many of the better high-ranking college teams are deliberately avoiding Notre Dame — purposely closing their schedules to the South Bend powerhouse. In this regard, however, Scholastic hastens to recall how Naval Academy officials expressed the Annapolis position on the matter. The job of the Academy is to produce the highest type of Naval officer. Football contributes to this end in that the Midshipmen engaged in this activity meet the strongest and most worthy competition. For Navy officials believe that only by competing with the best, regardless of outcome, can courageous officers be developed to lead a fighting Fleet. It is indeed unfortunate that all do not share these sentiments, for it is an undeniable fact that wherever college football is played the sport’s ultimate end is the greater development of men of courage and strength. Hand-picked competition, designed to injure successful seasons, will never permit the realization of that objective.
Whenever talk among football fans centers about great Notre Dame elevens the theory is almost inevitably proposed that an unlimited supply of talent at the University accounts for Irish gridiron success. To an extent, perhaps, this is true. No great football team has ever been formed without a relative abundance of good material. However, it has long been the Scholastic’s contention that Notre Dame does not have a corner on the manpower market.
Yet when one considers the fact that America is populated by nearly 145,000,000 hardy souls, a good proportion of whom are husky young high school lads, the possibility of one school attracting the fifty best football players is unthinkable. That there are fifty, or even five hundred, young men who are essentially and innately better athletes than their millions of brethren is equally impossible. No — the secret of great Notre Dame football teams lies only partially in material.
What then is the secret, if it be such, behind the constant flow of great Notre Dame football machines, which year after year vie for national championship honors? Scholastic maintains the considered opinion that this success has been the result, fundamentally, of hard work. Hard work, directed by a crew of dogged, driving coaches, who pound the fundamentals of football into a highly receptive group of alert young athletes who never seem to lose their enthusiasm for the game. It is this attention to detail, so characteristic of Rockne’s coaching brilliance and so obvious a trademark of his remarkable young successor, Frank Leahy, which accounts for the smooth perfection of Notre Dame teams. Fundamentals are never lost sight of in Irish football — a boast shared by all of the University’s departments — not even when the attention of the tacticians is directed toward the more complex details of attack and defense. For it is perfection in fundamentals which guarantees success in the complexities of modem college football. And it is this basically well-coached ideal, ^carried into action by groups of Irish warriors inspired by the very real “Spirit of Notre Dame” which has kept Notre Dame constantly in the fore-front of college football.

CROWDS
Crowds, perhaps more than any other single phenomenon, characterized Notre Dame football in 1947. In this second post-war football season the Fighting Irish soared to heights never before reached by any college football team, and captured the fancies and imaginations of additional millions of American football fans. And the observable results were crowds! Crowds that made every Notre Dame game a complete sellout. Crowds — the 10,000 who crammed the fieldhouse for the Army pep rally; the more than 59,000 who overflowed the stadium for the grand finale of the Army-Notre Dame series; and the year’s top mark of 103,000 at Los Angeles for the climax game of the year between Notre Dame and Southern California. A total of approximately 566,000 fans saw the Irish in their nine games this past season.

FRANK LEAHY—
Anybody, Anywhere, Anytime
By JOHN A. O'CONNOR
At a Quarterback Luncheon in Chicago one bright October Monday this fall an inquisitive guest carefully pondered his thoughts, sized up the speaker, and £ blurted out: “How bad do you think Michigan could whip Notre Dame?”
Frank Leahy, the speaker, leaped to the challenge. “I just wish we had an opportunity to beat Michigan,” the Irish coach replied. He masticated each word, and his blue eyes glinted eagerly. “We’d ■ be happy to play them anywhere, any Saturday, any fall.”
That was Frank Leahy the fighter speaking. Like a bristling tiger turning to defend its tawny brood, the Notre Dame coach set his firm Gaelic jaw and came out scrapping for his team. Newsmen, having lapped up their own preseason publicity which pegged Irish power in terms of atom-bomb potentialities, had been unimpressed by the low-gear pick-up with which the Blue and Gold had started the season. So they sat back and picked their teeth, jibed and jabbed about rifts in the squad, diagnosed the case as one of acute over-ratedness, and hurled their criticisms accordingly. The crack about Michigan was going too far. They poked censure at the wrong guy. They got Leahy’s Irish up, and he flung down the gauntlet at the Ann Arbor aggregation, which, because of their top-ranking position among the nation’s teams, could mean a challenge to any football club in the U. S. It reminds one of the cartoon dated about 1930 that pictures a cleated Notre Darner straddling the continent, and through cupped hands yelling across the ether to all the whirling planets, “Anybody want to play football?”
Frank Leahy and his lads are a fighting crew. He instills that into them at every practice session. “Be a fighter, gents,” he reminds them: “not only out there on the football field, but out in life as well.” This goes for the tuckered ballcarrier, laden and haltered with tacklers, who churns a few more steps, and scraps for another foot of yardage. In the spirit of Notre Dame’s teaching it goes for the college man who must scrap his way in
the business world, fighting for his faith, his family and his country.
Coach Leahy has always been a fighter. Back in Winner, South Dakota, little “Monk”Leahy tangled with neighborhood kids in the ring between scheduled events to pick up small change. At Omaha’s Central High young Frank fought his way to captaincy of his high school team. Under Rockne at Notre Dame in 1929 the 180-pound Leahy thumped the road to the first-string tackle assignment before injuries cut his playing days short. In New York, where he coached the ‘■'Seven Blocks of Granite” under the Drowsy One, handsome Frank fought his way through Brooklyn subway throngs to win his sweetheart, Flossie Reilly. Even today he almost has to fight his way in and out of his office, always clogged with reporters, ticket-seekers, admirers, business-men, friends, and his lads. In handling this latter chore he has the assistance of charming, pleasant Snub Pollard, and able, friendly Frank Sullivan.
Coach Leahy loves his football. To the eternal distress of opponents, he approaches the game from a scientific angle. His concept of the T-formation as the game’s best system of play comes from long, late hours of mathematical approach. The lamps in Leahy’s office burn at all hours. He has a scholarly knowledge of the sport. Switching to a box huddle, with Lu jack facing the sidelines, was no mere artistic whim. The Old Fox figured Johnny could better observe the defense, the boys could jog out faster, and more running plays would follow. They did.
An example of the thoroughness Leahy 'injects into his brand of ballplaying is his instructions to the fullbacks on block-

ACT IV— the games they play’]
Mi*	=	■	=5=g6V
£ PITTSBURGH, Oct. 4.—Grimy Pittsburgh Stadium shone dully under a toasting autumnal sun this afternoon as some 64,333 sunkissed, soot-covered spectators—first capacity crowd here since the halcyon days of Marsh Goldberg— watched and waited.
Watching, they saw a scrappy Panther football team stem the Notre Dame tide until a flood of Irish substitutes coupled with the uncompromising heat, finally to overwhelm a virtually one-string Pitt eleven in a 40-6 defeat.
Waiting, they failed to see the visitors from South Bend assume their 1946 championship mein which had been so glowingly reissued them this season by grid experts.
The Panthers had obviously polished theii- available talent in last week’s tussle with Illinois, while for Notre Dame it was the initial clash of the ’47 season—and they showed it. Reportedly sluggish and far off stride in practice sessions this fall, the Irish looked every bit the part, gaining a paltry 209 yards rushing and being guilty of six fumbles. It was only John Lu jack with his devastating arm who saved the varsity from sinking into oblivion on offense.
The first Notre Dame touchdown of the ’47 season came $ after six minutes of play, the honors going to Terry Brennan who wound up a 57-yard drive by ramming over from the three. The march was sparked by a Lujack pass to Jim Martin good for 34 yards and a first down on the Pitt 14. Earley’s conversion sent the Leahymen ahead, 7-0. The Panther’s countered midway in the second stanza when Frank Tri-pucka, gazing downfield from the Irish 21 in search of pass receivers, was hit and fumbled, McPeak recovering for the Pennsylvanians. Four plays placed the pigskin on the Notre Dame 11, first and ten. On fourth down DiPasqua elected to run the injured and absent Moose Connor’s left tackle slot. It was good judgment on the part of Pitt’s quarterback for the play picked up the necessary seven yards and a touchdown.
Twelve seconds before the second quarter ended, Lujack again inserted himself into the proceedings and fired a 9-yard flat pass to end Doug Waybright who stood unencumbered on the Panther goal line. The Irish had taken possession of the ball on their own 20 following Hardisty’s punt into the end zone. Brennan and Gompers shared chores with Lu jack’s accurate arm in bringing the ball to the Pitt 30 where Johnny again faded as if to pass but changed his mind and hoofed it down to the nine, where he was knocked out of "•B bounds. At this juncture, John whipped incompletely to Brennan but made amends on the next play by hitting Waybright and paydirt. The clock ran out after Earley missed the uprights and the visitors romped off the field leading, 13-6.
Leon Hart kicked off for the Irish to open the second half. Three running plays netted Pittsburgh only one yard, but Hardisty’s spiralling 57-yard boot set Notre Dame back on their own 18. Red Sitko scooted 13 yards in two tries before Lujack resumed his aerial attack. Waiting until fourth down Lujack dropped back and winged to Martin for the third Rambler score. Fred Earley booted his second conversion in three tries and the scoreboard read, Notre Dame 20, Pittsburgh 6.
With the fourth quarter came the Irish rebellion. Having refused to surrender more than one score per quarter, the single-string Panther hide finally wore thin and was pierced for 20 points. Bob Livingstone and Coy McGee lugged thirty yards overland enabling Lujack once again to pick out his target — this time Leon Hart. Earley’s boot made it 27-6. A recovered fumble and one play, a twisting sprint over left tackle, was all Coy McGee required to cover the distance. The score rested temporarily at 33-6. Lank Smith soon shook loose and only stopped after 17 yards to avoid hitting a goal W' post. Wee Fred Earley sent his fifth placement over the crossbars ' and Notre Dame had neatly disposed of the Panthers from Pittsburgh, 40-6.

A pair of Boilermaker tacklers play tug-of-war with Floyd Simmons and Joe Signaigo (foreground) lays watching.
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind., Oct. 11.—A once-defeated r Purdue football team today displayed the greatest form re- " versal of any one team in this young season. The Boilermakers threw up a defense that held Notre Dame to three touchdowns and a fieldgoal as the Irish triumphed 22-7.
On the first play from scrimmage after Purdue took the opening kickoff, Quarterback Bob DeMoss threw a wild pitch on a shovel lateral, to the left. Before the Purdue backfield could gather their wits, John Panelli was on the ball giving Notre Dame possession on the Boilermaker 21-yard line. In six plays the Irish had picked up a first down inside the ten, but penalties moved the ball back to the 21. On the seventh play after the fumble John Lu jack hit Terry Brennan in the end zone with a pass for six points. Steve Oracko missed his first try for the conversion, but the Purdue line was offside and on the second try Oracko made the point good to put the Irish ahead 7-0.	'
Later in the same period Purdue started its move. Interference was ruled on a pass from DeMoss to Ned Maloney, Purdue end, giving the Boilermakers a first down on the * Irish nine-yard lineY Three plays later Purdue was in the same spot, so on fourth down DeMoss unlimbered his throwing arm and connected to Harry Szulborski in the end zone. Art Haverstock kicked the extra point. This marked the first time that a team had made a conversion against Notre Dame since the end of the 1945 season.
Purdue was on its way to another score later in the first period when a fumble on the Irish 29 upset the march and gave Notre Dame another break which led to a touchdown. After two running plays and an offside penalty, Lujack threw a pass to Larry Coutre who was brought down on the Boilermaker 21. Then Lujack faded to pass but found it more expedient to run. He crossed the goal line unmolested. The play covered 21 yards. Oracko failed to convert.
In the second quarter the Purdue forwards tightened their grip on the Irish offense. Only once in the quarter were the Irish able to move into scoring territory, but the attack slowed down on the Purdue 11 where it was fourth down and one. Bather than try for the first down, the Irish called upon Oracko who kicked a field goal from the 18, putting the Irish out in front 16-7. It was the first field ' goal that Notre Dame had scored since the Navy game in 1942. The half ended with Notre Dame holding the lead.
The final score of the game came in the third period after Coy McGee fielded a Purdue punt on his own 40 and side-stepped and feinted his way back to the Purdue 17. After a few thrusts at the line by the Irish backs, Floyd Simmons carried the ball into the end zone from the three. Oracko again failed in his conversion attempt.
Purdue, which had dropped an early season game to Wisconsin, was not given a chance to put up a battle with the Irish. But the Boilermakers thought differently and from the opening kickoff to the final whistle they made it a battle. The ends Clyde Grimenstein, Bob Heck and Maloney kept the Irish wide run attack bottled up all afternoon. The defensive work of these three left the Irish with but one recourse, the forward pass, which Lujack and Frank Tri-pucka used on 26 occasions. The two hit their receivers 16 times for 184 yards. On the ground Purdue outrushed Notre Dame 128 yards to 89 chiefly through the efforts of Harry Szulborski and Norm Adams. The game sent Irish rooters and critics home with the question on their lips, “What’s wrong with Notre Dame?”

The game heralded as a battle of beefy lines turned into a romping revue for scampering halfbacks as stubborn Nebraska succumbed before Notre Dame’s concentrated land and air attack, 31-0.
A capacity throng of 56,000 sun-drenched fans saw the Irish open a four-game backyard stand by outplaying the undermanned Cornhuskers in all departments to regain a capsule of their pre-season reputation, fastly waning in the past two games. With Johnny Lujack masterminding, the T, Notre Dame piled up 20 first downs to the Buskers’ nine; covered 255 yards in land skirmish to 149 for its heavier, adversary; completed 10 out of 17 passes for 135 net yards while Nebraska’s Del Weigand was hard-pressed to get across a lone heave out of eight tries for a trifling four yards.
Yet the leading men of this afternoon’s pigskin panorama were not the big, braising linemen, but a trio of swift scat backs led by one Coy McGee, whose spine-tingling display of halfback choreography had the crowd on its feet during much of the game. Seasoning his role with pre-punt return gymnastics, McGee picked up 66 yards in 10 shots at the Busker line. In the other stellar roles were Emil Sitko, top ground gainer of the day with 53 yards in five attempts and Terry Brennan, the Irish workhorse, with 42 yards in eight tries.
Notre Dame began its first touchdown drive toward the end of the first period. Starting at the 26-yard line, John Fanelli, Mike Swistowicz, Larry Coutre, and McGee picked up five straight first downs to bring the ball to the Nebraska eight from which point Fanelli drove over for the marker. Oracko failed to convert.
The Irish picked up their next touchdown at the start of the second period as Swistowicz moved the ball from Notre Dame’s 45 to Nebraska’s 33 in three smashes off right tackle. Frank Tripucka flipped a pass to Brennan who galloped 22 more yards. With three more shots at the Nebraska line Swistowicz carried the mail over for the second score. Once again Oracko’s toe failed to yield the extra point.
$
McGee set the stage for the third touchdown, returning a Busker punt 35 yards to midfield. Lujack hit Swistowicz for 36 yards and a first down on the Nebraska 14 and then McGee wiggled through tackle on a quick-opener to scamper across standing up. This time Fred-Earley tried his luck with the toe and scored a bullseye.
A 91-yard march netted the fourth tally early in the last period. Sitko opened the proceedings with a 33-yard slash off tackle, followed by successive thrusts by McGee, Bill Gay and himself before Tripucka completed a 20-yard aerial to Gay to put the ball on the Nebraska 13. A penalty pushed it back to the 18, but a pass to Sitko picked up four yards, and another to Waybright notched the score. Earley’s kick was wide.
Nebraska fumbled the ensuing kickoff and George Stroh-meyer recovered for the Irish. In successive line plays, Sitko, Gay and Floyd Simmons moved the mail to the Busker 10, where Sitko capped the afternoon’s touchdown proceedings with a 10-yard jaunt around left end after a shovel pass from Tripucka. Earley’s kick was blocked.
The game was the rubber match of the Irish-Busker series, leaving Notre Dame with six victories against five for Nebraska. One game ended in a tie.

Rain threatened teasingly and the crowd sat speculatively this gray, gloomy afternoon. But the Notre Dame football squad solemnly went about its business of accomplishing four-ends all within the space of two hours before a sellout crowd of 56.000 in the Notre Dame Stadium: it played as hard as was necessary to defeat ever dangerous Iowa, 21-0; it evened the all-time series with Iowa at three victories apiece; it restored itself to No. 1 position in the national rankings; and it convinced many a sportswriter that he labored under-misapprehensions.
From Des Moines, Davenport, Sioux City, Marshalltown, Missouri Valley, and even little Boone came the Hawkeye hopefuls to watch their team try to recapture the Indian sign it once had on Notre Dame. Back to the farms, back to the offices went the Hawkeye hopefuls nodding, somewhat incredibly, but convinced that the Irish and Frank Leahy had meant business.
Despite what any dope sheet had to say, Iowa, like all its predecessors on the Notre Dame schedule, had pointed for this one since way back when you were lolling on the beach last June. And the Hawks played that way, too. Rousing them on was its student'cheering section and a very well organized, 100-piece band, part of the Iowa student trip.
The game was about three plays old when Billy Walsh, the Jersey Jumbo, recovered an Iowa fumble on the Hawkeye 29. It was one of Iowa’s few fumbles of the afternoon but a very costly one. With Lu jack at the controls and mix-

ing his plays expertly, he sent Brennan off tackle in two plays for sixteen yards. The Comet hit Jungle Jim Martin with a bullet pass for a first down. Then Brennan knifing nicely through the Iowa defense, went over. Freddy “The Foot” Earley converted his first of three successes for the afternoon, and the game took on the appearance of a rout.
Usually though, you don’t rout a club which has Eddie Anderson, Jack Meagher, and Frank Carideo on its coaching staff. Still, it continued to look that way when Coy McGee, the Texas loper, returned a punt to midfield. Red Sitko dashed, slammed and hurdled to the Iowa 18. Again, Terry Brennan, playing one of the most brilliant games of his college career-' galloped like a man possessed for the second T.D. Four players had shots at him; nobody stopped him.
Iowa, striving desperately to draw even, fought back fortuitously for the most part. Into the game came one of its top-billed performers. Al DiMarco, the mighty mite from Mason City. DiMarco, though always a threat, didn’t put on the show that was expected of him. Frequently, he was smothered by the charging Irish forward wall; at other W times he never came near his target. The one Hawkeye threat that really smelled of touchdown vintage was a thing of beauty. Just after the second half had gotten under way Emlen (The Gremlin) Tunnell slanted off tackle between Connor and Martin, a rare feat in itself. Tunnell, suddenly realizing that those gates open seldom, made the most of it. He reversed his field and sauntered 65 yards before being forced out on the 10 by Brennan and Lu jack who had shrewdly jockeyed the runner and blocker close to the sidelines all the way down.
From here on, Lu jack, wary of opponents’ scouts, used basic plays to direct a 98-yard drive which was interrupted only briefly by a Sitko fumble. Larry Coutre sliced off guard from the Iowa one for the final tally.
Both teams had touchdowns nullified, but the one in which Frank Tripucka pitched a 30-yard toss to Bill Wightkin was one of the best executed plays of the game. That one was a symphony in faking. McGee and Billy Gay were great little crowd-pleasers catching the fancy with their dipsy-doodle running. On the line there was many an able hand but Bob Lally from South Euclid, Ohio, was red hot! On six successive running plays he personally brought, or assisted in bringing, the runner down.

CLEVELAND, 0., Nov. 1.—Like a blind elephant throwing his ponderous weight around in all directions, sometimes stumbling and generally looking somewhat clumsy as a striking force, but always wreaking havoc and consternation on all sides of him, Notre Dame’s unstoppable football team today crashed through Navy, 27-0, for its fifth straight victory.
Over a thousand Notre Darners, in Cleveland* on the annual student trip, were on hand to watch the fun, and the Irish, aided by clear skies, still air and bright sunshine strangely suited to All Saints Day, did their best to make the trip a complete success.
It was an ideal day for passing, and Johnny Lujack and his suddenly-sensational understudy, Frank Tripucka, passed the Middies off their poop deck. Two aerials accounted for the first two touchdowns in the first and second quarters, one a 29-yard pitch from Lujack to Terry Brennan and the „ other a 31-yard fling from Tripucka to Leon Hart. In the ► third period, Brennan’s one-yard plunge and Bob Livingstone’s 42-yard romp with a stolen Navy pass finished the day’s work. Faithful Fred Earley converted after all but the second score.
The dozen Army scouts who helped set an all-time crowd record of 84,117 for Cleveland’s Municipal Stadium must have gone back to West Point feeling bitterly frustrated, for Notre Dame showed nothing but straight football.
Except for a single spectacular- play, most of the game’s highlights came on the passes of Lujack and Tripucka. Lujack, operating in standard form, completed ten of 18 throws for 172 yards; Tripucka, rendering his peak performance of the year, completed eight of nine for 136 yards.
Lujack brought the mob roaring to its feet in the second quarter when, with the ball on the N. D. six, he dropped back for a pass, saw a hole, and galloped 72 yards before being nailed on the Navy 22. Unfortunately his anti-climactic fumble gave Navy the ball right there. John’s ran, longest of the day, did much to build up Notre Dame’s total ground gain of 185 yards.
Navy plugged away at the Irish defense for a good total of 131 yards on the ground and 112 in the air, but threatened seriously only twice. With second and third stringers in for N. D., the middies moved on passes to the 21 in the third quarter and to the three in the fourth, but couldn’t do much more about it.
The first Irish score came at 12:03 of the first period. After both teams had fooled around for a while, Leon Hart hopped on a Navy fumble on the Middies’ 42. Emil Sitko went off guard for ten yards and a first down, and he and Terry Brennan picked up three more on a couple of shots at the line. Then Lujack, running wide to his right, flipped a 29-yarder to Brennan deep in the end zone. Nobody was near Terry as he raced down the field and into the right cornel- to snag the pass.
Notre Dame scored again in the second period soon after Lu jack’s ramble had put the ball deep in Navy territory. A few plays after John’s fumble, fullback Bill Hawkins obligingly gave the ball right back. This time John Frampton made the recovery on the Navy 38. Tripucka tossed to Bill Wightkin for seven and then hit the towering Hart as he crossed the goal line. The T. D. came at 4:46.
Another recovered fumble spread the carpet for the first score in the third quarter. Again it was omnipresent Leon Hart on the spot, this time on the N. D. 46. Passes to Brennan and Jim Martin ate up most of the yardage, and Brennan bucked over at 7:10.
Bob Livingstone added the fourth and final touchdown when he fielded a Navy pass with ten seconds left in the third period and scurried 42 yards down the left sidelines.
The unqualified success of the Irish aerial attack in today’s scrimmage threw a significant light on next week’s feud-ending fuss with Army. As the Notre Dame students filed out this afternoon, the “Go Irish; Beat Army!” chant rolled across the vast spaces of the Stadium.

Army 7
By JIM BUTZ
Before an all-time record crowd in Notre Dame Stadium of -59,171 the Fighting Irish ripped the vaunted Army line to shreds and piled up a 27-7 victory over the Cadets on November 8 in the temporary finale of the greatest series in collegiate football history.
Just as their predecessors of 34 years ago, the 1947 Notre Dame squad surprised Army with their offensive play. Disdaining their powerful air attack, the nation’s second best at the time, the Irish struck early and often along the ground to roll up 361 yards net from rushing, the medium which accounted for all four of their scores.
The death knell for Army hopes was sounded in the opening 18 seconds by Terence Patrick Brennan who gathered in Mackmull’s kickoff on his five-yard line with a fine over-the-shoulder catch and threaded his way 9-5 yards down the west sidelines to score. Brennan was aided by some fine blocks thrown by Jim Martin, George Connor, Bill Fischer, and Bill Walsh, but he used each block skillfully and picked, his way through until he reached his 25 from where he simply out-ran everyone. Earley added the seventh point as the crowd went delirious with joy at the prospect of an Irish scoring orgy.
Army received the next kickoff and was forced to punt after gaining a first down, Notre Dame taking over on its own 20. In just thirteen plays Notre Dame had covered the 80 yards to paydirt. Terry Brennan carried on six of the plays, gaining 29 of the yards, and adding a second tally to his brilliant opening run. The march was a masterpiece of quarterbacking by Johnny Lu jack who came up with several “surprises” for the Cadets at moments when it seemed as though the Irish attack would stall. Earley missed his conversion try, but with more than six minutes of the

first period remaining, Notre Dame led 13-0, and it seemed as though the slaughter was to be realized.
The Army showed its mettle, however, by driving to the Irish 35 after the next kickoff before being halted. Gillette featured the drive, picking up 28 yards in three attempts through the line.
The remainder of the first half saw both teams battle back and forth with Notre Dame having a little the better of it. Early in the second period the Irish began to roll from their own 14, and they swept Army back to its own 10-yard line where the soldiers stiffened and, aided by a penalty, stopped the drive.
Cadet rooters got a momentary thrill late in the second period when Galiffa recovered Simmons’ fumble. The nimble Galiffa faded back and tossed a beautiful pass downfield to halfback Winfield Scott who was behind the Irish secondary, but he dropped the ball inside the 25-yard line.
Largely due to a fumbled kickoff, Army was in a constant hole in the third quarter until Livingstone capped a 47-yard Irish march by scoring from six yards out. Swis-towicz and Livingstone sparked the Irish, and Fred Earley converted to make the count read 20-0.
The Army attack, which had sputtered several times earlier, finally began to roar late in the third stanza, and Rowan, Stuart, and Galiffa paced the Black Knights as they swept 56 yards down the field through an Irish line that had been unscored upon for 18 consecutive periods. The quarter ended with Army threatening on Notre Dame’s 23-yard line.
Elwyn “Rip” Rowan bucked over from the four in two tries to climax Army’s one scoring drive of the afternoon. Capt. Joe Steffy added the extra point from placement.
Stung by Army’s touchdown, the Irish retaliated by smashing 80 yards on the ground in 11 plays. Mike Swis-towicz and Larry Coutre were the big guns in this sequence, the two Chicago sophomores ripping through Army’s forwards for huge gains. Coutre tallied from 11 yards out and Earley added the 27th and final point for Notre Dame.
The remainder of the game saw Army filling the air with desperation heaves, few of which connected. And it was a Brennan who ended the game in Notre Dame’s favor just as a Brennan started the.Irish off on the right foot. _ Jim Brennan, brother of Terry, intercepted a wayward Cadet aerial to finish the day’s activities.

Notre Dame 26 Northwestern 19
By JOE WILCOX
CHICAGO, Nov. 15—Chicago, on a fcul November day with rain mingling with the mist and smog, is not a pleasant place to watch a football game. Notre Dame’s Fighting Irish, who came out on the long end of a sparse 26-19 score, found out that it was definitely not a pleasant place to play one. Rolling over Northwestern in the statistics, Notre Dame piled up 284 yards rushing to a mere 49 for the Purple. For once in their lives, sports writers who had been saying “anything can happen when Notre Dame plays Northwestern” had their trite predictions come true. Northwestern turned out to be a tougher tribe of Wildcats than anybody supposed, least of all the Irish. They were not nice kittens.
Notre Dame started out as if the afternoon were going to be one big practice session. With less than seven minutes of the game gone, Notre Dame drove from its own forty-yard line to score when Panelli, who had featured the Irish drive downfield, took the ball over the Wildcat goal from the nine-yard line. Earley’s kick failed.
Then, a mere 90 seconds later, Notre Dame struck again, this time through the air. When Northwestern fumbled the kickoff on their own 8-yard line, Notre Dame recovered. After several incomplete passes, Lu jack finally dropped a shot into the waiting arms of Terry Brennan, who stepped over the goal to make the score read Notre Dame 12, Northwestern 0. This time Earley’s kick was good.
It began to look like a rout. The 48,000 fans who had braved the afternoon’s elemental outrage began to squirm in their seats and wish that they were home by the fireside. However, after an intercepted pass, Northwestern found itself on Notre Dame’s fifteen-yard line. Then, following a pass which set the Wildcats on the five-yard line in the first play of the second quarter, Northwestern finally crossed the goal on its fourth try.. The kick was wide.
On an exhibition of acrobatics by Lancaster Smith, Notre Dame scored once again late in the second quarter. After Smith had stepped out of the end zone on a pass thrown by Frank Tripucka from the Northwestern 21-yard line, “Trip” threw another one from the Northwestern 37, where a holding penalty had set back the Irish. This pass clicked, as Smith made a baseball catch over the goal. Earley’s kick was good, and the score was Notre Dame 20, Northwestern 6, when the gun went off ending the half.
After Northwestern had kicked off to the Irish to start the second half, they stopped a sustained Irish drive on their own 9. From there, via a series of long passes from Burson to Vuravleff, the Wildcats drove to Notre Dame’s 9. The Irish held for three plays, but when Brennan slipped and , fell in the end zone covering a fourth down pass from Burson to Aschenbrenner, Northwestern had another six points. The try for the extra point was blocked, but the Wildcats were within eight points of Notre Dame.
Notre Dame came back in the opening moments of the fourth quarter to score its fourth and final touchdown. The Irish went from the Northwestern 38 across the goal line with Lu jack tossing a six-yard pass to Hart for the counter. Earley’s extra point attempt was blocked.
But Northwestern wasn’t done. With Notre Dame deep in its own territory, Frank Tripucka gambled with a third down pass from his own ten-yard line. On the slippery turf his receiver stumbled and the pass fell into the grasping arms of a covetous Northwestern man, who galloped over the goal unscathed. The kick was good, and Northwestern trailed by only one touchdown.
With the first team in again, the Irish drove to the Northwestern one-yard line before a fumble restored the ball to Northwestern’s possession. On the next play, Noi'th-western also fumbled, but the game ended one play later.
Panelli (67) skirts Northwestern's end pursued by Wiltgen (86) with Brennan leading the way. Others from left to right: Burson .

The Notre Dame power plant exploded again this after-“ noon before 57,000 chilled witnesses and an equally cold Tulane team. The final was a 59-6 triumph gained by an endless array of glittering backs operating behind a fierce-charging line.
“Moose” Krause, directing the attack in place of the absent Frank Leahy, saw his lads roll up a total of 559 yards while amassing the highest point total of any Leahy team.
Wise patrons streamed in early in case of kickoff spectaculars but they had three minutes to wait. Then, Terry Brenann captured an enemy pass on the Tulane 42 and bolted to the five, from where Emil Sitko did the honors in two smashes. Earley’s kick was wide.
The Tulane backs only watched the kick-off, so Jim Martin fell on it on the Green Wave’s 20. Lujack immediately hit Sitko with an end zone pass which Emil took over his shoulder at full speed. Earley appeared for the second time in a minute and converted.
Tulane successfully fielded the kick-off but was soon forced to punt and the Irish juggernaut proceeded to stage another march. After Sitko’s 30-yard dash had placed the ball on the 18, Brennan smashed off guard, slithered off four ' defenders and angled into the end zone.
After Earley’s kick sailed wide, Oracko put his back spin to work again and the ball popped into Leon Hart’s hands on the Tulane 37. Then Bill Gompers swept around left end, cut back, and scored standing up behind great downfield blocking. Earley made it 26-0 and the quarter hadn’t ended.
Czarobski stopped a budding Green Wave rally by recovering a fumble on the Notre Dame 40 and soon the fifth touchdown was in the making, as Brennan, Gompers and Panelli brought it to the enemy five. Lujack then shot a bullet pass to Brennan in the end zone. Earley' having his worst day of the season, missed again, making it 32-0.
Tulane made its one sustained drive at the start of the second quarter, marching 83 yards from the Irish 17. Price dashed for 20 and a lateral pass brought the ball to the Rambler’s 21. Van Meter and Price alternated to the Irish four and Price bulled over on fourth down.
Thrills started early in the third quarter when Bill Gompers, back in top-notch form for the first time this season, shot around end from his own 24 and continued 76 yards for a would-be score which was nullified by a clipping penalty. The march stalled, but only for a time as Jim Martin

and Bob Livingstone set the scene for Panelli’s one-yard thrust. Earley converted to raise the score to 39-6.
Tulane, who made only 19 yards in the second half, was soon forced to punt to Livingstone who picked up a host of blockers and returned the ball 51 yards to the enemy eight. Clatt smashed to the four and then Livingstone made the rest. Earley again made-.the point.
Fourth period proceedings were conducted principally by third and fourth stringers. Principal workhorse in the first drive was Corny Clatt who bulled his way for runs of 14, 12, and 8 yards before crashing over from the four.
The last few minutes were used to give valuable experience to quarterbacks Gerry Begley and Jake Skall and other newcomers but the score continued to mount. Jim Brennan carried on the family tradition with an eleven-yard dash into the same corner brother Terry had previously visited in the first quarter and Earley’s successful kick made it 5 out of 9 for Fred and 59 for Notre Dame.
However, there was bad news along with the good as Emil Sitko and Terry Brennan both joined the injured list. Emil, who was hurt in last year’s Tulane game too, suffered an injured ankle in the first quarter and Brennan was later carried off with a torn ligament in the knee..
The statistics were staggering: the Irish amassed 24 first downs to Tulane’s seven in addition to their 559 total yards.

Notre Dame 38
So. California 7
By JOHN A. O'CONNOR
LOS ANGELES, Jlec. 6—Notre Dame’s pent-up power burst into glorious flower beneath a dazzling California sun here in Los Angeles’ Memorial Coliseum today, as the star-studded Irish trampled the Trojans 38 to 7 before a phenomenal crowd of 104,953. It was the first time in 17 years, since the last great team of the immortal Rockne, that the Blue and Gold from the twin-laked campus near South Bend, had come through the season undefeated and untied. And for Coach Leahy it clinched once again the national championship, the second in a row, and the third since his advent at Notre Dame.	.
The Irish attack, vicious, hard-thumping, persistent and quick-firing, so astonished the baffled, but tenacious, Trojans that little was left to be said except that once more Notre Dame superiority had been established from coast to coast.
In the first half the contest was at its tightest, and the vanquished were at their best. On the first play from scrimmage Murphy, the Cardinal quarter, bobbled the ball and George Connor, N.D.’s mighty tackle, lunged in for the recovery. Nine plays later, after meeting stubborn, inspired defense from Cravath’s crew, Notre Dame went out to a 3-point lead, by virtue of little Fred Earley’s angular boot from- the 18-yard line.' '	''
They battled on, Southern California cheers roaring from an ocean-voiced, white-shirted cheering section. But the Irish wore them down. Lujack, Livingstone and Fanelli led the way, and Notre Dame marched 87 yards to tally again in the first minutes of the second period, Sitko belting over from one yard out. Earley’s kick was good; 10 to 0.
A few minutes later Jim Powers, Trojan quarter, stepped in to snag an N.D. pass on the Irish 44. The Beverly Hills

Bomber then proceeded to shoot the Ramblers’ pass defense full of holes, projecting the Big Red team deep into Notre Dame territory, from where Jack Kirby sprinted over for the lone Trojan score on a fourth down gamble. Walker’s kick made it 10-7, and that was the last of the fun for the home team. They cheered mightily, they fought hard, they uncorked some nifty performers in ponderous Jay Perrin, Dean Dill, Paul Cleary, and Powers, but they just didn’t have the stuff to withstand the bruising charge of the Irish forwards, or the lightning breakaways of the Leahy backs.
Only once more did the Trojans look threatening, and then Cleary dropped Powers’ long desperation heave out in the open.	. ■“
The second half saw Notre Dame explode in a rash of long runs and an ample ration of touchdowns. Scarcely had the Irish taken possession after the kickoff when Emil Sitko burst through to go all the way, his stumpy legs churning and kicking, 76 yards to touchdown town. Connor’s guillotine block on Gray sprung Emil into the open. Earley’s goal made it 17-7.
A few minutes later, after Lujack had intercepted a Cardinal pitch, Sitko and Panelli teamed to power the Irish to the 5-yard line, from which point the “Pepper” boomed ~ it across. Earley made it 24-7.
In the fourth stanza the Trojans moved all the way downfield to inside the Irish 10, but Bill Walsh batted down Dill’s fourth-down pass and the visitors took over.
With unexpected daring the Irish scored again. This time, after stopping the Trojan march, they struck on the first play upon taking over. Bobby Livingstone, the flashyeyed favorite, romped 92 yards to stand the mad thousands on their heads and shoot the Irish ahead even farther, this time 31-7, with Earley’s perfect placement.
In the dwindling moments of the game, with shadows leaning down from the gray walls of the concrete Coliseum, the fighting Trojans passed in prayerful desperation. Into one such throw loomed the bulky figure of Al Zmijewski, burly Polish tackle from Newark, N. J. Big Al snatched an S.C. lateral and ran 30 yards for the final marker. Earley’s try was right on the button. And the spree was over.
The game was highlighted by the inspired play of Connor and Lujack, Ashbaugh, Signaigo, Czarobski, Urban, Sitko, Earley and Bob Livingstone. It was the Irish all the way, a fitting end to a great season, another crown for Notre Dame, another coronet for Leahy, more wonderful memories for the men of Notre Dame.

OUTSIDE THE SPOTLIGHT
Each fall America’s football fans are entertained by the galaxy of gridiron greats who bask in the limelight made so brilliant by the incomparable color of bigtime college football. There are others, however, through whose efforts these stars gain their lustre, and there are the stars themselves, off the field and on the sidelines. For the closing act of its pigskin panorama, SCHOLASTIC takes its readers behind the scenes of Notre Dame football for a glimpse of the men who played, equipped, trained, publicized, understudied and made colorful the great Fighting Irish team of 1947.

•HUGH BURNS -
By BOB VIERHILE
Many a football fan, stoutly convinced that football is 90 per cent tomfoolery, gives out with a big belly laugh whenever he reads about an injury to a star player. “He wasn’t hurt,” the skeptic smirks. “The coach is only trying to make his team look bad so the bettors can smoke out some of that underdog dough before Saturday.”
... Miles of Tape and Oceans of Wintergreen
f	If the gents with the galloping tongues could look into
the Notre Dame training room after a bone-crushing scrim.	mage, their chins might quickly drop to half-mast. To Train-
er Hugh Burns, director of Notre Dame’s Department of /. Cuts and Bruises, the injury list is no social register. He > .	repairs black eyes, twisted cartilages, sprained ankles, and
i,	wrenched shoulders that were products of the football field,
■	not of a sports scribe’s typewriter. A football player on the
?	bench is worth a hundred in the infirmary; that’s what makes
.	Hugh Burns’ job the most important of any on the training
staff.
The man entrusted with keeping Notre Dame athletes in top physical condition is medium in stature but giant in skill and confidence. As Irish as the shillelagh, he is a graduate of Notre Dame (’39), a dynamic worker, a warm personality, and a sound Catholic husband and citizen. To the boys on the dressing tables and under the heat lamps, Hugh is “the guy who will lend you five bucks without asking you for a pint of blood as security.”
Some months ago, as he was about to close his office in the field house, a student tore through the door and asked him if he would patch up his bleeding nose. “Sure, but how did you get it?” Hugh asked. “I—I got it in a bridge game,” the student replied. Hugh threw in a smile when he said it, then went to the medicine shelf for a swab of cotton.
Burns, who is 31 and looks even younger, tempers his enthusiasm with consideration for the facts of physical conditioning. Says he: “I believe the first commandment of athletics is the prevention of injuries. A playei- who forgets about physical and mental conditioning and relies entirely on his hip and shoulder pads for protection is a detriment to sport and his fellow players.”
For three years, he has carried on a hammer-and-tongs campaign against injuries. He took charge of the training tables, introduced a special balanced diet. He designed his own calisthentics aimed at tight joints and muscles. This year he wrapped 316,000 yards of tape around weak ankles, knees, and wrists to prevent sprains and breaks. His office is equipped with the latest in whirlpool baths, electric massagers, and ultra-violet lamps. Commented a husky fullback: “Hugh’s got more stuff around here than you’ll find in Bellevue Hospital in New York. What amazes me is that he knows how to use it, too.”
Hugh was born in Michigan City, Ind., which is almost as much a part of Notre Dame as Farley Hall. Inasmuch as his uncle, the Reverend James A. Burns, C.S.C., was president of the University of Notre Dame from 1919 to 1922, Hugh had a one-way ticket to the Dome. He entered in September 1935, graduated in 1939 with a degree in physical education. His athletic career was limited to the shagging of fly balls

Senior Manager Larry Ryan and his able aide Bill Brown form the braintrust of the quartermaster corps in charge of equipment, travel, etc.
Magazines and radio swamp the reading and listening public with the details of titanic struggles that take place each fall Saturday afternoon over the nation. The headlines scream results from Yankee Stadium and the Coliseum in Los Angeles.. Yet, a little more than a 20 or 30-word blurb serves to describe the Armageddon staged daily, Monday through Thursday, on the practice fields.
The Fighting Irish’s greatness has been credited to about everything from the excellence of the coaching staff to the Notre Dame spirit, but it is these daily practice sessions on Cartier Field that supply the real answer. Every year scores of Irish stars are graduated and every year- from the laboratory on Cartier, Dr. Leahy produces more monsters to haunt the Friday night dreams of the nation’s coaches.
Inside the high green fence that circles Cartier Field, the football day starts for Coach Leahy’s charges at 3:30 P. M. Most of the players have finished their afternoon classes by that time. When the whole squad hits the field at about 3:30, the calisthenics start. The backs and linemen divide into two groups to go to work under Coaches

Football Games Are Won on Weekdays . . .

Crimmins and Ziemba. Meanwhile, the quarterbacks are ofF to the side with Coach Leahy practicing their fakes and spins, the essential part of a successful T-formation.
After the calisthenics the guards, tackles and ends move over to one corner of the field with Coaches McArdle, Krause, Druze and Ziemba. There, the bonecrushers practice their blocks and tackles on inanimate objects such as tackling dummies and two and four-man blocking trays. At times the men go to work on each other. On one of the three gridirons the backs practice running and pass catching.
When these rituals have been completed the whole squad is called together for a scrimmage. Before the season and for the first few weeks of the schedule, these scrimmages are run according to game regulations so the players can gain their competitive edge. At other times the scrimmages are more specialized. Punt and pass scrimmages give the squad members a chance to polish the rough edges of their defense against passes and punts. Before games the third and fourth teams are given the opposition’s plays to run against the first and second teams. This gives all involved a chance to see what they are getting into on Saturday.
All during the practice sessions Coach Leahy and his assistants keep a watchful eye on the proceedings. They do not let one mistake go uncorrected. At times Leahy climbs to his 15-foot green tower so that he can follow the whole practice with a minimum of motion.
It is little wonder that hulking 200-odd-pound tackles overtake and pull down fleet opposing backs. All week they are either chasing speedsters such as Jimmy Brennan or Frank Spaniel, or Coach Leahy has them taking laps around the practice field or charging 50 to 100 yards in wind sprints. Barging into such granite-like obstacles as guards Jim Dailer and Jack Connor makes Saturday’s work like child’s play.
When Paul Brown, present head coach of the Cleveland Browns, tutored “Zeke” O’Connor at Great Lakes in 1945, he announced publicly that Zeke was one of the finest ends he had ever coached. The blocking backs don’t find their tasks so difficult on Saturdays after they.have spent a couple of hours each day trying to move Zeke out of the play.
The spirit that keeps these men coming out night after night to absorb most of the punishment and little of the glory can best be seen in the story about gigantic Emil Ciechanowicz, the largest man on the squad. Coach Ed (Moose) Krause, who is only slightly larger than Emil, patted his charge on the head and told him to get in there and “eat ’em up” on the next four plays. Emil nodded his assent and queried, “OK, coach, but what’ll I do on the four after that?” Emil’s last name was a stumper for the coaches and his teammates when he first joined the squad. Finally, after much mispronunciation and deliberation, the a whole group with Emil’s approval decided to call him " Chicken-sandwich.	<
... Daily Practice Sessions Provide the Fighting Irish With the Toughest Football They Encounter All Season
When the backs bounce to their feet after a hard tackle in Saturday’s games, the crowd gives them a big hand for their display of intestinal fortitude. But, to those men it is nothing new, they have been taking knocks harder than that from their own teammates, men like centers Art Statuto, Walt Grothaus or Don Carter.
Nobody knows better than the varsity players that at the first sign of a letdown, Tom Saggau, Cliff Wilke, Jerry Begley or Dick Leous will move up to take over the varsity spots. The men on the second and third teams can’t afford to coast for a minute because substitutes like Bill Gay and John Sinkovitz are gunning for their spots.
Someone has tagged those men you don’t see on Saturdays as “hamburgers.” At any other school in the country men like Ray Espenan, Joe Fallon, Bill Leonard, Al Burnett, Ed Hudak, Joe Fallon, Frank Gaul and Bill Russell would be received with open arms, not as hamburgers, but as blue plate specials. The price of hamburger would shoot skyward if Russ Skall, John Jeffers and Len LeCluyse were suddenly put on the market.
Al Zmijewski, a forgotten man as far as Notre Dame tackles went, made only one appearance away from the Notre Dame Stadium this season. In that one appearance he made sure that the people of Southern California will remember his name. In the closing seconds of the USC game he intercepted a lateral pass and returned it for a touchdown.
Besides the hard work of the whole team, some of the individuals have their own struggles which keep them up on top of the greatest collegiate football team of the year. Ziggy Czarobski, an All-American in any man’s book, played first string tackle on the 1942 and 1943 teams before he went into service. In those two years Zig played his tackle position as well as any man he faced. Last season he won back his starting berth, but the back-of-the-hand talkers said he ' talked his way out of more situations than he blocked. Early in the summer he was given an ultimatum to return to school in shape or else. Zig was determined to hold his starting berth, so he went to work with a construction gang in Wisconsin. He often got up at five A. M. to do road work. Back at school in the fall, he frequently sandwiched in a private practice session. The results of his work and determination made him the Notre Dame players’, the opposing players’ and the coaches’ All-American.
You have no doubt basked in the warm Octobei- sun in stadia like Illinois Memorial, Purdue’s Ross-Ade or Northwestern’s Dyche and admired the gold-helmeted, green-shirted horde pounding down the ramp onto the veld. All clean, shiny and sleek they look. Here is what you didn’t see. Just before the Pitt game, Dr. Leahy prescribed three hours of gruelling calisthenics, scrimmage and miscellaneous head banging. A sudden downpour sent all spectators for cover. Leahy stayed and so did his lads, for five laps around the field. “Can’t tell when we might have to play in the rain,” he jibed.
The locker room is the forum room for the players. Here they talk over all subjects, but mostly their conversation centers around football. Most of the men arrive early to give themselves plenty of time to don their pads. Coach Leahy
Drive! Drive! Drive echoes across the practice gridiron as Coach Druze puts Ends Begley and Waybright through blocking maneuvers.
makes them do laps around the field if they are late for practice. At one end of the locker room Manager Leo Costello lords over an equipment room. If one of the player’s T-shirts is ripped or his socks have holes in them, he has to argue with Leo for replacements. Leo wins most of the disputes. Across the hall from Leo, Hugh Burns, the team trainer, holds forth in his fully equipped training room. When Hugh is not rubbing stiff muscles or taping swollen ankles, he is matching jokes with Ziggy Czarobski. Occasionally Zig will sing a few verses of some Irish ballad for the boys. The consensus of opinion is that Zig is at his best when he is standing under a hot shower.
It is all this and more that takes place daily behind Cartier’s green walls and in the locker room. These are the men behind the men: like Russ Skall, who likes it better the rougher it gets. Russ bicycles to practice, but there is no one to find him back pedalling in scrimmages. These are the men who make Notre Dame football — the little known guys who work just as hard, just as long as the AllAmericans.
They also serve who only stand and wait A group of reserves (CarroU. Jeffers. J. Sullivan. Ciechanowicz. Wilke. Kenefick) huddle on the sidelines awaiting the call to action.

Inter hall Football
". . . Born to Blush Unseen
By JOE ARCHIBALD
An essential part of Notre Dame athletics is the inter-hall sports program. The program which runs the full school year gives the average non-varsity student the opportunity to back up his bull session claims with actions. The first sport offered is football, which is under the direction of Mr. Dominic Napolitano of the Physical Education Department.
Every residence hall on the campus has the privilege of entering a team in the competition. This year 12 teams including a squad representing the off-campus students were entered. Before he was issued a uniform each potential competitor had to get a medical certificate affirming his top physical condition from the University physician. To facilitate scheduling the 12 teams were divided into Eastern and Western divisions depending on the location of the hall. The Western division was made up of Lyons, Dillon, Alumni, Walsh, Badin and Morrissey Halls; while the Eastern listed St. Ed’s, Farley, Cavanaugh, Zahm, Breen-Phillips and Off-Campus. The schedule was a round robin affair with each member team getting one crack at the other five teams in the division. Games were scheduled according to the afternoon free time from classes of the competing members.
On October 21, after several weeks of practice in which muscles were toughened and made jolt-proof and coaches were appointed by Mr. Napolitano or elected by team members, the official season got its start.
All of the games during the season except one were decided by one or two touchdowns. Five of the games ended in ties. The exception to the low scoring contests took place when Cavanaugh, the eventual champ, rocked Breen-Phillips, 34-0.
Cavanaugh romped through the Eastern division with five victories and no defeats and did not once have their goal crossed. Zahm gave them their only scare in a game which the men of Cavanaugh came out on top, 7-0. Pete Varda and Bernie Powers served as co-coaches of the team. In the Western division Lyons pulled though for the second year in a row as division champs with four wins and one tie. The tie came at the hands of Morrissey, the cellar dwellers. Morrissey held Coach Ray Chamberland’s
lads scoreless. It was the first time in nine games that Lyons had suffered such a blow.
The championship play-off game was held in the Stadium on November 23 before an estimated 1000 people. Neither team was able to score in the first half. The second half also looked to be scoreless until late in the third period. Cavanaugh took possion of the ball on their own 35-yard line and marched 65 yards through Lyons’ forward wall to a score. Jim Presley covered the last three yards after the Lyons defense had held the Cavanaugh attack for three downs on the three. Presley then stepped into tailback and booted what proved to be the winning point. Lyons roared back to a score with Bob Cianchetti getting the last five for the score. Paul Lane’s attempted forward pass for the conversion was knocked down by Bernie Powers of Cavanaugh. That was the ball game. Cavanaugh held off a last minute drive by Lyons and came up with the championship, 7-6.
On the spectacular and aggressive side of football interhall did not have to take a back seat to its bigger brother, varsity football. The games produced such things as: a 60-yard return of an intercepted pass by Farley’s Tom Moorman . . . Pat Shannon’s 55-yard pass to Walsh teammate Don Jost . . . Lyons’ highly potent forward pass battery, Paul Lane, pitcher, and Tom Muscatello, catcher . . . the punting of Walt Mahannah of Lyons . . . the coordination of Cavanaugh’s backfield, Presley, Powers, Higgins and Bruno.

HESE ARE FOOTBALL’S
GUINEA PIGS
By TOM ADAMS
It may well be said that the unsung heroes of this year’s varsity gridiron campaign are the members of the 1947 freshman football squad. Each week these green-jerseyed frosh have had the suicidal task of preparing the varsity for Saturday’s game. Each afternoon, during the super-secret scrimmages on IP Cartier Field, the freshman squad has . run off the plays of next week’s opponents in order to sharpen the varsity defense. Although they have won no fame for their efforts this fall, the time will come when their names will be written into the annals of Notre Dame football.
When the freshman ineligibility rule went into effect this fall, after a lapse of five years, forty candidates for the reincarnated freshman football squad reported to Coach Bill Vangan and his as-sitants, Bill Heywood, Jack Fallon, Joe Yonto, and Marty Brutz. Coach Vangan has been well pleased with the progress of the team, and declares that several members of the squad will be serious contenders for varsity berths next fall.
Head Coach Leahy has been high in his praise for the freshman line, which has performed commendably against the varsity front wall in scrimmages, and has stated that there are several frosh linemen that would be playing varsity football this fall, if it were not for the ineligibility rule.
■ At center, Jerry Groomes and Phil Yanoschick have looked outstanding. Both have played well on offense, while Groomes has received praise for his able defensive play.
Bill Higgins and Dick Kuh have been standouts at the guard positions. Louis Polman and Chuck Feigle also deserve mention for their rugged line play. Frank Palmisento, a cousin of AllAmerican John Mastrangelo, captain of the ’46 Irish National Championship team, also looked promising before he was sidelined with injuries.
The varsity tackle posts, which will be vacated after graduation of All-Americans George Connor and Ziggy Czarob-ski, George Sullivan, and Gasper Urban, will have some able candidates next fall in Dean Thomas, Tom Holmes, Vince Ste. Marie, Jim Mahoney, Phil Schwartz, and Tom Huber. Coach Vangan describes all as being very promising.
At ends, the competition has been keen with Jack Murphy, Ray Jonardi, Phil Cantwell, Ray Yanics, Bill Yanics, Ben Klepek, Martin Hayes, and Bob Crump all receiving praise for their determination and fine play. Although the ends, for the most part, lack size, they have displayed a lot of spirit in practice sessions. *
Bob Williams, 18-year-old quarterback
from Baltimore, Md., has been outstanding in that position. Williams is described by Coach Vangan as being “not only an exceptionally good passer, but also a good punter.” Don O’Leary, of Seattle, Wash., has also shown remarkably well in practice sessions, and has proven himself a good passer also. Others who have received- praise from Coach Vangan for their work at the quarterback post are Tom Carter and Bill Whiteside, the latter also working at the halfback position.
Leonard Kroll, of Boys Town, Nebraska, and Jack Landry, of Rochester, N. Y., have been the outstanding candidates for the halfback posts. Leo McKillip and Lyle Pearson have also shown well in scrimmage.
Dick Cotter, erstwhile Bengals boxer, has manned the fullback position, followed by John O’Neil, Steve Hen-, and Ray Miller. Cotter has shown a lot of drive in scrimmage sessions, and has made great strides forward.
The frosh squad also boasts of an extra-point specialist in Jack Voit who has displayed remarkable accuracy from any angle in the drop-kick.
Other members of the freshman squad who deserve mention for their fine play are Gene Smith, Tom Logan, Ed Conley, Bill Hanousek, Ed Smith, Bill Hickey, Jim Sheerin, Earl Ruen, and Bill Ker-chner.
BOTTOM ROW (left to right): Smith, Pearson, Logan, Polman, Smith, Voit, Higgins, Klepek, Hayes, Krall.

N. D. FOOTBALL SPELLS

For the first time in years, perhaps within living memory, the Notre Dame Band appeared this fall in uniforms
'Admiral Imposter' addresses Navy rally
which did not look like something collected in a clothing drive. Complete even to spats (yellow) the new uniforms were to the old as the full moon to a skillet. The change in uniforms brought out enthusiastic new band candidates, no longer wary of being taken for ushers in all-night theaters on skid row. .
Another inducement which helped swell the band to a total strength of over a hundred was the fact that band members with five semesters’ service may now wear letter sweaters with letters patterned after the new band emblems.
Under the direction of Mr. H. Lee Hope, and with expert Jim Kress of Detroit, as drum major, the band appeared at all home games with a sparkling new routine and travelled to one game away — Navy at Cleveland. Students regretted that the band could not be transported the relatively short distances to

Band spells out NAVY to salute Middies at Cleveland
Lafayette for the Purdue game and Evanston for the Northwestern game, but the band had to be content with making the student trip to Cleveland. On this trip the new members were initiated according to the traditional mummery of the band, whereby the new men were submitted to all manner of indignities and were forced to memorize heroic odes which were composed of language never heard anywhere this side of nowhere. At the ungodly hour- of three A. M., the band members were jolted out of the half-sleep that is the lot of the 1 railway traveler and summarily herded . into the baggage car, where a group of elite guards who had been around a semester or so longer gave the “schmoes” the same treatment they themselves had received not long before.
The band was foiled in its planned welcome of the Army Cadets when the Cadets were delayed by a train wreck and arrived just in time to take their seats in the stadium before game time. The band led them into the stadium playing the Army song.
During the half time of the Iowa game, the band put on a new version of the old nursery rhyme, “Four and Twenty Blackbirds.” It was necessary, however, to substitute pigeons, alas, which proved to be recalcitrant in coming out of the huge “pie.” Even after the second half of the game had started, the pigeons tumbled out of the pie and got a H birds-eye look at Notre Dame demolishing the lowans.
Aiding in the merciless massacre of Tulane, the band put on an old-fashioned southern minstrel show during the half-time. With a competing wind, which mixed up band members and streamers, the band also had to compete for interest with a fight which was going on hot and heavy in the south end zone. Nevertheless, they received very favorable comment on the exhibition.
Notre Dame’s cheerleaders, abandoning some of the old cheers, introduced a . new jazzed-up trumpet yell during the	\

of their efforts at the Army game, when they • actually succeeded in provoking cheers from the student body, which has > developed a penchant to cheer* when it 1 pleases. Nevertheless, the cheer leaders stirred up great interest among the St. Mary’s contingent, which was sometimes suspected of making more and better noise than Notre Dame.	R

It was only just that one of the tackles score at least once during the year, but it had to :onds remained in the season before the unsung could cash in on the touchdown glory.
Prior to and following Brennan’s initial score the Irish had a most peculiar footing in the national champio n s h i p picture. Before the season opened, some experts considered them
the greatest collegiate football team ever to take the field. They were supposed to have everything — passers, runners and line. However when N.D. opened against Pittsburgh, the Irish did not look too impressive even though they scored six times. Purdue, their second opponent, lowered Notre Dame’s stock by battling the Irish on even terms for four- quar-Q ters. Notre Dame had to resort to passes to win the game. For this reason questions began to rise about Notre Dame’s running attack.
The Irish gave a partial answer to the questions in their next two games. They scored seven times in the two contests with Nebraska and Iowa. All scores came on the ground. But to beat Navy, the fifth opponent, they had to go back to the pass as a means to score. Again the doubts blossomed. These were quickly dispelled by Terry Brennan when he ran 96 yards with the opening kickoff against Army. The team followed up that quick blow to Army’s pride by making 20 of 22 first downs on the ground and scoring four times along this route.
Northwestern stayed true to form by scaring the cleats off the undefeated Irish. Three times in the past 25 years the Wildcats have done the same thing to undefeated Notre Dame teams. Notre Dame rolled up impressive yardage on
the ground but had to pass for three scores when Northwestern’s line tightened.
For the last two games of the season it was all uphill for the Irish. Tulane made mistakes in the first quarter and Notre Dame took advantage of every one of them to run up 32 points. They kept going from the 32 count to score 59 points, in the allotted 60 minutes. Southern California, the last hurdle in the national championship path, fought for one half but fell fast when the Irish opened up both barrels. Bob Livingstone romped 92 yards through the Men of Troy for the longest run of the day. He was not alone in the lengthy jaunts. Emil Sitko hit paydirt after a 76-yard trip.
From Brennan to Zmijewski the season was full of breaks, both good and bad. The Dash were quick to capitalize on the good breaks and make the most of their own bad breaks. They had to open their season with Captain George Connor on the bench with a bad ankle. He was slow hitting his peak form because of the injury. John Panelli, first string fullback, wrenched his arm in the Nebraska game and was out for three weeks. Emil Sitko was kept out of several games because of an injured leg. Coy McGee spent most of the season on the sidelines with bad ankles. Terry Brennan had to sit out the Southern California game with a badly wrenched knee. Mike Swistowicz missed the Navy game because of a groin injury suffered in the Iowa match. Even with these apparent holes in their offense, the Irish scored an average 32 points per game. Not once in the season were they held to less than three touchdowns.

When the Irish take the field next fall

Notre Dame followers will swallow hard and look with dampened eye on a squad depleted by the loss of a large number of very good men, familiar faces all.
Pete Ashbaugh, tricky stepper, defensive ace, cool and confident. During pregame warm-ups he’d pitch sixty-yard passes and the crowds hollered for more.
Corny Clatt, bruising fullback, buffaloshouldered, hard smacking, remembered for those huge rips through the Seahawk line and the Great Lakes forward wall.
George Connor, All-American, the Big Moose, Captain of his team, and first to trot out of the tunnel to receive the ovation of the thousands.
Ziggy Czarobski, the portly jester, a Falstaffian character, well-liked, a born
Fred Earley, the little place-kicker, number one on his jersey; we’ll miss his modest jog.
Bill Gompers, the contact-lensed scat • back; break-away artist, possesses the vanishing hip. *
Bob Livingstone, “The Liver,” popular hero, flashy, ahead of Creighton Miller in ’42, foot-trouble after the war, deft at the cross-over, dangerous, fast.
Johnny Lujack, All-American, “The Luj,” one of the greatest of all times, a fine gentleman and Notre Dame man.
Joe Signaigo, the Southern gentleman, and black-eyed terror in the middle of the Notre Dame line.
Floyd Simmons, speed on the straightaway, hard hitting, the Oregon trailblazer.	i
Art Statuto, burly center, hard charg- f er, bullish tackler.	|
George Sullivan,	mightly	tackle,	sen-	J

t So. California Rout Inspires Writers To Superlatives
Jim Costin, South Bend Tribune: Sparked by the sensational running of Emil Sitko and Bob Livingstone, the . Notre Dame football team today climaxed its first unbeaten and untied season in 17 years by rolling over the Southern California eleven, Pacific Coast Conference champion and Rose Bowl entrant, by the thumping score of 38-7 before the season’s largest crowd anywhere—104,953—and clinched the 1947 national championship so convincingly that even the Los Angeles authors are convinced.
Arch Ward, Chicago Tribune: Lua jack’s performance was brilliant and, above all, workmanlike. He made no mistakes. His passing was accurate, but his team today didn’t rely on Lu-j ack’s marksmanship. It ground the Trojans into the soggy turf by one of the most devastating running attacks this historic field has seen.
Neiv Yortv Times: Notre Dame, unbeaten, untied and virtually unchallenged—has been selected as the outstanding college football team of 1947, winning the honor for the second straight year in the final poll conducted by the Associated Press.
Grantland Rice: There no longer is any doubt as to the best team in college football. It happens to be Notre Dame. College football never before has known a team so big, so fast and so experienced. Especially big and experienced. Martin and Hart, two giant ends, gave the line from flank to flank an average weight ” of some 215 pounds, easily a match for the best pro line in football today.
Bill Cunningham, Boston Herald: It is the greatest Notre Dame squad of all time. Its third string could whip most varsities. There are enough able-looking backs to staff an entire Ivy League. Lu-jack and Frank Tripucka, his understudy, are terrific. No other team in the nation can boast two such quarterbacks. This team has never yet been keyed for an all-out performance.
Stanley Woodward, New York Herald Tribune: There is a suspicion in this department’s mind that the Notre Dame football team is the best it ever has seen. It is a big team which is fast and combative and it employs a varied T-formation repertory that puts a terrible burden on the opposition. Notre Dame has a dozen backs who could run for t any team.

in Cartier Field and to the circling of St. Mary’s lake as a member of the track team.
When “Scrapiron” Young decided to pick up his paraphernalia and go to work for the Chicago Rockets in 1943, the University didn’t wait long to pluck Burns off the pond. He was coaching the backfield at Xavier University, Cincinnati, Ohio, when he received a wire saying the job of head trainer at Notre Dame was open. Hugh boarded the first train to South Bend. He never used the complete, round-trip ticket.
Burns is fond of talking to the athletes as he gives them their alcohol rub-downs. It is nothing new for a lineman to pour out the troubles he is having with Susan back in Jersey City. Hugh enjoys administering his painless psychology. By his training room chats with the boys, he is able to make the men forget their problems when they get out on the gridiron. He takes their minds off old injuries and rebuilds their confidence. “He’s a regular Doc Anthony with a Dorothy Dix line,” commented an ailing tackle. “Hugh ought to be answering some of those letters to the lovelorn in the papers. And I thought I knew women.”
The training department cares for the athletes in all of the major sports at Notre Dame. Football, however, leads all other sports in injuries by a ratio of 10-to-l. Some of the mishaps don’t occur on the playing fields. Before the season opened, Halfback Emil Sitko got his foot caught in his bed while sleeping. In the middle of the night, he rolled out of his bunk: and twisted his knee into a knot that would make a Boy Scout envious. Sitko had to bring his roommate around to verify the story before his teammates would believe him.
Hugh’s family, wife Mary Eileen, sons Michael Patrick and Daniel Shamus, and little 7-month-old Susan Eileen, don’t see much of the breadwinner during the football season. “When he does get home,” says his wife, “he usually makes his family spend the evening perfecting a new type of calisthentics that he has dreamed up.”
Save for the “boys” who know Hugh and his work, few people appreciate the importance of his job. But yet, that last statement isn’t exactly correct. Athletes who have learned the means of proper conditioning carry that knowledge to their sons and daughters, to the teams they will coach, to the men they will lead. Hugh’s efforts don’t evaporate like the alcohol on a lineman’s shoulder. They go more than skin-deep. The courage and stamina of the athletic field become the health and physical happiness of life.

After successfully finishing the course, you are commissioned a Second Lieutenant, Air Force Reserve, and assigned to active duty with the Air Force at $336 a month (including flight pay), with excellent chances for further increases as promotions come through.
In addition, you get an extra $500 for each year of active duty, and will he given a chance to compete for a commission in the Regular Air Force if you are interested in a service career.
This, opportunity, which cannot be duplicated anywhere else at any price, equips men for well-paid, responsible positions throughout the aviation industry, at high pay from the beginning. It
is open to you if you’re single, between 20 and 26^ years old, and have completed at least one-half the requirements for a degree from an accredited college or university (or pass an examination measuring the equivalent). Ask for details at your U. S. Army and U. S. Air Force Recruiting Station, or write to Headquarters, U. S. Air Force, Attention: Aviation Cadet Section, Washington 25, D. C.

Lujack Fans Give Sorin Mailman Round Shoulders Delivering 'Dear John' Letters
By LOU ALMASI and TOM HIGGINS
Have you ever received a “Dear John” letter? Take it easy chum, remember your blood pressure and stop feeling sorry for yourself. There’s a man right here in Sorin Hall who gets those missies at the rate of 50 a day and it doesn’t faze him a bit.
Stagger along with us any bright sunshiny morning shortly before eight to 115 Sorin and await the arrival of the mailman with the morning round of letters. Here he comes . . . “One for you . . . two here, doc. . . . nope, not today . . . three sackfuls here ...” and down at the door he dumps them. The husky occupants of the room open the door and drag the letters inside, to be opened by the person to whom they are addressed, Mr. Johnny Lujack.
Some of this mail is addressed merely Johnny Lujack, Notre Dame. That’s all. It’s up to a kind-hearted postal employee to see that this mail reaches its final destination.
To the kids of America who write most of fhese letters, “The Luj” is the hottest thing since Superman, and they’re not far from wrong. To the girls of America who write their share of this fan mail, he’s the country’s most eligible bachelor . . . next to Li’l Abner, of course.
Each of these letters is read by John
and almost all of them are answered personally by him. Many of them come in the form of requests . . . autographed pictures, four tickets to the Army game (on the fifty-yard line, if possible), game jerseys, shoes, warm-up jackets ... or some old letter sweater you don’t want.
Insofar as is possible, these requests are fulfilled. That is, of course, provided that the post office, or the Railway Express, can handle a steady outgoing of old pads, shoes, helmets, and blankets. Sometimes these servants of the public rebel, however, and Irish fans must be content with mere autographed pictures of the Notre Dame passing wizard.
Many of the letter-writers are not satisfied with pictures or other personal items belonging to Lujack. Some of them want personal contact with their hero before they will be completely happy. Two girls from Dayton wrote inviting John and Irish Captain, George “Moose” Connor to a sorority dance, Nov. 21. The letter ends, “Here’s hoping that you have no serious romantic entanglements. You both have kind faces and we know that you wouldn’t refuse to help two poor girls in distress. So how about escorting these two lovely damsels to the dance? We’ll root for you (at the football games, that is) forever, if you

NOTRE DAME. 26; NORTHWESTERN. 19
Jim Costin, South Bend Tribune:
“A battling bunch of Wildcats wearing the purple of Northwestern university put up a game show here this afternoon before the hardiest of 48,000 ticket holders who ventured into rain-drenched Dyche stadium, but the gallantry of the home team was not enough.”
Wilfred Smith, Chicago Tribune:
"One touchdown is the maximum undefeated Notre Dame has granted anjl^ football team for two years. Three Irish opponents this season have failed to score. Yesterday afternoon, Northwestern’s Wildcats, ensconced in last place in the Big Nine, crossed Notre Dame’s goal line three times and, while they were beaten, 26 to 19, their sturdy battle against the national champions again proved that this particular rivalry always produces the unusual in football.”

“Rockne still lives on the Notre Dame • campus, while Perry Haughton is as	’

For many years you have been hearing of Harvard < I indifference, for it is a college which attracts, in the main, blase young men who try to be sophisticates.

Yes, they know Rockne and what he stands for out there, as they S know their chemistry and their Latin poets, and it is a crying shame that Har- ® ( vard has forgotten Haughton, who, in B I my day, meant so much to that genera^^d tion of students as did president A?^^^ Lawrence Lowell — or maybe more.” O

Charlie Callahan, the man in charge of the Irish press box, was flooded with requests beginning last January when the initial announce m ent was made that Notre Dame would play host to the Cadets for
their final tussle.
Word of Notre Dame’s thrilling 27-7 triumph was broadcast over three national networks besides eight other stations which did their own play-by-play broadcasts. In addition, two television companies telecast the game. Newspapermen representing 102 of the country’s largest papers were present in addition to representatives of six press associations.

EX-PUBLICITOR PETBITZ An outstanding job
“Eed” Smith of the New York Herald Tribune; Ken Smith of the New York Mirror; and Francis Wallace, noted novelist.
Coach Leahy held press conferences each day at 2 p.m. in the Rockne Memorial lounge. Many of the little-known facts about Army and Notre Dame, about Leahy and Blaik, and about the chances of the Irish in the coming game were hashed out here.
All of the sports writing fraternity were admitted to the very secret practice sessions, and they saw much of Notre Dame’s unrevealed offense which the Cadets were to see on Saturday. However, they also saw much which the Irish did not choose to unleash against the Army, saving it for another time.
As the week wore on and as game time neared, Charlie Callahan’s office or his temporary press headquarters in the Oliver Hotel took on the appearance of a Who’s Who in the athletic world. Grantland Rice; John Winkin of Sport magazine; Tim Cohane of Look; Dave Camerer of Pic; Walter “Red” Barber of CBS; Stanley Woodward of the New York Herald Tribune; H. G. Salsinger of the Detroit News; Arthur Daley of the New York Times; Larry Robinson of the New York World Telegram and others were in and out all day.
In the middle of the week Chicago’s leading journalists began descending upon the campus. Arch Ward, Warren Brown, Tom Siler, John Carmichael, Jerry Liska, Ed Sainsbury, Charlie Einstein, Bill Fay, and Jim Enright began filing daily stories.
The job of personally taking care of this group from their information needs to their entertainment needs fell to Charlie Callahan. Arranging hotel rooms, trying to handle ticket requests,
explaining to disappointed seekers of press box space why they couldn’t get in, and handling the myriad of publicity details connected with the biggest football game in history made the “Thin Man” even thinner.
Callahan did a tremendous job of satisfying the needs and whims of the working press and handling the other details of his job during this week. In

Modest J. McAllister Runs Equipment Room With Vise - Like Grip
By JOHN KRUEGER
John W. McAllister, superintendent of equipment, is one of the men behind the Notre Dame scene (as the football programs put it). Behind the scene can be taken in its truest literal sense as regards McAllister. M is for modesty, his greatest virtue. If Mac had his way the aforementioned spread in the football programs would be left out.
Tommy Devine of the Detroit Free Press used the right technique to get McAllister to talk about himself. Devine had an assignment from Sportfolio magazine to write up the men behind the football scene at Notre Dame. Tommy always stopped in the Field House to visit Mac on his excursions to Notre Dame. With nothing said about an interview he had his customary gab session with our Superintendent of Equipment. There was no one more surprised than McAllistei- when the magazine hit the stands with Devine’s article including the writeup on Mac, “the man who doesn’t like to talk about himself.”
McAllister, despite his 62 years, is what you’d classify as the strong, silent type. The silver-haired, square-jawed Irishman tends diligently to his job of supervising the care of all the athletic equipment at Notre Dame. Mac began his career at Notre Dame in 1926 during the regime of Knute Rockne. He has served under all of Rockne’s successors: Anderson, Layden, Devore, McKeever, and Leahy. McAllister recalls how Rockne introduced silk pants and jer-sies for show and speed. The next first for Notre Dame in equipment came in the early 40’s with the innovation of nylon as material for pants and jersies.
The football team averages about one new set of uniforms a year. This past season the Irish took the field against Southern California in new outfits. The discarded uniforms are put aside for use in freshmen and old-timers’ games. Besides the regular game equipment, light rubber pants and mud cleats are carried on every trip. As regards practice wear, Notre Dame could outfit 10 or 12 teams. The total value of all the football equipment is approximated at around $60,000.
Now the team travels with 20 standard size trunks, but Mac remembers Rockne’s passion for trunks of hulking proportions—big men, big trunks. Needless to say Railway Express men didn’t

look forward to handling the Notre Dame baggage. The closest any of the trunks has come to being lost is when it was placed on the wrong train, and that was only after the game was over.
The equipment rooms have expanded since 1926. The “A” squad now has its quarters in the stadium. Mac divides his time between there and the Field House, aided by six student assistants. McAllister is the answer man for queries of all sorts, ranging from “what’s the combination of lock 167” to “can the managers use the basketball floor for their big game next week?”
In his kind of work a man like Mac couldn’t h:lp but have a storehouse of thrilling, ironic, humorous memories. But there are some things on which he is non-committal.
“Every year a great team,” is the way he feels about the best Irish squad he’s seen and “players are all the same to us” in reference to the greatest individual performer.

Head Coach Rank Leahy
(Continued from Page 13) ing for runbacks of punts or kickoffs. “Knock your man down, and when he gets up, knock him down again, and if he gets up again, knock him down again, and if the ball-carrier is still fighting his way down the field, KNOCK YOUK MAN DOWN AGAIN!” So it goes.
In picking his linemen Leahy likes fighters. “Gents, if you can physically whip the man across from you on every play, we can score touchdowns. It’s a test of strength between you and the man opposite you. And if you can whip him, and that happens all the way down the line, seven men physically whipping the men across from them, we can win ball games.”
Have a look at the time two light scrappers put in this past fall. Johnny Frampton and Bob Lally, both “B” material last spring, blocked and tackled and fought their way to high varsity positions this fall. That’s what Leahy means when he says “determination to succeed and a will to win.” That’s the “old thumperoo.” That’s the fight he expects from every man who trots out there on Cartier field to play for Notre Dame.
And Coach Leahy knows his boys have that spirit. That’s why, when inquiring persons foolishly suggest the possibility of Michigan beating the Irish, Frank Leahy springs to the defense. He knows that Notre Dame drops no one from its schedule because of fear, rears back at no challenge, respects no ballyhoo. His lads will take on “anybody, anywhere, any Saturday, any fall.”

K UNIT OF THE BELL SYSTEM SINCE 1882
I’d like to look back over the season and pick out a few laughs that I enjoyed as the week-ends quickly skipped by. Our first game of the year in smoky but friendly Pittsburgh found the Irish playing in 85-degree temperature. That was the week-end that Ziggy met movie actress Lizabeth Scott and movie producer Cecile B. DeMille and introduced them to the rest of the team as “Liz” and “Cec.” After the Pitt game, the team took over the “Gay Nineties” room of the Henry Hotel and put on one of the best shows that Smokeburgh had seen since Olsen and Johnson brought their “Hellspoppin” there in 1944.
Traveling to Lafayette the following week, Notre Dame found the Boilermakers tough. Coach Leahy was so disgusted after the game that he wouldn’t allow any photographers in the dressing room to take pictures. His gymnastics along the side-lines during that game brought many laughs to the fans at the game as well as those listening to their-radios. Some announcers drifted away from their play-by-play of the game to give a vivid description of his antics.
The following two Saturdays Notre Dame played host to Nebraska and Iowa in that order. Coach Leahy’s psychology did an about-face and the team seemed to settle down to play the kind of football that it was capable of playing.
Leaving South Bend a week later for Cleveland and the Navy game, the Irish boarded the 3:40 along with a car-load 8B of St. Mary’s seniors who made this their Senior Trip. Bridge games, maga-

zines, and Czarobski (telling about his Ptan cap that gave him the New Look) shortened the trip.
Two motorcycle cops met the team outside the station and escorted the players (all of whom walked) six blocks to the Carter Hotel. Seemed kind of silly watching those badge boys balancing their bikes along the curb going about 3 miles an hour.
The Navy game was so rough that Moose Fisher suggested that each of the Notre Dame players should pick out a Navy man and let him have it on the next play. Captain George Connor talked him out of it. Czarobski was busy during the game asking his opposing lineman about the guy from Annapolis who got caught scalping tickets. “Must be quite a guy,” Ziggy told him, “I scalped four iNavy tickets last night that cost me $3.75 apiece and all I got for them was $2 apiece.” On the next play Marty Wendell was laughing so hard at Ziggy that he missed his block.
Sports writers from all over slipped into South Bend a week before the Army game and the local telegraph office was swamped with press wires. The Irish were confident of winning; the student body disagreed on whether or not the score should add up to the total of the ’44 and ’45 Army scores; the coaching staff (as usual) was willing to settle for a one-point margin of victory. Everyone at Notre Dame was satisfied when the final gun sounded.
The Army game this year brought about the longest run and the longest walk. The fans saw Terrific Terry lug the pigskin 95 yards to pay dirt on the opening kick-off, but very few (and none 'of the sports writers present mentioned it) witnessed the dramatic “long walk.” After the game ended, Coach Leahy and Coach Blaik met at mid-field, quickly reached for each other’s hand, immedi-

ately released their grips and walked ALONE ten yards apart to the SAME exit. And, brother, it was a long walk!
Rain-soaked and slippery, the Wildcats’ field in Evanston was nearly marked as the National Championship Graveyard of Notre Dame. The statistics whispered that Notre Dame had thoroughly outplayed Northwestern but the 26-19 score yelled that the Irish weren’t invincible.
After the game the Irish crowded into the “606 Club” where (you guessed it) Zygmont Czarobski took over the master of ceremonies job long enough to have the whole joint cheering the son of a butcher and singing the praises of the Leahy Lads.
The Tulane game a week later was a quiet affair. Nobody expected much competition from the Green Wave but those 32 points in the first quarter made a guy wonder how Alabama, the number one team of the Sugar Bowl this coming New Year’s, dropped its opening game to this same eleven. Head Coach Frnka of Tulane refused to shake hands with acting Head Coach Krause after the game.
Last week after the Southern Cal fracas, Liz Scott kept her date with Ziggy and entertained him royally in Hollywood. After meeting in Pittsburgh, they corresponded occasionally with the idea of getting together when the season ended. They got together!!!

the days that followed he received letters from writers all over the country who covered the game and were amazed at the wonderful treatment.
Walter “Red” Smith of the New York Herald Tribune wrote Father John Cavanaugh on behalf of the New York writers that “we appreciate the great work done this week by Charlie Callahan. He had the most difficult job, and no one could .have handled it better.”
' John Winkin, ass’t. editor of Sport, commented: “I am sure I voice the opinion of all of us who were there at the game that the treatment received by the press was beyond reproach. I am sure everyone felt that it couldn’t have been better, and time and time again I heard it said that this was the best treatment the press had ever been accorded anywhere or anytime. I would like to say that I concur entirely with this.”
Perhaps the tribute which Callahan appreciates most came from Joe Petritz, for 13 years the Notre Dame publicity man and now in charge of publicity for the All-America Football Conference.

Petritz said, “Thank you again for your courtesy of last week. Congratulations on the very excellent manner in which you operated the press box. It was the most exacting assignment in the history of Notre Dame stadium, and I’d say that you and your crew did an outstanding job.”
Notre Dame has long been recognized as having the best relations with sports writers of any college in the land. Consequently, the Army game was a challenge to our press facilities and hospitality as well as to our unbeaten grid-ders. The Irish scored a smashing victory in both respects.
Lujack's Fan Mail
(Continued from Page 58)
would. . . . P.S.: If you can’t make it substitutes would be appreciated.” Since the date in question was the eve of the Tulane game, the lads invited were unable to attend, and as Clashmore Mike was indisposed, he declined to act as a substitute.
It won’t be enough that gridiron fans the country over will be seeing Lujack cavort on the greensward for a few more years yet, but those of you who are followers of the bangtails may also have the opportunity to see Lujack come thundering down the home stretch. We don’t mean to infer that Johnny is thinking seriously of making the ponies a profession, or of entering himself in the Kentucky Derby, but if some girl in Florida has her way, there will be a thoroughbred named after him.
And speaking of names, a man out Los Angeles way, a rabid Notre Dame fan, sent John a hundred-word wire. He had just named his second son “Lujack” in honor of our lad from Connellsville.
What does John think of all this fan mail? Naturally he likes it and appreciates the fact that so many people are interested in his welfare. But it isn’t just a passive appreciation; he takes a pen in hand and spends an average of two hours a day answering these letters.
“Now, take this letter,” said John, “from a girl out in San Francisco. She’s had infantile paralysis since she was seven years old and has never seen a football game, but that doesn’t stop her from rooting for Notre Dame. I’m writing to her now. Listen to what she says in her last paragraph . . .
Johnny, I know I have been a pest to you but to me it was a pleasure writing this letter. I will pray to God to let you have a beautiful star to lead you to success in the future. Perhaps some day when I get well, I will really see you in action ... or the wonderful Notre Dame team I read about. God bless you always.
It couldn’t happen to a better guy.
