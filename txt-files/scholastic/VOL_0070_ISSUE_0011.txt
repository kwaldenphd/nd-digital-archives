and the try-outs will be taken care of as quickly as possible. Rehearsals will begin immediately after the group has been selected.
Professor Doyle washes to stress the opportunity for all to prove their dramatic ability. The play is for everyone, and anyone harboring any desire to take part in such a production should certainly attend this first meeting. Watch your hall bulletin boards for the exact day. There are twelve parts open in this production.
It will be impossible to present this play before the Christmas holidays, but it is hoped that the premier production will appear shortly after the holidays. The recess period will enable those taking part to further familiarize themselves with their lines, and the work after vacation wall be directed chiefly in somothing the action and mechanical aspects of the play.
Any student washing to aid in the business direction of the production may also attend the first meeting.

“Everything in America outside the Catholic Church is disintegrating both morally and intellectually,” declared Arnold Lunn, eminent Catholic apologist, Thursday night in Washington Hall. This was Mr. Lunn’s last lecture on the campus of the University of Notre Dame, as he leaves Saturday for Switzerland. His topic was, “The Catholic in the Modern World.”
Pointing out that Catholics in America have long been on the defensive so far as Christian Apologetics is concerned Mr. Lunn urged that they now take the stand of militant offense.
Mr. Lunn will leave the campus tomorrow for New York. Next Tuesday he will sail for Switzerland where he will assume control of the British skiing team. He was recently appointed captain of the British team which will compete in the International races in Switzerland in February.
Mr. Lunn expressed his enjoyment at having taught at Notre Dame,
“This has been a most enjoyable experience. This was my first attempt at teaching, and I was particularly amazed at the energy and the hard work of the students,” he said.
While teaching at Notre Dame Mr. Lunn served as the guest speaker at many campus club meetings. He was the promoter of the Chesterton Society, an organization to acquaint the students -with the arguments given by Communism against the Catholic Church and to prepare them to be able to debate matters concerned.

HOWARD ADVANCES IN HALL DEBATES; TO FACE DILLON
ALUMNI PRESIDENT HUGHES URGES ACTION FROM GRADUATE LEADERS TO AID FIGHT AGAINST COMMUNISM; PLANS SET
Next week the semi-finals of the interhall debating tournament will be finished. Chairman George Morris announced that the semi-finals are being run off in the regular bracket manner, and that only one defeat is now necessary to eliminate a team. .
Since no debates were held in that division this week, the standings of the Junior-Senior teams are the same as of last week.
Next Monday, Dec. 14, the members of the Dillon squad will debate the pace-making Howardites.
On the following evening, the winner of the Dillon-Howard debate will pit its strength against Sorin hall. The victor of this debate will be the champion of the junior and senior halls.
In the Freshman-Sophomore division, Morrissey beat and eliminated Freshman hall in the tilt on Dec. 7. Previously it had swept Lyons from the brackets on Dec. 2. The judges for these two debates were, respectively: Mr. William J. Coyne, associate professor of speech and varsity debate coach, and the Rev. Robert W. Woodward, C.S.C.
On Monday, Dec. 14, Cavanaugh hall will struggle with the winner of the St. Edward’s-Badin debate held on last Wednesday evening.
To complete the brackets, the winner of Monday night’s debate will encounter Morrissey on Tuesday, Dec. 15. The outcome of this clash will decide the champion debate team of the freshman and sophomore halls.
Chairman Morris stated today that the final debate (between the champions of the two divisions) to choose the champion campus team to be held at St. Mary’s College, has been postponed until the week of Jan. 16, next year. -

Complete plans for the Alumni Association’s fight against Communism were revealed in the December issue of the Notre Dame Alumnus, which appeared yesterday, in an article by Mr. Arthur J. Hughes, president of the Notre Dame Alumni Association.
N.D. Club of Chicago to Hear Faculty Talks
Professor William H. Downey, of the economics department, will give the first of a series of lectures by University of Notre Dame faculty members before the Notre Dame club in Chicago on January 6, 1937. His

subject will be “The History of Nationalism.”
He will be followed by Rev. L. R. Ward, C.S.C., professor of philosophy, on February 3; Mr. Christopher Hollis, professor of history, on March 3; and Mr. Daniel G. O’Grady, professor of philosophy, on April 7. As yet their subjects have not been announced.
Prof. Campbell Speaks To Old Dominion Club
The Old Dominion club was entertained by an advisory talk given by Prof. T. Bowyer Campbell in Carroll “Rec” last Friday, Dec. 4. Professor Campbell pointed out some of the advantages of attending the University, advantages that sometimes escape the attention of students.
While refreshments were served, the holiday program was discussed and settled. With Frank Kelly as chairman of the arrangements committee, the club will hold a dinnerdance at the Country Club of Virginia in Richmond shortly after Christmas. The date has not been set as yet, but it will be announced in a few days by the secretary.
In explaining the movement, Mr. Hughes said, “The 85 different Notre Dame clubs will be made the media through which informative data will be released to the people of the country at large.
“The president of each Notre Dame club is earnestly requested to immediately appoint a suitable committee, the members of which shall in each instance have two major duties. First to thoroughly inform themselves as to the general principles of Communism. This study and investigation can be made in connection with data which will be furnished each club by the University through the Alumni secretary’s office.
“The members should also inform themselves as to the inroads that are being made by Communism in their particular communities and the effects which such inroads are evidencing. Secondly, the members of each such committee should qualify themselves to carry on a consistent plan of public speaking by appearing’before the various clubs and societies of their respective cities or communities and presenting clearly and concisely the fundamentals which go to form the objective of our drive against Communism.”
In order to standardize these speeches, the Rev. John F. O’Hara, C.S.C., president of the University, has arranged for faculty members to prepare papers on the different phases of Communism.
A series of radio addresses has already been arranged from the Paulist Fathers station WLWL in New York. In addition to this, programs will be offered from Chicago stations and other principal centers. Father O’Hara and other priests of the congregation will supplement the radio programs by making public appearances in behalf of the movement in many of the larger cities of the country.
Giving another phase of the attack, Mr. Hughes said, “As a culmination to this announcement, Father O’Hara has approved an arrangement wherein the formal initiation of our movement against Communism will be made, we hope, by all of the 85 clubs holding meetings on the evening of Monday, Jan. 25, 1937. These meetings will not be in the nature of banquets or dinners, but will be held rather as forums.”

MONDAY IS SIXTEENTH ANNIVERSARY OF GIPP’S DEATH
By Frank Reilly
Notre Dame pauses on Monday, Dec. 14, to comemorate the death of one of her most famous sons, George Gipp.
In September, 1919, a modest almost timid freshman, from Laurium, Michigan, reported to Coach Fitzgerald in Cartier field as a candidate for the first year football team. Some two months later, while football scribes diligently, but vainly searched for his name in the football guides, records,
George Gipp
“Far and away the best. . .”
and encyclopedias, the name of this youth was being flashed all over the country. This unknown freshman in the game between Notre Dame’s freshman team and Kalamazoo College had come within three yards of breaking the world’s record for the longest drop-kick.
The young man had attended Calumet High School, and was attracted to Notre Dame by the friendly interest of “Dolly” Gray, a former baseball catcher for the University.
In 1920, George Gipp was chosen almost unanimously for the backfield position at left-half on the All-American team. Some sports writers had said that he was the greatest football player they had ever known.
Grantland Rice said of this man Gipp, in the New York Tribune, of Dec; 2, 1920: “If one were to select an all-star array from this combination he should undoubtedly begin with George Gipp of Notre Dame. He is the best back in the country, a back who can punt, drop-kick, pass, break a line, or run an end. . . There has been a scarcity this season of triplethreat back of the Mahan type. . . . Gipp was far and away the best, not (Continued on Page 22)

KANSAS - OKLAHOMA CLUB SETS DATE FOR YULE DANCE
•
At their final pre-holiday meeting last night, Dec. 10 the members of the Kansas-Oklahoma Club agreed on definite arrangements for the Christmas dance. Al Schwartz and Carl Senger, with the enthusiastic cooperation of the alumni group, have arranged to hold the dance in Salina, Kansas, on the night of December’ 26th. The club hopes to make the dance this year the finest ever given by the club, and a ten-piece orchestra will be hired for the event. Although some of the members living too far south in Oklahoma intend to hold a small party of their own, many of the Oklahoma members residing closer to Salina have expressed their determination to attend the dance.
Because some of the fellows already have tickets, plans for chartering a special train-car for the homeward journey have been discarded. However, groups of the boys will band together for the trip.
A post-holiday Communion Breakfast and a yet distant Rockne Memorial Program were briefly discussed also.
Pastor Villaflor Creates a World of Art From Silken Threads in Corby Retreat
By Frank E. Larwood
Some of the finest embroidery in the world is made at Notre Dame by Pastor Villaflor, the first Filipino admitted to the United States, who makes all the altai' cloths, tapestries, and vestments for the Congregation of Holy Cross.
Pastor, as he is familiarly known to his many friends among both students and faculty, has been so many places, done so many things, and met so many prominent people prior to his retiring to Notre Dame that as he says, “It is hard to remember. Things are all so jumbled, and happened so long ago.”
After attending St. Vincent College in Iloilo, Philippine Islands, Pastor came to the United States in 1901 at the close of the Philippine Revolution. He was invited to breakfast in the White House by President Theodore Roosevelt and the First Lady where he acquired another “first” in being the first Filipino to shake hands with the President.
Pastor was also personally acquainted with President Taft. “Although Theodore Roosevelt was a Republican I am for Franklin Roosevelt

James Osgood, senior lawyer from Chicago, was named chairman this week of the Lawyer Ball, which is to
be held on Friday evening, Jan. 15,

Members o f the committees have been appointed as follows: Ticket committee, Francis Dunn, Peter Vivi-ano, Samuel Minel-la, James McGuire, and Thomas Foy;

committee, Francis Meyer, John Watters, Robert Schmelzle, Harry Weakly, and Peter Nemeth.

This annual Ball is the most im
portant and the largest event in the social year of the Law School, and in the past has been well attended,
now,” he said with a laugh and a twinkle in his dark eyes.
Unaware of it, Pastor created quite an interest in the United States when he first entered this country. He toured many states playing the guitar, and singing songs of his native land in numerous theaters. It was on this tour that he became acquainted with Cardinal Mundelein of Chicago and Cardinal Hayes of New York.
In traveling around the world twice, Pastor had audiences with both Pope Leo XIII and Pope Pius X. Being cosmopolitan, he considers the world as his country and the people of all nations as his countrymen. During the World War Pastor was a volunteer worker at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, where he taught the soldiers how to weave baskets and rugs.
To describe even a part of the many works of art that he has made or to tell of the things that he has done would take much more space than is here permitted. This diminutive man of over 60 wears a size two and one shoe has led a very busy life.

The December issue of the Notre Dame Alumnus made its appearance yesterday with complete plans for the Association’s fight against Communism outlined in the main article by Mr. Arthur J. Hughes, president of the Alumni association.
Another article on Communism was a reprint of the Rev. John F. O’Hara, C.S.C., speech “Two Programs of
Managing Editor Dooley Editor’s Right and Left Hand.
Life,” delivered in the Church of St. Paul the Apostle, New York City, on Sunday, Nov. 15. This sermon was the opening address of the Alumni association’s drive.
The remainder of the news section is composed of articles on the Lae-tare Medal presentation to Richard Reid, by Father O’Hara, at Augusta, Georgia, on Nov. 88; a history of the Ave Maria, which is 71 years old; an article on the endowment fund; and the appointment of Gerald Hoar, ’21, to the managership of the N. D. laundry.
Of special interst to members of the Alumni were stories on the graduates of the University who returned for the Ohio State and Northwestern games, and a list of “Oldtimers” who gathered for their second annual reunion over the week-end of the Northwestern game.
The column on campus life was again conducted by John J. Lechner, ’37. The Sports department was handled this month by Richard A. Riley, ’37, of the Scholastic news staff, substituting for Joe Petritz, the sports publicity director, who was in California for the Southern Cal game.

Detroit Alumni Secure Faculty Lecturers
The Notre Dame club of Detroit will bring four members of the University faculty to speak before them and their friends during the winter months. The lecturers will speak at the Detroit Institute of Arts.
Professor Daniel C. O’Grady, Ph.D., will deliver the first lecture tonight at 8:30 p.m. Professor O’Grady will speak on the topic, “A Sense of Humor.” Professor Clarence Manion, will address the group on Jan. 15 on a pertinent and timely subject, “Scrapping the Constitution.”

"Religion in Governments” will be discussed by Father Miltner in the final talk of the Alumni series.
Philippe Taylor Hostermann — a name to reckon with. In this native of Seattle, Washington, we have a man who is not president of his class or of any campus organization. Never has he been a manager; never has he edited a school publication. He was not all-state in his high school, O’Dea, end he was not voted the most likely to succeed. In spite of these negative characterization, if not because of them, Phil has been destined for Man About these three years.
For wild and woolly hunting and fishing yarns he has no peer. They
are so clever and well-told that they don’t become boresome, even upon repetition. He is an ardent outdoor man, and hasn’t had a date' at school; the two statements seem to be related.
Each Christmas he goes through a trying experience. Up to the last few days before vacation, he tells his friends sorrowfully that he won’t be able to get to Seattle for the Yule-tide. Then, usually on the last day, he gets a check for train fare, and inside of two hours, is on the South Shore, bound for home. Although the train trip takes three days and three nights, he amuses himself easily.
He’s the type who worries constantly about his studies, gloomily predicts two or three flunks every semester, but always passes everything. Phil knows virtually every - -senior-and is still looking for the guy who gave him the unaccountable nickname of “Stimy.”
It was his misfortune to start car-
FEATURE GLEE CLUB ON NATION-WIDE
AIR PROGRAM
•
Making its first concert appearance of the year, the Notre Dame Glee Club took to the air last Wednesday evening when they entertained a radio audience over the Mutual broadcasting network. The broadcast from 9:30 to 10:00 p.m. featured the Glee Club during the major part of the half-hour.
Station WGN, with studios in the Tribune Square, Chicago, served as the key station of the Mutual Broadcasting Company for the program.
The first number rendered by the Glee Club was Vittoria’s "Ave Maria.” This was followed by a selected college medley of Notre Dame songs. Beginning with “On Down the Line,” the Glee Club followed with the “Victory March,” and concluded the medley singing with "When Irish Backs Go Marching By.”
As a finale, the Glee Club, accompanied by the studio orchestra, sang the popular "You Are Free,” from the recent musical comedy “Apple Blossoms.”
Seventy members of the club took part in the program. The Glee Club is directed by Prof. Joseph Casa-santa. This marked one of the several appearances that the Glee Club’s plans call for this year.
While the Glee Club was performing over the airways, Professor Casa-•santa also announced that the one hundred-piece band will present a half-hour concert from 7:30 until 8:00 p.m. before the start of the basketball games and the band will also entertain during the intermissions.
Central Ohio To Have Christmas Forty
For its annual Christmas celebration, the Central Ohio club has decided to hold a private party in an unannounced Columbus hotel. Joseph Rotondo has been appointed to take charge of arrangements. He will be assisted by Leo Hall and Richard Rodenfels.
A Communion Breakfast has been postponed until shortly after the holidays.

THE WEEK
Capitalist
All praise and honor to Vince Hartnett, the serene defier of convention, the eater of delicacies. Perched beneath the noses of those at the head table in the west dining hall, our Mr. Hartnett nibbles his personal repast after the meal proper has ended. Vince is something of a gourmet: where the ordinary person might wolf apples and like proletarian delights, he picks at pickled onions and marmalade. The mere accomplishment of picking at marmalade classifies him as an Epicurean. For special occasions, such as rainy Sundays or fishy Fridays, he brings forth his crowning nourishment; it goes by the name of Paradise jelly and, we are told, is a happy combination of quince and crab apple jellies. After grace, while the unfortunates file out, Vince figuratively primps his palate. At first his daring got him little but ridicule; now many a tongue hangs out at the sight of his snacks. Please, Vince, don’t tempt us too much. After we have seen what we laughingly call food and we pass you and your tidbits, we tend to go berserk.

Take Another Guess
We suggest to all football forecasters the current system of Jimmy (may we call you Jimmy?) Costin. On Friday, Nov. 27, he predicted games which had been played Nov. 26. Obviously, he was playing them close to the vest. But this slip became distinctly minor league when the Dec. 2 issue appeared. A makeup editor, trying to fill space, inserted election returns, which were only about a month stale; something about “Roosevelt leads,” and a few statistics. Never a dull moment.

Shots In The Dark
Never have we known the match of Notre Dame for wild rumors. Take the simple case of the Rev. George Marr, C.S.C. Early in September it was breathed that he would take a trip immediately after the first semester. One self-styled authority had him going to India. Another said China. A third offered Australia. Then, as the weeks went by, the problem of rector pro tern came up. It wouldn’t do to sail off and leave the Walsh haliers to shift for themselves. We questioned here and there to find out who would substitute. Three men were approached; the first told us that the second floor prefect would take the post; the next candidate nominated the third floor prefect; and the last went entirely out of bounds by offering the name of a priest in

St. Edward’s, Texas. Of course we could have asked Father Marr for the details of his trip and his successor, but we didn’t want to appear nosey- Anyhow, bon voyage.

Missing Persons
If a person feels that he isn’t being appreciated, let him go away; he’ll soon be missed. Witness the confusion in the west dining hall brought about by the absence of the Rev. John Farley, C.S.C. Father John went with the team to Southern California, and matters slipped completely out of control. When meals were over, and the usual cliques congregated outstide in the foyer, there was nobody to close the doors; and, keenest of all, we missed his genial slap on the back and his friendly kick in the pants. Those intimate expressions grow on one. After the noon meal (meal is used advisedly) a prankish fellow, probably one of the Rover boys, pushed a serving table out of the hall into the corridor. Now, that sort of thing would never have happened had Father John been on hand.

Dear Kris:
We write an annual letter to Santa Claus, but this is the first time it has been published. We feel rather squeamish about baring our inner self to a critical campus, but here goes. Our requests may be filled any time. We hope that some day, when we ask for sausages at the cafeteria that the girl will have a brainstorm and give us seven instead of six. It would be nice if, when Adolph, the apple man, is throwing more than one apple to the boys at a basketball game, the entire crowd would not count along with him. We’d like to hook up with a professor who didn’t try to scare us out of a decade’s growth with his threats of a stiff final exam. We wish that Joe Casasanta would let a’ certain trombone player take a “ride” chorus on “St. Louis Blues.” We wouldn’t be at all mad if electric razors were declared unconstitutional; they spoil radio programs so strategically. We’d be ever so happy if, just once, the students would be quiet when the bell rings for grace; then there wouldn’t be that agonizing delay. We’d like to hear a man refuse an invitation to a show by pleading the need for study, and not have his friend say "Study? Don’t be silly.” We’d be thrilled if a campus club would plan for’ a big dance withozit contacting all the name bands in America. We wish—you all a merry Christmas. The new year will take care of itself.
ACADEMY OF SCIENCE RAISES STANDARD FOR ADMISSION
A qualitative average of 87 will be the minimum for admittance into the Academy of Science after September, 1937. This -was voted upon by the society, now in its tenth year of existence, at a meeting held last Monday in Science hall. In previous years an average of 85 was sufficient.
Papers were read by John Powers, a senior in the College of Science from Houston, Texas, and by Arthur C. Davidson, a junior in the same college from Greenville, Miss.
Powers briefly outlined and illustrated the “Foraminifera in the Formation and Location of. Petroleum,” in which he described the three theories on the formation of petroleum: the organic, the inorganic, and the combination of these two.
In his talk Powers declared that the foraminifera theory, the organic, is applicable to the Gulf region, from which more than one-third of the petroleum output is obtained. Bacterial action, pressure, and action of heat cause a distillation of the organic matter in the foraminifera to form petroleum products, which are accumulated in pools by seepage through particles of sand. Shells are used to indicate the age and limits of a petroleum reservoir, and geologists, he said, by examining the earth for foraminifera shells can tell the likelihood of petroleum pools.

Alumni Letter
Editor,
Notre Dame Scholastic,
Notre Dame, Ind.
Dear Editor:
The Alumni Association is preparing another illustrated booklet concerning Notre Dame for distribution among young men throughout the United States who may be interested in attending the University.
During our three years of stimulating these contacts, our own students here on the campus have been the most valuable aids.
Recent graduates themselves, of some 1100 high schools in this country, they are familiar with the immediately succeeding generation of boys heading collegeward.
Being Notre Dame men, they are anxious to have the men who follow them here maintain the standards of Notre Dame as they are maintaining excellent standards set by the alumni who preceded them.
The Christmas holidays give the students an opportunity to resume these contacts.
May I, through your magazine, ask the students of the University during the coming several weeks to list the boys who, in their judgment, may or should be Notre Dame men next year.
This list can be brought back personally after the New Year, to the Alumni Office, and literature will be sent to the young man’s home address. Or a card or letter during the holidays will achieve the same result.
Very truly yours,
James E. Armstrong, Alumni Secretary.

A Columnist’s Viewpoint
Getting out this little column is no picnic.
If we print jokes, people say we are silly;
If we don’t they say we are too serious.
If we clip tilings from other magazines
We are too lazy to write them ourselves;
If we don’t we are too fond of our own stuff.
If we don’t print contributions, We don’t appreciate true genius; If we do print them the column is filled with junk.
If we make a change in the other person’s write-up
We are too critical;
If we don’t, we are asleep.
Now like as not someone will say We swiped this from some other magazine.
—WE DID.
The Old Order Remaineth
In the hope of improving its athletic standards and the calibre of its teams authorities at Wisconsin University were recently considering the advisability of initiating a system of scholarships and preparatory training for Wisconsin high school graduates who had outstanding athletic and scholastic records.
Under the plan such high school graduates would go to a free summer institute where the would study sports as well ac academic subjects. Students with the highest rankings would then be offered scholarships of $400. It further provided that these scholarships might be renewed for two years for those students who continued to maintain satisfactory records.
However, latest reports are that the system will never go into effect since it violates the principle of the present athletic code of the Big Ten.
In Short—
Fritz Crisler, football mentor of Princeton, missed making Phi Beta Kappa when he was a student at Chicago U. because of too many absences from Chapel service. Attendance was compulsory in his day. . . . Says the Daily Californian — “The reason women live longer than men is because paint is a great preservative”. . . The best story of the week comes from the Auburn Plainsman. It seems that a geology professor was annoyed and disgusted at the way his class insisted on talking about nothing but Rose Bowl candidates. Trying to stop this line of thought he insisted that his class ask him questions about geology. The first one asked of him was, “What happened to Fordham’s seven blocks of granite?”
MYSTERY. BIOGRAPHY. POETRY. ADDED
TO LIBRARY
•
With subjects ranging from essays to biography and from poetry to mystery stories, the new books in the library should prove of interest to every class of readers in the University.
Mystery fans will probably be interested in Edmund Bentley’s Trent’s Own Case, one of the best, in which demon-dick Trent makes Philo Vance look like a hick cop. More serious readers will enjoy Sir Thomas’ History of the Scotland Yard, in which the famous criminologist reveals the secret working of the “Yard.”
The recent trend in modern American literature toward controversial subjects is illustrated by three outstanding new books. Chief among these is Irving Brant’s Storm Over the Constitution in which an attempt is made to prove that the makers of the Constitution intended the national government to have more power than the Supreme Court decisions of recent issue allow.
Sweden, the Middle Way by M. W. Childs, a significant work, traces the complete history and development of Sweden’s highly praised cooperative projects, while Higher Learning in America by the youthful president of Chicago university, Robert Maynard Hutchins, delineates present day advancements in education.
Poetry is well represented with the latest collection of T. E. Daly, Italian-American dialect romancer, and the interesting study by Edgar Lee Masters called Poems of the People, which is a treatise on more than 50 persons, historical or unknown. Masters’ autobiography, the retrospective Across Spoon River, is also listed among the new books.

At one time Pastor taught Spanish, Latin and French. Many leaders in Church and eduactional circles today were among his pupils. He has judged art as well as taught it, and lists singing, weaving, piano and violin playing among his talents. Because he devotes so much of his time to his needle-work he has given up the latter accomplishments. • At one time he was a seminary student.

No. I I
CONCERNING SANTA CLAUS ...
NOBODY in the history of the world has ever seen the wind. Few people in history have ever denied its existence. Nobody in history has ever seen and felt the spirit of Christmas, the spirit of love and brotherhood that grasps the world in common bondage—yet by their actions millions of people seem to deny that this spirit exists; or if it does exist, they are content to relegate it to the antiquary reserved for mustache cups and two-horse surries.
Hundreds of thousands of young men throughout the world will kneel to Christmas prayer this year in uniforms. Thousands of homes will strive humanly to push the fear of war back a little in consciousness to allow room for the seasonal spirit. Some homes in Spain, indeed, have seen their last Christmas.
It was not many years ago that most of these uniformed boys were hanging Yule stockings. It was not many years ago that they saw things simply, clearly, with
a solemn faith. The world needs a Santa Claus this year more than it ever has. The world needs a Santa Claus to revive faith in things that have no cold hard touch.
Several years ago the New York Szm printed a famous Christmas editorial. Its writer would be happy and yet sad to know how truly his work applies to today’s world. We reprint it here in the hope that it may re-kindle somewhere a sputtering spark—we reprint it because the world needs a Santa Claus.
“We take pleasure in answering at once and thus prominently the communication below, expressing at the same time our great gratification that its faithful author is numbered among the friends of The Sun:
“‘Dear Editor: I am eight years old. Some of my little friends say there is no Santa Claus. Papa says, “if you see it in The Sun it’s so.” Please tell me the truth; is there a Santa Claus?
Virginia O’Hanlon.’
“Virginia, your little friends are wrong. They have been affected by the skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except they see. They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible to their little minds. All minds, Virginia, whether they are men’s or children’s, are little. In this great universe of ours man is a mere insect, an ant, in his intellect, as compared with the boundless world about him, as measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge.
“Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist, and you know’ that they abound and give to our life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! How dreary would be the world if there were no Santa Claus. It would be as dreary as if there were no Virginias. There would be no childlike faith then, no poetry, no romance, to make tolerable this existence. We should have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The eternal light with which childhood fills the world would be extinguished.
“Not believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in fairies! You might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on Christmas eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if they did not see Santa Claus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, but that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus. The most real things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see. Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but that’s no proof that they are not there. Nobody can conceive or imagine all the wonders that are unseen and unseeable in the world.
“You may tear apart the baby’s rattle and see what makes the noise, inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest man, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever lived, could tear apart. Only faith, poetry, love, romance, can push aside that curtain and view and picture the supernal beauty and glory beyond. Is it all real? Ah. Virginia, in all the world there is nothing else real and abiding.
“No Santa Claus! Thank God! he lives, and he lives forever. A thousand years from now, Virginia, nay ten times ten thousand years from now, he will continue to make glad the heart of childhood.”

Christmas Eve « « «
By John Lechner
“Come on, sonny,” my mother said, “We’re going to play Santa Claus tonight.”
I remember reaching upward to take her hand. It was Christmas Eve and the white snow covering the grounds outlined the house sharply against the sky. From a window at my left a tiny pencil of light, broken into a right angle by the tightly drawn shade, weakly lit the box-up-on-box steps before me.
“Santa Claus?” I exclaimed won-deringly, but before my mother could answer, the door opened and Mrs. Patelli invited us in.
The room before me was almost entirely bare. In its center stood a long, pear - shaped table. Ringed around it were five brown-eyed, mahogany-colored little faces, and, at its head, sat an older, moustached mahogany.- On the table, a little off-center, rested a deep, long bowl, and from it the barest suggestion of steam was rising. In the moment before the six sensed our presence, the longing with which they gazed at that bowl was as if they were tasting it with their eyes.
Mrs. Patelli, too, seemed to turn from it reluctantly as she chuckled cheerily to my mother:
“Merry Christmas, Missa Pow’, and you too, lit’l Mist’ Jack. You sit down, eh? You maybe eat a lit’l with us, eh?” -
My mother smiled and shook hei* head. “Thank you, but not tonight, Mrs. Patelli. Jackie and myself dropped in to wish you and Mr. Patelli a Merry Christmas, and leave a few toys for the children, and a few groceries for tomorrow.”
At the mention of his name the moustached mahogany came forward murmuring his thanks.
“You’ll find the boxes in my car, Mr. Patelli, if you’ll be kind enough to get them. I’m afraid my Jackie isn’t big enough yet—yes, right out there to the left, Mr. Patelli.”
My mother rumpled my hair. “Not as big as your Georgie, Mrs. Patelli,” she said, smiling at me.
Mrs. Patelli straightened slightly. “Yes, my Georgie, he. fine boy. • My Louie, he good husband, too. Banan’ they no sell very well in winter. Louie very sad, but Georgie say to Louie, ‘You all right, Pop, soon I make plenty money.’ But Louie jus’ shake his head and drink maybe a little mule. Bad—”
Mr. Patelli staggered through the door, heavily laden, an open box under each arm. From one of. them a round-eyed doll perched unsteadily, slid past a toy gun, rolled over a bag of marbles, and fell to the floor. Mrs. Patelli stooped quickly and picked it up. She turned towards the table and called softly, “Yolanda.”
A little girl, very dark, even smaller than I was, came forward timidly, took the doll and retreated behind her mother’s dress.
“Georgie, Ota, Johnny, Sammy, come see what Missa Pow’ and lit’l Mister Jack got from Sant’ Claus for you.”
But the other children shyly kept to their places.
My mother had sorted out the gifts and had a toy gun in one hand, a small racer in the other.
“Sammy,” Mrs. Patelli called sharply, “come, be a nice lit’l boy.”
Sammy came, reluctantly at first, from his place at the table and then dashed quickly past mother and myself, and joined his sister behind Mrs. Patelli’s skirts. He began to cry.
Mrs. Patelli looked downcast. “Sammy, she’s so ashamed,” she explained apologetically. “Sammy! Go get nice gun from Mrs. Pow’!”
Sammy continued to cry. Suddenly, acting almost on impulse, I took
The Room *
After coming from the outer darkness, the single unshielded bulb which hung from the cob-web draped beam dealt me a blinding blow. But when my eyes became accustomed to the unflattering glare, I began to look about the one dingy room which comprised this hovel.
True to its garage-like exterior, the walls of this cubicle were bare and unplastered boards. From chinks in the comers the cold winter night blew in causing the suspended light to sway and to cast dancing shadows about the room. Across one comer of the room was draped a tattered green curtain which hid a sagging, unmade bed. The rumpled covers bunched in the center of the mattress added further to the air of disorder and untidiness which pervaded the place.
“Why don’t you clean this room
the gun from my mother’s hand, walked over to where Sammy was trying to hide, and cradled the toy in the crook of his arm.
“Here,” I said, “take it.”
After that, the distribution of the gifts proceeded more smoothly. Each child came forward timidly, received his share of the contents of the toy-■ box, and then scurried back to the vantage point behind his mother’s skirt.	•
During the skirmishing preceding my action in tendering the gun to Sammy I noted something in one corner of the room that I had not previously seen. It was a stunted, scrubby, little Christmas tree, and from its branches hung but two objects— an undersized apple and a dejected-looking orange. I remember wondering at the time how any three objects, so ill-favored, could take on such dignity and appropriateness placed as they were in that corner and in that room. Having seen them, I forgot them.
Mother and I prepared to leave. Again I took her hand. I was almost across the threshold when I felt a touch on my shoulder. I turned and saw Mrs. Patelli standing before me, the apple in one hand, the orange in the other.	-
“Mister Jack,” she said softly, “you wanna ’nappie, you wanna ’norange ?”	.
It was Christmas Eve.
By William Carroll
once in a while?” questioned my superior as he rubbed the accrued dust of weeks from a bedpost.
“I keep it clean. Only last year I painted up, but the furnace, it smokes. Here, I show you.” With this our case tottered across a newspaper strewn floor to where a stove hissing stove crouched. He opened the door. Grey smoke billowed into our peering eyes.
“See, what did I tell you? How ya gonna keep a place clean with this here? It just gets dirty again.”
My companion turned to me, shrugged his shoulders in a resigned manner and peeled a bill from his wallet.
“Here go out and buy yourself a Christmas,” he ordered. Then we turned.	.

ATHLETICS
WILDCAT CAGERS INVADE LOCAL FIELDHOUSE TO RENEW COLORFUL RIVALRY WITH IRISH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. DEC. 16
By Arch Gott
Notre Dame’s basketball squad will take the flooi' for its first big-league game next Wednesday night when it meets the Northwestern Wildcats in the local gym. With the season only 12 days old, the Fighting Irish will have had three warm-up tilts in which to polish its performance. Northwestern as well has been sharpening its defensive and offensive weapons in preparation for this all-important game.
The intense rivalry between these two teams is unparalleled in basketball history. Two games are regularly played each season, and with rare exceptions the final score is always settled by a one or two point margin. Incidentally, one of the exceptions occurred in the first contest between these squads last year when Notre Dame’s highly - geared five

romped to a 40-29 triumph. A stunned and wounded Wildcat aggregation dragged itself back to Evanston to resharpen its claws for the Fighting Irish New Year’s Eve invasion.
Notre Dame stormed into Evanston on Dec. 31st determined to reassert its superiority over Northwestern, but it seems that the Wildcats also had ideas. In one of the most hectic games on record everything that could happen in a basketball game took place last night. Notre Dame brilliantly held on to a slight lead until there were only two minutes to play. A tie was made and broken by two Wildcat fieldgoals which sent the score to a 20-18 count against Keogan’s men. With a scant couple of seconds to play, the light-(Continued on Page 23)

From the ashes of a quiescent football season, there annually arises a spectre to haunt the lovers of this Autumn sport — the All - American selector. This being the Land of the Free, hs is able to bring his skeleton out of the closet without interference. Rather than test my Democracy to the utmost, I’ve restricted my field to Catholic colleges with Notre Dame, Fordham, Duquesne, Santa Clara, Marquette, St. Benedict’s, Holy Cross and St. Mary’s as the more fruitful candidate producers. Let’s look them over:
' ENDS: There weren’t very many outstanding ends this season so that the better ones stood out. PLATUKIS of DUQUESNE was the keyman in a line which successfully withstood the attacks of such powerful machines as Pittsburgh and Marquette. CAPTAIN AL BOGLARSKY from DETROIT won the other flank post because of his uncanny ability to block punts and catch passes. It was his catches of Andy Farkas’ tosses which enabled Gus Dorais’ men to whip opponents. There were other good ends like Deutsch, All-Kansas end from St. Benedict’s, Joe Zwers and Joe O’Neill of Notre Dame, and Brown of Santa Clara.
TACKLES: For offensive blocking and defensive play, ED FRANCO of FORDHAM has been almost unanimous on this year’s All-American teams. BILL WILKIN of ST. MARY’S beat out his teammate, Jerry Dennerlein, for the other tackle position. This 240 pound tackle has

IRISH WHIP ST. MARY'S IN SECOND GAME OF SEASON
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TIES NOTRE DAME IN THRILLING FOOTBALL FINALE, 13-13;
WILKE, McCORMICK SCORE
By Fred Digby
The Fighting Irish, abetted by the return of Paul Nowak to the line-up and led by Johnny Moir in their attack, defeated the St. Mary’s quintet, 39 to 27, last Tuesday night in the Notre Dame gymnasium.
The first string netmen approached mid-seasori form and scored at will on St. Mary’s, but the Irish proved to be very weak in reserve strength. When the first stringers left the game in the second half, the play had been rather one-sided, and the score stood 33 to 13. The St. Mary’s quintet then rallied and outplayed the reserve team in the latter part of the half, scoring fourteen points to their six.
Johnny Moir, pla.ying at the center position, turned in a brilliant offensive game, netting six field goals and a foul shot for a total of thirteen points. Paul Nowak, at forward, saw service for the first time. He did not play in the Kalamazoo game, but in Tuesday night’s tilt exhibited his old form both defensively and offensively. Captain Meyer followed Moir in scoring with seven points chalked up to his credit.
The Irish got off on the right foot and easily ran the score up to 25 to 8 by the half. With Mike Crowe playing at forward in place of Nowak, this same team started the second half. The Irish soon scored eight more points, while St. Mary’s registered five. Moir was forced out of the game because of four personal fouls.
With the score standing at 33 to 13, the second team entered the game. They were able to score only six points as St. Mary’s, taking control of the tilt, ran up fourteen extra tallies for a 27 point total.
Vaickus, St. Mary’s left guard, scored two field goals and five free throws to lead his team offensively. Co-captain Scully and Ziegenfuss followed him with five points each.

The scoreboard read simply 13-13 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum last Saturday, as the final gun terminated the eleventh meeting of Notre Dame and Southern California on the gridiron, but to the 78,000 frenzied football fans who witnessed the game it was a veritable encyclopedia of the thrills and

Track Team Drills For Hard Season
Coach Nicholson paced his track team through calisthenics and limbering-up exercises this week, and cautioned them to remain in condition during the forthcoming holiday season. He pointed out that the opening meet of the indoor track season is with Indiana in early February; and since Indiana, has a great track team this year the Irish should be ready for them and be in good physical condition for their encounter with the Hoosiers.
The team will be weakened considerably at the start of the season because of injuries to key men. Szu-machowski and Francis, both top-notch distance runners, are on the sidelines nursing inj'uries. Dan Gibbs, stellar pole vaulter, is handicapped by a bad knee and will not be at his best for some time.
The rest of the squad, barring unforeseen complications, should round into condition by the first meet. “T-Bone” Mahoney, the reliable hurdler, has been brushing up on his form all week and should develop during the season into an even better hurdler than he was last year.
The indoor and outdoor schedule has as yet not been approved. Listed among the coming events are meets with Marquette and Navy, besides participation in the Butler, Armour, and Drake Relays. The Central Intercollegiate Indoor Meet will be held in the fieldhouse in early March.
excitement that made this year’s football season the wierdest in many a decade.
The Irish seemed worthy of the 2-1 odds that had been placed on them at the outset. Taking the ball on the kick-off they traveled down the field with utter disregard for the Men of Troy and scored. To the “experts” a a Notre Dame victory was at first imminent and then inevitable, as the concerted efforts of Bob Wilke, Bunny McCormick, Larry Danbom and Andy Publis moved the ball around at will. It was Bunny McCormick, strutting his stuff before the homefolks, who greatly helped in his initial drive toward the Trojan goal. Catching passes and sweeping the ends he gained considerable yardage all the way. Wilke carried the ball over for the six points.
But mid-way in the second period the complexion of the game changed from Irish green to Trojan crimson, when Schindler faked a reverse, cut through center, and then lateralled to Berryman as he was being tackled. Berryman scooted 60 yards down the sidelines to tie the score at six all.
Again an alert Southern California team upset a Notre Dame threat at scoring. The Californians not only averted an Irish touchdown but also add one for themselves. Notre Dame had the ball on Southern Cal’s nine yard line, first and goal to go. Wilke dropped back to throw a flat pass to Puplis on the goal line, but Langley, Trojan right half, intercepted it and raced unmolested 99 yards for six points. Henderson put the Trojans ahead at 13-6 by his placement.
As the multi-colored Trojan rooters saw an unexpected victory in the offing, Davey Davis, Southern California’s 158 pound quarterback, quick kicked to Puplis on the Notre Dame 12 yard line. With the shadows of their own goal posts stretching out at their backs, the Irish put on the pressure that has characterized many a last minute rush this year and last. Utilizing straight football they moved to the Trojan 15 yard line in a series of line bucks, end runs and short passes. The Wilke - to -- McCormick passing combination again clicked and the Livermore Rabbit scampered over the goal with the pigskin tucked safely in his arms. Andy Puplis tied the score at 13-13 by means of his conversion.

INTRODUCING
Early this year we made a resolution to present all the football players before the Christmas interlude. Before we knew it we found ourselves with but one column to write before Christmas and two men to introduce. So we’re doubling up this week and presenting Frank Kopczak and Jim Martin together.
It is entirely fitting that “Koppy” and “Pepper” be introduced together because they’ve been playing side by side for the last two football seasons. Kopczak at right tackle, and Martin at right guard.
Chicago, Illinois, is the scene of Kopczak’s birth and all subsequent activities prior to his entrance at Notre Dame, and Harrison Technical High School is the scene of his football activities prior to Notre Dame. Here “Koppy” made his debut along with Andy Pilney, Hank Pojman and Andy Puplis, and here it was that these four men combined to give Harrison Tech the greatest football team they ever had. Since then these same fellows have combined to give Notre Dame some pretty good teams in the past few years too.
Koppy played right tackle on that team and also did quite a bit of the team’s kicking. It seems strange having a tackle kick while such men as Puplis and Pilney are in the backfield, but when a tackle can get them off for 60 yards from behind his own goal line like Kopczak did, no coach could pass up the opportunity of using him, regardless of Pilney and Puplis.
Frank’s playing at tackle and his kicking won him All-City nomina-

tions in 1930 and ’31, and an AllState nomination in ’31. While at Tech he took time off from football to participate on the baseball, track and wrestling teams. Since coming
to Notre Dame he’s forgotten about track and wrestling but still sticks to football and baseball. He’s one of the star pitchers on Jake Kline’s nine and will be depended on this year to carry most of the pitching duties along with Arboit and Van Wagner.
Summertimes he’s been working on the Western Electric assembly line in Chicago. A physical education majoi- he plans to enter the coaching field •when he graduates. He’s had some tough luck this year, receiving an injury early in the season he was unable to play most of the games. However he recovered soon enough
Frank Kopczak
to see action against Northwestern and Southern California.
Jim “Pepper” Martin comes from “way up” in Concord, New Hampshire. He was born on St. Valentine’s Day, which should mean something or other. Dean Academy in Franklin, Mass., was the prep school that sent him here. While there he captained the football team and received AllState i-ating for his stellar play at the guard position. Baseball and basketball seasons at Dean Academy have also seen “Pepper” out there competing for the Massachusetts school.
For the last two years he’s been playing regularly at the right guard position. He rooms with Bill Smith, the retired captain, who also was a right guard before his retirement. If Bill had stayed on the team these two roommates would have put up a swell battle for he position. It would have been a pleasure to watch.
“Pepper” is a life guard in the summertime at Concord City pool. He’s a Phy. Ed. major, and ilke Kopczak plans to do some coaching in New Hampshire when he gets out of school. In his spare time he likes to fish, hunt, and play handball.
IRISH TO MEET BUTLER. KENTUCKY AND PITT
IN JANUARY
•
At a time when four day old New Year resolutions are fading from memory Keogan’s eagers will be preparing to meet three of the country’s outstanding basketball teams. After battling the Kentucky Colonels in Louisville on Jan. 5 the Irish quintet will return to the local fieldhouse to play host to the down state Butler aggregation on Jan. 9. Four days later the Keoganmen will meet the Pittsburgh Panthers on the latter’s home court.
Colonels Are Strong
The contest with the Kentucky quintet promises to be one of the highlights of the schedule. The Southerners have risen to national prominence in the past few years and advance reports indicate that this year’s team will be on a par with the outfit which played that hectic game two years’ ago against N. Y. U. in Madison Square Garden. Although the Colonels lost many of their stars through graduation experienced men are ready to step into the vacated posts. The Irish defeated the Kentuckians last season by the score of 41-20, but reports have it that a special defense is to be employed against the Irish.
The Butler-Notre Dame rivalry on the courts is traditional. The Indianapolis lads were setback twice last season by Ford and Co. in close contests. This year with new blood mixed with experienced veterans, the Hoosiers will present a fast, sharp shooting team. The Irish defense will have to be functioning at its best to stop the swift passing attack of the downstaters.
The Panthers Again
When the Irish journey to the Smoky City they will encounter one of the strongest teams in the east. The Panthers will be out to duplicate the football victory as well as to avenge the two defeats suffered last season. It was against Pitt last year that Moir shattered all Notre Dame scoring records by collecting 25 points in the impressive 43-27 Irish victory. The Panther defense is being framed to stotp Moir as well as the other Irish shooters. The swift cutting forwards presented in the Pitt line-up work right into the fast breaking game employed by the Panther hoop-sters.
The Irish line-up for these encounters will, in all probability, be the same as was used in recent games.

KALAMAZOO BEATEN BY IRISH CAGERS IN OPENER
•
By Bill Donnelly
The Notre Dame basketball season began in the field house - last Saturday night with a “breather” against Kalamazoo that had the home team panting heavily before the finally pushed over a 41-27 victory.
Although the Irish showed much potential power individually, they lacked the cohesion that will come with more practive. They flashed very brilliantly in spots, but often threw the ball away on offense or permitted Kalamazoo to penetrate their defense.
Captain Ray Meyer and Johnny Moir led the Notre Dame attack with ten baskets divided evenly between them and seven successful foul flips monopolized by Moir. Meyer scored his points on one arching set shot and four smoothly executed lay-ups; Moir’s baskets were his usual spectacular hair-raisers, each one from a different angle and position. Spals-bury scored 12 points for the Teachers and Warren, who feinted Moir out of position on several pivot shots, scored nine before he finally went out on fouls.
Notre Dame started an all-Junior lineup of Johnny Moir in Paul Nowak’s place at center, Ray Meyer and Jim Carson as forwards, and Tom Wukovits and Tom Jordan as guards. Kalamazoo got the initial tipoff, but the ball went up and down the floor for four or five minutes before Warren of the teachers finally scored on a pivot. Then Tommy Wukct/its slipped in a charity chuck, Jordan popped a bucket, and Meyer dropped one of his lay-up shots on a pass from Moir. Mike Crowe replaced Car-son and a little later, when the Irish seemed to be coasting on a fairly safe lead, Coach George Keogan substituted Gaglione and Conrad at guard. The half-time score was 24-14.
With the exception of Knobel for Meyer, the same team started the second half that ended the first. Notre Dame scored •five points in five minutes, but after Kalamazoo had retaliated with nine points of their own, Coach Keogan rushed his first string
The Irish journey to Urbana on Dec. 19, for an important clash with the Illini. Pre-season reports indicate that they again are slated to have a high-powered representative quintet. Last year in the only battle between Illinois and Notre Dame, the latter won out by a 33-23 score. Moir and Nowak paced the Irish that particular night, or the final count might have had a different story. The Illini, for many seasons, have always been one of the top-notch cage outfits in the Big Ten Conference. Their scoring is built around a tricky, smooth offense, and they will be out to avenge the ’36 setback.
Northwestern entertains Captain Ray Meyers and his crew at Evanston, on Dec. 31. The last game played in the Wildcats lair by Notre Dame resulted in the famous 20-20 tie, and Coach Keogan dislikes repetition—at least in particular matters. Coach Dutch Lonberg will present a veteran aggregation composed mainly of four lettermen and one sophomore.
Fred Trenkle and Mike McMichaels, one of the country’s leading point-getters in 1936, will hold down the forward posts. Gene Smith, a six foot three inch center, will probably be the pivot man. Captain Duke Vance is at a guard position; while Bob Voigts, tackle on the ’Cats grid squad, is being groomed as fits running mate. Notre Dame will be afforded plenty of opportunity to observe the Purple’s offensive tactics when the two teams clash next Wednesday in the local fieldhouse.
The Irish encounter Chicago, Jan. 2, in the Windy City. Although the Maroons -were recently defeated, 25-21, by Marquette, they nevertheless have a strang team. This will be the lone contest between Notre Dame and the Midway five, this season.
The Maroons have a host of good sharp-shooting forwards that include Fitzgerald, Cassels, Mullins, and Eg-gemeyer. Their tip-off is controlled by Amundsen, a tall, rangy pivot man, who is now holding down that position for the third consecutive season. At the guards will be Petersen and Ros-sin, two outstanding performers who have seen plenty of service.
back into the game. This three bucket deficit remained estagnant at 29-23 for four or five scoreless minutes until Meyer finally dropped another of his lay-ups and the Irish began moving ahead once more.

Splinters From The Press Box
By Cy Stroker
Never before have we accused Lady Luck of selling out to the enemy so far as Notre Dame football was concerned. When things went against the Irish we always realized that it was the result of one of two things, — superiority of the opposing team, or the “breaks of the game” which make football so interesting. Even the Navy game brought forth no excessive amount of wailing from this corner. But after the Southern Cal game we cannot refrain from screaming to the skies that “we wuz robbed.” Any team that can smother the opponent’s attack as Notre Dame smothered the Trojan’s, and charge through the enemy defense as though it were made of paper as the Irish did Saturday, certainly deserves to win the game.
There is no question but what that first touchdown play of the Trojans was well executed and rated the score. But the second, — well, it just about revives our belief in Santa Claus. There has been a lot of talk about the goings on between Larry Danbom and the umpire. Not having actually seen the play, we have to rely on the reports of sports commentators, Bing Crosby, and Jimmy Costin. Both seemed to think that Danbom was the logical man to get Langley. Both implied that the umpire could have been more alert in getting out of Larry’s way. However, Arch Ward calls the interference accidental, so perhaps it was just another “break of the game.”
One of the interesting things that we heard on the broadcast was the salvo of boos that greeted the announcement that Pitt would play Washington in the Rose Bowl. Public opinion seems to favor L.S.U. or Alabama as a logical choice for the game. To our way of thinking Pitt was a good choice. It cannot be denied that Pitt is one of the outstanding teams of the country in spite of its defeat by Duquesne and its tie with Fordham. Pitt’s athletic director, W. D. Harrison, inimated that the Panthers would show the world how the team should be rated. Said Director’ Tarrison, “They (the players) are going out to redeem the Pitt prestige. ...”
We are glad to report that some outsiders appreciate the quality of the Notre Dame teams. In his column in the Ohio State “Lantern,” issue of November 30, Sports Editor Dick Williams had this to say:
“With Notre Dame opening grid relations with Minnesota and Illinois next ' year, I’m wondering if the Gophers and Illini can do something about halting the Irish supremacy over Western Conference foes.
“Big Ten members have had very little success in stopping the Irish in the last 15 years. Since 1920 Notre Dame has played 39 conference foes and has won 33 of the games, lost four, and tied two. The only Big Ten elevens able to beat the Irish over this long stretch were Iowa, Purdue, Wisconsin, and Northwestern.
“Besides Minnesota and Illinois, Northwestern, too, will play the Big Ten Nemesis next year.”
To all appearances Coach Keogan and his men are at it again. The victories over Kalamazoo and St. Mary’s, while not important in themselves, point to another year of high percentages for the Notre Dabe basketball team. We expect that the team will show even greater strength than it did in the last two contests, but it will need to. Northwestern, and Illinois will determine definitely just how well the 1936 edition of the Irish court team will carry on the Keogan tradition of bigger and better victories. Potentially the Irish have the best combination in the country, with no exceptions. .
KEOGANITES TO MEET ILLINOIS TEACHERS AT GYM TONIGHT
•
The thus far triumphant Notre JDame Basketball team will encounter somewhat stiffer opposition tomorrow night than they have previously run up against this season. Coach Roy Hanson, in bringing his classy outfit here from Western Illinois State Teachers’ College ,is expected to give the Irish Keoganmen a taste of their first serious competition of the year.
The Teachers, who hail from Macomb, Illinois, are members of the Little Nineteen Conference, probably the strongest athletic conference of small schools in the Middle West, if not in the country.
Last year, the Macomb boys were classed as one of the best teams in the state, and tomorrow night they invade the Irish fieldhouse with practically the same veteran team which took second place in the conference then. Notre Dame has never met Western Hlinois State Teachers before, so their personnel, outside of being reputedly strong, is, as far as the Irish are concerned, a minus quantity.
On the other hand, with Paul Nowak back in the lineup the Irish are at full strength. Nowak handled a forward post in the St. Mary’s game Tuesday night, and his presence made an inestimable improvement not only in the scoring, but in the whole play of the Notre Dame team. With the lanky forward feeding Johnny Moir, they rolled up 25 points in the first half, over half of which were attended to Mr. Moir personally.
Thus, although Keogan’s eagers dre gradually rounding out their form, and he is able to put his veteran team on the boards at full strength, nevertheless he is not willing to take this game as just another of those practice affairs. He says, “It’ll be a tough game,” and he means it.

Irish Football Team Has Successful Season
By Charles Callahan
The forty-eighth Notre Dame football season is history. The spine-tingling climaxes, the hoarsely-shouting fanatics, the bands, the aftergame traffic jams, and all the rest— they’re all gone for another year.
For the Irish, it was a season of good, poor, and finally great football. Notre Dame teams have always been noted for their ability to “come back.” The 1936 eleven kept

that tradition alive. After a good start they played Pittsburgh in the fourth contest of the year. When the final and somewhat welcome whistle blew, the powerful, pitiless panting Panthers proudly pointed to a slaughtering 26-0 triumph. During the ensuing week, sports writers wrote articles on how the famed Notre Dame system was slipping. They maintained that Rockne’s sys
tem had faltered perceptibly before the advances of both time and defense, and that the torch which the “Old Master” had passed on to others was slowly being snuffed out. However, this team—as mentioned before —was a club that could “come back.” One week later they beat a truly great Ohio State team, 7-2, before the largest crowd ever to witness a game played on local premises.
Coach Elmer Layden, after the Pitt debacle stated, “We may not be a great team, but we are far better than we look today, and we’ll prove it before the season ends.” To Elmer and his boys we doff our battered bonnets; they most positively did prove his statement. Furthermore in their classic contests with Army and Northwestern they deserve ranking with any Irish eleven in history.
Taking a conspectus of the season we find the Irish opened at home with a 21-7 victory over Carnegie Tech. -Steve Miller scored twice and Larry Danbom once in a game that saw the Laydenites blocking brilliantly. A valiant band of “Iron Men” from Washington University, of St. Louis, were entertained next in what was supposed to be a “breather.” When the dust, smoke, and mud had cleared away, Notre Dame was triumphant by the slender margin of 14-6. In their third tangle we see Notre Dame acting as host to the Badgers of Wisconsin. Playing a smashing brand of football and using seven teams, the Fighting Irish continued on its undefeated way by white-washing the visitors, 27-0. Thus the first meeting of Elmer Layden and Harry Stuhldreher as opposing (Continued on Page 21)

fourth quarter was blocked and the deadlock remained intact, although Notre Dame was continually threatening the Trojans with spectacular passes and consistent runs. Statistics are usually cold and heartless and those of Saturday’s game were no exception. Notre Dame outplayed their opponents in all departments but their efforts at making or preventing more touchdowns were nullified by alert Trojans or, in the case of Langley’s long run, by a slow-moving referee.
All-Catholic Team
(Continued from Page Ilf) remarkable speed and agility for a man of his size.
GUARDS: BASSI of SANT \ CLARA has caught the eye of most selectors with the fine blocking he performs in leading the Bronco backs to the scores which have kept Buck Shaw’s men undefeated. Tossing my hat in the ring, I’m picking JOE KUHARICH of NOTRE DAME over Johnny Lautar because, while Lau-tar’s work in the last few games has been excellent, Kuharich has been giving a consistently fine performance Saturday after Saturday which is the essence of an All-American. Kordick of St. Mary’s, and Pierce of Fordham are also deserving of mention.
CENTER: This was the most difficult problem of all with ALEX WOJ-CIECHOWICZ of FORDHAM edging out Mike Basrak of Duquesne. The former was the pivotal point in the famous “seven pillars of granite” which stopped Purdue, Pittsburgh, St. Mary’s et al. Basrak, A.P. All-American selection, can get a testimonial from Elmer Layden as to his ability.
QUARTERBACK: NELLO DON FALASCHI, the field-general and blocker for the undefeated SANTA CLARA team, has been picked on most of the All-American selections. Of him a Western scribe writes: “At quarter Flash Falaschi of Santa Clara is a standout. A great blocker, fine defense man, he exerts an influence on the morale of the squad which is indispensable.”
HALFBACKS: RAY BUIVID of MARQUETTE and BOYD BRUMBAUGH from DUQUESNE get the call with Notre Dame’s star, Bob Wilke close behind. The former, an All-American, handles every assignment that a back is called upon to do besides being one of the finest passers seen around the Middle West in some years.

Successful Season
(Continued from Page 19) coaches ended with Elmer holding the upper hand.
The Pittsburgh encounter is probably best covered by that well known maxim: “Some days it doesn’t even pay to get up.” Sadly deficient in all departments, save that of punting, the Notre Dame eleven was overpowered by the hard blocking, vicious tackling, and classy ball carrying of Coach Jock Sutherland’s disciples, 26-0. It might be well to mention that a lad named Goldberg played halfback for Pitt. Elmer evidently told the boys what was what during the following week, for the next Saturday—in true Notre Dame style— they defeated Ohio State, 7-2. A capacity throng of 55,000 witnessed the game. The Buckeyes, with their “razzle-dazzle, hocus-pocus, find-the-pea-under-the-shell” type of football were able to accomplish but little against an inspired Blue and Gold outfit. “Bunny” McCormick carried the mail across the counting stripe for the Irish. The Navy game, on the following Saturday—like its Pittsburgh predecessor—is another one of those affairs of unpleasant memory. A field goal off the righ foot of Bill Ingram—the individual star of the fracas—gave the Middies a 3-0 edge.
Now we come to the traditional Army game played, as usual in New York. It is here that the Irish really hit theii' stride. Eighty thousand saw a hard-hitting, free-wheeling, green-shirted brigade spear headed by a limber-legged lancet named Wilke', a fancy - stepping blocker named McCormick, and a line-bucking ball-handler named Danbom, cogwheeled around a grand keyman named Puplis, knock a strong Cadet eleven completely apart, 20-6. Great as they were against Army, these “1936 Four Horsemen” aided by a magnificent fast-charging forward wall, were even greater against Northwestern, as they shattered the Wildcats’ hopes for National Champion honor, 26-6. The Irish would probably have trounced any team in the nation that afternoon. In the season’s finale with Southern California out on the coast, Notre Dame made nineteen first downs to the Trojan’s two. The score: Notre Dame 13, Southern California 13. You figure that one out because we can’t.
The Southern California contest provided the scene whereupon was written the swan song of backfield performers Bob Wilke, Larry Danbom, Steve Miller, and Vic Wojci-hovski, and linesmen Joe O’Neill, Bill Steinkemper, Art Cronin, Frank Kopc-zak, Captain Johnny Lautar, Jim “Pepper” Martin, Joe McMahon, and Fred Mundee. For individual men
tion, we single out Captain Lautar. He was a fighting, inspirational leader, and his guard play was of the highest caliber at all times.
In closing we wish to give a word of praise to the “forgotten man” of the 1936 eleven: Ex-Captain Bill Smith. Slated to be the captain of the team, he was forbidden by doctors to play. Rather than force the team to have a non-playing leader for two years in a row, he resigned before the season started. His action commends highest respect.

Gipp Anniversary
_____(Continued from Page 6)_ very far from being anothher Mahan. . . . Gipp alone was worth two or three specialists for Notre Dame, for when he dropped back, the defense had no idea whether he intended to pass, kick, slide off tackle, or run an end. And he could do all four jobs better than any one of the specialists. . .”
Two days after the Northwestern game in 1920 Gipp’s slight cold developed into pneumonia. Two more weeks passed, Gipp was baptized and died, Dec. 14,1920.
Telegrams and letters of condolence -poured in from all parts of the country. William Lyon Phelps wrote from Yale. A fund was started for a memorial. Poems and columns of eulogy appeared from coast to coast. The fame of the boy from Laurium had
spread over a nation. George Gipp died in the flush of victory. He died as a young man, at the very outset of his life, but he died when many men would have chosen if they could.
Gipp knew few of his fellow-students by name, because as soon as he learned a name he would forget it. This made no difference to the others, it merely increased their inability to understand him. And this in turn increased their interest in him. ■

John Moir Injured
Irish, basketball hopes were dimmed noticeably this week when it was learned that John Moir, stellar forward on the cage team, had suffered a broken jaw in the St. Mary’s game last Tuesday night.
Moir’s injury will keep him on the bench from three to four weeks. During these four weeks the Irish -will meet such foes as Northwestern, Kentucky, Butler, Pittsburgh and Syracuse. At present Coach Keogan’s problem is great. Nowak, All-American center is still out because of an operation and with Moir on the injured list the Irish will be hard pressed for victory.

Cagers Meet Wildcats
(Continued from Page H)
thatched Johnny Ford swished a longshot from midcourt just as the gun sounded. This last Notre Dame score should have made the count 20 apiece but some mistake in the book of the official scorekeepei' showed a 20-19 victory for the Wildcats. The teams had already gone to the showers when Coach Keogan discovered that all the newspapermen present agreed that the score was actually 20-20. Because the game had been officially closed there was no chance to continue an overtime period. Anxious to straighten the mix-up, Coach Keogan urged a Northwestern committee to decide the argument. They concluded that the game had ended in a 20-20 deadlock, but a Big Ten schedule ruling prevented the replaying of the game at a later date as Keogan desired. Consequently the incident was closed, and it will be re-opened for the first time Wednesday night. Without a doubt there will be 2,900 students each keeping his own individual scoresheet and ready to shout disapproval of any official miscount.
