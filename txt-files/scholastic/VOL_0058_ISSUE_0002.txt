SOME of our “friends” have asked us, in what Ring Lardner would “laughingly” call their facetious way, why not call this page The Weak? Well, why not? We spoke gently of the Freshmen in one of last week’s paragraphs, but the reports continue to simmer in that the new class is listless in becoming Notre Dame men. What’s the trouble? We hear that they are slow in learning the yells. That might be attributed to bad example, judging from the turnout at the Pep Meeting last Friday. But the odd coincidence is that while reports have them silent when they should be noisy, they are also alleged to be noisy when they should be silent. Perhaps when the classes in “College Aims” are a bit more advanced our new acquaintances will be tempered.
Last Saturday was a hot day and the team didn’t have a whole lot of trouble in scoring against Wabash. But the student body could have been prosecuted for non-support. The defense might have used as “Exhibit A” the presence of so many outsiders in the East stands. The East stands are primarily the student stands and, if a cheering section means anything to the team, must be kept so. After the students, let the outsiders fill up the stands, but not among the students.
Founder’s Day gave the Freshmen their first big* opportunity to run wild. Before Opportunity had a chance to knock, she was trampled down in the rush. Many of the upper classmen were away for the week-end; those who remained planned to get a jump or two ahead of the piled-up duties. But if hell is paved with good intentions, Notre Dame Avenue isn’t the only new street.
George Bischoff and his S. A. C. men have been saying little and doing much. The Gridgraph is all set for next Saturday afternoon. The machine cost rather heavily and
it is from the proceeds of the exhibitions that it is to be paid for. This is only a secondary reason why the students should attend the local meeting to follow the fortunes, of the team Saturday, but it is important. The S. A. C. have also asked to have it understood that the signs about the campus, marked “Please” mean please keep off the grass. Also forbidding smoking on the main quadrangle is a present custom as well as a past tradition.
We hope this inactivity—outside the routine work—is only the lull before the storm. Homecoming is approaching. Plans are well along toward perfection. Ray Cunningham has been appointed to give the old-timers the glad hand; McGuire, remembered for the Rocky Mountain barbecue, has been given charge of the entertainment; John Hurley’s, evident good taste has brought him the decorative appointment, while John Kilkenny will run the Stop-and-Go signs at the dangerous corners. Usually the present incumbents have to take lessons in pep from the prodigals at Homecoming. With the rest the boys are taking now, we ought to be able, by Homecoming, to reverse the process.
Campus scribes are wandering aimlessly about with ever-deepening furrows in their faces. The Dome has taken a big step ahead in obtaining the photographs of the Senior class. But realizing that it’s hard to deceive the camera, the class has been allowed to fill out its own questionnaires. Dan Hickey is smiling occasionally which means that there is almost enough copy on hand to put the first Juggler out. The Scholastic editors don’t have time to listen to the criticisms on one copy before the next is due. Some solace has been given them in the establishment of spacious offices in Father O’Malley’s erstwhile recreation room in Corby Hall.

S. A. C. NOTES
ECAUSE of the absence from the University of several of the members, the weekly S. A. C. meeting, scheduled for
Sunday morning, was postponed. It was held instead Wednesday at 6:30 in Room 112 Main Building, at which time the Faculty Advisory Committee, consisting of Fathers Irving, O’Donnell, Lahey and Coach Rockne, were present. Homecomingplans, reception of the football team on its return from the Anny game, and other matters of student interest were discussed in the joint meeting.
—o—
Attention of the students is again called to the old tradition which allows no smoking on that part of the quadrangle bounded on the north by the Administration Building, on east by Washington Hall, on the south by the Sacred Heart statue and on the west by the Church. Do your bit, men. Many schools allow no smoking whatever on the campus.
—o—
Paths in the wrong places, are again making their appearance on the Campus. In an attempt to remedy this tendency the S. A. C. has erected “please” signs.
—o—
Freshman political pots will start boiling when they hear that election of their class officers is planned for the latter part of October. When the Freshman President takes his seat, the personnel of the S. A. C. will be complete.
—o—	.
Secretaries of all campus organizations will please hand the names and addresses of their officers to John Twohy, Secretary of the S. A. C., at the earliest possible moment. And these same hard-worked secretaries are asked also to give the same Mr. Twohy tentative programs of their clubs for the year, especially as regards meetings, so that major conflicts may be avoided. Second publication of these requests!
.	—o—
Students are urgently asked to buy tickets for the Wisconsin trip as soon as possible after the sale begins on October 20. A
hearty cooperation will enabel the S. A. C. to know with the least possible delay, the exact number of men making the trip.
—o—
For the safety and general welfare of the student body, the Faculty has asked that: (1) there be no auto trips to Madison; (2) that there be no stopovers in Chicago; (3) that only students travel on the students’ special train; (4] that those intending to make the trip show their tickets and permits from home to the Rector of their halls before Friday noon, November 7.
MONOGRAM MEN PLAN MEMORIAL
At the last monogram club meeting, President Elmer Layden outlined the plan for the erection of a fitting tribute to the greatest football player of all time, and Notre Dame’s martyred hero, George Gipp. In all probability a plaque, resting on an oval slab, will be finally decided upon as the most appropriate design to commemorate the deeds of George Gipp. Cartier Field, the scene of Gipp’s many triumphs, will be the location for the plaque and when Notre Dame is hard pressed the players can glance for inspiration at the marble slab and come back upon the field with renewed vigor and fighting spirit.
Much of the ultimate future of this tribute to Gipp depended upon the success of the Monogram Dance. Realizing that the club is desirous of doing its bit for Notre Dame, one hundred and twenty couples attended the “Little Giants” dance Saturday night. The Monogram Club wish to thank the guests of that evening for their encouragement and help. The master violinist, “Perce” Connelly, led his “Big Five” Orchestra. The Wabash visitors, in addition to the local dance lovers, were highly complimentary to the colorful Mr. Connelly. As the Monogram Club will lose approximately twenty five members, through graduation, its ranks will be depleted somewhat next year but it is hoped that the sophomores will rise to the occasion and perform in a manner that will gain them the coveted emblem. The Monogram Formal, a success of the last spring social season, will be held again next May.

THE NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC
WITH THE CLUBMEN
HE MONOGRAM CLUB held a sprightly dance at the Tribune Building last Saturday night which ended altogether
too soon. Everyone seemed to be having a wonderful time and the concluding number at eleven thirty didn’t bring forth any outburst of joy. Pere Connelly’s Big Five orchestra played for the occasion. One Joe Hylan in the band surely did play the cornet as seldom is heard in these parts. He was great, to say the least. Coach Rockne was among the many present. No, he didn’t dance. Besides Mr. and Mrs. Rockne the patrons were Professor James E. McCarthy, Professor C. E. Manion and Professor William Benitz. Bert V. Dunne was chairman of the dance committee and had as his assistants Philip Mahoney, Paul Harrington and John Hamling.
—o—
The Scholarship Club’s dance of last Monday, held at the Palais Royale, was also a success. As usual a large crowd turned out for the hop and most of it was composed of young ladies. But the Palais Royale isn’t so small and accommodated the crowd very nicely.
—0—
The officers of the Scholarship Club, which holds these splendid dances so that the students may meet the better sort of South Bend girls and also finance worthy students at the University, are: Mrs. D. L. Guilfoyle, president; Mrs. John Worden, vice-president; Mrs. J. M. Cooney, second vice-president ; Mrs. Helman, secretary; and Mrs. H. J. Weber, treasurer.
—o—
The Villagers club for the Day Dodgers, was a busy organization the last few days. It turned out last Friday night and met the Wabash squad at the station giving the “Little Giants” a rousing welcome. Eddie Luther was in charge.
Tuesday night The Villagers held a banquet in the Rotary Room of the Oliver. Father Hugh O’Donnell and Father Holde-rith gave interesting talks. The proverbial banquet cigars were distributed and all the boys looked like honest-to-goodness politi
cians. (Whatever an honest-to-goodness politician is?)
—o—
The Toledo Club has presented Tipperary Terrence II. to the football squad. He looks a lot like the first dog the club presented. We’ll have to inquire of Ray Cunningham or John Hurley to see if this new Terry is a twin brother of the Terry that went to the Niles road once too often.
—o—
The New Jersey Club is the latest organization to join the campus clubs. Its officers for the year are, Tom Farrell, president; Jim Silver, vice-president; Eddie Duggan, treasurer; and Jake Purcell, secretary. All the members were introduced at the first meeting which was held last Tuesday. The club hopes to run a Christmas dance. Another meeting will be held this week.
—o—
The Cubs, formed by the Freshmen journalists of last year, are supposed to get together this week. We had no definite word about the meeting before press time, but we hope they do get started. It is the only way The Cubs will stick together since there is no journalism class for them this year. Last year, if we recall correctly, The Cubs managed to get several prominent newspaper men to address them.
—0—
The Minnesota Club held a meeting in the Law Building last Sunday morning. The boys from the Gopher state plan to make their club hum with activities.
o
The Metropolitan Club expects to hold a Christmas dance at one of the large New York hotels The only thing decided about the dance s > far is that it shall be formal.
The officers of the club for this year are, Joseph Burke, president; Jack Adams, vice-president; Bill Reid, treasurer; and Ed
Byrne, secretary.
o
The Indianapolis Club is to have a meeting this coming Sunday morning in the Law Building. Maurice “Sam” McNulty would like to have the members present by ten o’clock.

NEW FACULTY FACES
FACULTY changes were numerous during the summer vacation. In addition to those previously announced in the College of Law, the following were made:
Professor James E. McCarthy, formerly assistant dean of the College of Commerce, was appointed Dean relieving Father O’Hara who will give more time to his duties as Prefect of Religion. Fathers Cornelius Hagerty and McGinn are now of the Department of Philosophy, succeeding Fathers Cheverette and Lumbreras who did not return to the University.
Fathers Maher and McDonald, Mr. Augustine Confrey, brother of Professor Burton Confrey, Mr. Tunney, Mr. Philips, Mr. Brennan, Mr. Kolars, Mr. Koelsch and Mr. Cunningham were added to the faculty of the Department of English. The Department of Politics and Economics now has Father Francis Boland and Mr. Mark Nolan, and the Department of Romance Languages, Mr. Provost and Mr. Endress. Father Ryan is now assisting in the Department of History.
Fathers Walter O’Donnell, Davis and Doremus are among the missing this year; they have been added to the faculty of Columbia University, Portland, Oregon. Father Foik went to St. Edward’s, Austin, Texas, to build up the Library there, and Father Broughall succeeded him at Notre Dame as librarian.
MORE PEP!
About half the boys showed up for the Wabash pep meeting in the gym last Friday noon. The results however seemed not so bad, and from the Wabash viewpoint it was lucky the whole gang didn’t turn out. Those who were there seemed in earnest and the quality made up for the quantity. New cheers, featuring the chant song and the “Fight, Irish, Fight” yell, were practiced and the “Hike Song” came in for attention and much enthusiasm. Those who were at the game Saturday and heard the new achievements from the West stands reported very favorably on all except the volume. This
was due in part to the slim attendance at .the pep meeting and in part to the unfortunate mixture of students and outsiders in the East stands. Cheering sections are no exception to the old rule of ‘divided we fall.’
PACIFIC MEN PLAN POW-WOWS
“You men are bound together by the bonds	j
of distance,” said Judge Wooten, Honorary President of the Pacific Coast Club at its premier dinner of the year, September the 27th. The man who fought the Anti-Catholic school bill in Oregon, and who was acclaimed by the Knights of Columbus of Ore-	<
gon and Washington as a “true Catholic crusader,” augmented his remarks with a cursory survey of the accomplishments of Notre Dame men in the west. Father Kerndt Healy and Dr. John A. Stoeckley exchanged sparkling satire.	'
The Doctor was the essence of ease as with brisk remarks from his unlimited repertoire, he drew a fanciful picture of the rise of the “stalwart men from the waste spaces!” John Kilkenny acted as toastmaster and welcomed the Freshmen.	1
The objects of the club are: (1) to boost
Notre Dame in the West; (2) To provide entertainment and amusement for the members, (3) To hold the men from the West together.	,
The Pacific Coast “Pow-Wows” will be held Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter and the club will have an outing at Diamond Lake the last week in May. The goal of the club is one hundred members and the new men imbued with enthusiasm are working	1
hard to achieve this end.	j

TALES OF THE DAY DOGS
The Day Dogs frisk in their first bow wow of the season when Fr. George Holder-ith’s orphans gather for their first smoker of the year on October 21, in St. Joseph’s Hall, Hill and Lasalle St. The Rev George McNamara will speak and other interesting features will be presented. '
—o—
Congratulations to Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Murphy on their latest addition to the family. Murphy, who rejoices in day dodging, is a senior in the Law school and a graduate of the Commerce department.
—o—
Pete LaCava, tenor and former member of the Notre Dame Glee club, who recently sang over radio, will again entertain over WGAZ on October 20. Hartford, Conn, please note!
—o—
The presence of “Chief” an Indian of unknown quality, whose surname is generally a puzzle even to his own teammates, is giving a warlike appearance to the Day Dog eleven. “Chief” is a fullback.
Everybody is tending to business this week, so news of the Day Dogs is scarce.
—o—
Referees and cheerleaders do not appear to be exempt from injuries, judging from the misfortunes of gridiron warfare. An official in the Notre Dame-Lombard contest was scarred, and Millard, Princeton cheerleader, threw his arm out while leading his rooters in “The Old Nassau Song.”
Be careful, Eddie!
FRIDAY NIGHT HOMECOMING CELEBRATION
It is important that Homecoming visitors arrive in South Bend early Friday evening. Because of the fact that Saturday is a holyday, the most important part of the Homecoming celebration must he held Friday night. Pass this information to your friends.
THE DOME OF ’25
y OW is the time for all good men to I \| come to the aid of their Dome”
Again the insistent plea for cooperation from the student body of the University, emanates from the Dome office, “in the rear of Corby Hall,” and judging from the large number of Seniors who have responded to the entreaties of the staff and presented themselves in the K. of C. chambers for portraits, this cooperation is not lacking from that source, at least.
The fact that the engagement of the photographer is limited to two weeks is largely responsible for the unusually prompt response from the Seniors. In securing the K. of C. Chambers for the purpose, the Dome staff agreed to vacate the chambers by Friday, October 17. The excellent reputation, gained by the Russell Studio by its work on the Dome of 1924 is also a contributing factor in the success of the work this year. “Rudy” Madlener, the genial photographer who made his presence felt on the campus early last year in the same work, has been secured by the staff of the Dome of ’25 and is living up to his previously earned reputation of “painless photography.”
That section of the Dome of ’25, devoted to the Junior class is already well under way and it is hoped that the same spirit which, prompted the Seniors to turn out early fortheir pictures will be as pronounced in the: Class of ’26.
Freshmen and Sophomore representation will be more elaborate this year than in the-past and these classes will be assessed a. nominal fee for their representation.
All in all, a Dome is promised for this, year at least comparable to the Dome of 1924, published by the Scallan-Bartley Publishing company.

St. Joan of Arc, Pray for Us.
St. Joan of Arc, in whose purity and simplicity lay the strength that conquered armies, is chosen patroness of the Army game. You will find her medal at the pamphlet rack, and if you love your team you will invoke her aid on Saturday afternoon. Last year St. Joan led Notre Dame to victory while Elsie Janis led the Army to defeat.

The Penitential Year.
The current scholastic year at Notre Dame has been set apart as a penitential year. The following year will be called a Eucharistic year. By penance and devotion to the Blessed Sacrament Notre Dame expects to train Notre Dame men to appreciate the honor that comes to the United States when the Eucharistic Congress comes to Chicago in 1926.
ITTmt Penance Means.
“Unless you do penance you shall all likewise perish.” The words of Our Lord are painfully direct: they promise hell to those who do no penance. Penance is the antithesis of comfort, and comfoit is the ne plus .ultra of American life.
* * *
“You Call Yourselves Christians”
A Christian is a follower of Christ, Who said: “If any man will come after Me, let him take up his cross daily and follow Me.” It’s a queer little cross that most of us carry, and it’s a queer little crown that most of us wear, if we are lucky enough to be with the crowned heads for all eternity.
If you are a man, bear a man’s-size cross, and don’t protect your shoulder with a cushion. Sacrifice softens the heart and hardens the backbone: comfort softens the backbone and hardens the heart.
Your Penance.
You are left to your own devices in choosing your penance for the year, but you are offered the following suggestions:
1.	Accept trials patiently. Crosses of God’s choosing are better than those of your own choosing.
2.	Wash your face when you fast. Don’t advertise to the world that you are another St. Anthony of Egypt.
3.	Stick. Don’t let a day pass without something worth while. Recall the parable of the devil who came back on the off-day with seven devils worse than himself.

MUSICAL NOTES
THE Band made its second appearance of the year at the Wabash game Saturday afternoon. Notre Dame can certainly be proud of the organization. The impression made by it, marching down the. field after the game, was one of the highlights of Saturday afternoon. There should be more opportunities for the appearance of the Band on the campus. Saturdays are too few and far between.
—o—
The Glee Club has been rehearsing daily since the try-outs last week. The stage in Washington Hall was the favored place for the noon time sings, until Brother Cyprian discovered that the cigarette evil had broken out among the amateur Carusos. They can now be found in the band room over Music Hall at any time.
New uniforms have been ordered for the men who have entered the Band this Fall.. There will be about twelve or fifteen new members to be equipped. In the meantime, they march in mere civilian clothes behind their more fortunate brothers.
—o—
The University Orchestra, under the direction of Dr. Browne, has begun work upon the program which will be presented this year. The concerts given by the organization upon the campus will commence during the second semester. As the group appeared very few times last year, the news of their frequent concerts this year will be greeted with pleasure.
—o—
The ‘Powers that be’ of the Glee Club wish it known that they will consider the applications of any of the city clubs on the campus to have the Glee Club appear in their respective cities during the Spring tour. Those interested should see Victor Lemmer, Badin Hall, or Frank Howland, Corby Hall.
“TAG” THE BAND TO WISCONSIN!
VILLAGERS GIVE DANCE FRIDAY NIGHT
The Villagers will give one of the season’s most interesting football dances tonight at the Elks Temple, according to plans announced this week by officers of the club. This dance will take the place of the Saturday night dance, and memories of past Villager dances promise an attractive evening. Arrangements of the committees in charge include the securing of Harry Denny’s Collegians, with a program especially arranged for the occasion.
The extensive preparations for this preArmy football dance should insure its success from a social, and entertaining standpoint. Tickets are on sale in all the halls, although a limited number will be sold at the door. For ready reference—The Villagers Football Dance, Friday night, Harry Denny’s Collegians, the Elks Temple (next to the Tribune).
A list of the patrons and patronesses follows: Mr. and Mrs. Harry J. Walters, Mr. and Mrs. J. Studebaker, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Hering, Mr. and Mrs. N. R. Feltes, Mr. and Mrs. D. J. Kelly, Dean and Mrs. Konop.
The committees in charge of the dance are: Dance—Edmund DeClercq, chairman, Ernest Wilhelm, Edward Alhering, Seymour Weisberger, George Farage. Music —Fred House, Edmund Luther, Clarence Harding, Wilfred Walz, William Reasor, John Stoeckley. Decoration—Walter Condon, chairman; John Prince, Howard Scanlon, Alvin Travis, Lester Wolf, William Braunsdorf, Sidney Eder, Joseph P. Miller. Tickets—Arthur Scheer, chairman; Thomas Hogan, Charles Baumgartner, Michael Nyi-kos, Eugene Knoblock, and Daniel Kelly.
Notice the sad and discouraged looks on some of the seniors’ faces? It is due to the severest blow a college man can get—the proofs from that Dome picture. They shatter the mind picture of suavity, intelligence and culture that the senior has and shows him to be—himself. But, boys, if “Rudy” can’t make you an Apollo, no one else ever will!
44	THE NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC
Simon Legree never won a popularity contest. And he died before he intended to. Last week, we urged the contribution of news, features, etc., from the campus at large. But when we opened our door mornings there was no influx of high-piled copy to overwhelm us with joy. The result has been such a continuous hounding of the overworked staff that Simon and his untimely end are commencing to be our bete 'noire. But we have solved the problem of the scarcity of copy. Contributors don’t know where the office is. Which is natural—we haven’t one. But by the time this reaches print, The Scholastic will be established in some corner of the Corby rec. room. So just bring your delayed features up to date and call on us there. As K. C. B. so optimistically remarks, ‘we thank you.’

BOY-MEN OPEN NEW HOME
Graduate House takes its place among the Campus “halls of exiled men.” After renovation and redecoration, the two-story frame structure, situated on the Eddy street road just across from Freshman Hall, is serving as a residence for the graduate students in the Boy Guidance Department.
There are men from many schools living there. They have come from Georgetown, Boston College, Catholic University, Villanova, Marquette, St. Francis Xavier in Nova Scotia, and from other places. Seven of the Boy Guidance students are from Canada; and all of these seven are accomplished hockey players. Thomas Murphy was captain of the Boston College basketball team last year, and played football too. John Connolly played football and basketball at Georgetown and Eugene McVeigh basketball at Rennselaer Poly, Buffalo, New York.
They say that they are to enter a basketball team in the Interhall league, which from present reports, is not the most cheerful of news for the other teams concerned.

FIGHT ’EM, GANG!	“CHECKING UP.”
The leaving of the Varsity for games away from home recalls some conditions of last year when the team left for Nebraska. Almost unaccompanied, the men who made the Army, Princeton, and Georgia Tech bow low to the supremacy of their fighting spirit, slipped away to another victory—or so it was taken for granted at . the time. There was no demonstration, organized or unorganized, no lusty slap on the back, no “Go in and get ’em, Old Man” to make that team come home a victor.
Unquestionably something was absent from the Campus at this time last year, even though the football season was in full swing. At Homecoming the spirit was dead; the cheering was flat; and the demonstration was totally a Freshman Hall affair, with a few high school boys along the line to fill in. This lethargy was climaxed when the team left for Lincoln without a treaty signed and sealed with the “gang” back home.
The time was when professors had to enjoin their students not to write every assignment about the ’’Notre Dame Spirit.” At the rate of depreciation last year, the professors will soon be handing out assignments to look up references upon that subject.
The team left today—as it will leave on other Saturdays—to fight on foreign fields with mighty foes. On such occasions get out and pep it up a bit! Pass the old spirit along! It’s catching. Silence never made that team hold on the one-yard line. “Hunk” Anderson used to say—“I’ll do the best we can,” and he meant it because he had pledged his best to the gang back home. Fight ’em, gang! -	—A. A. S.
When the average Senior has settled his “credits required for graduation” and has begun to worry about his thesis there comes a time of introspection. He weighs his college career and finds, invariably, that if he were beginning all over quite a bit of the scheme would be different.
What have the four years accomplished? Generally they have added polish. He speaks easier. He has a certain air of self-assurance. His taste in clothes is improved. Perhaps he is a little more cultured. But these are surface things. What are his thoughts regarding his studies? He realizes that the knowledge he has hastily scanned is infinitely greater than the things that he has actually learned. It is mostly on account of the studies that he would like to begin all over.
However, Mr. Average Senior has a consoling thought—somewhere he has heard that “associations are ninety per cent of a college education.” In this course he feels he has earned a mark of at least eighty-nine.
And activities. Because he is a senior and a fail’ representative of the class he has been popular and capable enough to be sought after in this field. He realizes, almost too late, that these things called “activities” have stolen time at college that cannot be made up later on.
Now it is the last year. Time still remains to be a student, in the true sense of the word. Our senior resolves to start this very night on his neglected books.
“The bill at the Palace is fair,” he remarks to his room-mate next morning.

THE LATEST PROBLEM
The Nem SCHOLASTIC has made its first appearance on the campus and has been received with some slight signs of approval. A word, however, about the unpopular subject of finance for the new-born babe. Unfortunately for the business staff, paper and ink and all that sort of thing which go into our SCHOLASTIC, must be bought and paid for with money.
The subscription list of the SCHOLASTIC does not include names of all the men on the campus or in town. In fact, and to be frank about it, only about one half of the prospective customers have signed a subscription blank. The staff is trying to make the SCHOLASTIC a real magazine—paper stock and all mechanical equipment used is of the best—but if the editor is to stave off gray hair a little longer, some more of the boys will have to inquire about a place to deposit their two dollars.
The editors are working overtime burning Father O’Malley’s midnight electricity in an attempt to make the contents interesting reading. An endeavor will be made shortly to dig up the latent literary talent which should exist in the student body; everything is being done to produce a magazine of distinction and interest—but the subscription list must be doubled.
WHO DISCOVERED AMERICA?
Four hundred and thirty-two years ago Columbus discovered this hemisphere. Since the day he returned to Spain to announce to Queen Isabella that he had navigated the unchartered seas for seventy-one days and found a new route to the Indies, Columbus always has been recognized as the discoverer of America.
It is true that long before Columbus, Her-julfson, an Icelander sailing from Greenland in 986, was driven accidentally by a storm to the shores of America; and it is also true
that Lief Erickson, his two brothers, Thor-wald and Thorstein, and later Thorium Karl-sefne, all Greenlanders, had voyage to this continent. But nothing resulted from their visits, and in time their accounts of having* seen a new land were wholly forgotten. Columbus, however, persisted four times in retracing his route to the new world. The discoveries which followed by other navigators like Amerigo Vespucci, John and Sebastian Cabot, and Ponce de Leon were made directly possible only by the early discoveries of Columbus. Undoubtedly, with the progress of science and civilization the Americas would have been discovered even had there been no Columbus; but there was a Columbus, and to him is due the credit of discovery.
At present, throughout the country, there is an anti-Catholic movement on foot to snatch these laurels from Columbus. Efforts are also being made by the antagonists of Catholicism to change the history text-books, wherein Columbus is credited with the discovery of America, and to ascribe this feat to some of the earlier navigators who never really contributed any valuable information about the new land. In many cities, this past week, advertisements and bulletins stated that banks and public buildings would be closed, not on Columbus Day, as the twelfth of October always has been called in America, but on “Discovery Day.” This is apparently another manifestation of religious prejudice, an effort to discredit the-discovery of the great Catholic Genoese sailor.
The traditions and facts upon which this country have been built are too sacred to be disparaged and discarded with any and every whim of bigotry. Unless the real Americans, the broad-minded and educated non-Cath-olic citizens and the Catholics, who profess the same creed that Columbus professed, get together quickly to counteract this movement, the kluxers and others who nurse religious hatreds will be finding the school books which our grand-children will use with all sorts of propaganda. They may even set forth that on one bright afternoon a certain Imperial Kleagel began an aeroplane flight across the ocean from Europe and first spied the continent of America.	—R. c. c.

THE ACE OF HEARTS
F. C. MILLER.
THE landlady did not trust her room renters. She regarded them as mere commercial assets; she looked upon them much as the cabby looks upon his “fares,” as units of profit only. They were things that lived in her rooms, paid (sometimes) their rent, dropped cigarette butts on the carpet,- muddled the floor with Sunday papers; things that left great soap rings on the. bathtub, which they did not take the trouble to wash away.
But Mrs. Tinfield did not feel that way towards Randie Steward. Steward was entirely different. Mrs. Tinfield was satisfied with his smile and his smooth conversational qualities, even if his rent was always two weeks late in coming and sometimes not forthcoming at all.
Had Mrs. Tinfield fallen in love with Steward?
The roomers had their own opinion about this. Some thought she had; others were doubtful; some few knowing ones said she was too old to fall in love and was merely infatuated with the freshness and vigor of Mr. Steward’s personality.
Steward was youthful looking, it is true; but he lacked the essence of youthfulness in one respect—years had piled up forty on him. He had arrived at “prime” unexpectedly and he never fully recovered,—never. Steward had more hair than the average man of forty. His hair was jet black, rather thick, and withal, very bushy, suggesting the back of a wet scrub brush.
On cold mornings Mrs. Tinfield would solicitously knock at Steward’s door and, hearing his brusk, “Come in!” she would push half of her rather fat and matronly body through the doorway and say: “Will you have a cup of hot tea this morning, Mr. Steward? I’m sure it will warm your bones on the way to the restaurant.”
It had become an automatic formula. She would smile an ear-tickling smile and he would merely mumble. “Yes, I will. Thanks awfully.”
Whereupon she would retreat down the stairs and shortly thereafter reappear with
47
a steaming and aromatic cup of tea, arousing the chagrin and animosity of the balance of the roomers for the rest of the day. That made the “prompt payments” angry, and justly, at that.
No one ever knew exactly, or dared to guess publicly, what Mr. Steward’s business was. But it was generally, though silently, known that he was a gambler. This they carefully deduced from the following facts:
He wore stylish but rather “loud” clothes and cravats; which characteristic, according to our best fiction authorities and caricaturists, is the unfailing signature of “the dealer in luck.”
He had large quantities of money at one time and suspiciously small quantities very shortly afterwards.
He said very little, shaved every day, smoked stogies, and put bandoline on his hair.	'
If Mrs. Tinfield knew of his dubious profession she did not give sign of it, being perhaps, transported into a moral dreamland by the personality of the suspect.
Early fall came on. The trees were turning yellow in the cool air. Evidences that Nature was slowly turning off her radiator were appearing. The roomers in Mrs. Tin-field’s rooming house on McFadden street, Marionette, Missouri, were beginning to blow their noses frequently, to become irri tated easily.
The brisk change of the season was unkind to Mr. S teward. His handsomeness, so carefully preserved for forty years, now crumbled rapidly. His ruddy, rather dark face became paler when the autumnal winds should have deepened it. He was nervous; he frequented little the precincts of the living room. Something was changing Mr. Steward’s life. The boarders paused just long enough in their own thoughts to remark about it.
Did anyone detect a tear in Mrs. Tin-field’s eye?
The days got colder and Mr. Steward appeared less and less among his fellow-roomers. When he did take part in the evening “confab” he said even less than usual (which was very little), and would excuse himself almost immediately, and betake himself

unto the dark streets. Mrs. Tinfield’s eyes followed him almost constantly.
It grew colder. It was almost cold enough for Mrs. Tinfield to begin taking morningtea to Steward.—Almost.
Meanwhile Steward became more palid. And he never “flashed” a bill; and what was more, his clothes were becoming rather frayed. Had any of the boarders occasion to notice any worn places in the perfect apparel of the gambler? No, not before, but now. The worn places were many and evident. They were amazed. He owed, it was noised about, two month’s rent. He had never let it go more than two weeks before.
One Monday morning it turned bitter cold, the first biting day of autumn. Mrs. Tinfield ceremoniously prepared for the rite of serving Steward his warm tea. Though he had not paid his room rent for two months (an unheard of laxity in the Tinfield regime), she still harbored her hopes. Love is a strong thing. She climbed the stairs this Monday morning, somewhat elated that she could again render her admiring service.
She tremblingly knocked on Steward’s door. There was no answer. Perhaps he had not yet arisen. He always arose at 7:30 and it was now 7:40. But no matter, she would wait.
Promptly at eight o’clock she again rapped on the panels of Steward’s door. Her repeated poundings brought no answer, and the tea was fast brewing to tremendous strength. Even love is not long blind. She drew her master key and opened the door. The room was empty, the bed untenanted and unmussed. The clothes closet was wide open and empty, the old-fashioned bureau was dementedly void, crazy with its own yawning drawers, which had for so long held Mr. Steward’s immaculate linens.
Mrs. Tinfield gave a cry, a cry half of grief and half of anger. Her quarry had fled. She went frenziedly from one object to another, touching them. Yes, there were tears in her eyes. Whether they were tears of sorrow for the two months’ rent, now lost, or tears of mortification because the object of her love had taken leave, it is hard to say. Nevertheless, there were tears. '
The boarders came, one by one, and looked
in through the open door. They nodded to each other, smiled sardonic, half-meaning smiles, as they saw Mrs. Tinfield perched on the side of the bed gazing gloomily into space.
But Mrs. Tinfield was a practical person. In fifteen minutes she had placed a placard in the window reading: “Room for Rent.”
That afternoon as she was re-arranging the bureau she espied a note addressed to “Mrs. Tinfield” in Steward’s small, fanciful hand. She tore open the note. The ace of hearts fell to the floor.
The note read:
Dear Mrs. Tinfield:
To those whom fate has destined to be unlucky life deals very cross-cut hands. I am one of these. If I have dared to love you it was because my passion was beyond my control. I owe you money. Luck has run against me lately and I am seeking new fields. Someday I shall repay you. Meanwhile, though I have never told you, I am pledging my faith with this ace of hearts, which some day, I hope to redeem.
Faithfully,
-	Steward.
Mrs. Tinfield did a funny thing. She tore the note and the ace of hearts into very small pieces and slowly let them flutter into the dust pan, gazing at them as one dying observes a last snowfall.
The Scholastic was all set to put out an extra edition last week when fire threatened to destroy Walsh Hall (all fires threaten to destroy in print.) But the insomnia of certain Badinites spoiled the story. Rushing over to the wastepaper room, the scene of the conflagration (fire), they deprived the fire department of possible glory by scattering the flames to harmless proportions and then putting them out. The fire department did finally succeed in making the detours and pulled up in time to find that they weren’t needed. One of the boys on the fourth floor said he didn’t get up because he thought it was only Father Haggerty making it hot for a late arrival.

THEATRE NEWS
No matter in what direction a man standing at the North Pole may turn, he will always be facing due South; This highly startling situation is comparable to that of the theatrical critic, who, no matter what he says of a show, must face the slings and arrows of an outraged clientele. For instance there were even those who strongly advised severe criticism of “Runnin’ Wild,” the Negro show which last week stopped over in South Bend. Most of us who went to the Oliver during the three-day engagement of this piece expected to see a show with good dancing, a torrid orchestra, and capable singers of the Ethiopian classics. In no respect were we disappointed.
There has of late been a bumper crop of good moving pictures. The Palace last week, for instance, showed “Bread,” the screen version of Charles Norris’ novel of that name. This interesting picture contained real comedy and a probable plot, a rare combination, even in this enlightened age. “Bread” was very good.
Mae Busch and Robert Frazer, the stars of “Bread” were engaged all week in ruinous competition with themselves across the street. The Orpheum showed this same pair, along with eight other screen notables, in “Broken Barriers,” a highly entertaining picture. In this story the heroine is tempted to defy convention, in the usual way, of course. Does she do it? Certainly not.
In response to the highly enthusiastic advertising of the Blackstone, we went to see “Feet of Clay,” another expensive production of Cecil De Mille. This picture wanders from the beaten path of moving picture plots, with very gratifying results. The conclusion of “Feet of Clay” is particularly striking.
Harry Carey at the Palace in “Tiger
Thompson,” kept up his perfect record by again overwhelming the forces of evil with almost ridiculous ease. At the Oliver, Douglas MacLean in “Never Say Die,” added another to his long series of winners. This picture, the story of which is taken from Willie Collier’s famous stage success, only establishes MacLean more firmly as our leading light comedian of the screen. “Her Love Story,” with Gloria Swanson, at the Blackstone, and “A Night in Rome,” at the Palace, both started out rather well, but fell into a painful limp before the final fade-out.
The Palace vaudeville, since our last re-, view, just about deserves a passing grade. “Snub” Pollard, of moving picture fame, was hailed last week as the main attraction, and he did very well with a mediocre act. The comedy had very little of the subtle about it, several times becoming to cumbrous as to resemble an attempt to tickle a person with the blunt edge of a shovel. There were, however, some good, old-fashioned laughs in Pollard’s skit. Bessie Barriscale, in “Scrub-bie,” was the headliner of the succeeding show. Her act, aided and abetted by the famous Barriscale knack of putting a thing over, was well received by the cash customers. Of this week’s bill Jean Boydell and Footlight Fantasies received the most applause. In this case, such popularity was deserved.
“The Arab,” Rex Ingram’s latest opus, is now being shown at the Oliver. That highly comely and wholly efficient pair, Alice Terry and Ramon Novarro, are playing the leading roles. “The Arab,” is a good picture.
On Sunday, Oct. 19, Monte Blue and Viola Dana in “The Revelation,” will come to the Oliver for a four day run, followed by a three day engagement of “Shuffle Along.”

ADVENTURES IN BOHEMIA
J. F. STOECKLEY.
I HAD blundered into one of those little Italian wine-shops that may be found along the smaller streets of Pisa. It was a good turn that my wandering instincts had done me, for the wine seemed to be of a remarkable vintage and its price was ridiculously low. As I poured the last few drops of my first bottle into the quaint glass I became aware that in the usual crowd of middle-class Italians there sat an Englishman of unusual appearance. Something about the man was familiar. Perhaps, I told myself, it is only the wine.
The eyes of this friend (for I now had classified him as someone I had met somewhere under pleasant circumstances) were most extraordinary. They burned in sunken cheeks with a dull splendor. The man was slight in frame and somewhat unkempt in the way he wore his tousled hair, a mass of black locks streaked with gray. He affected no tie, and wore some sort of a velvet jacket. His manner was at times impetuous, but always preoccupied. This I observed from my place some three tables away. Finally I could overcome my impulse no longer; I went over to his table and asked permission to sit with him.
The melancholy eyes brightened momentarily. With a half-smile he expressed, in excellent English, his pleasure—if I would be so good as to honor him. Neither of us spoke until Guiseppi appeared with some of the best wine his humble shop boasted, for I saw the folly of bandying pleasantries with my strange acquaintance.
“You are an American seeking Bohemia?,” his delicate lips formed.
“Happiness is always elsewhere when one is misunderstood,” I volunteered, partly as information, partly as my philosophy. The talk and the wine moved slowly. We spoke of Italy, its political upheaval, the unrest of the people. My friend spoke bitterly of a doctrine he had once believed—that the people could overthrow tyranny if they would. The talk had a familiar ring to it; I had read those ideas somewhere. Those eyes—his expression—I had seen them before.
“Shelley,” I cried.
“So you are acquainted with my name,” the gentleman answered. And because of the wine, or the atmosphere of the place, neither one of us paid any more attention to names, but went on with the discussion of freedom. Shelley, it seemed, was somewhat cynical. He had seen how the people ruled in Italy, once they had overthrown the tyrannical government. He spoke as one somewhat disillusioned. He had seen America, he told me, but he had seen too much of it. The wretchedness, the hate, the scheming, the intrigues of Europe, all these things he had found in America, the one place he thought free from the sins of older nations.
“Human nature,” I reminded him through the glow of the wine, “is the same all over the world.”
Shelley agreed that the evil aspects of human nature were universal, but admitted that he was still a bit of an idealist. The spirit of man, he confided, yet soared above the clouds, separating itself from its bodily limitations. Poetry of thought still lived. Literature was in the past... poetry... few wrote it nowadays. Free verse was madness. It was liberty turned to license. In that man had retrogressed. But because man had a soul and the love of music within him the rhythm and regular cadence of poetry were sure to return. Even now the trend was toward the romantic. Mad youth would learn its lesson in time to go back to the classic muses. The turning from the ancients was deplorable but inevitable. It was but a part of the cycle. Soon the cycle would repeat itself...
The talk drifted to many things even as the low lights took on a dimmer glow. Our cigarettes were about exhausted when the talk turned to a broad view of man and his civilization. Civilization, I averred, had advanced greatly in the last century. Shelley believed that mechanically the progress of man had been great, but he felt that in matters of thought little had been accomplished. The inventions that had been made tended toward convenience'and labor-saving—they left man with more time for things of the intellect, but they also fostered his natural laziness. Philosophy had become more skep

tical, leaving the logical man with the conclusion that it is snesible to deny everything but the tenets of Scholasticism.
Beautiy... there was beauty in wine, I remember saying... too much attention paid now to the artificial... only phrases linger in my memory... man creates his beauty in physical things... there is no consideration of the spirit of things... the stage... a spectacle of gowns and lights... the lines are nothing... personalities carry a play... war... a necessary evil... the World War... a step toward human advancement... “uneasy rests the head that wears a crown”... painting... the moderns are hideous... yet they are striving... striving... man is constantly striving for better things... opto-mistaic talk... a new era... must come... like the dawn... which comes now... “my quarters”... I would be delighted...

I awoke in a quaint little garret with the warm sun of an Italian noon in my face. At a table a rather gaunt man of forty sat writing. He turned as I moved and smiled pleasantly.
“You’ll pardon me but I have a class to prepare for this afternoon,” he said in an explanatory way.
I must have appeared puzzled for he continued :
“I thuoght that you knew me last night. Perhaps you have forgotten. I am Shelley Marmount, teaching English literature at the University of Pisa. Last evening, I assure you, was one of the most pleasant I have spent in years. Your company was delightful. Let me urge you to sleep longer if you will.”
And as I turned my face to the pillow I murmured softly—“Shelley... Shelley... ”

BUCKEYES SHOWING SPIRIT
The election of officers was the point of interest at a meeting of the Ohio Club, held last week. Wm. Krider, Canton, Ohio, was unanimously elected president; F. Steel, of Akron, Ohio, was elected vice-president, while the offices of treasurer and secretary went to Gerald Miller, Defiance, and John Hurley, Toledo.
An ingenious plan for Homecoming was laid before the Club. All guests from Ohio will be met at the various stations and escorted to their hotels. This will be in conjunction with the Blue Circle’s reception committee which will do away with the necessity of the club maintaining its own reception booth. The Ohio contingent at the University will be distinguished by the wearing of some badge or insignia characteristic of its state.
It is the wish of the officers of the club that any student from Ohio who was not present at the last meeting, hand his name to F. Steel, Sorin Sub., as soon as possible, in order that every Ohio man on the campus will be available for this occasion. The Homecoming committee will be announced in the near future.
STUDENT TRIP
Only five hundred game tickets are available. Each will be sold with a railroad ticket. The total cost is $12. Pullman fares are extra—lower berth, $3.75; upper, S3; drawing room, $13.50.
The train will leave South Bend at 11 P. M. Friday and arrive at 7:30 A. M. in Madison. There will be a student parade through the main streets of Madison immediately after the arrival.
Seats will go on sale Monday, October 20th, in the Gym, from 3 to 5. The sale will last until all the tickets are sold.

In accordance with the law school tredi-tion started in nineteen sixteen, the Senior lawyers are now appearing with canes. This feature up until a year ago was exclusively worn by law men.
A smoker for the pre-law men will be given some time next week. The purpose of this affair is to acquaint the ambroy lawyers with the law faculty as well as with each other. Dean Konop will speak on their future work in the law school, and prominent members of the senior class will also talk. The place and time of this smoker will be announced later.
Toward the end of this month the Law Club will give a smoker for its members. Extensive plans are being laid for this as it will be the only social affair of the club until after Christmas.
The installation of a telephone booth has been promised the law school now that the new switchboard is working.
DEATH REVEALS SAD CASE
John O’Rourke, 70, dropped dead of heart disease in front of the Notre Dame postoffice at 7:15 Thursday morning. Many people witnessed the aged man’s collapse and Father Hugh O’Donnell reached him in time to administer the last rites of the Church.
O’Rourke was a graduate of Notre Dame, class of ’77, of good family, and a brilliant student in his earlier days. After leaving school he went to his home in Pittsburgh where his early career was reported as very successful. Misfortunes came and he returned to Notre Dame. He was employed at Saint Mary’s first, later at the University. More recently he has been living east of the campus where he owned a little property.
Only by the accident of his death does the tragedy of O’Rourke’s life come to light. For years he was “one of the janitors.” How truly Shakespeare spoke when he said, “............There’s	no art

In making up this page of exchanges every week we will attempt to get away from the accepted form of exchange department, which is merely to comment on the general form of contemporary publications. In this first appearance, and more so in subsequent issues, it will be attempted to blend together with our comment, examples and extracts from contemporary college writers, and in this way provide a more interesting section.
There is a consistent tendency among college magazines to loosen up on the old cut and dried system of following the deep and scholarly type of material in literary and news publications. Especially is this true in regard to the presentation of short-stories and commentative essays. The “duty” type of essay, very strained in literary form and propped up with expressionless, eaborlate diction, is fast disappearing from our exchanges, supplanted by the more conservative and lighter type, which is better fitted to be read by the student body, and surely more digestible.
The “Viatorian,” an old and honored literary publication of St. Viator College, breaks into its forty-second volume at the beginning of this year. The “Viatorian” has for many years set a high standard of Catholic literary attainment in sectarian colleges. '
The “Messenger” of St. Mary’s College and Academy, Monroe, Michigan, represents a collection of original and very excellent literary talent. The poetry of the book is extraordinary, both in scope and form.
Among the outstanding college monthlies received, is that of Duquesne University, Pittsburgh. Essays on political science, etc., show a great deal of thought and ability.
“The Holy Cross Purple,” one of the most perfectly printed literary monthlies we receive, is published by Holy Cross College, Worcester, Mass. Last year’s numbers contained some excellent essays on Frederick Ozanam.
The short-story section of the “Purple” is particularly well done, as is also a complete athletic department, which covers the activities of all Holy Cross athletic teams.
Gerald Sullivan is one of the budding poets writing for the “Ozanam,” published by St. John’s College, Toledo, Ohio. |The beauty of his form in verse can be seen from this single stanza from “Antique”:
The house is old-fashioned, Decrepit, forlorn;
Its windows are broken;
The shingles are torn
From its woe-begone roof.
The general style of the book is artistic. It shows careful planning and a knowledge of the science of organizing a magazine properly. An old grad department is very good in the “Ozanam.”

“The Saint Xavier’s Journal,” continues to be a book of strong literary traditions. Their collection of humor makes it almost an exclusively humorous magazine.

And Now—Beat Army!
Sluggish temperature accounted for the listless game and poor showing made by Notre Dame against the “Little Giants,” despite a score of 34 to 0. Saturday was not a “football day” and outside of an occasional brilliant play there was not that spirit and dash of a Notre Dame team in action. The occasional flashes of the game came when Jimmy Crowley circled the end for a pretty run, when Doc Connell ploughed off tackle with four or five Wabash tacklers with him, or when Elmer Layden sneaked through for
five or punted a beautiful spiral seventyyards down the field. The “Little Giants” were veritable giants on the defense and they put up such a stubborn offense that it was not to be denied several times during the game. The Notre Dame line showed poorly when Wabash tacklers sifted through the line and nipped the runner before he had started. The line was overly eager and time and again drew penalties for five yards. Despite the apparent faults of the team in action Saturday they are to be discounted by the fact that the “master mind,” Rockne usually arranges a psychological set-back to the team before it journeys East.
Harry Stuhldreher made his first appearance of the season Saturday after being out of the line-up because of an injured shoulder. He showed his old-time form to the crowd which numbered about 13,000. Cerney and O’Boyle showed up well again after playing a brilliant game against Lombard. The first, second,, and third teams were seen in action, each scoring one or more touchdowns.
Notre Dame will face one of its hardest opponents next week when the team journeys to the polo grounds to face the Army. This week Rockne is giving the team intensive training and all practice is secret in preparation for the annual classic next Saturday. Sport writers and scouts declare the Army team of this year to be one of the greatest to represent the Military Academy. Rockne, the “magician,” as the Eastern critics acclaimed him last year, may have to open up the proverbial bag of tricks in

order to repeat the performance of last year when the Irish defeated the West Pointers 13 to 0. Garbisch, Woods, Farwick and Hewitt compose a big part of the “kick” in the Army mule and the new addition of Wilson, of Penn State fame, presents another problem for Rockne. Tiny Hewitt, all-American, was stopped last year inside his own redoubtable line and it is reported that Garbisch had his hands full with Adam Walsh last year.
Grantland Rice in “The Sportlight” says, “It is something along terrific lines to carry a football team unbeaten through a hard schedule. Injuries and ill-luck can change the tide of affairs in a flash. Notre Dame couldn’t do it. Out of all the many leading colleges only five could slip by without having at least one dent inserted in the system. It is a large assignment to get a team ready in early October, and still have it ready in late November. But this year that is just what Yale, Dartmouth, Army, Notre Dame, Michigan, Illinois, Princeton and the Navy must do—since they all go to battle Oct. 18 against high class opposition.
THE MOST FAMOUS COACH
Feg Murray in “Brooldyn Daily Eagle”
“Why is it that the coach of a little college of 2,300 students near South Bend, Ind., is one of the leading gridiron mentors in the country? The answer is Knute Rockne’s inventive mind, dynamic personality and psychology. Why is it that football fans and experts from almost the whole country flock to see Notre Dame play? Because the public is sure of being well entertained when it watches the light but fast Hosier team in action, because Rockne’s men are always springing something new and unexpected— because speed, cunning and aerial attacks feature Notre Dame’s play.
Knute Rockne, “the gridiron magician,” graduated from Notre Dame in 1913, and was assistant football coach to Harper until 1916, as well as track coach and professor of chemistry. While a student “Rock” had starred as an end, being one of the gamest and brainiest “good little men” that ever
“Jimmie” Croivley who starred against Wabash last Saturday.
played that position. Playing in the band and acting in dramatics were also sidelines of Knute’s while a student.
As head coach Rockne’s inventive mind sprang the famous Notre Dame shift which had the coaches and officials up in the air in 1921. That fall ten of the team’s regulars were disqualified for playing professional football, but, Rockne built up an entire new team the next year that, though composed mostly of sophomores,, had a wonderfully successful season. This was because the Rockne system starts as soon as the freshman enters. Last year I had the pleasure of seeing the fighting Irish beat the Army. The soldiers expected an aerial attack and were ready for it—but Rockne crossed them by sticking almost entirely to end runs and line plunges. Notre Dame has beaten the Army eight times, and played one tie game, out of nine contests!
Just one thing more about Coach Rockne— when his team lost to Nebraska last year he did not offer one single, solitary alibi. There’s a real man for you!
There’s a REAL MAN for you I”

The Princeton football team was outplayed last Saturday by Lehigh who held the Tiger men to a scoreless tie. The Tigers escaped defeat by a lucky break when a Lehigh man, who had crossed the goal line, was denied a touchdown for stepping out of bounds. Princeton’s attack was helpless against the Lehigh line. The Tigers showed a tendency to fumble.

Georgia Tech, which will be here for Homecoming, was held to a 7 to 7 deadlock by Florida last Saturday when the teams met at Atlanta. It was a big day for both teams as the governors of both states were in attendance at the game. This is the second year that the teams have battled to a 7 to 7 tie.

LAMB REPORTED OUT
Capt. Roy Lamb of Lombard may be out for the rest of the season. He was injured a week ago in the game against Notre Dame. It is probable that the shoulder injury he received has ended his collegiate football playing.
FROM FRANCE
The fame of Coach Knute K. Rockne and his football team has travelled far and wide. A clipping from the Paris Times tells the story of Rockne and his football hopes for the 1924 season. It stated that Rockne expected, to have a light line this year. It also told of the wonderful achievements of the' team in past years.
LIGHT HORSE HARRY WILSON WILL LEAD ARMY CHARGE AGAINST “FIGHTING IRISH”
GEORGE TREVOR.
(Brooklyn Daily Eagle.)
P WHERE the lordly Hudson twists, around the frowning foothills of majestic Storm King, Coach McEwan is
putting his Army football squad through its final paces prior to the clash with Knute Rockne’s Notre Dame wonder team at the Polo Grounds next Saturday. West Point has an old grudge to settle with “the fighting Irish,” wherefore the calcium searchlights are playing on “The Plains” as the boys in black and gold chase the eerie ghost ball hither and yon. Well, now that that is off our chest we feel better. Fancy stuff aside, that battle twixt the determined soldiers and the scrappy Harps from South Bend ought to be worth goin gmiles to see.
To use a mixed metaphor, the Army mule will be the under dog next Saturday. For some years now big, sluggish Army teams have approached the Notre Dame game with a false sense of complacency, only to be smeared all over the landscape by Rockne’s
THE NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC	59
lighter hustlers. Speed plus brains has beaten Army brawn time after time. While West Point’s burly team was thinking what to do, the Notre Dame outfit went and did it. The Irish beat the soldiers by outwitting them. Will history repeat itself?
When will West Point snap out of it? When will those in command abandon the ultra-conservative game, which was long Yale’s undoing, in favor of more modern methods. It was sad to see that sluggish, lumbering, Army eleven repeatedly outfoxed by Rockne’s lightning line shifts at Ebbets Field a year ago. Even Garbisch was lured away from the point of attack by Notre Dame’s deceptive thrusts. The South Bend •outfit is always an instrument of precision. Rockne’s pupils are drilled for months, until the timing of each play is perfect. No wonder the Army lads, whose time for practice is limited by military duties, find it hard to halt the Irish.
With Wilson at left half, Gilmore at right half, and Bill Wood at full, the Army is assured of a well-balanced backfield. Wood can punt with any man in the game, while Gilmore is a great defensive back and “takeout” man. Hewitt is available for heavy line smashing, while Schleiffer, a sn°.ed bov. be called upon for the wide sweeps at end. The Anny will be well advised to get away from the close-order attack, which has been a feature of previous campaigns against the Irish. It is a temptation to plug the close slants when one has such men as Farwick, Ellinger and Garbisch, but the temptation must be resisted.
Once more Anny must face Notre Dame’s vicious stabs off tackle, with Crowley, Miller and Layden carrying the ball. Rockne does not employ a line shift, but there is a deceptive jump-hop of the backfield, used in conjunction with an unbalanced line, which is very effective off tackle.
Rockne’s running plays are doubly effective because the threat of his famous forward pass hangs like the sword of Damocles over the heads of his rivals. Notre Dame’s opponents are continually in dread of this aerial attack. The Norwegian genius takes full advantage of this fear, to bluff
the pass frequently. Newspaper stories might give one the idea that the Notre Dame team plays nothing but “glorified basketball,” but the fact is that Rockne’s men do not use the pass as much as many other elevens. When Notre Dame does hurl the ball, however, it makes the passes work. Seldom do you see one of Rockne’s boys muff the oval. They handle the pigskin as deftly as though it were a baseball. Notre Dame’s attack, in short, is a judicious blend of aerial and rushing tactics. As such, it is a thing of beauty and joy forever to all but their opponents.
In Don Miller and Crowley Rockne has elusive, hard-hiting backs worthy of the great traditions established by Gipp, Brandy, Dorais, Mohardt, Desch, Castner and others too numerous to mention, as writers say when they can’t for the life of them think of any other names. We admit that we are in this category and apologized to the unnamed stars for their omission.
HALL LEAGUE PROGRESSING
The Inter-Hall League is now in its second week. Badin, Sophomore, Sorin and Walsh halls have each won one game. Walsh Hall defeated the Day Dodgers last week in a hard fought game. On Sunday morning, Sophomore - Hall triumphed over Carroll, and Badin Hall defeated the Day Dogs. It was the second defeat for the latter team. Brownson is the only team that has not yet played a game.
The standing of the teams follows:

tice field. Shaw, Reidy and Sullivan, backfield men for the Sophs, were big factors in • the victory. The Sophomore line showed up well on both defense and offense. The only score made by Carroll came in the second quarter when LaVelle drop kicked the pigskin over the Sophomore goal from the 35 yard line. It was a pretty kick. Carroll put up a good fight but the superior strength of the Sophs was too much for them.
BADIN 7, DAY DOGS 0
The Day Dogs were defeated for the second time when Badin hall scored a touchdown in the second quarter of their game played on Brownson field, Sunday morning. Both teams fought hard and but for a lucky break for Badin hall it might have been a tie game. In the second quarter Cody, quarterback for Badin, threw a forward pass to one of his men behind the Day Dogs’ goal line scoring the only points of the game. The Day Dogs protested against the legality of the pass but their objections were overruled and Badin hall was given credit for the touchdown.
WALSH 8, DAY DOGS 0
Walsh hall scored a safety and a touchdown in a game with the Day Dodgers, last Tuesday afternoon, while the latter team went scoreless. In the first of the second period the Dodgers’ center threw the pig-sl“n over the full back’s head and the ball rolled behind the goal line. In the last quarter Walsh hall with superior playing scored the only touchdown of the game. Ed Walsh carried the ball over the line. Walsh attempted a drop kick for the extra point but
it was blocked.

BOXING	I

Coach Charlie Springer took eight of his men to Mishawaka last week where they performed at the Miami Country Club. Charle acted as referee for the bouts. The men gave good exhibitions and were highly complimented. Coach Springer was praised for the fine condition in which he had the men.
The first bout was between Guy Lorenger, and Dan Harvey. Both are in the bantam weight class. The second bout, between Ed Sherer and Ed Willoughby, ended in a comedy in which Springer, the referee, got the worst end. Manual Garcia, Philippine light weight, in the third bout showed a nice left hand against Benny DiPasquale, whol held the light weight High schoo championsip o fBuffalo. Pat Canny, middle weight Varsity man of last year, met Harry Ryan middle weight on the Penn state freshman team of last year, in the last bout of the night. It was a fast and clever fight. All bouts lasted three rounds. There were no decisions.
For their fine exhibitions the boys were invited*’to visit the club again. Their work and spirit went beg wit hthe men at the club.
The various boxing classes are progressing fast. All men are taking interest and willing to work. Coach Springer is working the men into shape for the coming boxing tournaments the dates of which will be announced later.
There was no student demonstration for the football team, leaving for the doubtful Army game. Is the Notre Dame man apathetic—or just confident?

FRESHMEN JAM GYM
NEW PHYSICAL ED. COURSE
The physical classes, obligatory to all Freshmen, are extra large and it is probable that a number of the morning classes will be split up to reach into the afternoon, especially when apparatus and gymnastic work begin. The only men excused from the classes are candidates for Freshman football, band members, and those out for boxing and advanced swimming.
So far the training has been elementary, dealing with marching and calisthenics. B. G. DuBois is directing the classes. He hopes to commence games of all types so that the work in physical training will be made attractive. Through physical training he hopes to develop the carriage of men, and athletes for the track team. He has already started some on short distance running and is beginning to pick out the most promising runners. If there is enough good material among the men, a Frosh track team will be formed.
TENNIS
The “B” Tennis tournament closes this week. The semi-finals were played Tuesday; the finals will be played Wednesday. This tournament, for Freshmen and men who did not make their letter last year, has been under way the past few weeks. Donaldson, Andrews, Stadel and Dorgan took part in the semi-finals. Donaldson was junior champion of Detroit, Michigan, last year; he is credited with a victory over Frank Donovan, this year’s Varsity captain. Stadel was a runner-up in the Connecticut state finals, being defeated by Orser. Dorgan is a junior and was in the finals of the Notre Dame tournament.
A new course in physical training, leading to a degree of Bachelor of Science in Physical Education, is being taught at Notre Dame this year. B. C. DuBois is director of the course. Mr. DuBois is a new man at Notre Dame. He was a captain in the U. S. Army for two years and had charge of physical training classes.
In the course the men will get the theory of physical education, and practical experience in the four major sports, football, baseball, basketball and track. It is a four year course and the present enrollment numbers ten men. In the course the men will be instructed in such minor sports as hockey, tennis, soccer, boxing and swimming. The purpose is to turn out competent directors of physical education, supervisors, college and high school coaches. One of the main points will. be the training of men to officiate in all sports.

Getting the right tailor, trailing with the right crowd, keeping the “profs” properly complaisant all come under this heading. But a tousled, untidy mane and dandruff on your “tuck” collar are always bad form.
Getting a bottle of “Vaseline” Hair Tonic and using it regularly keeps the scalp healthy and makes stiff hair look silky. It prevents dandruff and puts on the finishing touch of slick headwork. At all drug stores and student barber shops.

GRIDIRON SPOTLIGHT RESTS THIS WEEK ON NOTRE DAME-ARMY
BATTLE AT NEW YORK
(Toledo Blade)
NEW YORK, Oct. 14.—A capacity crowd of more than 50,000 is expected to witness the Army-Notre Dame football game Saturday at the Polo Grounds where one of the most spectacular of the intersectional series between the two rivals will be fought.
Army will outweigh the faster Rockne, team. The opposing back fields include many of the recognized stars of the country, but in the clashing lines the cadets will have an edge over the Notre Dame forward wall which has been partially rebuilt.
Wilson, flashy all-American of Penn State last year, is expected to add the dash of speed to the Army attack which has been lacking since the days of French. Hewitt, former Pitt battering ram, although completely stopped by the “Watch-charm” guards of Notre Dame last season, has shown improvement this year. Woods at fullback is one of the best punters in the East and a line plunger who has been effective against Rockne’s team during the last two seasons. Gilmore, another speed merchant, completes the quartet.
Against this attacking group Rockne will present the Miller-Crowley-Layden-Stuhl-dreher combination which returned intact this year after parading around the tackles of every team encountered last season.
Miller is one of the fastest running backs in the game, Crowley is the elusively-spec-tacular type, Layden is possibly the most brilliantly versatile fullback in the country when in condition, and Stuhldreher was rated as one of the great quarterbacks of the last compaign.
Neither squad is exceptionally smart at ends and Army is reported to have strengthened its tackles since last season while Rockne was required to replace the giant Oberst with a lighter man.
Captain Walsh, blond center, who gave Garbisch a heroic battle last year, will be back but neither Captain Brown nor Vergara, the 1923 Notre Dame guards credited with stopping Hewitt of West Point, are on this year’s squad.

The most interesting item this observer notices about the “Fighting Irish” of this season is the absence of “Irish.”
To be sure, there is Capt. Walsh, a Crowley, a Colling, and a McMullen—who would be passed by the Ancient Order of Hibernians without too much question- ing. But such lads as Hunsinger, Kizer, Hanousek, Stuhldreher, Glueckert, Eggert, Weibel, and Rigali— well, if they are Irish so is the Prince of Wales.
This town, or at least that part of it which is Notre Dame, is football nutty. More than 400 of the student body are kicking, running, passing, fumbling, stumbling, falling for upwards of an hour six days a week. One hundred make up the varsity squad; fifty the freshman squad. Then there are nine teams of at least twenty in each, called “Hall” teams, also strutting their football stuff under the eyes of Rockne, and Tom Lieb, his chief assistant. Keogan, who looks after the freshmen, and Vergara, last year’s right guard, whose thirty minutes as a sub at Fordham a few seasons ago made him ineligible for this year’s play, also lend their advice to putting the Notre Dame system across to the Football Four Hundred of South Bend.
