Editorial 


The rising costs of textbooks is not a new problem on any campus. But it is a prob­lem that becomes worse each semester and shows no sign of getting any better in the near future. Many professors are conscious of the rising text­book costs, and they try to keep prices down by ord­ering paperbacks, photocopying (albeit sometimes illegally), putting materials on reserve and trying to stay flexible in their course syllabi. But there are other professors who are content with the books they have and cannot or will not find any better alterna­tives despite the constantly rising prices. Still others do not take textbook prices into account at all. The problem is not apathy. If anything, the faculty cares too much about books. And the dilemma is obvious: if you have to chose a syllabus with economy in mind, you come perilously close to sacrificing the quality of education. At Notre Dame, the student government is paralyzed. They have tried to organize student book­sales, but a combination of bad planning, insufficient promotion and poor organization has characterized these efforts. The latest idea, , the Notre Dame Com­:puter Book List, a joint effort of the Entrepreneurial : Society, the Hall Presidents' Council, and Adworks is 
ng 
similarly doomed. 
Three factors come immediately into play in this prediction. First, it is being operated out of Cavanaugh Hall and the Adworks office, which is problematic. It should have been operated out of stu-· dent government offices. Second, the $.25 per book charge, while not exhorbitant, is annoying. It should have been free. Third, the program shot itself in the foot when it wrote that the form may be mailed with an enclosed check via campus mail or submitted in person. It fails to mention to whom the checks should be written, and any reason why students should trust campus mail with enclosed checks. It simply should have been better conceived. 
Since the faculty seems to be the only group on campus able enough to act on this problem, the Faculty Senate needs to. investigate this issue thoroughly. Specifically, it should address three questions: 1) Is there any inquiry (possibly by deans or department chairmen) into the motives behind book changes? 2) What safeguards are there against faculty members receiving financial benefits from publishing companies through the sale of their own books on the home campus? 3) Can there be any con­certed effort among the faculty to combat rising prices without sacrificing the quality of education?

Week In Distortion/Mike Keegan 


Christmas Spirits 
Keegan offers his version of Christmas in the land of misfits 

hristmas is a time to remember the old and wish for the new. A time to rehash the memories we hold 

precious in our hearts and to reveal the dreams we wish to achieve in the future. Join me in a poem dedicated to remember­ing what the first semester at Notre Dame was all about. 
'Twas the night before Christ­mas, and throughout Notre Dame Not a person was stirring, but some dreamed of fame. 
All the stockings were hung by the chimney with hope, As Monk dreamed of power and becoming the Pope. 
Father Bill dozed off into a deep winter snooze; He dreamt of a policy outlawing booze. 
Digger dreamed of Rivers and a national crown, As Christmas came early for an athlete named Brown. 
Mr. Hickey wants money,· he's 
pulling no punch; The Student senate says no, not without Circus Lunch. 
Father Tyson in his kerchief and Doctor Goldrick in his cap Had just settled down for a long winter's nap. 
When up from the quad there came such a clatter; Dave and John arose to see what was the matter. 
To the window they flew and threw open the sash, Down in the quad domers were having a bash. 
Tyson screamed "Expulsion! but not without a fine; Ten years of hard labor, that's the decision of mine." 
Other John and Jane Domers were snug in their beds As visions of social gatherings danced in their heads. 
Mom and Dad taught them how to drink responsibly-­First shut the door, then chug 'ti/ ya can't see. 
Meanwhile down South, Coach Holtz dreamed of the day 
When the Aggies from Texas would soon come his way. 
A plant promised to clean the air of its smell, But most of the students wished the plant go to hell. 
It was off to the mountains where the Hare-Krishnas did run, Chanting the whole way, "Are we having fun?" 
They came dressed as ducks, issuing citations to party,· The laugh that they're having on us must be real hearty. 
Everyone awaits the first storm 
of snow,· North and South Quad Domers are ready to throw. 
When we next open our stock­ings what will we see, Eight squealing reindeer and a no-cheating policy? 
One never knows what the future will bring, But hopefully for the team a Cotton Bowl ring. 
And I heard him exclaim as he flew out of sight, Beat those damn Aggies, knock out their lightsa

Penn State Gets Its 
Irish Up 
Penn State's student newspaper, 11The 
Weekly Collegian", ran an article concerning col­lege football and bowl games. Interestingly enough, the article featured the recent process of Notre Dame's bowl dilemma. Lew Bosco wrote, "Now picture this scenario. Notre Dame, ranked in the top 10 at the time, unofficially accepts the invita­tion to play in Dallas, but ends up losing two of its last four games to (inish 8-3. The winner of the SWC is going to have at least two losses. Now you have two teams with five combined losses playing in a New _Year's Day bowl game that supposedly has a lot of prestige." The article fails to describe the situation df the Nittany Lions (8-3), who will face the Clemson Tigers (9-2) in the Florida Citrus 
Bowl on January 1st.

tune," says 
Seymour Parker. on minding their counterparts are 
extending a 'cultural lag' that signals that 'women are not as capable as men, and should be treated dif_ferently'. Parker, an anthropologist, studied the attitudes of 190 college students, and found that the people who valued such manners most also tended to believe women to be "a little irrational and in need of extra care". Parker argues
"M '

think that if they spend hours and hours in the library, they'll learn by osmosis and good grades wiU come automatically." Olney came up with the idea for a different way to study when one of his sons was denied admission to ASU. Olney appealed the decision and his son was accepted on probation. Now that his son was in school, Olney needed to find a way to keep him there. He came up with

nine techniques designed to enhance studying; his son, with the aid of these techniques, made dean's list all four years and graduated with honors. These techniques include studying in five minute 'bursts' rather than hours at a time, because "you basically remember the first and last things you hear or read," Olney says. Other methods are writing essay exams in erasable ink and using a word processor for term papers. Neatly written exams are almost ensured to yield a higher grade than ones with crossed out sections, and students are much more likely to correct mistakes with a word processor 
than a typewriter. This new study method seems to 
. reap more rewards than just better grades --the three hour cassette, "How to Get Better Grades in College", sells for $29.95. 


The University of Pennsylvania has 


warned the fraternities not to hire female strippers to perform at rush functions again. The president and provost of the university wrote a letter to all fraternity houses stating that "the hiring of strippers portrays people as objects in a degrading, dehumanizing and tasteless manner." Evidently, two fraternities had strippers perform at rush func­tions and pressured freshmen into engaging in s~x­ual acts with the performers. One freshman told campus officials about the incident, causing the University to issue its warning.

fter the hugs and 
laughter of the begin­
ning of the academic 
year comes the inevit­

able reality of classes. And with 
classes come books. And lines in 
the bookstore. Artd the largest 
checks students will likely write 
all semester. 
Those checks can be a problem for some students. The price of many hard-cover books has risen to forty dollars or more for a sin­gle text. When the problem-solving guide and laboratory manual are added, the total can rise well above seventy-five dollars and above the average student's budget. 
"For one class, if I had bought all the books, it would have cost me between $65 and $70. Multiply that by six," said Peter Harvey, a junior accounting major. 
"If one professor asks for $100 in books, that may seem reason­able to him. But, when a student has five classes, that's over $500," said Thomas Swartz, the college fellow of the College of Arts and Letters and an economics profes­sor at Notre Dame. He added that

begins. 
Dan O'Connor, a junior Managment Information Systems major, said, "It's unfair that the prices are so high when we can only use the books for one year and then can't even resell them because (the professors) change editions." In fact, students in all four colleges complained that they had to buy an average of three-quarters of their books new this semester. Arts and Letters stu­dents bought the fewest new books, since many of the novels typically resell well, while engineering students purchased the most new books, because those texts are typically not sold at the end of the semester. 
Swartz said, "Most of the time we can't go beyond two years with economics books. The text book companies revise the books. The text must respond to the current world, not to the world three years ago." He added that the Econom­ics Department makes an implicit contract with the students to keep the same books for two years but that it is occasionally necessary to start over if the text turns out to be poor. 
Frequently, a book that more accurately and completely covers the material defined by the course description appears on the market. Byung Cho, an associate professor of management in the College of Business, said, "A new book can be more rigorous on the important material without a lot of extrane­ous information." 
Jorge Garcia, an associate pro­fessor of philosophy, selects a new book for its contents. A book he uses now was not on the market when he first taught one philoso­phy course. He said, "It enables me to cover some different topics in Moral Relativism." He added that the anthology he uses for His­tory of Ethics has been used for all the years he has instructed that course, although, "I probably use ten of the twenty-four readings in any semester so the topic does not become dry for me either." 
Robert Klawiter, a German professor in the College of Arts and Letters, uses the second edi­tion of a text first published in 1954 for his Cultural German class

because he feels it still lives up to the course requirements. However, his Intermediate German class purchased a new text this year. He said, "We switched to this series because it had a very good tape program." 
Swartz cautioned that revising text books can be part of the pub­lishing game. He said, "The pub­lisher will put out a new edition to spoil the text. In a standard text, at most, ten to fifteen percent of the book is updated." 
Professor Swartz believes that teachers often do not realize the financial burden they place on the students by requesting new texts annually or biannually and that this may be be, in part, due to the fact that book salesmen often do not know the price of the book they are marketing. Cho said, "I have my own son in college, I real­ize (how expensive books can be)," unlike some professors. 
Several of Notre Dame's col­leges are now implementing other programs to provide students with the most recent information. This way, students are not required to purchase as many expensive books each semester. ! 
Workbooks that accompany the . main texts are usually not required material for a course, although many students choose to purchase them under the advice of the pro­fessor to practice for the exams. These workbooks can cost as much as twenty dollars. : 
Cho attempts to help students 
'r 

with this problem. He said, "I 
i

make :UP my own problem sets to run off for the students." He stressed that he can only do a cer­
i 

tain amount of this since the Col­i 
lege of Business budgets each pro­
fessor with a twenty copies per 
student per semester. 
Other professors have material held for their classes at the Hes­burgh Library or the library 
i

within their college. Garcia said, 
"I put things on reserve for my 
students if they are not in the 
book." He, and other professors, 
pointed out that with more exten­
sive copyright laws, duplication of 
information for students is 
unethical. The professors agreed, 
though, that they believe students 
are probably making copies of 
reserve material for themselves 
anyway. 
In the College of Business, the text used for any particular course has been the prerogative of the instructor. Cho said he prefers to 
i

have one universal text for all ! classes of the same course descrip­
' 

tion, .so that students would all be equally ready for the next level of the course and more books could be resold at the end of the semes­ter. (The policy a few years ago was such that one book was decided upon for a particular level

of a class by a committee in the 
department, but since has been 
changed to allow professors more 
choice of the text best suited to 
their needs.) 
Students commented negatively on being asked to buy books that they never used substantially. · Michael Cimino, a junior in the College of Business said, "I paid forty dollars for my Quantitative Methods book which was new last year, and I only used it to do 
homework problems." 
In the end, both students and 

professors agreed that education 
should come before individual 
book price. The professors 
believed that if a more recent or 
complete edition better fulfills the 
course requirements, there should 
be no reason to prolong the usage 
of an incompetent text. Garcia 
laughed, "I'd probably get tired of 
teaching out of a 'perfect' text 
after five or six years anyway." II

And to All 
a Good Night 
The Glee Club takes time out the last weeks of school to spread their own brand of Christmas cheer 
BY SUZANNE LUTZ 

The weeks between Thanksgiving and Christ­mas break are the most hectic for many students. 
Some of us frantically try to finish final papers and projects while others must deal with one last round of tests, and all the while finals creep up faster than expected. It's enough to make a student forget that it's the Christ­mas season. 
Enter the University of Notre Dame Glee Club. They're here to save students from being con­sumed by academic stress and to remind them that this is a special place to celebrate the holiday sea­son. For starters, they carol at the library, giving appreciative stu­dents an enjoyable study break. (If you haven't yet been to the library once this semester, you'll want to be there Saturday, December 12 on the second floor.) The women's dorms are also visited by these mistletoe-bearing carollers, who are in turn showered with female attention. 

All this is in addition to the Glee Club's overwhelmingly popu­lar Christmas concert. In recent years two Christmas concerts were held for the students in Washing­ton Hall, and these consistently sold out in twenty minutes or fewer. This year, however, there will be one concert at Stepan Center to allow all Notre Dame and St. Mary's students the pleas­ure of attending the performance; 

10 Scholastic 
no students will be turned away. 
The Christmas Concert for stu­
dents is scheduled for Friday, 
December 11 at 8 p.m. and SUB 
will supply all the accoustics and 
lighting for the performance. Scott 
Liptak, President of the Glee 
Club, is happy with this change 
because it allows more students the 
chance to take a break from their 
studies and share in some Christ­
mas spirit. Said Liptak, "It's hard 
for students to remember Christ­
mas at this time. What we want to 
do is to promote some well­
deserved study breaks and Christ­
mas nostalgia." 
The students aren't the only ones to benefit from the Glee Club's spirit. On Friday, December 4, they performed for South Bend residents and members of the Notre Dame community at the Bendix Theatre. Sunday, December 6, they visited Logan Center and sang for the children and their parents. The secretaries and other employees at the Administration Building also received a dose of holiday cheer on Wednesday, December 9, when the Glee Club continued its tradi­tion of singing to the listeners from the top floor beneath the dome. The administration employees were able to stand below the singers and look up to the dome while enjoying the holi­day music. Then on Thursday, December 10, a concert for the Notre Dame faculty and employ­ees will be held in Washington Hall at 8: 15; all seats for this con­cert were filled in one day. 
A look at their Christmas schedule, which includes perfor­mances on 11 of the first 13 days of December, reveals the high degree of dedication that each Glee Club member must have. Some may not realize that the commitment exists for the members throughout the academic year and often into the summer. The Glee Club travels nationally each year; their travelling schedule next semester includes a musical competition in April, when they'll be the featured vocal group at the

International Music Conference in 
Kansas. During Spring Break, 
four days of the vacation will be 
spen:t by the club at the American 
Choral Directors Association com­
petition in Cleveland; here the 
University of Notre Dame Glee Club will be one of five nationally acclaimed groups featured. For the remainder of their Spring Break, Glee Club members will tour throughout the East, making stops in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Con­necticut, Boston, Buffalo, and. New York City. The Glee Club also travels to Western Europe every three years. Last summer the club took a European tour which included visits to Dublin, London, Amsterdam, Paris, Angers, Mun­ich, Innsbruck and Rome. 
The dedication that each Glee Club member demonstrates, and the amount of time that the 70 men share together necessarily brings with it a fraternal atmo­sphere. Said Liptak, "The frater­nal aspect is key to the organiza­tion. It really keeps the members going." Scott adds that without this sense of fraternity, some members wouldn't be driven · to maintain the commitment neces­sary for the club. Paul Salva­toriello, a freshman Glee club member, finds this atmosphere to be an invaluable aid for social orientation at Notre Dame. Paul said that in becoming a part of the Glee Club, each new member in effect is given a group of 70 friends. Their closeness can be seen as they share dinner every day after practice and as they take part in social events like the Glee Clubs dances and formals. 
The closeness for the Glee Club members also arises from the part that each man has in the Glee Club's sense of tradition. The club was organized in 1915, and has since risen to a long-standing posi­tion of national and acclaim. ·earl Stam, · the club's conductor and Director of Choral Music for Nore Dame, helps the club to maintain its reputation as one of the best all-male groups in the country. Mr. Stam is also the Conductor of the University of Notre Dame Chorale, as well as the teacher for several courses in the Music Department. 
A vital part of the Glee Club's tradition has always been its involvement in spreading holiday cheer during the Christmas season, and this year is no different. The Unive·rsity of Notre Dame Glee Club has dedicated itself to the maintenance of Christmas spirit at Notre 'Dame during these very hectic times. Each member of the club gives up a huge portion of his pre-finals week to provide others with an enjoyable break from academics. Taking a break from final papers and exams for the Glee Club concert not only rests the mind, it can also help provide a happy memory of Christmas at 
,.: Notre Dame; in the long run, that may prove to be more valuable than· whatever work could have been completed during that time¦

I Big Brothers and Sisters at Notre Dame provide companionship for South Bend kids 

BY SARA HARTY 

It's not every day that Santa Claus visits Senior-Alumni Club or that its dance ·noor is turned into a stage for a 
mag1c1an. Usually the pool sharks aren't eight years old and the bev­erage of choice isn't always coke. But if the Big Brother-Big Sister party held there on Sunday December 6 was not typical that doesn't mean that the participants didn't have just as much fun. Between the food, games and entertainment there was something for everyone. 

Big Brothers of South Bend was i founded in 1968 on the Notre ii Dame campus. Gradually the pro­ject grew into the present agency on East Madison A venue. Now the 
~
Notre Dame group is just a part of Sit Big Brothers-Big Sisters of St. 1 Joseph County. . 6 
Scott Smith, president of Big Brothers and Big Sisters at Notre Dame, said "Children in the pro­gram tend to have parents that are not home a lot or one has died. Their mothers or fathers choose to have the kids join the program and be matched up with a big brother or sister. There's quite a waiting list right now." 
"Big brothers and sisters spend three or five hours a week with their kid. They are committed for a year but tend to stay with the same kid until they graduate," said Smith. Once or twice a month the club organizes some group activi­ties such as the Christmas party, a trip to the zoo, dinner at Show Biz pizza or an upcoming trip to Chi-

cago. 
"The idea, however, is to have 
the type of relationship that 
develops best when you spend 
time alone together." Smith said 
that he's talked with his ten year 
old brother, Jermaine about values 
and about people. "I've got the 
satisfaction of knowing that I've 
given something back, that I've 
been the father thaat he doesn't 
have. He's learned what it's like to 
have a big brother and to have 
some leadership in his life." 
For the students involved in the 
program motivations are varied. 
All agree that the relationship is 
satisfying for both parties 
involved and a lo.t of fun is to be 
had with the kids. 
Michelle Lynch is a junior who 
has been a big sister since last 
Thanksgiving. Melissa is an eight 
year old whose parents are both 
deaf. "We've gone roller skating, 
to the movies, one time she came 
over to watch a BP football game. 
I just have a lot of fun, it's like 
being a little kid again. For her it's 
good to have someone to hang out 
with. If something's bothering her 
she'll tell me and we'll talk, but 
she's so young that mostly it's just 
fun." 
Scott Swick's little brother Jer­maine is eight years old. "It takes patience because his house doesn't have a telephone so I have to go over there to plan the next day with him. It's good to be able to · give him a chance to get out of his house and see a different environ­
ment." 
Julie Sennet has been a big sis­

ter to Melanie for three and a half 
years. They've spent a lot of time 
together roller and ice skating, 
finger painting, and making cook­
ies. Sometimes Melanie will spend 
the night or Julie will go to watch 
her play basketball. " I've been 
able to watch her grow up and go 
through some tough adolescent years and turn out ok. Through me, my family and friends she's been able to see a stable environ­ment and the benefits of that kind of a situation." 
Trish Sullivan, community Pro­jects Coordinator of the St. Joseph County chapter said , "It's not really a problem that the stu­dents are only here for nine months of the year, it's just hard for the kids to spend so much time with someone and have them leave 
for the summer. But the students 
are good about writing letters and me to get away from the regular grind at school and an opportunity to help him out too. Kurt lives with his mom and four sisters so I can be a special male friend that he can go out with. It's been a good friendship --beneficial for both of us," said Irving. 
Nine year old Andy's big brother Tod Perry agreed, saying, "The best thing for me is the satis­faction you get from helping someone and being a positive role model for someone who doesn't

FLASHBACK: late October, 1981. Notre Dame head hockey coach Charles "Lefty" Smith looks very happy. His Irish hockey team has gobs of scholarships to offer, a captain by the name of Dave Pou­lin, and large crowds at the ACC. The Irish ascend .to a 23-15-2 record and Poulin ascends later to the NHL as an all-star center for the Philadelphia Flyers. Poulin joins other Smith-coached Irish players in NHL fame, like Jack Brownschidle, Bill Nyrop and Don Jackson. 

FLASHBACK: late October, 1986. Notre Dame head hockey coach Charles "Lefty" Smith looks very ill. His Irish hockey team is wet behind the ears, with only three seniors, none of whom are on scholarship and none of whom will ever see an NHL game without buying a ticket. Few fans brave the cold to see the Irish play in person, which makes sense because the Irish often play l~ke 
Gre1 Kohs 

stiffs and finish 10-19-1 for the season. In March, Smith decides he's had enough and after 19 years as the Irish boss announces his resignation. 
FLASHBACK: late October, 1987. New Notre Dame head hockey coach Ric Schafer winces and then smiles. The Elvis imper­sonator he asked to sing the national anthem has just drawn out the 'home of the braaaave" in · The King's own dark whimpering style, and the crowd of over 3,000

at the ACC is going berserk. The Irish, still without scholarships, but with seven seniors, open the season with a 5-4 win over Wind­sor. 
I
t is now mid-December and Schafer, who really does spell his name Ric (without the k), has his Irish team off to a rousing and completely unbelievable start. With last weekend's split at home against Michigan-Dearborn, Notre Dame stands 9-2-2 (3-1-2 in its confer­ence the American Collegiate' .
Hockey Association). The start 1s the team's best since 1968, the first year Notre Dame began play­ing varsity hockey. And that squad's 11-2-3 getaway could be matched this weekend when the Irish play host to Dayton for a weekend pair Friday and Saturday at the JACC. 
But while fans --and several players --may be surprised by Notre Dame's quick jump out of the gate, Schafer sees things dif-

.a

f erently when he looks at his team. "These guys all believe in them­selves, and with good reason," he said after a recent game. "If you ask me how many games I want to win, I'll say every game." 
"I remember one meeting before the season," recalled Irish winger Bruce Guay, a sophomore whose 16 goals lead the team. "Coach Schafer came in and told us to look at the schedule. Then he said he expected us to lose maybe four games or something like that. At the time, after last year and everything, we all just looked at each other and said, 'Right, Coach'." 
Guay and the rest of the Irish may have just attributed their coach's prediction to a case of dilirium caused by his joy at returning to Notre Dame. Schafer, it seems, was more than anxious to move on from the University of 
At six-foot, one-inch, and 200 pounds, senior Pat Foley anchors the Irish defense and keeps a rov­ing eye for the safety of his smaller teammates. 
Alaska-Fairbanks, where he coached for seven seasons. Although the stocky ex-Irish defenseman and center started the Nanook program and built it into a Division I power, he discovered Alaska provided him with some unique problems. 
"It was the toughest recruiting assignment I'll ever have," he noted. "You have to remember that it's just 120 miles from the Arctic Circle and that in December the sun only shines three hours a day. My wife and I enjoyed what the state had to offer, but it's great to be back." 
At Notre Dame, Schafer should find his job a bit easier. The

winter sun may not shine much more than it did in Alaska, but the Irish are playing terrific hockey and gradually regaining the confi­dence of the university 
administration. The Golden Dome's august rulers are providing scholarships once again --specifi­cally, ten spread out over ten years --after taking away all scholar­ships and demoting the sport to club status in the early 1980's. The road back to a competitive Divi­sion I varsity team has been tor­turous, but the scholarships should allow Schafer to see the goal on

Schafer found fire power when he 
moved senior shooter Mooney to the same line as McNeill and Guay. 
the horizon. 
"Right now, we are Division I in name only," he noted. "Dear­born, Kent State and the service academies are teams on our schedule that don't offer any hockey scholarships. But we will now be able to upgrade the pro­gram and bring in higher-ranked teams to give us better competi­tion." 
During one exemplary stretch of the season, the Irish showed 
they could master their current competition with ease. Using a less-physical and more defensively conservative attack than last sea­

son, they reeled off nine straight wins. "The streak gave us so much confidence," said Guay, who along with senior captain Mike McNeill and winger Tom Mooney have scored 31 of the team's 71 goals this year. "We like Coach Schafer's system. Even though he's more concerned with defensive coverages and picking up the extra man than he is with scoring a lot of goals, we're winning." 
Not surprisingly, Schaf er also disdains the rough-and-tumble style of play often seen in Smith's recent teams. "I've talked to the team about the fact that I don't like the rough style," Schafer has stated. Apparently not. Schaf er spent only 126 minutes in the penalty box in 139 games as an Irish undergraduate. But even if Schafer admits he can't condone goon play, he does emphasize, "We dont want any sissies." 
Schafer has few, if any, sissies in his defense. Individuals like seniors Pat Foley and Lance Pat­ton, junior Roy Bemiss, and sophomores Tim Caddo and Bruce Haikola, have spared goaltender Lance Madson from any heavy bruising this season. In all, the Irish have yielded 59 goals on the year while netting 71 themselves. 
And the future of the program appears solid, with six juniors and seven· sophomores, including Mad­son, Guay, center Kevin Marko­vitz (seven goals, 13 assists), 

winger Tim Kuehl (six goals, 9 
assists), center Brian Montgomery, 
and defenseman Leherr, all re ­
turning next season. The Irish do 
lose McNeill, however, a con­
sistent performer and strong team 
leader who led the Irish in scoring 
over the past two seasons. Still, the 
present nucleus, along with prom­
ised help from the university in 
the form of scholarships, should 
make Schafer's attempt to put the 
Notre Dame hockey program back

Final Word 
Making A Difference 


hrough a ton of support from my mom and dad, a great group of friends in my dorm and a diligent and caring coach, I have been blessed over the past months with the opportunity of a lifetime: that of being the Leprechaun for Notre Dame. 
. Though it has been a taxing experience, as anyone who saw the Air Force game can attest to, it has nonetheless provided a lot of fun, a lot of memories, and a lot of insights. 
The first of these is, "What is the best part about being the Leprechaun?" This is a tough question because it is a lot of fun watching Tim Brown return two punts in a row right in front of you; or watching Andre Jones (y'know --# 7) rip down field on a kickoff and hear him crush the return-man. It's been great watching the soccer team go undefeated at home (10-0), while our women's volleyball team had 
their best season ever and our hockey team is in the process of accomplishing the same. 
But, believe it or not, the best part about being the Leprechaun is something that cannot be seen. It could be likened to the feeling that a goodwill ambassador must feel after a successful tour abroad. Appearances at United Way functions, autographs for wide-eyed little kids, and show­ing support for a hard-working yet little praised women's field hockey team all provide comfort­able assurance of having made others happy. Whether it has 
BY BRIAN STARK 
meant making others feel good about Notre Dame, a particular event, or just themselves, it has also made being the Leprechaun something particularly unique. It has been great to represent Notre Dame and its student body of which I am proud to be a part, and, in so doing, to bring happi­ness to others. 
My response to the second question I hear most often is sort of my Christmas message this year. "Why did I go out for' Leprechaun in the first place?" Like many of you, I was very active in high school extracurric­ular activities. Coming to Notre Dame was. different though. It was a different game in a hell­of-a-lot bigger ballpark. You could not effect change or "the common good" as easily as before. There was a tendency to relax and let the "Laurie Binks" around you do it all. (I say that with great respect for our student . body vice preside.nt). 
I myself fell victim to this tendency. But as I approached the end of my junior year, I was faced with the reality that I would soon be gone from this place without ever having made a dent. I knew I would not be able to justify leaving Notre Dame with so much while having given back so little, so I began looking for a way through which I could contribute. Because some close friends thought my funny­looking beard, Irish drinking habits and hard-core desire to always see Notre Dame win were clues from God himself, I tried out for Leprechaun with the hope that through that character, I could make a difference. 


I am convinced of the impor­tance of such practice. Whether it be our school, our family or our favorite relationships, we inevit­ably will be most happy and most Christ-like if, when we leave, they are better because we were a part of them. I am convinced now that it is in giving that we receive. 
I am grateful to my parents and family, and to my friends who have provided this oppor­tunity for me; and I am glad that they can share it with me, through me. But, most of all, I hope that my gratititude will be. manifest in the good that I do, so I can give back some of what has been given to me. I hope that I will make a difference. 
I am reminded at this point of one of my mom's favorite pro­verbs (my mom was into that stuff --she always had a good proverb for any given situation). She often reminded my brothers, sisters and I that "from those who have been given much, much will be expected" (Mom 6:27). Only recently have I come to realize the full impact of my mom's words. 
I pass this insight on to you so that, for . one, you will cheer loudly during home basketball games, and more importantly, so that you will realize the impor­tance of striving to make ·a difference in your own life --at Notre Dame and beyond¦
