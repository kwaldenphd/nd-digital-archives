This missing linkis theJeanne Clery Disclosure ofCampus SecurityPolicy and Crime Statistics Act, which, according to www.securityoncampus.org, "is a federal law that requires colleges and universities to disclose certain timely and annual information about campus crime and security policies." Under the Clery Act, ifa student reports a sexual assault to an individual in a university department or office, that individual is legally obligated to report their crime statistics to the proper authorities, even if the survivor him/herself does not officially report. In effect, this act requires rectors, coaches, advisors and pro­fessors to report to NDSP any time a student informs them that he/she was

In addition, it also is imperative that stu­dents know that if they are victimized by sexual assault, they should relay the details oftheir assault to such university departments as Heath Services so that proper statistics can be compiled and awareness ofsexual assault on Notre Dame's campus can be raised. Before Notre Dame can be the safe, 
welcoming community it claims to be, it must be able to adequately assess and combat the occurrence ofcrime -and especially sexual assault-on its campus. ·

Gas expensive in Katrina's wake 
How the Hurricane affected Michiana gas prices 

• Aislinn Doyle 
The price at the pump was painful for many South Bend drivers even before the onslaught of Hurricane Katrina on Monday, August 
29. And although gas prices have receded from the inflated highs that were seen shortly after the hurricane hit, prices most likely will not return to pre-Katrina levels. 
According to Jim Sullivan, assistant professor ofeconomics and econo­metrics, Katrina did not directly affect the Midwest's gas supply, as the region is not dependent on the Gulf Coast for gas. In fact, the Midwest imports oil from Canada and refines it locally before sending it to the pump. However, because Katrina effectively knocked out refinery pro­duction in the Gulf Coast, "Areas that usually get their gas [there], like Atlanta, had to start looking other places," Sullivan explains. He adds, · "This increases the demand [for gas] all across the country and raises 
prices for all ofus." 
David Betson, associate provost ofeconomics and policy studies, agrees 

that the sudden rise in gasoline prices came as no surprise. "When a 
shortage is expected, it is in the suppliers' interest to sell too high so as 
to not lose money. No one wants to sell cheap if there is going to be a 
shortage," Betson says. 
With the release of oil from the federal petroleum reserve and Gulf 

Coast refineries now in the process of being repaired, the post-Katrina 
gas shortage is being alleviated, and prices are falling gradually. But this 
gradual decrease does notimply an overall downward trend in gas prices. 
"Gas prices were on the rise before Katrina and would have continued to 
be on the rise had Katrina not hit," Sullivan says. 
Facing the possibility ofincreasing gas prices, senior Colin Taylor might start riding his bike to schooL "Ifyou look at the fact that we're about a dollar higher than we were a year ago, that's frustrating. We'd happily take the $2.50 we had this summer. I think it underscores the fact that we need to find an alternative source ofenergy," Taylor says. @

21 SEPTEMBER 2005 
W:ile the university projects a 
Disney-like aura ofbliss and 
ecurity, many members of the Notre Dame community have dealt with the apprehension associated with crime. Whether it is robbery at gunpoint,! sexual assault or any simple misdemeanor,­crime is an issue at Notre Dame. Over the past three years, university crime\·ates· have remained relatively constant, with larceny, burglary and underage posses­sion of alcohol comprising the major­ity of campus crimes. The few 

statistics, this glaring difference can­not be ignored, especially since alcohol almost always plays a role in criminal activity, according to NDSP. The SBPD reinforced this sentiment when the city council passed i party ordinance over the summer regarding off-campus par­,,ties thrown by Notre Dame students. 
· "We have to be strict [regarding alcohol policies], but a lot of it is for [the stu­dents'] safety," police Cpl. Aaron Cassel ofSBPD says. Many

on and off campus.

Although law stud_ent 
enforcement 
bodies exist both on campus and off 
campus to protect the community, they 
cannot prevent all criminal activity. As 
Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) 
Associate Director Phil Johnson says, 
'~[Notre Dame has] 11,000 students en­
rolled here, 4,500 faculty working here, 
and.we are the second leading tourist at­
traction in Indiana." Clearly, NDSP does 
not have the capacity to monitor all of the 
activities taking place throughout the en ­
tire campus. However, as NDSP's safety 
brochure so simply states, "Campus safety 
begins with you." NDSP urges students 
to remain responsive to any suspicious 
activity and take initiative by reporting 
behavior that they interpret as unusual. 
According to the South Bend Police 
Department (SBPD), sobriety is pivotal 
in staying safe in dangerous situations. 
Unfortunately, Notre Dame students 
often abuse alcohol. Although the Office 
of Alcohol and Drug Education claims 
that 78.3 percent of students drink one 
time per week or less, NDSP reported 
over 250 liquor arrests in both 2001 and 
2002. This number, however, dipp,ed by 
nearly 40 percent in 2003 in response to 
the university's zero-tolerance policy 
concerning hard alcohol. Even with the 
recent reduction in alcohol-related inci­
dents, Notre Dame's violations still out­
number those of Washington University

who died three years ago, as an example of why the ordinance is necessary. Sharon, who alleg­edly split off from his friends during an off-campus drinking excursion, was found in the St. Joseph River two months after he was reported missing. As the ordinance aims to prevent similar events from occurring, SBPD offers advice on how to protect oneself. "If you're walking at night, don't walk alone," Cassel says. "Make sure you have somebody with you. Ifyou see someone who's walking home alone, make sure you get somebody to go with them." 
On the other hand, the party ordinance raises staff­ing problems. Since SBPD is limited by the size of their force, reallocation ofofficers to bust under­age drinking reduces SBPD's chances of catching more serious crimes. Cassel adds, "If we're at a house every Friday and Saturday for big parties, that becomes a problem because you're tying up police services to go out and take care

of these parties when we should be out fighting crime instead ofbabysitting." 
Although alcohol prevention is impor­tant, police forces could be redistributed to fight more serious crimes, such as sexual assault and rape. Unfortunately, sexual assault is a real concern for Notre Dame students. There are 173 registered sex offenders in South Bend, spanning all age, race and religious demograph­ics. But off-campus residents are not the only ones at risk of sexual assault. From 2001 through 2003, six accounts ofsexual assault and rape have been reported on campus and two more were reported this semester alone. Even worse, sexual assault figures tend to be misleadingly low. Ac­knowledging the faulty statistics,Johnson says, "I'm not sure how often it occurs on campus, because I think it is an under­reported crime; sexual assaults are often underreported here and nationwide." 
The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Cam­pus Security Policy and Crime Statistics Act of 1990 states that all colleges and universities must publicly disclose in­formation concerning crime on and around their campuses. Reporting all alleged sexual assaults is also a component of the Clery Act. But not all sexual assaults are reported to the university. Many 
organizations

Mixed Signals 

Satellite dishes in Alumni Hall cause headaches for students and Reslife 
• Daric Snyder 
t is not an uncommon sight when 
I
walking the perimeter ofa residence . hall to see small farms of satellite dishes popping through half-open win­dows and planted on the grounds outside. The owners ofthese dishes, unhappywith the poor reception and limited channels of local television programming, have opted to order satellite cable service to enhance their viewing experience. This fall, however, one less dorm will have the luxury to surfa cable network ofover 200 channels. 
Because residents' satellite installation efforts allegedly have resulted in signifi­cant damage to the dorm's fire detection system, those living in Alumni Hall currently are prohibited from ordering satellite service for their rooms. How­ever, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the DirecTV satellite system have left Alumni's residents searching for answers. 
"We had satellite service both our freshman and sophomore years, so we wanted it again," Alumni junior Michael Ferkovic says. As a result, during his first few days on campus this semester, Ferkovic organized his roommates and section neighbors to order satellite ser­vice. On August 24, the students had their service in­stalled -the first such in­stallation in 

Alumni this year. In order to receive ser­vice, each outfitted room needed a coaxial cable run to the room from the dish. As in previous years in Alumni, the students ran cables above the hallway ceiling tiles. "I talked to the guys who had satellite in this section last year," Ferkovic says, "and we ran our cables the exact same way." With no objections from the hall staff, the students had no trouble getting their service up and running. 
However, on August 25, students in a third floor section known as "Chapel Al­ley" awoke to a university fire chief trying to sort out why the smoke detection sys­tem in Alumni had shorted out at 3 a.m. Theinstallati~n ofsatellite cables was sus­pected as the cause of the short, and the fire department removed and confiscated all the satellite equipment from Alumni, which has not yet _been returned. Wit­nesses at the scene were unhappy with the reaction ofthe fire official, who they say accused students of causing thousands of dollars in damage by tampering with the system and threatened certain students with criminal prosecution. 
Ferkov:ic, who canceled his DirecTV service shortly after the incident with the fire chief, received a disciplinary summons from the Office of Residence Life and Housing as a result of the events surrounding the installation. Based on a misunderstanding .of his arrangement for service with DirecTV, Ferkovic was cited for displaying advertisements and allegedly soliciting other students for the DirecTV service. ResLife also sus­pended any further satellite installations in Alumni pending an official ruling on the matter. 
Andrew Breslin, the resident assistant of Ferkovic's section, said that the damage to the fire system is now estimated at$6,600, as it recently was determined that one of five circuitry panels in the section was shorted out. He also says ,that the cause of the damage "has not been ascertained for certain." Evidence pointing to the satellite installations as the source of the damage has been inconclusive, as the short in the circuit occurred at 3 a.m., multiple hours after the time of the cable installation. And, according to the Rev. George Ro­zum, C.S.C., rector of Alumni Hall, the technician who removed the cables from the ceiling in Breslin's section found no damage to the fire system wires where coaxial cables were run. 
Rozum has been in ongoing communi­cation with ResLife, pushing for the office to make a definite ruling on satellites for Alumni. Even if satellite privileges are returned to Alumni, Rozum believes it is unlikely that cables will be permitted to run through the ceiling again. However, in the future, the conflicts over satellite service in Alumni should become irrel­evant. On September 13, in a meeting with rectors, the Rev. Mark Poorman, C.S.C., vice president of student affairs, and Bill Kirk, associate vice president for ResLife, decided that basic cable will be integrated into all the dorms by the start ofthe next fall semester. Rozum hopes to see a solution for his residents before then. "I want my students to be able to· have what all the other students on campus have," he says. 
Officials in both ResLife and the Notre Dame Fire Department were unavailable for comment.

(_/Jios ofJVotre cJJame /Forum <Panelists 
• compiled by claire sobczak & Mo Ert:el
0 n Thursday, September 22, a collection ofthe brightest minds in the modern world will gather in the Joyce Center at 2 p.m. for the Notre Dame Forum, an academic discussion on the possibility for peace in a world consumed 
with war. The following individuals are among the more notable participants of 
thefurum. · 
Cardinal Oscar Andres Rodriguez Maradiaga, S.D.B. 
Rodriguez Maradiaga, archbishop of Tegucigalpa, Honduras, was con­sidered by some to be a possible successor of Pope John Paul II in the April 2005 papal conclave. He is an advocate for human rights in Latin America, an outspoken proponent for the cancellation of Third World debt, and is a member on the Council for Social Communications, the Council for Justice and Peace and the Commission for Latin America. 
Tom Brokaw 
This former NBC news reporter will moderate the panelist discussion, bringing to the forum his nearly four decades of international reporting experience. A man who has proven himself well versed in the areas of global peace and development, Brokaw was the first American anchor to conduct exclusive interviews with the Dalai Lama and Mikhail Gor­bachev, as well as the first American anchor to report on human rights abuses in Tibet. 
Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf 
The founder and CEO of American Society for Muslim Advancement, Imam Feisal has devoted his life to building bridges and increasing peace­ful relations between Muslims and the West. He also is a leader in the effort to build religious pluralism and incorporate Islam into modern American society. 
John Danforth 
Danforth, a former United States ambassador to the United Nations and Former senator from Missouri, has dedicated his political career to bringing peace to conAict-ridden areas. Serving as special envoy for peace talks in Sudan in northern Africa, Danforth has participated in negotiations to settle the civil war there. A political moderate that is respected by both parties, Danfor.th re_cently wrote two op-ed pieces in The New York Times in criticism of the increasingly indistinct line between church and state that he feels has been brought about by some Christian conservatives in the Republican Party. 
Naomi Chazan 
Chazan, a professor of political science at Hebrew University of Je­rusalem, is an outspoken critic of the clash in the Middle East, and has challenged Israel to pursue a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conmct. In addition, Chazan has been a longtime advocate of advancing the status of women in Israel; she cofounded the Israel Women's Network in l984and the Israel Women's Peace Net in 1989.

A Pilgrimage to Biomecca

elcome to 319 Alumni Hall, the 
makeshift recording studio of 
Biomecca -a hip-hop group based out ofJackson Hole, Wyo. -and the home of sophomore Nick Cotting­ham, one of the group's three members. Cottingham, along with fellow Biomecca members Craig Williams and Jeff Bed­ford, gained a following during high school, when the guys first bonded over their lyrical inclinations. "We've been friends forever and we started freestyling together a couple years ago. We used to bond and think of rhymes all day, writing rhymes in class in high school, too. All of our friends at home freestyle. We'd chill 
W
members of Biomecca start­ed college last fall and were scattered across the country. However, with the help of Cot­tingham's room in Alumni, Biomecca is able to add to the nine tracks that they have recorded thus far. Room 319 features a Shure KSM 27 microphone and an M-Audio Ozonic key­board so that Cottingham can write and work rhymes and record beats from the comfort of his dorm room. Then, with the help ofsuch computer applications as Cubase and Reason, Biomecca is able to mix their music and send the results to one another over email. 
Many of Biomecca's songs, includ­ing "Fraction of Rhyme," "Know Not, 
· You're a Robot," "One Mic to Rule All" and "Hell oflt," have been recQr.ded ip. the past six months under this system, and the group promises many more to come. Meanwhile, back in 319, Cottingham's three roommates, sophomores Aaron Martinuzzi, Chris Lepore and AJ. Re­

In light of both our recent fortune of rejoining the top-ranked teams in college football and our misfortune 
in last weekend's loss to Michigan State, I thought it would be nice to honor those, well, less fortunate than us. I'm talking about those that only get to see victory from the losing side of the field as well as those that know their opponents' cheers better than they know their own. And let's not forget the teams that consider losing by "only" three touchdowns to be a moral victory. I welcome you, the reader, to the bottom of the barrel -the worst teams in college football. 
Duke University 
Looking at the Blue Devils' schedule, I think the best they can do is hope that things aren't as horrible next year. It's never a fun thing when you lose 48-0 at 
· home. Sure, it was to then-No. 7 Virginia Tech, but it was still a 48-0 loss. On the bright side, they did manage a win against the oh-so-extremely-tough Virginia Military Institute; they're so good you

never even hear anything about them! Whoever thought that putting five cur­rently-ranked teams in Duke's 11-game schedule was a smart move needs to be fired-now. Just do us a favor, Duke, and stick to basketball. 
University oP Central Florida 
Losing their past 17 games, the Golden Knights have nowhere to go but up. That is, they would have nowhere to go but up if they had a defense, offense, secondary, special teams, coaching staff and a decent playbook. Well, on the bright side, they're in Florida; their fans can use the game as a means to get a good tan. That is, if the fans know about the gaipe. 
Louisiana-LaPayette

the fans; If it counts for anything, the Cajuns did come home with a field goal. And they have a cool team name, too. 
University oP Pittsburgh 
· Poor Pitt. This was the same team that came into our stadium last year and left all ofus shocked and appalled by the end result. But under Head Coach Dave Wannstedt, they haven't won a single game. What happened to them?• Did all of their starters graduate? Did the mag­nificence of Wannstedt's mustache dis­tract his players? Did we just scare them into submission? Though. the answer is definitely not the last choice, I'd like to think so. Oh well. 
· And there you have it. Don't expect our Fighting Irish to fall anywhere near the likes of those on this list inthe many weeks to come. Just use the list as a re­minder thatno matter what happens dur­ing the remainder of the. season, things can always getworse. Or you could use it purely to ridicule others. It's up to you. @

·Nicole Dorner·······················································/( 
Sports Editor ..................................................... !i This is an important game for the Irish. Com-·! ing off a bad loss to Michigan State, the Irish need to pull themselves together and bring back the fire from the first two games. Washington, led by quarterback Isaiah Stanback and tackle Manase Hopoi, is coming off of its first win in a year. But the Irish have a lot more to lose and will be giving 200 percent to come out of this game victorious, 28-10. 
Michael Kim .. Assistant Sport Editor ...................... '. The media will create a re­
venge motive for Tyrone Will­ingham. As much as the former Irish coach would like to beat Notre Dame for the last laugh, national viewers just might end up laughing at the inconsistent offense of Willingham's Hus­kies. Not even a miracle can save Washington from an Irish pounding with Charlie Weis at the helm. He won't let his players get emotional. Weis has respect for Willingham, but I hope he runs up the score in this one to silence all Willingham supporters once and 
for all. Notre Dame wins easily, 56-7, with a mercy touchdown for Wash­ington in the fourth quarter.

The world's most famous Thompson Twins are probably the British pop trio from the '80s. But a different set ofThompson twins is making a name for itself on Notre Dame's tennis courts. Juniors Catrina and Christian Thomp­son made Notre Dame history last Feb­ruary when they became the first Irish women's doubles team to reach No. 1 in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) rankings. They finished the season with a 28-7 record and a No. 5 ranking, and they made the final 16 of the NCAA Tournament. Head Coach Jay Louderback speaks highly of the twins. "They have the potential to be the best doubles team we have ever had at Notre Dame," he says. "Their biggest advantage is that they are so good playing together; they've played together since they were born." That cohesion was evident last season when the twins earned All-American honors. They were the first women's 
TWO OF A KIND: Catrina and Christian Thompson battle past sibling rivalries and all other opponents on the road to the national doubles championship. 
tennis All-Americans from Notre Dame 
since 2001 and the first twins ofany gen­
der to become All-Americans at Notre 
Dame. 
Louderback is confident the twins will 
have more success this season. "Poten ­·tially, they could be one of the better doubles teams in the country, especially since they now have some college expe­rience," he says. "They play doubles like 
you should play doubles." 
The Thompsons have had success on 
the international stage, as well. They 
have been ranked as high as No. 573 in 
the world, have competed in girls' doubles 
at the U.S. Open, and were selected to 
represent the United States at the World 
University Games in Turkey last August 
(though they were unable to attend). 
But despite their success in doubles, the 
Thompsons are not inseparable -they are accomplished singles players, as well. Catrina is the No. 1 singles player for Notre Dame, and she finished last season ranked No. 46 in singles nationally. Her style is one ofpure force and athleticism. She features a huge forehand and serve, both ofwhich have become more consis­tent during her Notre Dame career. She is also lethal at the net. Christian made the All-Big East Tournament team in singles in both 2004 and 2005. She is an extremely fast and consistent player and, like her sister, is very strong at the net. Christian also has a great backhand and deadly serve. 
The Thompsons kick off their 2005­2006 campaign with the rest of the Notre Dame team at the Maryland Invitational in College Park, Md., starting September 
23. @

eing Catholic definitely has 
its benefits. We get Christmas 
and confession, and what other religion gets to drink blood during their religious services? Unfortunately, one not-so-fun aspect of claiming member­ship with the universal Church is our rich, long-standing belief in demonic possession. Unlike, say, the Trinity or the Twelve Apostles, possession is usually glossed over at Sunday school, probably because it involves a demon invading and controlling your body. Reader, you might shake your head as you read this, but believe me, it's in the holy books. Even JPII issued a statement defending exor­cisms in certain cases. That being said, as a Catholic, I recently made the poor and terrifying decision to see the movie "The Exorcism of Emily Rose." In retrospect, seeing "The Exorcist," another movie about demonic possession, wasn't such a good idea, either. Now, quite frankly, I'm 
beginning to wonder ifmaybe I myself am not possessed by Satan. 
Okay, 'okay, before you turn the page, let's look at the facts. First off, I'm a young nubile brunette, which apparently is the devil's type. I'm Irish, so most ofthe year I sport an unsettling corpse-like pallor. Plus, what with the new Death Cab for Cutie album out, I have been staggering around accompanied by terrifyingly mo­rose music, just like Linda Blair and Em­back the design that I mailed in. 
I took a looky-loo at the U.S. Coun­cil for Catholic Bishops Web site (www.usccb.org) and found a newsletter that listed a few ways to identify a pos­sessed person before administering the Rite of Exorcism. One manifestation of possession is having knowledge about things I would have no way of knowing. I have this all the time! For example, this past weekend I knew that drinking three whole milk White Russians was a bad idea, despite the fact that I had never had one before. And while a non-believer might suggest that this would explain my "Exorcist"-esque projectile vomiting, I suspect darker forces are at play. To the skeptics' credit, though, neither movie suggests demonic possession tradition­ally causes explosive diarrhea like that, despite what the completely qualified, not-in-any-way-incompetent physicians over at Health Services keep telling me. 
Other indicators include abnormal physical strength, which admittedly I don't have. I do, however, have a very strong sense of direction, which I think is pretty much on par with being able to crack a headboard in half or twist some­one's head all the way around. Mysterious language acquisition is the third charac­teristic, and since a national poll of all people who are me voted that Halle-ese counts as a legitimate dialect, well, the conclusions draw themselves. 
Apart from the damnation and oozing sores and whatnot, there do seem to be some pretty great perks to being pos­sessed by the Lord ofFlies. For example, the next time that girl in my English class insists on wearing her sunglasses inside the classroom for no reason, seeing as how she is neither blind nor famous that I know of (unless maybe in a "Girls Gone Wild: Midsized Midwestern City" sense of the word), instead of just rolling my eyes in 
· impotent contempt, I might spew a stream of steaming pea soup onto her desk. Ifthat didn't stop her, I could, I don't know, may­be heave her body javelin-like through the window and out onto DeBartolo Quad. And who will blame me? I'll shrug my shoulders coyly, and the professor will just shake his head, exasperated but bemused. Because who's going to point a finger at the poor possessed girl? No one, that's who. And then he'll give me an "A." 
Also, if the movies are any indication, I get a whole wardrobe of full-length, slightly urine-stained white nightgowns, which I'm positive is going to get me about a bazillion times more dates than I get right now. Which is none. As was probably fairly obvious after that urin~­soaked nightgowns reference.

/COUNTERPOINT 
Jhave the distinct impression that · people at this school feel as though they are living inside of an insulated 
bubble, void of anything unpleasant, whether that be theft perpetrated by fellow ·students or acts more violent in nature stemming from out­side trespassers. People jog around the lakes at night, dorm room doors are rarely locked, and students leave laptops and other personal objects unattended in areas of study. 
I grew up in a suburb ofChicago, and there was a.constant stream ofstories in the local newspa­pers about robberies, stabbings and other acts of unacceptable behavior. I learned that as­suming one is in a position of safety is a mistake that could result in one's death. 
Upon arrival at Notre Dame, I decided that I would not be so naive as to believe I was out of harm's way simply because I was on a relatively contained campus. No matter where you find yourself in this world, there will be people who do not respect laws and the rights of fellow hu­mans. These deviant individuals know that Notre Dame is an area filled with young, sheltered and, more often than not, intoxicated kids carrying wallets filled with mom and dad's money. This knowledge also suits the interests ofsexual preda­
tors in the area.
