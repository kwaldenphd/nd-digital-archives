There have beeii several changes of format' initiated by ,the·_ company to improve their image and . clarify the purpose 'bf the publication..The 1965 edition 'o{ Monarch Notes fea~ tu~es a box on·the cover noting the three Ph.D . .'s on the ·editoriai" boa:rdof consultants; along with 'a· state·­ment of intention: "Monarch Notes and Study .Guides are designed J:o stimulate . the reader's. •·_interest, deepen his enjoyment and encourage the desire to enrich his ·learning/'

:: ,· SCHOLASTiC 


in any of the publications, yet most held some reservations-at least at a gut·level.' Dr. James Walton, asso0 ciate professor. of, the English•:De­partment says, "I frame my assign­ments. around questions which: de­mand more.than a summary, or even a critical summary, could provide. I look for .a; highly distinctive .· ap­proach .with emphasis on individu, ality.'.' Dr. Walton added that he is not aware .of what kinds of study methods students ·employ:, "I'm like the. college professor: . they warned you about in high school. I don't pay much. attention ·to the study habits of the students." Walton does point out a problem.with the use· of notes: "I evaluate by· how personally lim­ited the subject matter is-,-Monarch Notes are comprehensive and imper­sonal. If, l ever felt that. students were being swallowed up in second~ hand sources, I would change the as­signment to; obviate that practice, only because, I'm afraid. they . would bore·me to·death.',', >, ;·, · 
_; Dr; John McDonald, assistant pro­fessor. of English,. also acknowledges· a certain bias against study guides and master plots. ,''There are better places to go; unfortunately, you have· to' know, something before· you. can find them. The format of the master ploL is • convenient, but •there are better .·sources and .guides to critical analysis... ,What :I object to," ·says McDonald, ''is the thinking that. all past . and. future knowledge on ,the work is. captured in these publica­tions.. ,They are · preoccupied with looking .for the truth through· di­vulging hidden·meanings." , .. 
One ~. senior. English, major · . ex~ presses' a similar point: "I suppose ·. I'm too arrogant, but · I don't trust them; '. One can fall too easily,. into the pattern of thinking thatthey are · definitive.''. It does seem that when. using study guides students find great comfortin discovering an agreement with theirthoughts and .those of the preparers : of : study ; guides.· . Dr. McDonald says, "I would not be.sur: prised if many of the safe,·pedestrian · ideas ·in. students',papers come from master. plots.'' Perhaps students are suffering from:: that:; great ; tinder~ 
APRIL':2, .1976 · 
graduate fear of being too original. 
· Professor• McDonald expresses doubts as to the . competency of the preparers of, master plots. Com­menting upon the fact that the de­gree Ph.D. often follows the name of the. author, Dr. Walton suggests · that only.•writers of pornography and· study guides feel compelled to follow such . a practice. . . Dr. McDonald points out that he would ·not object. to master ·study guides if they did not·pretend to do something · which they do not 'do. ".They make a mistake in thinking they provide what a professor is looking for when they approach a book as iL itwere a puzzle. Such a method is the least part of one's edu­cation.'~ . As study guides, however, McDonald feels the notes can be used prnductively .•. to . aid students in formulating questions in their own minds...Lievowitz from Simon and · Schuster notes that tests have shown that ·students' comprehension .. in­creases when using the notes in con­junction with the book.• "We include critical commentary. so. that even when the student feels· he; has read 
the book well, he will find that he has 'really missed some' points.'' : Dr., Walton, notes that there :is a positive value when.study guides.are used as a mnemonic aid: . Often stu­dents 'Will use···specific study guides to retain or recall the intricacies of plot in the more lengthy novels. 
Apparently Monarch has . com­municated its appeal to students to avoid using the, notes as· substitutes for reading· primary sources since few admit risking such a short cut. There is, after. all, more to the ex­perience of reading a book. than .an objective summary and analysis. The spectrum of student opinion is wide. One freshman :remarks, "I wouldn't use them unless I.was in the biggest jamof my life," but other self-con­fessed procrastinators acknowledge their ·• debt to. such conveniences. There is, however, something incon~ gruous' about• condensing the. Bible into 30 pages of critical commentary with. review questions and. answers includ_ed and God listed as the main character. But as Jong as· there are students, and 900spage .··novels;:: and not enough hours in.the.day.;_: . ,

Porky O'Rourke pressed the.button 
for the fifth floor. The elevator 
wheezed as it carried us slowly up, 
letting us out into a corridor covered 
with soft, green carpet. We walked 
down to his room, and he turned the 
knob. The door was open, and from 
the hall, we could see irito the room.· 
It was dark, and we apprehensively 
followed him into the blackness. I 
wondered where Edith was: .

beers and popped them open. He . 
dragged a heavy chair across the 
room, -cutting long veins in the nap. of 
the· carpet. He completed a circle ' 
with a:-velvet settee, and held out the· 
beers to us. ·

To many people around the coun­try,.Notre Dame is.often represented by symbols: perhaps the inost popu­lar and widespread; is the famous Golden Danie; covering the Admin­istrati~ii . Building.: Sacred. Heart Church is another,.. especially to 
, alumni, ind now the ACC symbolizes the Notre Dame image in. the col­legiate.. basketball ~orld.-But, to the myriad Irish football fans around 
·the country, it is the imposing arena where t~e football team plays its games that stands · the most for Notre Dame and its sports program -:-the Stadium.. ; . 
As afacility,.the Stadium is used solely. for football; it is a football showcase. No other athletes. walk onto that field except those dressed in-the pads and helmets of-the foot­ball team.· Notre ·Dame has: played some_ inspired and famous games .on the Stadium field: probably the most 
fam.otis of recent years is the Notre Dame_ victory' over ._USC in ·1973, 23-14, with -Eric. Penick's 65-yard run ,to clinch .the game, and ; this year's loss to Michigan State, 10-3, · which blasted the, team's chances for an undefeated season.. , ; , 
Physically, the stadium itself is an 

imposing structure-a half mile in :circumference and 45 feet high, it is -constructed ·of-bricks and California 
redwood-(for the seats), 400 tons of steel, and ,15,000 cubic yards of ·con­crete. Built· in 1930~ the Stadium still has the original sod of Cartier Field,.where Notre Dame didn't lose a single home game in 23 years. The first game played · on the Stadium turf was the Notre Dame-Southern Methodist game in 1930, won by. ND 20-14. · 
· The Stadium also encloses a rifle 
range, . a · calisthenic .area for the 
football players to loosen up before 
a game and a press box which ca:n 
hold 375 press people and writers. · 
The head of maintenance· in the Stadium· is Harold Benninghoff, who has been in charge since 1965. For him, the Stadium represents a some­times exhausting job, but one which keeps a symbol in functioning condi­tion. "We don't do -all that much during·. the winter,•~· he said. "It's nios.tly the preparation for the fall season,and·steady maintenance dur­ing the regular schedule that · occu­pies us most."--In'.the off-season, Mr. Benninghoff and his crew usually at­

· Stadium: repainting signs, repairing 
'seats and tasks of that nature. . Saturday mornings in the football season are the times when Mr.-Ben­ninghoff and his crew ·are · most pressed.· "We have· to cover or un­cover the field with the tarp'as the 
·weather dictates," he said. •"Plus all the details after the game keep tis busy:· . ..'Sunday morning is when my cleanup crew goes to work on all of the trash left in the Stadium. Usually it takes tis half a day; ... That's: a lot of ·garbage.''-Mr. Ben­ninghoff also ·mentioned the summer uses of the Stadium. Open from 8 :00 a.m; to 5:00 :p.m. for the public, it is often used for large conventions and meetings, · such·, as. the· Charismatic 
:Renewal held last year.: -· 
>As of-this writing the Stadium is empty,_ except for the football play­ers running up and down the steps to condition themselves for. upcom­ing spring practice. ,They· are. thP. only people in. that cavernous struc­ture which so many times in the past years-has-been filled to capacity.with 
-: fanatic .Notre Dame:fans. It looks einpty; waiting for the roars that fill itin the fall. Just walking around in it,Jooking at the barren field, seeing 
all the empty seats .leaves the ob.­
server with .-an expectant feeling; 
this ,field, should-,be crowded with 
cheerleaders, massed players, alumni, 
managers-::--everyone associated with· 
_the . whole, mystique of T_he . Game. 
The 60,000 se~ts should be filled with 
.the· eager, rabid Notre, Dame fans, 
!Oaring. f9r their athletes;: cheering 
f_c_,r. the sudden touchdown, , the long 
be>mb, the.breakaway. 
The· Stadium stands in its own 
section of the campus, fittingly. alone _as a symbol of Notre Dame athletics, . the ·spirit and verve_ of the Notre Dame image. With no one : filling those old. walls, it seems· a shell, a body 'Yi,thout a soul. But soon after ·the summer days pass, when we·are back in the autumn, the stadium will live again, full of the game. and people of a football weekend at Notre Dame. As one alumnus put it, "It's where the action is.'' And for · the· time· being,. the Stadium will be 
enjoying a well-deserved rest.

I have a friend-who is a jellybean connoisseur. She has made a study of, various breeds.of jellybeans: the

Only the lowest form of cad would disparage the 76-cent purchaser as a pinch-penny or fawn upon the 84­cent buyers. And although I per­sonally question the state of the tastebuds of those. who·. nibble marshmallow rabbits (pink!), I will. defend· their· right to do so (the. crazy loons). The selection of Easter candy is free from· prejudice. 
It is unfortunate that few seem to take the lesson of the jellybeans· to heart, to apply it to their daily lives. The secret is to care about de­cisions, to look with care at all their details so as to see distinctions, to be able finally to suit· our decisions to _our tastes..
