so comprehensive it does not fit any one definition but can only be 
described as unlimited excess and access -perhaps access to that 
which is better left undisclosed. 
With technology always on the rise, www.facebook.com (Facebook) 
has become a portal into the college community in a way that has 
never existed before. With the ability to post profiles, photos and even 
social events, most college communities embrace the versatility and 
breadth of the Web site. 
As one would suspect, Facebook has been used to implicate students 
in illegal activities and to confirm suspicions of wrongful behavior. 
Although this seems to be an invasion of students' privacy, the ad­
ministration is not legally unjustified in using this tool to monitor its students. At Notre Dame, any employee at the Office ofResidence Life and Housing (ResLife) has access to the same excess ofinformation as one's fellow classmates, since Facebook is a public domain. By posting anything and everything on Facebook, students leave themselves open to public scrutiny, particularly by those with the power to incriminate them for what they have so casually shared. 
Whether happy about it or not, Notre Dame students declare they will abide by the regulations set forth by the administration when the enroll. Violations ofduLac, whether public or private, are illegal on this campus and seriously enforced if discovered by university officials. To post such occurrences on Facebook is simply begging for administrative inspection. It is comparable to any misdemeanor committed; whether or not the misdemeanor is reported does not reduce the illegality ofthe action. In this sense, Facebook is simply alerting the administration to more of the violations on campus than were previously detectable. 
While students may see this rather morose outlook as similar to the "thoughtcrime" outlined in George Orwell's "1984," there is one fun­damental difference -the people are still empowered. What appears on one's Facebook profile is subject to what he or she places there, and the viewers of this material are at the discretion of the user. Any addi­tions to the profile made by another individual are easily dismissible. Facebook even offers user-friendly privacy settings to move profiles from the public arena to a private, personalized viewing sphere. 
The user essentially controls his or her own destiny and is capable of limiting what personal information is broadcast to the public. Ignoring the potential consequences ofpoor profile management will likely result in an undesirable result at some point in time. After all, it is one thing to admit a wrongdoing and another to draw attention to it. @

Spotting Fool's Gold 
Connecting the Media with April Fool's Day 
• Erin nobed:son . .. 
e exact origin of the phenomenon of April Fool's Day pranks 
s unknown but widely speculated. The favorite day ofpractical 
Jokesters everywhere occurs every year on April 1. The main aim of this day is to hoodwink unsuspecting family, friends and strangers by master-minding hoaxes and practical jokes. 
One speculation behind the origin of this foolish day comes from the observance of the mockery of Christ when He was sent from Annas to Caiaphas, from Caiaphas to Pontius Pilate, from Pilate to Herod, and from Herod back to Pilate again, preceding the crucifixion which is dated as having happened on April 1. Another origin comes from the observance of the vernal equinox in India. The last day of the festival of the equinox, April 1, was reserved for farces of grand proportions. Always cognizant of such opportunities, se"."eral media outlets partake in the fun. 
Some of the most outlandish and cunning jokes have played out in the media. Even the most reputable news sources have treated April Fool's Day as fair game for revelry. Spotting the latest slew of hoaxes has become an annual pastime. Burger King posted an ad in USA Today offering left-handed customers a Whopper with all condiments rotated . 180 degrees so the burger would drip from the right side. Numerous customers were fooled and asked for the new burger at chain restaurants across the United States. 
The advent of the internet has also helped pranks to propagate. One email circulated announced the internet would be shut down from March 31 until April 2 in order to purge "electronic flotsam and jetsam." In 1999, the music website Wall ofSound reported that Britney Spears was 11 years older than she claimed she was. Fans called her record label for 
confirmation. So, it seems not even Britney is exempt from April Fool's practical jokes. 

Ourvery own Notre Dame publications have tried their hand at producing farcical publications in honor of April Fool's Day as well. This phenom­enon has fueled spoofs such as "Sarcastic" and The Observer's "Ab­surder." There is no end in sight for the his­toric day that prank­sters know and love. @ 
Burger King is one of many corporations that has notoriously tricked its clients on April Fool's Day.

Examining the security issues encountered by Facebook users on campus 
I
0 ·
Daric Snyder 
n the opening days of the 2004 fall semester, the Web site www. facebook.com (Facebook) arrived at Notre Dame. Within weeks, thousands of Notre Dame students logged in for the first time to the now-familiar social . networking site. By the end ofthat semes::. ter, the site had conquered the majority of the student body. More than just a fad, 
the Facebook is now a fixture of Notre Dame social life. 
The usefulness of the site relies largely on its ubiquity, not only at Notre Dame, but at thousands of colleges and high schools around the country. With every­one 'connected, it is easy to keep track of old friends, new friends and even "friends'; · you haven't met yet. Beyond basic contact information, an individual's profile often tells a great deal about its creator's ac­tivities, interests, friends and classes. Last year, the site, which previously allowed a single profile photo, introduced photo 
albums, allowing users to upload and 
share pictures. Further, the albums offered a .feature known as "tagging," which allows users to label their friends in photos. 
This abundance offun and useful infor­mation explains the site's popularity. Yet, this same glut ofpersonal data can lead to unintended consequences when students get a little too personal. At many schools with Facebook, students are reluctantly discovering the troubles ofplacing seem­ingly private information into a surpris­ingly public realm. 
At North Carolina State University, students were brought up on charges of under-aged drinking when campus police found incriminating photos on Facebook. Louisiana State University removed two swimmers from the team after they in­sulted coaches in a Facebook group. At Syracuse University,·severaYstudents were punished for bashing a professor through the site. Pennsylvania State University used Facebook to find stu­dents who rushed the field in the post­victory frenzy after this fall's football matchup against Ohio State. Several police officers were injured during this chaotic incident. Students at George Washington University, aware that the site was monitored by· campus police, promoted a "death party" through the site. Those authorities arriving at the party instead found a "love party" with hugs for each incoming guest. A profes­sor at the University ofNorth Carolina weeded through profiles to determine which students would be allowed to take his class. John Brown

University, a strict Christian school lo­cated in Siloam Springs, Ark., expelled a gay stuµent after administrators were ,. led to photos .on Facebook of the student · dressed in dra·g. · · · 
Yet it's not just administrators and cam­pus police who are logging on to the site, but potential employers as well. Recently, employers admitted to checking the pro­files of recruits on Facebook and other social networking sites, such as www. myspacr.com. Aspect~ 9f an individual's

.. •, Could incidences like these hap­pen at Notre Dame? . ··•· 
There_is certainly enough in-.: ctirilinating information on the site to bring trouble to many Notre • • o 
Dame students. A simple cruise through random profiles turns up plenty of crude humor, praises of debauchery, .countless photos ofunder-aged drinking and liquor in dorms and other "evidence" that could be used to implicate students in wrongdo­ing. While information sha,red on Fai;:e­book may not'be particularlysurprising to the average college student, it may cause a number ·of people ·outside the student body with easy access to this information to take notice. 
Right now, there are about 18,000 Face­
book accounts at Notre Dame. Notably, 
this number is greater than double the 
number of undergraduate students here. 
Subtract current graduate students and 
students who hav:e graduated since the 
introduction ofthe site, and a substantial 
number of accounts still remain. Fake 
profiles, faculty, staffand less-recent 
alumni make up the remainder. 
Fake profiles, though in violation of 
the site's terms of use; which state that 

users may pot "create a false identity 
on the se'r-vice," are often added by 
students as a joke. A profile for Pope 
.Benedict X:VI or "24"'s,Jack Bauer 
may bi a· fun "friend" to add, but 
the existence of these accounts 
reveals the ease ofregistering an 
account on the S:i.te. The only 
requirement for registering a 
H2006 . 
new account is an nd.edu email address. Students creating spoof accounts usually take advantage of the multiple ways an email to their Notre Dame account could be addressed. This simple requirement, however, has a tendency to lure students into a false sense of privacy, considering the relative ease with which university officials can create their own Facebook account. 
"People get Notre Dame email ad­dresses for a lot of reasons," says Bill Kirk, ResLife isn't actively looking, other authorities, such as resident assistants, who often have close bonds with students under their responsibility, haven't been able to avoid finding info. 
Justin Doyle, a Dillon Hall RA, is Facebook friends with many people in his section and around the dorm. "The RAs looked at this at the beginning of the year," Doyle says. "We anticipated people would be careless with what they put on­line." Doyle says he tried to preempt any

This includes administrators, professors, hall staff and campus police. In addition, Notre Dame alumni also have accounts -alumni who may have ties to companies students could be trying to find jobs with. .. . . . "I've been on Facebook," Kirk says, "and some of the things students put online make me ask, 'What are you tl1ink­ing?'" Kirk acknowledges that he has an account with the site, hidden from public view. Other campus authorities, including some rectors, use the site as well, several with visible profiles. Kirk acknowledged· that some student leaders were upset to learn of use of the site by these authorities. "I explained we hadn't broken any rules. I didn't represent myself falsely by using the site; there's no need to. That information is simply out there," he says. As for ResLife using the site to hunt down violations ofduLac, Kirk says, "We don't go looking. We have enough inci­deuces come through the office as ids. We don't have the time." While ResLife may not look for students breaking rules on Facebook, Kirk stated that it would potentially act on Facebook information that was brought to its attention. Though 
choice, it gets online, and then • • • • it's out there." There are several things Notre Dame students can do to improve their privacy on Facebook. The site offers privacy set­tings, available from the "My Privacy" link on the left sidebar. The information· available only' to friends can be differen­tiated from an open; . public profile:. In addition, certain people, or en~ire groups, . such as staff; faculty and alumni, can be barred from one's profile. Although it is possible for anyone to register as a student, faculty member or an alumnus, these security settings can limit much of the content available to outsiders. A limited profile that hides certain infor­mation · from specific people can also be used. Photos have privacy settings as well; if someone uploads a photo tagged with a certain person's name, that person has the ability to remove his or her name from the photo. If a student is concerned about who might be looking at what is on his or her Facebook profile, the best idea rriay be to refrain from putting information on-line in the first place. Many are publicly posting information that few would have shared so openly a fewyears ago. Bill Kirk suggests that the dangers ofonline expo­sure may be good reason for "students to reflect on their behavior." @

News Analysis: "Theological Face-Off" 
Why won't the Cardinal Newman Society leave Richard McBrien alone? 
o David Poell 
ess than two months after a pre­liminaryinvestigation conducted by the University of Notre Dame theolog department dismissed an al­legation of possible plagiarism against the Rev. Richard McBrien, the Crowley-O'Brien Chair of Theology, the univer­sity has been alerted to another separate incident of possible academic dishonesty by the prominent theologian. This al­legation was brought to the attention of University President Rev.John I.Jenkins, C.S.C., in the form of a letter written by Patrick Reilly, the founder and president ofthe Cardinal Newman Society (CNS),

rather than unethical behavior; thatstate­ments ofregret and apology for oversight have already been issued; and that there is no previous instance to indicate a pattern requiringinvestigation." Another passage from Cavadini's letter that was included in the NCR report characterizes the CNS as "a militant right-wing Catholic interest group lobbying for the most stringent standards of orthodoxy to be used in courses and curricula at Catholic colleges and universities." 
Despite this rather unfavorable descrip­tion of the CNS, Reilly says that his dis­pute with Notre Dame chiefly concerns the univ~rsi:r's justificati,?n for dismissing

In_Janua~y, th~ CNS urged the uni­vers1ty to mvest1gate charges brought  
forth by a Massachusetts resident and the  
Catholic blogger Dominic Bettinelli, Jr.,  
that raised concerns aboutMcBrien possi­ 
bly committing plagiarism in the writing  
of~n article ent.itled ''.Banned in Boston(  
which was published m the January 6 ed1­ 
tion ofThe Tidings, the of~cial newspaper ofthe Los Angeles Archd10cese. Accord­ 
ing to a CNS press release dated January  
19, the CNS was concerned with passages  
in the article that were similar to those in  
an editorial written by Eileen McNamara  
entitled "Zealots Mask Real Struggles,"  
which was published in the Boston Globe  
on December 11, 2005. Both articles were

to p~ag~arize b~t did then it's no longer
plag1ansm," Reilly says. 
Reilly also disputes the assertion 
in Cavadini's letter that "there is no previous instance to indicate a pattern .requiring investigation," a claim that Reilly charges as being false given a book review of "Lives ofthe Popes" published 
in the July/ August 1998 issue of Books & 
Culture magazine by Notre Dame profes­sor emeritus of history, the Rev. Marvin O'Connell, C.S.C. In his review of the book, O'Connell cites examples of ex­cerpts in McBrien's book that bear simi­larities to passages contained in Kelly's book, "The Oxford Dictionary ofPopes." The presence of these similarities was acknowledged ap.d defended by McBrien himself in the February 10 edition of the NCR: "I have quite a few lines regarding my indebtedness to, among other sources, 
J.N.D. Kelly's 'The Oxford Dictionary of the Popes.' And in all the years· my 
30 MARCH 2006 

book has been out, I've never had any complaints from him or anybody else regarding misuse ofhis material." 
Yet for Reilly, O'Connell's book review constitutes a possible previous instance of plagiarism that should have been reason for concern among those conducting the investigation. "Cavadini said they looked into this background and said they had no prior concerns ofplagiarism. That's what caused us to produce this new documen­tation [ ...] It seems highly unlikely that Cavadini could not have turned this up and it's almost impossible that McBrien didn't know a colleague had accused him of plagiarism in a review ofhis book. So that's why we came out with this second instance. Itwasn't sour grapes in reaction to the prior complaint. It was to demon­strate that their dismissal ofthe claim was f;lse," Reilly says. 
According to the definition of plagia­rism as derived from the Notre Dame Academic Code of Honor, plagiarism is "the use of another person's writings, ideas, insights, analys~s and arguments without giving_proper credit .to the odgi­hal•·spurce;~i,)t~t!tedinically,•.•·plagiarisiµ;,i:

Notre Dame was justified in dismissing the first complaint ofpossible plagiarism, Scholastic consulted a linguistic expert by the name of Alan Perlman of Perlman Communications, Inc. in Highland Park, Ill., to analyze the two columns in ques­tion that precipitated the initial concern of plagiarism. In his final analysis Perl­man wrote, "I find no linguistic evidence whatsoever that Father McBrien plagia­rized his article from Ms. McNamara's article. The only linguistic similarity between the two texts is a quote that each writer could have obtained independently. I should note that the two texts introduce the quote with different wording. The two articles are, ofcourse, concerned with the same event, but the similarity ends there." Perlman added, "The Cardinal Newman Society's complaint that the structure, arguments, ideas and general theme of Fr. McBrien's article closely resemble those ofMcNamara's op-ed, at some points using near identical language to McNamara's, is completely unsup­ported by the linguistic data."

Given this silence, it is impossible for anyone to know the full story surrounding the particulars of the investigation. This being the case, it seems inappropriate for CNS members to criticize the actions of the university when they know very little of the inter­nal operations ofthe university. It is also slightly disconcerting that an organiza­tion thatclaims to be dedicated to uphold­ing a strict adherence to Catholic values in all Catholic universities would publish provocative, one-sided press releases accusing Notre Dame of impropriety without anything close to an airtight case. In doing so, the CNS has challenged the integrity ofuniversity officials ana dam­aged the reputation of a fellow Catholic, all with relative impunity.

unlikely that there is any way Notre Dame could satisfy the CNS's dissatisfac­tion with failing to address O'Connell's book review. Given McBrien's interview in the NCR, O'Connell's feelings on the book were well known, but apparently the university judged this isolated incident as insufficient to indicate any pattern of wrongdoing. Yet McBrien should take stockin the fact that "Lives ofthe Popes" has been in circulation for nine years without any accusation ofplagiarism from anybody save an activist Catholic group with a history of targeting McBrien. O'Connell's review noted strong si:tnilari­ties between the books, but he did not ex­plicitly accuse plagiarism, which is a very narrowly defined concept that typically requires more than the mere observation of some similar passages cited in a book review in order to merit a lawsuit. As McBrien notes in the February 10 article in the NCR, "If! were trying to hide my sources and claim as my own what is the work of somebody else, I would not be so up-front at the very beginning of the reface and in the acknowled ement of

athy Zhu is an average Notre Dame student in ~ost re~pects._ The sopho­more English maJor hails from the northwest suburbs ofChicago and resides in Farley Hall. But the unassuming Zhu stands out from the crowd -her novel, "Jade Butterflies," was published in 2005 and quickly became available from giant online distributors. 
When asked about how it feels to be a published author, Zhu says, "It's awesome. This has always · been a childhood dream ofmine. I just had no idea it would happen so quickly, and it took a while to sink in." 
"Jade Butterflies" is a young-adult novel set. in imperial China. Its plot focuses on Mei, an ingenious young girl who disguises herself as a boy in order to receive an education from an 
· academy in the capital city. She meets Shan Shu, another student en route to the capital, and the two become good friends during the course of the journey. Once at the academy, she discovers a terrible secretthat threatens to destroy China. Mei must risk everything and reveal her deepest secret ifshe is to prevent a horrible chain ofevents from occurring. 
Zhu has been writing since she was young,with continuous encouragement from her -mother. Begun the summer before her freshman year of college, this book was her first extensive project. As she continued writing, she decided to submit her text for publication. Prominent companies like Random House do not publish new authors, so she was forced to look for different options. She sent five chapters and a synopsis of the rest of the book to PublishAmerica, a publisher specializing in works by new authors, before heading to Notre Dame at the end of that summer. PublishAmerica accepted her manuscript on the condition that she finish the entire novel by January I of the following year. 
"It was really hectic," Zhu says. "I had to sacrifice mall trips and movies with my friends a lot of the time. I just had to manage my time really well. The trick is to write one or two pages every day and set reasonable goals for yourself." 
Although this book is geared towards young adults, Zhu would like to write for a broader audi­
. ence in the future. The goal o_f this book was to introduce Chinese culture to young Americans, although anyone interested in· Chinese ·history or culture would enjoy reading ''Jade Butterflies." 
A LITERARY LIFE Student author Kathy Zhu poses with her newly published novel,".Jade Butterflies." 
Living in China for six years ofher life allowed Zhu 
to present a more accurate backdrop for the story, 
an aspect of her writing that she believes to be very 
significant. 
Zhu is thinking about attending law school after 
graduation, although she also wants to continue 
writing. She knows that writing, as a career, is ex­
tremely difficult, but she believes it is something she 
will continue to do for the rest of her life. 0 
''Jade Butterflies" can bepurchasedatwww.barnesand­noble.com, www.amazon.com or www.publishanzerica. com. Zhu also has a box ofcopies in herroom that can be bought at a discount. Her email address is mzhu@nd.edu, andshe askstha_t anyone interes.{i;rl-in purchasing a copy of "Jade Butte'rflies" please not hesitate to contact her.

marie magdalene 
~ow !O get aring by spring in four easy, psychotic steps
presents: 
Is your love life a smaller, but somehow more tragic, version of the Hindenburg? Have all attempts at being fun, flirty and fabulous blown up in your face like so many Appalachian meth labs? Well, fear not, Ms. or Mr. Lonely Hea~t, for you still have almost two months until you walk across that stage and officially seal your fate as a dating leper. We here at Sarcastic/marie magdalene present to you these time­tested tactics toward ensnaring a spouse -protective orders and common human decency be damned. 
Step 'the /First:
.!Finding "'the One" 
Some of you might have that special person in the crosshairs of your love rifle, while others of you are still seeking a mate-to-be. If you fall into the latter camp, here are a few tricks to help you find your perfect mate. Take a look at the lady or gent in front of you: Are they slower-moving, elderly or ill? Do they get separated from the herd? Do their faded jeans bunch on top of their giant white.· sneaks? Keep in mind that the headiest perfume is the stink of unadulterated desperation. What does your lab partner smell like? 
Strive to have the strength and cunning of a lion as you descend on your prey romantic intrigue; Let the eviscerated body of an aged wildebeest being picked apart by jackals be a symbol for that ring that you so truly deserve. Perhaps you could have that image carved into an ice sculpture for the reception. Which you've already booked South Dining Hall for, right? RIGHT? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING?!?!? Get your head in the game, or you're going to end up spending every weekend for the rest of your life buying outfits for your concrete lawn geese and pra,ying for death. 
Oh, no, you're dght. We're sorry about that. Sometimes we just get so worked up over how magical your special day will be, we just want to burst into a bridal expo and start peppering it with machine gun 
CLASS OF 2006 
spray. Metaphorically speaking. From here on out, you can't waste your time with 1'learning" or "friends." The only learning you will do is the art of the proposal; the only friend you have now is 
Sarcasticlmarie magdalene. 
Some people, like the ladies of "The Rules" or the writers over at Cosmo, emphasize the importance of having a life of your own so that your mate will see how fun and attractive your life is even when he or she is not around. 
Wrong, wrong, totally wrong. We only have until graduation! WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOUR BULL$#!+. Your attention should be focused into a laser of love, strong enough to make your potential spouse's head explode, but gentle enough to almost unnoticeably alienate yourself :from all other aspects of your life. 
Step the Second: 
£gcation,£gcation,£gcation 
Constantly and, if necessary, forcibly steer your future mate to the Grotto to set the stage for a romantic proposal. Do not be fazed by inclement weather, the descent of night or the fact that your "future mate" is a terrified elderly clergyman that you abducted from the steps of Corby Hall. For the gents, the constant wearing of sporty, brightly-colored knee pads implies both a willingness to "assume the position" if given the slightest inclination by their companion, such as eye contact or being a woman, as well as the athleticism necessary to chase down any potential spouses attempting to make a break for it across the :frozen St. Joe's. 
Step the 'third: J\fothing Scary 
flout '[rue J:g~e 
Ml.ght we suggest a pregnancy scare? Thanks to the abstinence-only sex education in many ofour nation's schools, there's a pretty good chance your loved one will have no concept of whether or not you could even be pregnant. Can't you get knocked up :from a futon cover, or :from riding horses or something? We · heard that on TY.Just tell them that. For you fellas out there, this might be a little trickier, but appealing to higher power might get you a few credibility points. We know it would work on us, and has! 
However, if even this most compelling of ploys just doesn't work, might we suggest ... 
Step the /Fourth: </Jear 'fraps! 
During an emergency (and graduating 
alone would qualify as such an emergency), bear traps and other large animal snares usually can do your convincing for you. Some· might want to start out simply, with a pie cooling under a large box propped up with a stick, the tantalizing smell of which will lure your prospective spouse close enough to entrap him or her inside. 
However, this is neither as cost-effective 
(the pie-filling fee for this venture alone can be astronomical) nor as comical as bear traps can be. And while the possibility exists that your lucky lady or gentleman suitor could gnaw through his or her own leg before you can descend upon ·him or her to shower him or her with kisses, even if your special someone can get through the bone, odds are he or she wouldn't be able to make it back to civilization. So at least you'll have that. 
Remember, it doesn't matter whether you snag an unwitting, bespectacled underclassman or a 70-year-old math grad student. For just as the shifting of tectonic plates creates tons of pressure that eventually presses coal into the sparkling diamonds that nestle atop a wedding band, so must your future spouse feel the constant, overwhelming weight ofyour affection bearing down on them incessantly, squeezing them :from an unrefined mass of a confused and often terrified stranger into the most stunning lump of love -physical and mental -that intimidation has ever produced. Good luck 'ti! May, and see you at the chapel!

THE 
BTQ§n!t~!~hatGets Free Rent from the Universiry 
:Students, others eact postively, 
negatively, 
indifferently 
to what we're not exactly sure 
By April O'Neil 
Staff Amphibiophile 
Studentreaction to yesterday's events was largely positive, though a majority of students responded negatively. 
Senior Brian Poluznitzky came out to show support for the cause. "At this university, some things are really important, really worth fighting for," he says. "This is the least I could do to give something back to Notre Dame." 
But not every student was as optimistic as Poluznitzky. Sophomore Amber Tiffany says students must keep in mind that not everyone shares the same opinion. "A large segment ofthe population is not being represented, and that's a travesty," she says. "I can't believe this is going on at a Catholic university." 
Opposition to the events was stiff. Led by Kathryn Bluemeadow and Raisewagesa Quarter, students clad in chartreuset-shirts-SouthBend is completely sold out oforange and red -attempted a military coup on Main Building.

Spoiled students bitch about punishments they des~rved 
Administrators say boo-friggin '-hoo 
By Philly Dell Ph.at Beat Writer 
When Paddy McGillicutty arrived at Notre Dame, he didn't expect to be burdened by "discipline" and "the rules." So McGillicutty was quite dismayed when, during his sophomore year, he received a stiff fine and community service hours from the Office of Residence Life and Housing for sneaking a keg into his dorm room. 
"Dude it was total coochie snorcher," McGilicutty says. "That would never happen at Michigan State." There, he says, "You can drink all you want, just out in the halls, plus the girls are so much hotter. Notre Dame sucks." 
McGillicutty did not believe he should.have been forced to go to ResLife, as the evidence his rector used against himwas merely circumstantial. "Imean, it's notlike he sawus drinking out ofthe keg," McGillicutty says. "He just saw the empty shell out in the hall the next morning. How did he even know there was beer in it?" 
Dissatisfaction with the disciplinary process is notlimited to alcohol policyviolations. Freshman Lallie O'Hallihan feels that her being kicked out ofher dorm for breaking parietals was unfair. "I mean, I was with my boyfriend," she says. "It's not like I'm a total· slut who gets in trouble all the time." O'Hallihan suggests that her rector, a nun, was not acting like a true Christian by sending her to ResLife. "We have to listen to all this talk about forgiveness, but nobody ever forgives us when we break the rules just a little . bit," O'Hallihan says. 
ResLife's Will Lurk says he frequently hears such complaints, and he couldn't care less. "We are infinitely wiser than the students, and when we punish them, we're doing them a favor," he says. "They'll thank us when they're older." 


Question of the Day: Could this question be more i'nane? 




Viewpoint 
Homosexuals will be smote. The Bible tells us so. 
The Viewpoint section so often is filled ·with shallow, unsubstantiated and uninteresting arguments for or against the performance of"TheVagina Monologues," the color ofTheShirt, 
· the percen~ge of white people at Notre Dame, and the seniors' right to hurl marshmallows at football games. But one important topic does notgetcovered nearly enough: whether ornotGodhates 
. gay people. lsaythat He does, and to supportthis claim, I turn to God's own words in the Holy Bible. 
· Leviticus 20: 13 clearly states, "Ifa man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own hands." Homosexuals would do well to heed this warning; after all, the -laws inLeviticus have held our society together for the past 3,500 years.-Where would we be today without this law: ''Ofbirds these 
are they which you must not eat, and which are to.be avoided by you: the eagle, and the griffon, and the osprey." (Leviticus 11:13) I shudderto think ofa society in which griffon is a delicacy. 
Unfortunately, man has not ·always obeyed God's commands, ,suchas this one: "Do notputon a garmentwovenwithtwo different kinds of thread." (Leviticus 11:13) !think we all are aware of the disastrous consequences ofwearing poly-cotton blends. 
So it's time for gays to wake up and read the Bible. God has been . telling them for three and a halfmillennia that they are detestable to Him. If they do not change their ways soon, well, let's justsay 
. that God's a crack shot with a lightning bolt.

vocalist of the Canadian super group "The New Pornographers," to the work of 

the blues and country warblers who reigned 40 years ago. Case's clear and emo­tive voice is a gorgeous surprise, controlled and modulated perfectly alongside her carefully constructed songs, an aspect that makes "Fox Confessor Brings the Fl~od" so old it's new. 
Though her vocals are clearly influenced by the likes of Patsy Cline and Loretta Lynn, Case manages to incorporate and revamp many influential genres on "Fox Confessor." The only constant on the album is Case's lucid voice. Raised in Wash­ington state, educated in Canada and introduced to gospel and blues as a teenager, Case's influences are widespread and varied. "Fox Confessor" provides interpretations of the formulaic pop of the 1970s, seen in the concise and guitar heavy "Hold On, Hold On," to the Supremes-esque "Lion'sJaws" with its throbbing keyboard intro and harmonies. 
Case's lyrical style is as involved and erudite as much of"The New Pornographers"' work, always telling a story. Case covers childhood jealousy on the unexpectedly jaunty "Margaret vs. Pauline," and makes a quasi-political statement on the title track. 
Lyrically and musically, "Star Witness" and "The Needle Has Landed" are standouts on "Fox Confessor." With beautiful imagery-"nickels and dimes/of the fourth ofJuly/roll off in a crooked line/to the chain-linked lots/where the red. tails dive" -and the jazzy shuffle ofa brush on the hi-hat, Case constructs a lilting story ofan unspecified tragedy in "Star Witness." Case draws the listener in with the reverberating opening to "The Needle Has Landed," a look at love lost and returned, hinged on the uncommon metaphor of a needle of a record player -"the needle's the same that recorded and played/when you left me at the Greyhound the year I moved away/and ifl knew then/what's so obvious now/you'd still be here." 
Case's stripped-down vocals are an integral instrument in her compositions. The power of her voice is harnessed to amplify complex lyrical and musical arrangements. Though at times the listener wants Case to wail with emotion, there is a refined beauty to her carefully crafted songs. -Regz~za Gesicki

be too worried-the prices are within college-student range.Scholastic decided to sample the fajitas and the "Mexican Favorites" section of the menu, which offers burritos, tacos and enchiladas that would make ND students believe they are south of the border. 
The two popular dishes of the evening were the fajita de camaron and the came asada. The fajita dinner arrived sizzling in spices and juices, consisting oftender shrimp, diced tomatoes, robust green peppers, grilled onions and served with fresh tortillas. The savory shrimp, succulent vegetables and fresh sour cream and guacamole are a fresh alternative to the standard sea nuggets and grilled cheese at the dining hall on Lenten Fridays. 
The came asada also created quite a stir at the table. This well-seasoned thin steak was served with lettuce, tomatoes and other fajita necessities. The steak was tender and moist enough to be enjoyed alone but also was delicious when wrapped in a tortilla. The gorditas and burrito Mexicano were also crowd pleasers., served with fresh and appetizing guacamole which was a popular accompaniment to these traditional Mexican meals. 
Nuevo Tijuana is an experience that everyone should have at least once while at Notre Dame. During the visit, Scholastic en­countered another group ofstudents enjoying a meal. One member ofthe group even claimed the establishment to be the "most amazing restaurant in the world." · The restaurant is an experience ofMexican culture, from the ambience to the cuisine. The welcoming atmosphere, kind and obliging staff and excellent food are a refreshingly authentic spin to an otherwise dull and ordinary restaurant culture.

cpre-med and engineering majors 
are well known for their endless 
amounts of problem sets, lab experiments ,and· formulas. But the men of1716 Enchanted Forest in Castle Point have dealt with more than their fair share of lab time :an'd:-have decided to enjoy their senior yeari in style. And the most important elements of their off-campus apartment certainly do not pertain to chemistry or physics. 
"I think the formula for living a good life is a bar within twenty feet of you at all times, a ~gh definition projector television, .a .bunch of recliners, good food and a talking.:deer head," says Shane Kappler, one ofl:henve housemates. Kap­pler, along with, Evan· Curatolo, Michael Wittman, Patrick:Longenbaker and Tony LoGiuduce share this haven for relax­ing, partying an'd the generally excessive lifestyle that is a signature characteristic of this Castle Point apartment 
Upon entering the apartment's main room, the first thing that stands outis the 16-foot wrap-around bar,. topped with a custom slate and granite pattern, that conquers the space where a dining room would normally be. Even more impressive is the fact that the bar was entirely hand­crafted by the housemates. "Building the bar was. quite a journey," Kappler says. "Everything on the bar is handmade. We bought a lot of two-by-fours, borrowed some tools and basically built for a couple of days straight when we moved in. It's a great place for everyone to hang out and have fun." 
Behind the bar sits the television ,arranged cozily between shelves that boast an impressive collection of vari­ous drinks. The bar's TV is linked to a security camera over the apartment's front door, exposing all arrivals to those enjoying a series of libations. Clearly, the residents utilized their science and technology backgrounds to make this creative feature. 
Also behind the bar is a kegerator, which is stocked with a different beer on tap each night. "The kegerator was the first item we bought after we got the apartment," Wittman says. "For a while, it was the only thing in our whole apartment. 
.TAKING AYEAR TO KICK BACK They know how to lounge in style. 
When we moved in, our neighbors saw us bringing in nothing but this kegerator." 
Another curious decoration is Buck, a mounted deer head that looms over the bar, which moves and talks when spoken to with a microphone. "People think we're kind ofweird because we talk about Buck as ifhe were another roommate," Kappler admits. 
Next to the bar is the living room area, where the housemates relax in their four coordinated recliners side by side (remi­niscent of"Friends") and watch television on their 80-inch_projector television, complete with digital cable and surround sound. The living room leads out to the apartment's Astro turf-carpeted balcony, home to an enormous gas grill, torches, lights and the occasional round ofputting practice. The housemates grill out on their porch "pretty much straight through December," Kappler says. 
But these seniors do not just sit around all day. The spiral stairway leading to the

upper rooms is complete with a hanging basketball hoop ready for a spontaneous pick-up game in the living room. 
Arguably, the most impressive and unique part ofthe apartment hangs from the slanted ceilings above: two beer pong tables winched to the ceiling that can de­scend when needed. "Our physics profes­sor taught us the dynamics ofwinches and pulle~, and we went a little crazy with it," Kappler says. "We thought the idea up for the beer pong tables during the MCATs last year. When we were supposed to be studying, we were spending our time drawing blueprints for how to make these tables work-clearly we're not really the poster children for pre-meds." 
With elaborate accommodations for everyone's eating, drinking, lounging, TV-watching and socializing needs, the housemates seem to have transformed 1716 Enchanted Forest into the perfect party setting, meeting the goals of the apartment and its residents' indul­gences from the first encounter. "We wanted to make a place where all ofour friends could get together, hang out, be comfortable and have a great time," Kappler says. "We also thought, what would our mothers definitely not want us to have? And then we basically added it. A full bar where the dining room should be? A basketball court in the house? It's very much a guys' apartment, and we like to have some disregard for common sense." 
Although these lads were somewhat lacking in the social life department during their first three years at the uni­versity, the housemates are more than making up for it this year by creating and taking advantage of their entertaining and extravagant apartment. As Curatolo rhetorically asks, "When else in your life are you going to be able to winch some beer pong tables to the ceiling?" CS)

30 MARCH 2006. 
CSPN's Kirk Herbstreit picked the Irish at No. 1 in his preseason football prediction. That's about as intelligent a decision as a female high school senior choosing Saint Mary's over Notre Dame. On the other hand, a male stu­dent in the same position would be making the best choice of his life -think of the boob-to-Adam's apple ratio. The nature of college football predictions is in­herently flawed. Herbstreit said the Irish will be national champions, but a prerequisite for a national championship is that the school has to be part ofthe United State.s. With the current state of political insecurity, we don't even know where America's borders will be in January of next year. Mexico has had its eye on South Bend for a long time, although the latest rumor is that Queen Elizabeth II has discovered we're Irish and wants to assimilate the campus into the United Kingdom. There's a saying that you shouldn't count your chickens before they're hatched. The same can be said ifyou compare football teams to a human fetus. When a female child is still in the womb, you don't buy a wedding dress for her. You don't know how tall she'll be, ifher hair will be curly or straight or if she'll even have a date for her high school prom, which means she'll be more likely to wear white at her wedding, but also less likely to have a wedding at all because she might be as asexual as a houseplant. Spring predictions are dangerous because you never know what kind of chemistry a team will ... z have. For each team that feels fireworks every time

II polls be taken seriously? 

. efore I launch into this, let me clarify that I don't like Kirk Herbstreit. I'd put him one step below Lee Corso and one above Pete Carroll on my list ofthe top 10 people who make college football less enjoy­able than itshould be. That said, I have no problem what­, soever thatMr. Ex-Buckeye has recently released his picks 
· for this coming season's top five teams on ESPN.com. Why is it OK to make predictions about the upcoming football season in March? Simple: it gets everyone fired up. 
Fans of those teams that make the rankings now have bragging rights before anyone has· even had a full contact practice. IfHerbstreit is right, Charlie Weis and the Irish will be hoisting the national championship· trophy come January, .and that's reason enough for the likes of me to be excited (even ifl personallydon~t .thinkwe'll win italluritil 2008). On the other hand, fans ofteams left off the list can now walk around with chips on their collective shoulders. This will inevitably lead to confr9ntations with fans of the ranked teams. Dialogue between the sides will occur, bar stools will be thrown, broken bottles will be used to stab people and everyone will become much more informed on the 
issue. All thanks to pure, unbridled speculation. 
Now let's be dear that these rankings are riot to be taken seriously. How do we have any idea what injuries will occur during spring practice, what i~pact each team's incoming freshmen and transfers will ha~e, and how many Florida State players will be arrested. before the season even starts? We don't. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about it. And every discussion rieeds a starting point. Thanks, Kirk; I thirikyou may have just moved above Corso on my hate list. @
