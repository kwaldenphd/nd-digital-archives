American Studies and Communication Arts 
John W. 11:eaney American Studies 452 Foreign Views of America 
An1erican Studies 453 The American Cinema 
AMERICAN STUDIES 452 CONTENT: This course. a new one, will be primarily concerned with the analysis of the American character by foreign thinkers: . The primary purpose of the course will be an understanding ·of the more objective criticism of America. Close attention will be paid to the back~ound of the various critics in order to better understand their prejudices. 
ORGANIZATION: The course will be a seminar of fifteen to twenty student.5. There will be some papers attempting to relate the back~ound of the critics to the criticism. There will a midterm and a final. One major in-depth paper will also be required. 
.READINGS: A partial list includes: Tocqueville: Democracy in America; D. W. Brogram: The American Character; James Bruce: The. American Commonwealth; Jacques Maritain: Re­fiections on America; Jean-Francois Revel: Without Marx or Jesus. 
AMERICAN STUDIES 453 CONTENT: "The ·American Cinema" ·is a study of -American cultural and aesthetic values as evidenced in American film. Professor Meaney's intention is to see how much Hollywood, within its regular system of production, really reflects the Amer­ican character. The course surveys American film from the 1930's to the present. All the films are sound films, beginnings with "Ninotshka" and "The Ox-Bow Incident," ending with films of the sixties such as "Cat Ballou" and "Cool Hand Luke." The 

course is primarily composed of junior and senior Arts and . , · 
Letters students. but it is open to all. 
PJ!.ESENTATION: Dr. Meaney begins the course with' a brief. history of film·in America, but beyond this he does little-formal lecturing. The seventy minutes are spent in dass discussion_ of the fihru. The quality of these discussions is questionable. . . · . 
READINGS:· The only required text for the course, is Th·e Char­acter of Americans: a Book of Readings. The essays range from de Tocque~lle and Crevecoeur to contemporary American the­orists such as Margaret Mead and Benjamin Spock. Overall. the readings develop exciting cultural theories. However, the rela­tion of the readings to the films often seems forced. The threads tyirig the two together are rather dubious. 
ORGANIZATION: Professor Meaney closely follows the syllabus which is given to the students at the beginning of the course. Readings from the Character of Americans are required eacli · week in conjunction with the films. A term project is required; it can take either the form of a class presentation or a paper deal-. ing with any aspect of the American film or the American char:-· acter. Exams are given at midterm and endterm; both tests require analytical essays. The final grade is based on the paper,. the two exams, and on participation in class 'discussion. 
COMMENTS: Professor Meany shows a strong interest in.his stu­dents, as is evidenced by his knowing all of the forty students in the class by name. It seems that several _lectures on cinema 
techniques and cinema history are needed to extend stu·dent's ability to appreciate the work done by the filmaker; Dr. Meaney does· not work with these aspects of films, but rather with the . ideas conveyed. As it is, the discussions often lack depth, but it is difficult to know where the problem lies: A combination of a more forceful instructor's approach and more student effort might be the solution.

Ronald. Weber American Studies 482 American Utopias 
PREMISE: Individual ~istence in· America is suicidal in today's society, therefore we must explore aspects of communal life. 
-' t ­

CONTENT: This course is a ·one-semester American Studies elec-. tive that is concerned with an exploration of the communal vein of thought in the American mind.. As such, the title American Utopias might be misleading. The course, is not a study of literary Utopias, but rather a study of. an American trend of thought as brought out in actual communal experiments. The course, will start· off with the present _and work backward with the major emphasis being 19th century American communal ex­periments. Of particular concern will be the factors common to all 
· and their elements of success and failure. The course is theoretic­ally, open.to all, bui: will be limited to 15. 
READINGS AND. ORGANIZATION:-This coi:irse is new this year and wiH be very flexible. , It will start with a look at the con­temporary vein of thought'with re~ds to communal life. The basic sources for this -will be the film "Year of the Communes" narrated by Rod Steiger and William Hedgepath's book The Alternative: Communal Life in the New_America. Following this, each student will study. in depth one of the. better-known com­munal experiments (i.e. Brook Farm~" New -Harmony, Amana, Oneida etc.) The results of this individual study'(or possibly small group study) will be y.rritten up in a paper and presented to the class. Each student will be required Jo design, as a type of final exam, his own· commurial · society based upon a historical per­spective hopefully gained fro~ the course. Other than the paper and the final creation, there will be no papers and no tests. Other than several very short class. readings, each student will, more or less, determine his· own reading list dependent upon his interests. · 
_ PRESENTATION AND Cm,ri,1ENTS: As is rather obvious, -this course is -an extremely flexible· one. Since this. course is an exploration, 
·there will be no formal lectures. ·The success· of the course will depend upon the people in it working alorig with Prof. Weber to achieve some sort of synthesis. The course will be an unusual one for Prof. Weber. Unlike most of his other courses, there is no preconceived idea of where the course ,will ultimately lead. In all likelihood American Utopias will be almost completely composed 
-of Senior American Studies majors. 
Edward. Fischer . CA 450: Writing for.Publication. 
C~N'rENT: Just what th~ title says. Students'write articles with specific · publication· in mind... A stress. is ·placed on· magazine 
. writing. · · · 
, , PESENTATION: Prof. Fischer spends the first few weeks of class · lecturing on the fundamental of magazine writing. After that _the student begins to write his own magazine articles. During this period the students meet individually with Prof. Fischer to discuss their· individual ,projects. Class meets again near the last two weeks. ~f the semester to wrap things up. . . 
READINGS·: None.· 
' ORGANIZATION: "Students must_ write a minimum of two mag­' ,azine:.type stories that have been decently researched. In the past . 'Prof. Fischer usually arranged for publication of these articles with 
local magazines. This means that-the students also have to meet with the editors of these magazines to discuss the potential of their articles. Average grade is a B. · . 
CoMMENT: Prof. Fischer knows much about the publication and 
, THE SCHOLASTIC 

writing game and many of his tips may be helpful. But if you feel that you've got the-knack already,-stay away from this course. This course -doesn't really teach you how to write, it simply explains the techniques for successful magazine writing tliat have worked in the past. 
Ronald Weber CA 452: American Literary Forms 
CoNTENT: A-lecture course. A critical examination of contempor~ ary American literary forms-story, novel, autobiography, and literary non-fiction. Prof. Weber emphasizes matters of technique and the relation of the technique to cultural developments. 
PRESENTATION: The best you could -possibly imagine. Prof. Weber's lectures flow evenly from class to class and his style is most refreshing. Clear, lucid ang. right to,the point. His lectures grab you from the beginning. Simple to follow. Easy to under-
Economics 
stand. Simply the best lecture course available in this department and possibly one of the best in the university. · · 
READINGS: There are many, but all well worth reading. Flannery O'Connor.: Everything That Rises Must Converge; Hemingway: In Our Tzme; Bellow: Seize the Day; William Gass: In the Heart of the Country; Thomas Pynchon: Thi Crying of Lot 49; Capote: In Cold Blood; Mailer: The Armies of the Night. 
0RGANI2;ATION: There are several 1-2 page papers on each of the readmgs. These papers require a certain amount of individual thought, but Professor-· Weoer· leaves plenty of room to work within. One midterm and a final that is like none you've ever taken_. The final ties the course together and is basically an exercise that demands you demonstrate what you've learned during the semester. The average grade for the course is a :B. 
COMMENT: Don't miss it. This is one of the few courses you'll never want to cut. frof. Weber is that good. · 
Frank Bonello Economics 467 Medical Economics 
CONTENT: A new_ upper-division economics course, 'Medical Economics, will be taught next semester by Mr. Frank Bonello. The course will focus on the supply and demand of medical services and personnel. Comparatively, the demand for more and better health facilities, hospitals, dental care, doctors, nurses, and other types of medical personnel is increasingly more rapidly than the supplies of these services and personnel. The economic ramifications of this critical situation will be explored in Medical Economics along with various health plans adopted by the government, such as the Kennedy Plan. 
PRESENTATIONS: The course will be presented in lecture form. Mr. Bonello's lectures are clear and thorough. He covers in lecture all the material included on -1:iis tests arid maintains a 
· friendly rapport with his students despite a sometimes dry lec­ture format. Class size should be· relatively small, depending on student -response to the course. 
READINGS: The texts to be used are Medical Economics. and 
The Doctor Shortage. -. 
ORGANIZATION: The only_ tests will be a midterm and_ the final. One paper will also be required. The paper will be done by a group of two to four students on some topic related to an eco­nomic aspect of medicine, such as a comparative analysis of health plans, or a medical inventory of a South Bend hospital. 
H. R. Carby-Samuels Economics 463 Economic Decision-Making and the Black Experience_ 
Economics 481 Aspects of Economic Developme~t 
ECONOMICS 363 CONTENT: This course is an inve·stigatiori of how traditional economic analysis deals with the phenomena known as the:black experience. Much of the course is taken by studying the as­sumptions and implications which are a part of the analytic framework of economics. The rest of the course attempts to determine how this framework explains, interprets, or ignores · the experiences of blacks in this country. There are no pre­requisites for this course; non-economics majors are welcomed in this course. 
PRESENTATION: This is a seminar-type , course. · Mr. Carby­Samuels never lectures; rather, he enjoys coming to , class with "sticky" questions with which students must grapple. He forces students to think about the economic training they have re­ceived and to question what economics has taught them to assume as valid, for he will not tokrate glib or ideological resoonses. This style was at first disconcerting for the students because the questions posed were not easy to think through. Students eventually picked up his style and were much more comfortable in such a dialogue situation. ' 
READINGS: There are several (7) articles from different journals. which Mr. Carby-Samuels distributes to the class. For those who have not had economics (but this is advisable for even economics majors), he suggests some chapters from Economics by Lipsey and Steiner. There are two paperbacks to purchase: The Political Economy of the Black Ghetto by William K. Tabb and Symbols and Civilization by Ralph Ross. The readings present different views on the subject matter of the course and their qualities vary, something Mr. Carby-Samuels eventually points _out. There is no assigned deadline for the readings for he expects students to deal with their content all semester. 
ORGANIZATION: There will be two, possibly three, e.xaminations. As Mr. Carby-Samuels explains, they are for pedagogical pur­poses. On each exam there are three or four statements of which •the students must determine their truth, falsity or uncer­tainty.. Credit is given for one's explanation as there may be several answers. Also, Mr. Carby-Samuels requires a term paper-
ECONOMICS 481 CoNTENT: This is the first time this course will be taught. Basically, it will consider aspects of economic change (appro­priate title for the course) of countries of the world. It will attempt to identify sources of economic change and to study their effect in different types of economic societies. Such topics as criteria and determination for economic back-wardness, political power and the factors of growth, and the role of social institutions in economic growth wiir be considered. 
. PRESENTATION: The presentation should stay the same as Eco­
nomics 463. Mr. Carby-Samuels will continue with his perplex­
ing question-'and-dialogue approach. 
READINGS: At present two basic texts will be used: Develop­ment and Society. by Novack· and Lekackman and Economic Policy and Planning in Developing Countries by Joszsef Bognar. Mr.. Carby-Samuels finds these books "fascinating." 
ORGANIZATION: Papers and tests should be the same as in EcO: nomics 463. · 
COMMENTS : Mr. Carby-Samuels does not indulge in doctrinaire and ideological "cliches" and ·he does not tolerate it from his students. Nonetheless he makes one seriously question what economics entails and how societal values creep into economic analysis. Those who are looking for a course which really ques­tions. their social science foundations ought to take !!ither of these courses.

READINGS: The bulk of the course reading will consist.= of , CONTENT: The-course will deal.with:-all economic aspects of articles on reserve, but two paperbacks .will also be required: an ·underdeveloped. country and then these aspects will be ap-
plied to Latin America. · There. are no prerequisites for the course. It will probably 'be filled by freshmen in the college of Business Administration and by anyone who ·just . wants to.· broaden his background in economics. · 
PRESENTATION: Professor Jameson's lectures are primarily de­. signed to tie in the readings and encourage questions. · Also he likes' to. bring in current economic events. 
READINGS : · The· readings· of the course consist of three paper­backs:, The first book, by Nickson entitled Economic and Social Change, explores the macroeconomic topics of unemployment and inflation. The second book, Baldwin's Economic Develop­ment• and Growth, deals ·with the economic ·development of less developed countries.· The last book, by Wilcox entitled Econo­mies o(' the· World Today, compares different modern-day economies. 
ORGANIZATION: There· will be a short exam after the comple­tion· of each book. Also· a paper emphasizing one Latin Amer­ican country is required ·in a group effort. The final ~onsists of two essay ·questions. 
COMMENTS: The course gives a unique insight into under­development; not just in Latin America but all over the world. Professor Jameson is very demanding of his students because he causes them to think on their own. This aspect coupled with his imagination and thoroughness are course's principal assets. 
Stanley Masters Economics 465 . Economics of Race and roverty 
· CONTENT: This is a new cou:::-se, offering in Economics. The course will be· a study of what current economic analysis can 
·contribute toward a better understanding of the problem of racial discrimination and poverty in the United States. Topics include the theory of discrimination, empirical studies of dis­crimination in education, employment and housing, an economic definition ·of poverty, and an analysis of various policies · to reduce discrimination and poverty. 
PRESENTATION: Dr. Masters 'plans to use a combination of lec­ture and seminar in this course. Much will depend on the size of the class. 
' READINGS: There will' be no basic text. Dr. Masters plans to use journal articles and readings from various texts. He stated that the· reading list will be extensive but not overburdening. 
ORGANIZATION: Tentatively,· Dr: Masters plans to have a mid­term and final examination. These exams will. be essay · in nature. ; There. will, also be a term paper which will not neces­
. -sarily be a·· strict research ·paper; the opportunity will be open for students Jo do an analytical paper on some economic policy of interest. · 
· CoMl\IENTS: This coming semester. will be Dr. Masters'' first at Notre-Dame. He received his Ph.D. , from Princeton. and .has taught ·at Rutgers.· This semester, he' is on a research grant at Wisconsin. 
Thomas ·McDonagh, C.S.C. Economics 455 . 
·Lahor and the Law· 
CONTENT:· The contents'.of this cdu~se· co~ld easily'cover many years of academic endeavor; yet Fr.· ·McDonagh somehow man-. ages to integrate all the general aspects of labor unions into a one semester· course. Beginning with a brief• consideration of labor movement theory, and its ,objectives in a historical context; the course moves to an investigation of the present day labor union and its successes. Their achievements are viewed within the framework of actual labor union contracts. Next, the course covers all the major labor legislation from old English· statutes to an analysis of the National Labor Relations Act and the Taft Hartley Act with their implications. The second half of .the semester involves the student directly thru the presentation of actual court cases. Finally, the students are divided into· two sections comprising a general forum which considers the prospect of labor unions being subjected to antitrust laws and prosecu­tion. This forum discusses the legal, social, political, and eco­nomic aspects. 
NOVEMBER 30, 1971 
PRESENTATION: Fr. McDonagh is a capable instructor who has both the knowledge of and the interest in this subject. He welcomes controversial discussions and often provokes then by his strong bias toward labor unions. He ably guides and criti­cizes· the student presentations and the forum. 
READINGS : The readings consist of one large book. Labor Law, which is very "legal" and therefore detailed and tedious. There are also outside readings in the Law Iibra:Y on the court cases. 
ORGANIZATION: The only written assignment required is an outline of the labor laws in your home state. There are three tests, including the final, which are taken mainly from the lec­tures and class presentations. The final grade is based on these plus participation, presentations, and the number of cuts (don't cut very often). 
Coll!l\IENTS : Actually, this course is not difficult if you do most of the work, which Fr. McDonagh expects. . Labor Law is also interesting because of the diversity of subject matter, the degree of direct student participation, and the classroom discussion. No prior knowledge of economics or of labor unions is · needed for this course. . I would recommend it for anyone seeking know­ledge-historic, legal, economic, social-of labor unions in the United States; especially at a time when these unions are so powerful and controversial.

Economics 312 
Capitalist Critique 
CONTENT: ,During the past 10 years, our capitalist system has come ,under increasing fire from the radical left. Racism, unjust distribution of income, pollution, labor dissatisfaction. concen­tration of industry. and consumerism have all been blamed on rapitalism. In this course, radical economists who have been identifying serious defects in our svstem -many of them calling for its destruction -will be read and discussed. Liberal econ­omists who recognize the system's shortcomings but see remedies within the profit-seeking corporate structure will be considered as well. Professor O'Leary adds. "The thinking involved will be oolitical economics -questionine; the context in which decision making takes olace, _examining alternative proposals for economic organization. and coming to some judgments about the direction American society is taking. Instead of reflec­tion. on the plays that help win the game, the rules of the game itself ,vill be questioned." 
PRESENTATION: The course ,vill be of the seminar-discussion type. 
READINGS: All in oaperback. they include Tohn Galbraith's New Industrial State, Robert Heilbroner's Limits of American Capi­tfllism ..and Between Capitalism and Socialism, Avn Rand's Capitalism, Unknown Island, .Milton Friedman's Capitalism and Freedom. Lindbeck's Political Economv of the New Left, and parts of Up Against the American Myth. 
ORGANIZATION: By the very nature of the course, the discus­siom .:tnd re,idine:s won't be too tf'chnical. s" there are no nre­requisites and it is open to non.majors as well as majors. There are no oaoers. There will be two tests and a final. The work load will be moderate -Professor O'Leary would be satisfied if the student preoared about three hours for each 75-minute class.· Professor O'Learv added that if a student kept up with 
,the readings and contributed to the discussions. he could expect a fairly good grade. 
COMMENTS: Professor O'Leary is quite an interesting person. 
· ·He= was a member of the Milwaukee 14 who burned draft records in September of '68, and he spent the year from June '69 to ·June '70 in prison for his act of ·protest. In additi.on to economics, 'he also teaches here in the Non-violence Program. Professor ·O'Leary is very excitt"d about this course. 
•: · ·our country's solution to' all of its problems is to grow and to grow faster. ·It certainly is worthwhi"le to stop for awhile, and to' reflect what we· are.growing into, and what direction our !;O"' . ciety is taking..Professor O'Leary is a soft-spoken man, and the student -shouldn't e.xpect a booming orator who will dazzle him and scare him into studying-. If the student isn't already enthusi­astic about the problems of 'capitalism and isn't mature enough to make himsdf study, he shouldn't take the course. Otherwise, the chance to· stand back and judge our economic system plus the. opportunity to get to know a man like Professor O'Leary, 
· makes the course quite an attraction. 
John Roos and Thomas Swartz Economics 430 The Urban, Crisis: Political -and· Economic Analysis 
CONTENT: As the title of:the course. indicates,· the.pr~blems of the Urban Area will be analyzed both politically and economical­ly. Considerable attention will be given to such :areas as urban process and reform, elections, state aid, and taxation policy... 
PRisENTATION: Although some time will be given to discussion 
(depending on the constitution of the class) the: course. will· gain 
most of its structure from the lectures of both Roos and Swartz. 
READINGS: The books and articles utilized will be both political and economic in nature; and should not cost more. than $15. These readings should tie in quite ,vell with: the _basic format of the course. · · · · · 
ORGANIZATION: This course demands two . tests, a .midtenn, 
final, and a paper, each of equal weight. · Some attention ·will be 
paid .to class participation. · · · 
COMMENTS: Although. no information has be;;n: gathered ~bout Swartz, we know that Roos is both ,vell-infomied and . enthusi.:. astic about his field -the urban area. Roos is sharp with both insight and supporting data and will be_ insistent on driving his point home. Subsequently, the course will be of great ,value only if the student is equally serious in studying the complexities· of the urban crisis. · " · ·

Economics· 406 History of· Economic, Analysis-II 
ECONOMICS 225 CONTENT: This course is a one-semester analysis of. economics offered for the first time during. the fall semester. .Micro, Macro, and International Economics are not so· much condensed into the one semester·.as they-are systematically. scrutinized; _Dr. Worland emphasizes the. rudimental aspects ·of·economics with the intention of providing the student with a· 0 powerful • base on which continued examination of the economic system· may be built. The only prerequisites that a student need have to_ benefit from the course are 1) a curiosity towards the economy­and how it works, and 2) a mind . capable of conceiving the· abstract and applying it to economic analysis. This_ :s_emester the, class was a mixed· bag· of students, mostly sophomore· AL­buf with a great selection. of engineers; preprofe_ssionals, upper-. classmen,. a few politicians, two or three· gf:niuses,-two •girls and one jock. Dr. Worland emphasizes· that-for the second semester. the course will be directed purposely towards all sophomores regardless of college or interest. . . 
· · 
PRESENTATION: Professor Worland is ·brilliantly flamboyant and 
capable-of the··clearest analogy between .the abstract ..and.the·. 

concrete.· He is always prepared for the .lecture;· most ··often structuring. his delivery on the readings as a .foundation~-Even though his lectures·develop towards a particular econorilic_priri-: ciple, Professor :Worland will digress ,jf need be to explain, a·,· point or to con·duct -the· lively discussions which so often, 'lead . :· the students as a whole towards evolving an economic-truth -·011 .. their own. This capacity of Dr. Worland's in which the student·= .. clearly seems to discover economk· truths ·on his .own; is ,the'.· 
mark of.the ·genius inherent in his pedagogy. . 
ORGANIZATION: The one basic text used during the fall semester was .the only.source of complaint by Dr. Worland. The readings were such that they always required elaboration by the professor -· at times the discrepancy between the level of sophistication in the text and Professor Worland's presentation only proved that the .book was an insult to the class'. intelligence, considering the clarity with which· Dr. Worland would always explain the more complex ideas. For. the spring semester_ the professor, _has 

excellent investment at the price of $10.00 The only other cost incurred· during the year will. be for the·graph paper used once weekly. for the .take-home_. problems .. This.' homework should never require more -than an ·hour. of labor.. A longer period of time only implies that the student failed to· take adequate notes since .the principles required . to do· the homework are: always covered in class previous to. the assignment. Two one-hour exam­inations and. a. final. are ·given ·during· the_ semester. Class atten-. · dance for the sole purpose ofclass involvement: and the professor's notes. during lecture· ~annot _be overempJiasized. · As ·the bo<?k used this semester was only secondary. to the lectures, good· class not:es · are :th.e key to understanding. · The·· homework: problems 
'do reappear miraculously, on the tests with· the.,theory of each homework problem simply .reapplied .to. a. similar .test problem. The tests are based on concepts and, analysis of situations hence rote memorization is not really required. ·u a studen_t grasps the basics, the tests will be less demanding._· 
COMMENTS: : This cours~ co~ld .be :recom~ended for ' anyone who has been puzzled· by tlie . economic world: It ·is not a prob­lem course· concerned·.. strictly:. witl( balance-of-payments, total employment or poverty, yet".within the cqurse _of. every lecture . the many real-life:· failures 'and ·the few· successes of economics in tlie political, sociological, historical· aµd.· philosophical worl_d are examined. through .implication.-The ·situation really makes the student consider. the world 'around. hiin. A student of. any discipline could benefit'.enpmiously ·from Dr. Worland's course as long ·as he remained. consci~ntious .. ·. _ · . ·. 
Grades . for ·this semester . will be liigh'. according .. to . Dr. Worland. rn· the spring. the ~ourse will. be ·more vigorous and _tutorial classes for the homework.will be added to the professor's personal counseling. Taken with the introduction of.. a new· text, the grades could very. well improve •without any-"act11aliza-: 
· tion of diminished returns." , · · ·. · · 
One last comment: Dr: Worlarid is"·always open-minded; he never forces· a politicized solution: on· his ·students, yet he is· far from being indifferent to· the situation.of.the world today. Thus he 'maintains the true; learni~g atmospher_e of his course.

CONTENT:' The purpose of this' course -is ·to develop' a basic understanding of descriptive linguistics. The c_ours_e commences with-a-bit of Albanian humor and quickly advances mto the more difficult concepts of.phonology, morphology, and generative and trarisfoimational · grammars. The· problems in-the.-workbook provide , ample -opportunity for the -students either to secure_ a solid -•and. working understariding-oF linguistics or-to acqmre 
_ multiple headaches.,_ T~is is ~ St. Mar_Y's course: 
PRESENTiTION: Mr. Berberi displays a'great deal . of enthusiasm in endeavorincr to teach-a difficult subject in the easiest-possible way. ·He couples enthusiasm with a lot ofpatience. -Although he -spends mcist-'of the class time·in lecturejmd explanation: he never 
: fails to draw the stude'nts into active participation either through his questions or his humor.· He always wants the students to ask questions and to:go to him 'with any problem._­
--. -~ ' -. . -,
' 

READINGS:' The text for the course is John Lyons' Introduction to Theo-retical Lin~uistics~ but Mr. Berberi's notes far outweigh the importance of any text. -The second piece of reading material of ­import is H.·:A. Gleason's Workbook .in Descriptive Linguistics. There are numerous outside readings from books on reserve, two of which '( Origin and Development of 'the_ English Language by 
_Thomas Pyles and-Dialects of American English by Carrol Reed) require-outlines, suinmaries, and comments chapter by chapter. 
' ' 

0RGA;.IZATION: There are two exams with a difficult preparatory quiz prec'eding· each. In place of a paper there are two books to read, outline, summarize, and comment upon. There are constant assignments 'in the workbook which leave the students in a state of confusion and contemplating the purpose of it all. ·The stu­-dents find M'r. Berberi's presentations somewhat disorganized, and must piece together bits of information to obtain a composite· picture of the topic they are discussing.' They believe that Mr. 
· Berberi grades fairly, but his manner of grading leaves many in a quandary. 
COMMENT: The·· Education Department requires all aspiring teachers to take this course, which-no doubt explains the hugeness . of the.class during the fall semester. The students.are very fond of Mr: Berberi and have a great deal of respect for him. How­ever, they find the course bewildering'and cannot seem to discover 
. its purpose; the text remains a complete mystery. Generally, the _students feel that.they would_not take the course again,.and most -do .not .recommend it.

Separate--Peace;. Koestier, Darkness, At Noon; Kosinski, Steps; Lawrence Sons .and Lovers; Malamud, The Natural; Flannery O'Conno;,-Three; Vonnegut, Slaughterhouse-Five. 
-ORGANIZATION: There will be a midterm and a final, plus one re­quired_ paper ancl, one optional paper. ·There wil! also perh~ps be occasional q'uizzes,. the only' necessary preparation for which ¼'.ill be' the reading· of the novel itself. 
ENGLISH.570 . CONTENT: The course will deal with British literature of the late 19th century in and for itself, as well as in and for its antici­
-pation· of important strains in 20th Century literature.. Poetry, nonfiction prose; fiction, and drama will all be treated, as well as some attention given to the French symbolists. translate~ of course:_ There will also be some attention devoted to the gomg­ons in the graphic an_d p1:astic arts analogous to those in literature. 
READINGS: The following is a list of the required texts for the course. -There will also be a number of recommended texts. John Rosenberg, ed., The Genius of John Ruskin; Cecil Lang, ed., The Pre-Raphaelites and Their Circle; Walter Pater, The Ren­aissance;· J.K. Huyamans, Against Nature; Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray; Kare Beckiso,n, ed., Aesthetes av.d De­cadents; Mario Amaya, Art Nouveau. 
0RGANIZAT;ON: There will be a midterm and a final, as well as major semester project, usually taking the form of a term paper, and a smaller assignment, in the form of a short paper or a class report. Much consideration -and encouragement is given to creative treatments of the projects, its form not necessarily hav­ing to take the form of a paper. 
PRESENTATION AND CoJ\n,rnNT: Mr. Bizot combines a thorough knowledge of his subject matter with a strong desire for extensive student participation in the course and even in the determination of the direction of the course itself. When he does lecture, the presentation is logical, informative. and generally very interesting. Although the. notion has been so misused, abused and overused lately, Mr. Bizot nevertheless manages to successfully infuse a good deal of relevancy into the course, while at the same time being able to succes3fully treat the subject matter as the art work that it is. Much encouragement is given towards creative and self-rewarding pur~uits of the students, while non-creative-oriented and traditional-minded students can also find value in the courses. 
-Mr. Bizot places a great deal of emphasis upon the initiative of students and the actualization of this initiative, being able to simultaneously arouse the creative passions of a student ( too often allowed to remain unstimulated and undiscovered) and also to appeal to the student who grows mostly through the pas­sive reflection of other men's thoughts and lives. But, even with the _insight and interest that Mr. Bizot displays in the classroom, the .student wiJI·receive the most satisfaction from getting to know him outside of: the classroom. His interests are widely _varied, and he 'does _not e.xclude the student from sharing in these in­terests. He is a friendly, e.xciting and accessible individual.

The-Naturalistic• Novel 
CoNTEN:r:• The_-Natiirali~tic 'Novel i~ con~erned with-the growth· of ·naturalism and the changing relationship between the author's view of reality arid his _expression in form. The movement in-_ volves itself-with tlie issue of man's ,freedom, and the degree to 
_ which .he· is· capable of·self-:determination and moral responsibil..: ify. .While there are· no prerequisites for the course, .the nature of the-material requires both enthusiasm and a willingness. to cope with the ideas presented by the various writers. ­
'PRES~NTATION: The course _is presented' in lecture-discussion , fonnat; depending on the students' response to the material. The · -class-· determines to some extent 'the atmosphere in the class­room.. Dr. Brennan encourages questions and points-of discussion,. . and: is extremely understanding and helpful toward his students 
outside' the 'classroom as well. ­
· O~c~-i:i~zATION: The papers i~ -th~ co~rse ~pproximate 20 pages~ -and the:_individual'student may: di9ose. to:_write eith_er one intro-­ductory paper-( 8-10 pages) and-two shorter papers (4-5 pages), 
or five of the shorter papers. There is no midterm and the final is usually a take-home essay of a general topic in the course. 
READI:KGS: Chosen to trace the development of naturalism; the readings are tentatively as follows: Zola, Germinal; Crane, selec­tions; Norris, McTeague; Dreiser, Sister Carrie; Sinclair, The Jungle; London, The Sea-Wolf; Anderson, Winesburg, Ohio; DosPassos, Manhattan Transfer; Farrel,, Studs Lonigan; Faulk­ner, Light in August; Wright, Native Son; Steinbeck, The Grapes of Wrath. 

CollD1ENT: Dr. Brennan's course comes highly recommended to the interested and thoughtful student. Although the reading appears a bit burdensome, the novels are on the most part enjoy­able and essential to an understanding of the period. Dr. Brennan brings with him an insightful approach to the works, and in tum encourages the students to probe far beyond the surface level of the novels. 
Eugene Brzenk English 312 The Education Novel 
English 465 Victorian Novel· 
ENGLISH 312 CONTENT: The course studies the novel genre which is variously called the "Bildungsroman," the novel of development, the novel of adolescence, etc. The books deal with a central character maturing with a growing awareness of the world and how the hero searches for a meaningful individuality within some sort of social context. The readings range from British and Amer­
.ican to German and French examples of this particular novel type. 
READINGS: A minimum of nine novels is required. The class will study about six in class while the remaining books are chosen by the student. You are encouraged to read· a novel in its original language, but all novels can be read in translation: Tentative list includes Fielding's Joseph Andrews, Stendhal's The Red and the Black, Butl~r's The Way of All Flesh, Ander­son's Winesburg, Ohio, Joyce's A Portrait of th.e Artist as a Young Man, and one novel by Hesse. More than sufficient time is given to read the novels. · 
ENGLISH 465 CONTENT: The course ·will present a panorama of the Victorian Period and examine the craft of typical novels of the time. Mr. ~rzenk has taught thi~ course before on the graduate level; as m the past, the class will be supplemented by reports and discus­sions on his lectures. No prerequisites. 
',, . 

READINGS: As in English 312, there will be a minimum of nine required novels, six of which will be read by. all class members. These_, six will _be the_ follo~ng: Tha~keray's Vanity Fair, Bronte s Wutherzng Heights, Dickens' Oliver Twist, Trollope's The Warden (or) Barchester Towers, Eliot's The Mill on the Floss,. and ·Hardy's Jude the Obscure. · 
PRE~ENTATI~N_: Mr. Brzenk's 11:ctures are informal and usually require a.mm1mu~ of note-takmg. He encourages students . to ask q~estions which can start an interesting class discussion.· Also, m the past, students have given reports of a particular aspect of the course which was not studied in class. Mr. Brzenk yvants a student to investigate a particular aspect of the course m p_apers ~~ :eports. This makes the two courses depend heavily on md1~dual response. The individual research is, per­haps, the most rmportant part of the course and is worth while. 
0R<:AN!ZATION: In_ both c~mrses each student is required to read nme novels, six of which all class members read in com­mon. Other works are chosen as the basis for class reports and payers. English 465 will have three papers (5-8 pages each), a midsemester, and a.final; English 312 will probably have the S3l1lle-The student 1s encouraged to read on his own and with httle secondary references to use as a crutch. Final grade 1s based on papers, oral work, and finals. Average grade: B. 
qoMl\l~NT: Mos_t believe Mr. Brzenk open to all intelligent ':e~ouits. I think that the courses depend largely on the in-, d1v1~ual student who must incorporate Mr. ·Brzenk's concen­trated· lectures and class discussion with individual research. Most found Mr. Brzenk's courses worthwhile. This reviewer ­would take him again not only for the course content but also in order to be with a courteous, helpful, knowledgeable and a very humane person. 
Patrick Callahan English. 461 Literature of the French Revolution 
CONTENT: Next semester will 'be. the first time this course is taught at Notre Dame, though certain·elements of this topic were dealt with in one of Callahan's earlier courses, Non-Fiction Prose of the Romantic Pertod. The emphasis will center on the British reaction to the French Revolution, but the continental atmosphere and the Rousseauvian influence will also be examined. 
PRESENTATION: Prof~ssor Callahan -anticipates a small class, and plans to enlist each student in a particular project that will cµl­minate in· a class report. Lectures on the many· readings will provide background-and insight~ if Callahan treats this course with the same enthusiasm that he di.splayed in his Science Fiction or Romantic Poetry sections. A thorough knowledge of the his­tory of the period·will not be-necessary, since lectures _will suffi­ciently supply the historical infonn~-~~on. 
READINGS:. Mr. Callahan describes his reading list as "moderate to heavy" though it is.justified by the extent of the treatment he nlans to give to ·the topic: The emphasis is on the non-fiction polemic of Edmund Burke, Thomas Paine. Dr. Richard Price, William Godwin, Mary Wollstonecraft and Thomas Carlyle, with "passing attention".paid to such minor figures as Sir James Mack­intosh, Thomas Holcroft and Jo.seph Priestly. Also, an examina­tion of the poets and artists involved in the issue of revolution will involve readings in Blake, Burns, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Shelly and others. A few assignments will involve .the use of microfilm resources in the memorial library. . 
ORGANIZATION:· Besides the individual projecCalready mentioned, there will be two or three short -papers, a mid-term and a final. The average grade is estimated to be in . the B to B-range. 
CoMll!ENTs: Enthusiastic about whatever he teaches, this course will be no exception to the thorou~h and extensive treatment Mr. Callahan always attempts.. However, :value gained from this course will require an interest in the period and of this parti­cular subject. 
Carvell Collins 
English 482 
Melville 
CONTENTS: The course will consider ·about six of· Melville's 
· novels and a number of his short stories. A :previous course in .American Literature ;is .usualli prerequisite but can be waived. The class is normally made up of about twenty junior and senior English majors. 
· PRESENTATION: Mr. ·collins seems less concerned with critical analysis as such, ·more interested in considering the works. by 
-way of the reader's responses. Therefore, individual participa­tion becomes pretty important. But Melville's works especially demand an honest response, so seminar participation cannot be 
. forced. Mr. Collins' unpretentious style allows for just this, kind of atmosphere in which Melville's stories can be experienced honestly. The seminar doesn't work, however; uniess each person brings a similar open attitude. 
READINGS:. Students will read about six novels, · including: Typee, ~edburn, Whitejacket, Moby-Dick, Pierre, and Billy Budd, Sailor. Also a number of shorter works including "Benito Cereno" ·and "Bartleby, the Scrivener." A selection of Melville's poetry will also be given to seminar members. 
ORGANIZATION: The seminar meets once a week for three hours. Class work includes discussion, one oral · report during the semester, and one seminar paper. Grade is based on the paper and class participation. 
Co.MMENTS: Reading Melville can be a greaf person.al adven­ture. But because Melville can't really be taught and· must be experienced, coming to an appreciation or und.erstanding of the author's works demands a lot of the reader as· an individual. In a real sense_ reading Melville requires a responsibl~ and straight.:: forward attitude. The reader should really have an honest sense of himself before embarking on the: great voyage. 
THE SCHOLASTIC 

Donald Costello English 595 ~1odern Drama II 
CONTENT: :Modem Drama II examines theatre from Brecht through contemporary theatrical experiments. Drama is examined in the course as theatre as well as literature in a probing analysi~ of the way in which fifteen modem playwrights order the chaos of modem life, with special emphasis on what is peculiar to earh artist's method. Although the concentration is on individual plays and playwrights, Mr. Costello's lectures provide continuity to the semester's work, relating each artist to the general trends of th~ modem theatre. 
PRESENTATION: The quality of discussion depends largely on the preparation, interest and enthusiasm of the students. This past semester when discussion lagged, Mr. Costello altered his usual open method of approaching the textual material and assigned general thematic and structural questions about the plays before the students read them. The discussion immediately picked up. M'r. Costello's method is fluid enough to adapt itself to the capacities of his students. 
RE_ADINGS: . Heavy. Appro;_imately 45. plays: Four British play­wrights (Ehot, Osborne, Beckett and Pmter); Six American play­wright (O'Neill, Wilder, Williams, Miller, Gelber and Albee)· Five Continental playwrights '(Brecht, Ionesco, Genet, Weiss and Handke). In addition the art of the modern film as it is related to the development of modem drama.will be examined in Fellini's I Vitelloni, La Strada, La Dolce Vita, 8½ and Juliet of the Spirits. . 
ORGANIZATION: There are three exams during the course of the semester. each requiring a close textual and structural analysis of the plays. Exams are usually in-class, but ultimately fair and they become real learning experiences, where the student can 
apply his  developing  tools  of imagination  and  analysis.  The  
final grades are not average grade is a B.  especially ,  high,  but  they ·  are  fair. .  The  

CoMMEN_T: Modem· Drama II ·is recommended to anyone who has _a seriou~ interest in modem drama and, more significantly, an interest m how the modern artist (and modern man) ap­proaches his disjointed experiences with reality and gives formal order to them in his art. One comes away from the course charged with a sense of the beauty of language and theatre of the creative possibilities of modem man. Mr. Costello's br~ad knowledge o~ Modem Drama allows him to thoroughly initiate the student mto the world of the modern theatre even in the limited time available for the study of each dram~tist. 
Walter R. Davis English 345 Shakespeare 
CoNTEN:: Mr. Davis envisions .the c~urse as an introductory explorat10n of Shakespearean drama for those without an exten­sive knowledge of Renaissance literature. Because the bulk of the· class wiU probably have only a general familiarity with Shakespeare, the course will depend primarily on lectures. 
Although, Mr. Davis has not made a final decision about which _'plays he will consider, the tentative list includes the Henry IV· tetralogy, A· Midsummer-Ni~ht's Dream, The Mer­chant of ~enice, Much Ado About N~thing, As You Like It, Twelfth Night, Measure for Measure, The Winter's Tale The T~mpest, Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth, Antony and Cleopatra, and Coriolanus. The lectures will deal first with the History plays and then pro­ceed to an examination of the Comedies, Tragedies and Romances. Any complete edition of Shakespeare will suffice, although Mr. Davis recommends the Complete Pelican Shake­speare published by Penguin Books. · 
ORGANIZATION: There will be a midterm and a final. In addi­tion each student· will be able to express his ideas about Shake­speare~n drama in two or three short papers (5-6 pages) and one term paper (10-15 pages). 
COMMENTS: Excellent is the word that best describes any course taugh by Walter Davis. An outstanding scholar, a fine lecturer and a first-rate critic, he can make even a survey course like this a.valuable experience. It lias been a while since Mr. Davis last taught Shakespeare, but no student should doubt his knowledge or ability in this area. Harvard University has invited him to 
conduct a similar course during this year's session. 
If Mr. Davis gives excellence, he also demands it from the 
students. The examinations will be difficult. The papers will be 
even more so. However, Mr. Davis is extremely accessible to his 
students and he always proves to be a great aid to the bewil­
dered, the ignorant and the seekers of knowledge. 
Richard Detlef 
English 449 
Milton 
CONTENT: The main concern in this course is with Milton's craft as a poet, recognizing that any informed judgment on his art would involve aspects of his cultural situation. In this con­nection, members of the class will be asked to take up a number of general topics as they relate particularly to his thought and art. These will include not only issues with which :Milton was occupied, but also developments in literature and the other arts which illuminate his achievement. This is a St. Mary's course. 
PRESENTATION: The dass will be conducted mainly as lecture commentary and discussion, with tutorial hours later in the seme­ster. 
READINGS: Prospective students will save time by reading Vir­e:il's Aeneid over the holidays (Mr. Detlef suggests the C. Day Lewis translation). He would be happy to suggest a few books. to those who would like to get some feeling for the seventeenth century before the course starts. 
ORGANIZATION: One short and one long paper, mid-term and final exam. 
Cm,n.rENT: Fritz Chrysler once said, "Laughter is the foundation of :ill worthwhile knowled~e." T~ough 1'fr. Detlef would never so severely chastise that "hoary puritan" he would approach his dark and trembly work with an agile eye bright to anything humorous. Students of his celebrated Chaucer classes found his entertaining lectures cunnine:, thorough CA-positions. Since Chau­cer is a requirement at SMC and since most students sport a Catholic upbringing, many at first hold prejudices against the poet. Through Mr. Detlef a profound understanding and lo,.-e for both Chaucer and the Middle Ages develop. Milton, while not Detlef's specialty, is an area of deep fascination for him assuring that his extensive mind will more than amply en­hance the material concerning the subject. The work load, as far as reading goes is heavy yet the student under the influence of DetlePs readv enthusiasm probes into the lifetime and works of the author. His approach enables the student to leave behind 20th ' Century prejudice, traditions. and idiocy for that of the poet's age. Once·this leap is made the poetry expands and re­verberates for the student. 
James F. Doubleday English 512 History of _the English Language 
CONTENT: English 512 is being offered for the first time this semester. The description that follows is Prof. Doubleday's­"There are three principal objects in this course. First, to gain at. least a minimum knowledge of linguistic terms and prin­ciples. (It is impossible to talk intelligibly about the historical development of any language without a certain minimum linguistic vocabulary. No linguistic knowledge will be assumed at the beginning of the course; but a good deal will be asked, . without apology, by the end of it.) Second, using these terms and principles, to investigate the changes in the phonology, ~orphology, and syntax of the English language from the set­tmg of Engoiand by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes to the present day. Third, to examine a number of topics in history of lan­guage, such as the following: the concept of a standard lan­guage, and how such a language developed; the model for the high style, the source of the colloquial, and the ways fue two differ, and the reasons for studying both; and the relevance of historical linguistics to language study." , 
ORGANIZATION: There will be short papers, one long paper, a midterm and a final exam. Professor Doubleday expects most of the grade to rest upon the two e."<ams and the long paper. He would recommend the course to any student contemplating teaching English. 

NOVEMBER 30, 1971 
READINGS: Three major texts-A History of the English Lan­guage, by A. B. Baugh; The English Language: A Historical Reader, A. C. Rigg, editor; and English and Its Histor11: The Evolution of a Language. 
J. P. Dougherty English 579 American Non-Fiction Prose 

CONTENT: Mr. Dougherty's theme in this course is man's en­counter with the new world and nation. The emergence of America, the "Virgin Land" of Henry Nash Smith, was a n_ew hope for man; a mound of clay from which men could fashion their dreams. This course will follow the problems and struggles our forefathers faced to make their dream a reality. The four main authors studied in this encounter are Henry Adams, Ralph ,,raldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau and Benjamin Franklin; The works of these men form the core of the discussion, with the other readings, from Jefferson to Francis Parkman, supplying historical, economic and political views of this encounter with the 
. promise of America. 
PRESENTATION: The format of the course will be either lecture or discussion, depending on the size of the class. In either case, however, the structure wiil be quite informal, as Mr. Dougherty is always warmly responsive to questions and student participa­tion in the learning experience. 
READINGS: The four main works for the course include: The Education of Henry Adams, Selections from Ralph Waldo Emer­son, an Organic Anthology, Walden and Other Writings, and Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography and Selected Writings. Other ,books include: Crevecoeur's Letters from an American Farmer~ 
W.E.B. Du Bois' The Souls of Black Folk, Two Years Before the Mast, by R.H. Dana, The Federalist Papers and Jeffe~son's Notes on the State of Virginia. Thomas Paine's Common Sense, and Parkman's The Oregon Trail will also be read. The total cost for the books is $14.40. 
ORGANIZATION: Students will write a research paper on one of the four main writers discussed in the course, _and also a shorter pa.per or verbal discussion on another work encountered during the semester. There will be no final exam. 
COMMENT: This course seems quite ambitious in its variety and length of readings, but for. those who have had Mr. Dougherfy in class, this ambition is a challenge. He chooses the readings carefully and they are an important part of the learning experi­ence, especially in the class format Mr. Dougherty presents. He does not force the readings down the students' throats, but ex­pects them to chew and digest them with care in producing a satisfying experience both .for the student and himself. Mr. Dougherty is thoroug~ yet not vindictive in his correcting student papers, and his comments ·are also part of the experience. The course is a good one. and Mr. Dougherty is very competent in this field. It all adds up to an experience, the foundation of the American literary experience with a man who is very conscious of his students' awareness. · 
Joseph Duffy English. 421 Tragedy and the Literary Tradition 
CONTENT: This course is·not concerned with giving the student a run of the mill glimpse of tragic plays. Indeed, the ·scope of the course is mind-boggling but is nevertheless achieved. Mr. Duffy not only deals with the major problems of tragedy; but also treats each work as a literary whole. Thus, one· will en­counter the idea of a-tragic sense, its history, its meaning, and 
· finally, its subjectivity, along with viewing each work in temis . of language, · style, image, and metaphor. , . 
ORGANIZATION: The course is almost entirely lecture due to the fact that discussion is rarely viewed important enough by ·the students to interrupt Mr. Duffy. The work is demanding, both in reading and writing. There will probably be one fifteen page paper, three demanding take-homes, and a synthesizing final. 
READINGS: A philosophical work by Unamuno, The Tragic Sense of Life; Homer, The Iliad; Aeschylus, The Oresteia; Sopho­cles, Antigone, Oedipus the King, Oedipus at Colonus, ·Philoc­te~es; Euripides; Alcestis, Hecuba, The Bacchae; Shakespeare, Kzng Lear, Macbeth, Measure for Measure, The Winter's Tale;_ 
Tourneur The Revenger's Tragedy; Racine, Brittanicus, Phaedra_: Chekhov 'The Sea Gull Uncle Vania, Three Sisters, The Cherry Orchard,'. O'Neill, Lon; Day's Journey into Night; Pinter,. The Homecoming; Brecht, Mother Courage;· Genet, The Screens; Beckett. En</game, Act Without Words. 
Col\lMENTS : it would . be, 'ridiculous, b~ring, ·and inane for me to try tp compete with the many myths already concerning Mr. Duffy; both ·as a man and as a teacher. Let it suffice to say that any course taught by Mr: _Duffy, especiaUy Tragedy, is an un­parallel_ed experience... . 
Donald Gutierrez· English 314 _ . . Introduction to Engli_sh Li_terature II 
English. 491 B 
Modem. British Literature II 
ENGLISH 314 CONTENT: This survey course in English literature, a continua­tion of English 313, begins with ·the _Romantic poe'ts and termi­nates in the 20th century. · · · 
READINGS: Selection of poetry, drama· and fiction from the Nor­ton Anthology_ and a ~ovel yet to _be chosen. 
ORGANIZATION: Semi-formal lectures and :discussions, a mid­term and final exam, and one to two papers of moderate length. 
ENGLISH 491 B CONTENT:. This course continues the survey initiated in English 491A (not a prerequisite). -Beginning with Forster's A Passage to India and the Twenties poetry of Sitwel.l and McDiarmid, it goes on to ·consider selected ·poetry, novels,· drama _and non­fiction from the Thirties into the Sixties. 
READINGS: Saunders, et· al., editors, Chief Modern Poets of England and America, (Volume I: The British Poets); Forster, A Passage to India; Orwell, ·Burmese Days,· Homage to Cata­lonia; Waugh, Decline and ·Fall; Greene, The Power and the Glory; Cary, The Horse's Mou_th; Amis, Lucky Jim; Lessing, The Golden Notebook; Pinter, The Birthday Party; Eliot, The Cock­tail Party; Arden, Sargeant Musgrave's_ Dance. 
ORGANIZATION: Formal and semiformal lectures and discussion, a midterm and final, one ~o two critical papers, and a short oral report on a literary work not on the required reading list. 
COMMENTS: The readings are all excelle~t and Mr. Gutierrez is eminently knowledgeable and oersonable. This is not always sufficient to guarantee a good· course, however. Mr. Gutierrez' lectures .are.not overly s·timulating ·and he is not adept at gen­erating discussions. The quali_ty of the course then depends very much upon · the quality, interest and efforts of the students 
enrolled. · ­. The course is very definitely a survey. Mr. Gutierrez attempts to -pro.vide exposure to all the main works. of the imp,ortant 
_authors o[ the period (including authors and works not.on the reading list). He also presents a wide variety of critical.opinions and at least ·mentions . all the important . aspects of the works covered. _In this writer's opinion,'more is attempted. than· can be successfully accomplished.

Lo~i~:,1.Hasley 
. English 379 . American Literature of the Westward Movement 
CONTENT: The course will study the imaginative literature deal­ing with the westward· movement of Americans from the first settling. Progression will follow the literature westward as it deals with section~ of the country from the Atlantic to the Pacific 
coas·t. · · · · · 
PRESENTATION: Professor Hasley's knowledge of the books and .the. authors provide very interesting and informative lectures, but these comprise only 30% of the course. These discussions . allow the student to use his power for independent thought,.but 
usually never get very deep. · ·The lectures are directly related to the tests, and students' participation in the discussions will help in preparation for the ·tests. 

THE· SCHOLASTIC 
READINGS: There are 12 requir~d readings. Included in these are The Grapes of Wrath, The Octopus, a selected Mark Twain,. The Big Sky, Giants in the Earth, The Bear, and N-0rthwest Passage\ The readings are !aken in an order .coinciding to the development of the country westward. · · 
ORGANIZATION: Two papers totaling 2000-2500 words, and two half-period quizzes and_ a midterm· and final. Papers ··are short and graded on form and content. The quizzes are short­essay type., and the longer exams deal with the major works in the course. -·A ·100-point semester is used and grades are based on the students' total points out of 100 according to the Uni­versity curve. Average grade _is a· B. 
COMMENTS: J:he course was very enjoyable even though the readings did· get heavy at times. Professor Hasley has selected a group of veiy interesting authors which follow· closely the theme of the course. · · · · 
John.Huber . English 433 
Arthurian Legend 
CONTENT: A study of. King Arthur beginning in Celtic mythol­ogy, chronicle history. and pseudo history, and French tradition: Sir Gawain and· the Green Knight, the alliterative Morte D'Arthur, miscellaneous romances, and Malory. There will be excursions into legends in other languages, particularly the stories of Tristan and the Holy Grail. Although the course will consider historical and mythic aspects of the legend, the main consideration will .be with individual works studied as conscious literary creations. The course will look beyond . the Middle English period to try. to find reasons for the decline of interest in the matter of Arthur during the Renaissance, and occasional reappearances .in later literature. 
PRESENTATION: Although class time will be more or less con­fined· to works of the Middle Ages, students'• reports may venture into Arthurian· literature outside of the . period: Tennyson, Arnold, Wagner, T: H .. White, Broadway or Hollywood, for example. Readings in modem English translation, , with some Middle English supplements. 
READI~Gs: Bre~gl~ ed. Arthur of Britain; Geoffrey, History of the Kings of Britain; Malory,-Le Morte D'Arthur, tr. K.· Baine; Brian _Stone, tr.,. Sir Gawaine; Beroul, The Romance of Tristan; Gottfried von Strassburg, Tristan; P. M. Matarasso The Quest of the Holy Grail; R. S. Loomis, The Development ~f Arthurian Romance . . · 
. . . ORGANIZATION: Take-home quizzes, short paper and oral report, long .paper, final exam. . . · 
COMMENT: Mr. Huber specializes in Old and Middle English and should kn?w this area as well as, if not better than, anyone on campus. His rapport with students is excellent and he is well · lik'ed by all his dasses. It should, however, be cautioned that although he is liberal in his views of class attendance and edu'­cation, the material should ·not be taken lightly. He is a serious scholar and likes to see the student take his studies in a similar manner. 
Harold Isbell English 307 Writing Poetry 
CONTENT: Students will· submit·a· poem every week which will be mimeographed, distributed among the class, and discussed. Nor~ally, the s_tudent deci~es up~n the topics of his poetry, but occasionally assignments will be given. Comments in class come mostly from the students. and deal with rhythm, rhyme, and style m general, as well as with the meaning of the poem. Mr.. Isbell sometimes begins the discussion with his own comments, and also attempts to clarify some of the comments of the students during class sessions. This is a St. Mary's course offering. · · 
READINGS: The New American Poetry edited by Donald Allen. 
~RGANIZATION: One poem per week, the length of which.is un­1m~ortant. The poems are not marked and no grades are given unt_1l the e~d of t~e semes!er. J:Iowever, students· may discuss their work m a pnvate sess10n with Mr. Isbell. Poems· may' be turned in-late on occasion, as. long .as it does not become an 
NOVEMBER 30, 1971 habitual practice. There is no cut policy. However, grades will suffer if absence affects the quality of the work. Students should expect at least five minutes of the class time to be consumed with stories and anecdotes by Mr. Isbell that seldom have anything to do with the course. . 

COMMENT: A good course for anyone aspiring to verse writing, as there is very little pressure. Students will appreciate the open and relaxed atmosphere. However, only those truly interested and sincere in their . want. of writing experience should register for this course. 
Thomas J emielity English 328 · Satire 
English· 403 Religious Experience in the Eighteenth Century 
English 554 Eighteenth-Century· Prose 
ENGLISH 328 CoNTE~T: This course is designed to thoroughly acquaint the student with the genre of satire. As typical of any Jemielty course, this means the student will delve deeply, not just in the writi~s themselves, but in the author's viewpoint, social forces acting upon him, and finally, a personal evaluation of the writer and his work. It will run from the earlier works of Juvenal and Horace to the modern ironies of Brecht and Becket. The ex­cellence of this course, however, rests mainly on Mr. Jemielity's own awesome display of ironic wit. The beauty of this wit being that he makes you think first, then laugh. Accordingly, no stu­dent. should let these barbs intimidate him or he may run the risk of forfeiting not only their humor but insights. 
READINGS: Austen, Pride and Prejudice; Beckett, Waiting for Godot; Brecht, The Threepenney Opera; Dryden, Selected Works; Horace, The Satire and Epistles of Horace; Johnson,. Rasselas, Poems and Selected Prose; Juvenal, The Satires of Juvenal; Pope, Selected Poetry and Prose; Swift, Gulliver's Travels aand Other Writings; Voltaire, Candide; Vonnegut, Cat>s Cradle, Mother Night, Slaughter-House Five: Or, The Children's Crusade; Waugh, Handful of Dust and Decline and Fall. · 
ORGANIZATION: The course will probably be lecture, although J emielity is never adverse to questions. He is not hampered by timetables as much as he is interested in the student actively participating with the material. There will be at least two six to eight page papers, and possibly two exams. Attendance is voluntary as long as the student keeps up with the course. 
ENGLISH 403 CONTENTS: . This course will deal with the problem of the reli­gious experience and its influence on man's search for happiness. Specifically, it will consider institutions, personal versus public cosmologies, the dynamism of good and evil, and probably any other serious topic that will add insight, either to the course or the student's own life. The course itself is new, but this will be compensated by the fact that Mr. Jemielity knows the Eighteenth Century as well as most of us know our name. Finally, Jemie­lity's own enthusiasm with the course's intent will guarantee a worthwhile semester. . 
READINGS: Mr. Jemielity will draw from the following authors: Blake, Johnson, Swift, Voltaire, Bunyan, Gibbon, and Hume. A complete reading list can be obtained from G-11 in the Ji.: brary basement. · 
ORGANIZATION: The course will be based on one or two student presentations each class period. From these presentations the student will be expected to submit one or two formal essays. Jemielity has structured courses like this before; the result always being most rewarding to both student and teacher. 
ENGLISH 554 Cm;iTENTS : The course will be pre-occupied with studying four ma3or concerns of prose: fantasy, satire. history and biography. It can be expected that these concerns will be synthesized with the writer's life as well as his time. . 
READING: ~oswell, Life of Johnson, London Journal; Gibb~n. The Autobiography of Edward Gibbon, The Portable Gibbon, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire; Johnson, Rasselas, Poems, and Selected Prose; Samuel. Johnson: A Collection of Critical Essays; Swift, Gulliver's Travels and Other Writings, Swift: A Collection of Critical Essays Twentieth-Century Inter­pretations of Boswell's Life of Johnson. · 
ORGANIZATION: The course will probably consist of· a lecture/ discussion format. A number of short papers ( 3-5) will be assigned and possibly one major (15-20). It .should be noted that undergraduates should not shy away from this course due to its level. It is no secret that Mr. Jemielity feels undergrad­uates often redeem such courses. Finally, if should be added· that a student's satisfaction from such a course depends largely on his willingness to participate in discussion. . 

CoMMENT: These are all fine courses as is Jemielity a teacher. He does not mollycoddle students with. affirmative nods of the head, but instead demands that they think for themselves. Ac­cordingly, the student develops a sense of confidence from this first hand experience with the material. Above and beyon& these teaching capabilities, Jemielity is a good person to know. His availability and readiness to talk to one makes such an acquaint:­anc1: ~asy for the stu~ent. And consistent with his teaching, Jem1ehty never patromzes but always relates to one as· a mature an~ intelligent person. Finally, Jemielity's wise and easy going attitude towards everything, including himself, is a refreshing study. 
Sister Franzita Kane English 420 Literary Theory and Criticism 
English 317 Introduction to English· Literature, II 
ENGLISH 420 CONTENT: In Sr. Franzita's own words: "This course is con­cerned with theory, not with the practice of criticism. It does seek to learn the relationship between . tneory and . criticism, if any does or should exist. It is not a history of major. theories. It does seek to isolate and explore a few basic and endurinu problems which have_ to do with the artist, the,artistic procesl the art work. The aim of the course is to enable· the student to develop his own di!>ciplined mode of theorizing about literary problems. The student has the opportunity to consider'·such prob!ems as The Relation of Art, Nature, and Society; Art as Makmg, as Expression, or as Communication; The Nature of the Aesthetic E>..'l)erience; The Poet. The Creative Process The Poem." This course is offered by St. Mary's. ' 
·P_RESENTATION:· Sr. Franzita's has .been the only course of this kind offered on either campus. in recent.years, and she has:had the benefit of working with students as interested in this field as she. Having been involved in theory and criticism in such a way, she is more than "qualified" to teach this course. . She fully realizes the danger in teaching one course so often and avoi_ds lapsing in!o mere recitation, talking with rather:· th~n to t:Jie cl~s.· l}ie s12e of the class ~hould be small enough to fac;i:­htate dIScussion. When Sr. Franz1ta does lecture it is only'in the hope of providing more material for thought• and debate. . As t~e qu3l-1ity <.>f a course of this nature· rests largely on in-:class d1scuss10n, an even,-though not.necessarily detailed familiarity of each student -literature and art is expected: · Di;cussion will center on assigned readings, but Sr. Franzita wishes most .of all to draw out personal ideas and theories from the members of the class. ·· · ­

ENGLISH 317 Co.NTENT: A study of the major writers of "Engiish Literature" of the 19th and 20th Centuries, including Joyce ~Yeats ,Pound and Eliot. Though there will be some treatment of drc:ma and the novel, this course deals primarily with the poetry of the time. 
_The poems are t?. be read as individual creations, but the,_stu­dent should examme the way in which some works constitute.and characterize a particular literary · movement. · He should also come to understand some of the chief literary modes and artistic 
concerns which change or which continue from the 19th to the 20th Century. 
PRESENTATION: . Any course in which there is.~ much to cover and which is usually accompanied _by a Jarge-·sized class demands a fairly strict lecture schedule. Sr. Franzita utilizes class time to give wholeness and form to what the student is expected to study on his own. She d~~s. l_ier.work; _anyone· wishing to LEARN from her must do his..There is never time to cover all in class, but Sr. Franzita welcomes.the opportunity. to talk' to and assist the stu­dent at times other than during.class. -. ­

COMMENTS: Sister Franzita's personal touch is all that is needed to make any course enjoyable. She brings a· full and well-aged experience with her and is eager to ·share all with her students. She has been kown to ramble on occasion, but these times often prove most pleasurable of all. However, the material is eventually covered, and well. It is ·hard to think of Sister Franzita as a "scholar". though that she is. : Rather, one thinks of her as a person with ·unusually sensitiye-feeling for life, letters, ·and art. For the student with interests in these areas and those of the t~e two courses•Jisted-above; I can recommend no professor more highly. -: . -. . · · .-­

ORGANIZATION: There are·nq tests. The grade-is based on two sh_ort papers, a class report, and a series of weekly exercises done with the computer, culminating in. a semester project in which a_ll the computer operations practiced _so far are applied ·to a smgle poem, and an essay is written interpreting the re_sults.

PRESiNT,\TION; Mr. Krier's lectures are_ intensely personal excur­sions,. and are. completely unique. He rarely bows to quote ·a critic~ and as totalities, his lectures are truly one of a kind. Class discussion is .frequent, lively, and often as rewarding_ as the lect-. ure. · 
READI_NGS: This semester, too much Faulkner and Hemingway, so Mr. Krier will cut down to one book per author, plus new .works by Cooper and Brautigan to be added. Others used are Fitzgerald's Tender_ is .the Ni!{ht, Updike's Of The Farm, and Saul Ilello,v and Kurt Vonnegut... 
--~ -­

ORGANIZATION: Three papers ·of medium length determine the semester grade, and it is good to. have them in on time. The third paper is due during exam ·week. 
COl',fMENT: This is .a first rate course by a first-rate mind. I discovered Mr. Krier by accident, and this commentary is ,vritten so you can discover him on purpose. If the purpqse of teaching is to raise the· consciousness of both student and teacher,· and you do not believe that it happens even occasionally, take this course or his new one below and change your mind. The result of this experience is that you begin to expect more and more from your education, and are dissatisfied when it doesn't deliver, and that dissatisfaction is a good thing. 
ENGLISH 405 CONTENT: Mr. Krier will involve himself with the novelist's attitudes toward his own craft in this new course. Letters,· pre­faces, worksheets and reviews will be a supplerr,ent to a. selective reading list designed to bring out· the writer's view of the novel both as a liternry form and a personal experience. 
READINGS: Tentatively projected • readings include works by Robbe-Grillet, Kafka's Metamorphosis, Proust, James' The Am­bassadors, Dickens' ·Our Mutual Friend, Bronte's Wuthering Heights, Austen's Emma, Melville's Mob')' Dick, and Defoe's Moll Flanders .. 
0RGAN_IZATION: -One can expect the same three-paper format that Mr. Krier uses in most of his courses. 
· David Luisi' . English 382 American Literature Since 1900 English 387 American English to 1900 
ENGLISH 382 CONTENT: A general survey-of American literature: that will begin somewhat before ·1900. Since.Whitman was covered in the first semester, it will most likely begin with the reconstruction era. Mr. Luisi tends to concentrate on those authors who are of great­est interest to the class. He frequently delves into areas of con­troversy that stimulate student reaction at the same time he gives insight into the author and his work. He is particularly adepLat giving brief but lucid summaries of authors' philosophies. ·James, Dickinson, Hemingway Dreiser and Faulkner will dominate much of the semester. 
PRESENTA~ION: Mr. Luisi encourages but never forces class dis­cussions.-' His lectures are well organized, thought provoking,-but always open for scholarly criticism. He· demonstrates,great know-. ledge of both subject matter and historical background. This course is offered by St. Mary's.

text. Mr. Luisi will sometimes distribute hand-outs to clarify and emphasize certain important points. Co?.U.tENT: The classes are demanding but enjoyable. Mr. Luisi conducts himself comfortably in class and always manages to main­tain a serious but light atmosphere. He has an excellent rapport with the students and is always open for criticism. My primary criticism of the workload is that too much falls due at the end of the semester. The tests constitute a large portion of the grade and should not be taken lightly. Attendence is not rigorously enforced, but students attend of their own volition more than gen­erally expected. This is largely due to the fact that the lectures and discussions are interesting and enlightening, and Mr. Luisi gives historical insight to unify · this large body of literature. Good grades must be earned, but are not uncommon. The average grade is B-. 
John Matthias 
English -327­
Poetry 
English 407 Writing Poetry 
English 499 Contemporary Poetry 
ENGLISH 327 CoNTENT: This will be a first time course for Mr. Matthias and he is at this time not absolutely certain as to how he will conduct it. The course is a.. poetry genre course and as such will not particularly focus upon one period. Rather the course will basically employ a study of contemporary poetry to illustrate universals concerning poetry. This is an elementary course and as such will deal with beginnings and basics. 
PRESENTATION: The course will be primarily a lecture course with class particapation invited. The writing of poems by the students will be required as Mr. Matthias feels that by writing. by at­tempting the thing, that one best gains a knowledge of poetry. The professor assumes no previous knowledge and will proceed from there. Along with the writing of poems, critical writing will be required. Readings will include anthologies, criticisms and single volumes of poems to stress the importance of the single volume over the anthology as the primary vehicle of poetry. This should be the ideal course for one wishing to hone his individual sense of the genre. 
ENGLISH 407 CONTENT: This· is not Mr. Matthias' beginning writing course, but an advanced course exclusively concerned with the serious­minded writing and examination of accomplished and/or finished poetry. The course will provide the time, and hopefully the space in which to do this. This course is not for the student who thinks that he would like to try and write some poetry. As a prerequisite one must have completed POETRY WRITING 307 
· and have submitted to Mr. Matthias, well before preregistration. a manuscript of at least five poems that have been written since the end of the elementary course. By registration Mr. Matthias will have posted a list of those to be included. Exceptions will be made fo these prerequisites, and anyone so interested would do well to see Mr. Matthias about it. 
·PRESENTATION: This is the second time that Mr. Matthias will be teaching this course. It becomes the logical extension of the 300 ievel writing course. All, including the professor, are seen as equals in the field of the course. In this light: things proceed in open~ended and sometimes almost endless weekly disc;ussions as each poet's work is taken up individually at least once for an 
·_ extended period of time. The time of the course will probably not be as advertised-the class will decide on a proper time at the first meeting. 
ENGLISH 499 CONTENT: A tracing of the trends· in Contemporary poetry, beginning with the work of the early modernists (Jones, Eliot, Pound, Stevens, Williams, Crane. etc.) and moving though the various reactions against and extensions from modernism to the present literary scene. 
PRESENTATION: This course is anchored in Ivfr. Matthias' ex­cellent knowledge and sense of contemporary poetry. Two semes­ters ago the course was primarily a seminar interspersed with excellent introductory lectures. The course wilI proceed through general introductory-materials, to an overview of the early mod­ernists-( you should have at least three early modernists texts read before the first week or so of class is up) and into a detailed con­
sideration of the various movements ( anti-modernism, confes­sionalism, marxist oriented poetry) and schools (projectivism, deep-imagists) of twentieth century poetry. Mr. Matthias' solid academic background, coupled with his personal knowledge of poetry and contemporary poets makes this course work. Also, the course provides the rare experience of being able to study poets who will be_ reading and attending classes during this year's Sophomore Literary Festival. 
READINGS: Matthias, 23 M-0dern British Poets; Carroll, Young American Poets; Hall, Pack & Simyson, New Poets of England and America; A. Poulin, Contemporary American Poetry; Olson, The Distaii:ce; Duncan, The Opening of the Field. No tests as such will be given. Writing will consist of 2 (5 page) reviews of new books of poetry, 1 {5 page) review of a literary magazine over the past five years, and an anthology of your own making justified by a five page introduction. 
Hart Crane. Although no specific pre-requisites exist the course 
is designed for junior_ and senior English majors. This is a 
St. Mary's course.­
PRESENTATION: Presumably the class will be small enough to develop as a seminar. with large student responsibilities. Mr. Messbarger's: style of lecture is slow-paced, but always· well pre:-. pared and informative. He welcomes student's contributions to the classes, and is always willing to suggest further sources of in­formation or provide help to the student.· 
READINGS: Norton edition of Leaves of Grass and Anchor edi­tion of Hart Crane. · · 
ORGANIZATION: Students will write two short papers and present two reports in class. ·There will be a final exam. Grades in Mr. Messbarger's classes are just,. often high. 
COMMENT: Mr. Matthias is a dedicated and thorough teacher. The questions and concerns taken up in these courses take on an added dimension, for they are just as, if not more important, to Mr. Matthias' work as a poet as they are to his work as a teacher of poetry. The intensity of the courses are an outgrowth of the . man's dedication to his art, as well as his dedication to those who wish to know of poetry and come to terms with it. Through this he possesses the ability to communicate a necessary (for modem poetry) first-hand knowledge of his subjects, and impart to his students a real enthusiasm for the literature he teaches.

ENGLISH 459 
CONTENT: Studies in the development of the· novel from Defoe 
through Jane Austen. Preliminary attention to the backgrounds 
of the form in romances, both English and French. Primary 
focus upon the novel as a form, rather than upon· the ·authors' 
ideologies, with inductive emphasis upon the contributions of 
individual writers to the development of the genre up to and 
slightly_ beyond the century's end. 
READINGS: Included in the following: Selections from Sev,enteenth-Century Prose.

Cm.1_MENTS: Mr. Martin sp~aks authoritatively fro~ a compre­~ens1ve ~~wledge or the subject. taught. His· style of teaching 1s an exciting one, his understandmg complete, which· allows for an enjoyable classroom experience. He is not the teacher to take unless you are willing to keep up with the assignments· which 
are, as he is, generally-fair.· · · ·

CONTENT: .This particul~ se~inar ----new .thi~ year_-_· will be· a study of the major works of Whitman and _all :the poetry·of 
C0?,1MENTS: Students wiship.g to gain the maximum from Mr. Messbarger's lectures should do a reasonable amount of reading on their own, in addition to the primary material of the course. It is left up to students to pull together ideas from the classes and readings jn order to define the trends of American literature. An opportunity for expressing these perceptions is the final exam. Because of Mr .Messbarge_r' s background in American Studies, he is able to provide the class with a large amount of supplementary material, including popular culture and political developments of the period studied. This factor, along with the nature of the material, will no doubt make the course very worthwhile. 
John J. McDonald English· 419 Twentieth Century Criticism 
CONTENTS: Beginning with Ezra Pound, T. E. Eliot, and ·1. A. Richards, the course will go on to treat several schools of twentieth-century criticism in survey fashion -suggestively rather than definitively. Points of interest on this tour will in­clude Freudian and Jungian· psychology methods, the -New Humanism, the New Criticism, Chicago Critics, Marxist Criti­cism, Historicism, F. R. Levis, the criticism of fiction, and, finally, Northrup Frye.. The first three critics and the last one will be considered indispensable. The others _will receive as much attention as time and class interest allow. 
PRESENTATION: Class time will be about equally divided between formal lecture and discussion. ·· 
READINGS: Litz and Lipking, Modern Literary Criticism: 1900­_1970; Wellek and Warren, Theory of Literature; Frye, Anatomy of Criticism. · · 
ORGANIZATION: An hour exam, a final, and one paper of about 2500 words ( ca. 15 pages). · 
COMMENTS: . Mr. McDonald. has a .rare enthusiasm for the 
materials covered in his courses. Although his lectures are con­
scientiously prepared, he never slips into mechanical recitations; 
his presentation is informal. · 
Students with a fondness for discussion should strongly con­sider this course for Professor McDonald does not consider discussion as an exchange in which the professor has the final word. Rather, he views it as a dialogue and encourages; even pleads for, theories different from ,his own. . 
Althowrh the work load will not be excessive, Mr. McDonald is very demanding• as to the caliber oI papers he receives from his students. Consultation with him prior· to writing the paper is helpful and very advisable. . · . . . . . . . 
Norman Michaud _ English 322: , Novel · 
CoNTENT: A study of the aesthetics of madness essentially in the post-war. novel,. this ·is-an '·attempt to see the _influence of man's constjous arid-·unconscioris modes of insanity on his cultural life and· on the form of the_ novel. This kind of aesthetic demands a deliberate kind,of health, which, as it becomes more and more impossible to achieve, requires an eveJ!. greater effort-to impose sanity on oneself. And perhaps, for the writer. to impose sanity on oneslf through writing. This is an aesthetic not just of absence or· diminution, but of loss. This is a St. Mary's course. 
PRESENTATION: Discussion essentially, of the readings, films, and 
_; ·,··THE SCHOLASTIC 

art. Some of the films are already scheduled in various caµipus series: Weekend, Negatives and Fires on the Plain. Mr. Michaud also intends to bring Grass' film Cat·and Mouse. Jerry Kosinski (two of his books are read) will be on campus for the Sophomore Literary Festival. · 
READINGS: To be chosen from the following: Barth, Giles Goat Boy, Sot-Weed Factor;· Lind, Lanscape in Concrete; Kosinski, The Painted Bird,· Steps; Hasek,· The Good Soldier Schweik; Dickens, ·B[eak House; Gogol, Dead Souls; Hawkes, Second Skin, Lime Twig; Grass, The Tin Drum, Dog Years; :Beckett, Watt; Celine, Journey to the End of Night, Death on the Installment Plan; Lagerwis, The Dwarf; Ooka, Fires on the Plain; Doderer, The Demons. 
ORGANIZATION: Mr. Michaud asks for a page of analytical notes per novel. These notes are not as structured as papers would be, nor are they as· intimidating. This arrangement encourages ex­perimentation and often uncovers the threads that make these pages of notes cohere as a kind of journal of the course. There is a take-home mid-term and an in-class final. 
CoMl\lENT: Very subtly, and very early in the semester, the correspondences between madness and politics, madness and language, madness and a repressive society become resonantly con­temporary. Subtly._ because Mr. Michaud is no cynic, nor is he a speaker of "movement" rhetoric. He has a deep concern for language, as language forms the culture and the novel itself. This is an important course. It evokes a response that reaches into all of contemporary life. Yet, it's a tangible course and well organized. These are at many times the aesthetics of our lives, but in Mr. Michaud's course there is time to recognize and to touch them. 
Elizabeth Noel 
English 354 
Development of the English Novel 
CoNTENT: This course involves a close critical study of the English novel from Dickens' time to the present. The major emphasis is upon the novel as an art form and its development as such. There are no prerequisites for the course and all classes are usually represented. This is a SMC course. 
PRESENTATION: Although the students are always invited to ask questions and discuss topics, most of the class time is spent on the lecture. Miss Noel's presentation is informative and always 
. covers the material assigned. 
READINGS: Dickens, Our Mutual Friend; George Eliot, Middle­inarch; Hardy, Jude the Obscure; Conrad, Lord Jim; V: Woolf, To the Lighthouse; Joyce, A Portrait of the Artist; Lawrence, Women-in· Love; Beckett, Molloy; Fowles, The French Lieu­ten·an,t's Woman. The reading load is moderately heavy, and all of the books are covered during the semester. All of the novels may be purchased in paperback. · 
ORGA~IZATION: Besides the readings, there are three 500-word essays and two one-hour exams. The exams consist of brief identifications and one or two essay questions on the main themes of the novels. The final follows the same format as the hour exams with one or two extra essays. Since attendance is· not demanded, the grade is based mainly on the papers and exams. The average grade is a B or C. ' · 
CoMMENTS: Miss Noel is a fair grader, but strict. Her lectures offer a wealth of information ori the ·author's literary purpose. 
Francis Phelan, C.S.C. 
English 302 
Writing Short Fiction 
CONTENT AND ORGANIZATION: This course is broadly titled "Writing Short Fiction" but the short story is the normal vehicle. Each student submits a minimum of two stories during the semester. These are mimeographed, distributed and criticized by the class. Stories are submitted anonymously. The author responds to criticism at the end of the discussion. Father Phelan is usually the last critic to comment. 
COMMENT: Everyone agrees that the course is worth-while for the student who wants to write, needs a deadline to stimulate him and desires criticism of his work. Many sense a lack, however, of really constructive criticism. No works of contemporary fiction or criticism are used in class. Consequently, it has been suggested, students are unsure of their own criteria for criticism. Father Phelan-has definite ideas about the nature of a good short story. It ought to be a "great piece of poetic imagery and metaphor," the writer ought to "roll the world into a ball." Although other theories are never rejected, Father Phelan's assumptions tend to dominate. 
Paul Rathburn English 345 Shakespeare 
CoNTENT: The course of study will focus on Shakespeare's his­tories, comedies, and tragedies; the sonnets will not be included. Approximately 12 of the plays will be covered. There are no prerequisites, and the course is open to upperclassmen. The plays will be studied as literary achievement through a study of a selection of plays and an independent perusual of certain important critics. 
PRESENTATION: Mr. Rathburn covers the plays in groups-his­tories, comedies, and tragedies. He generally begins his classe.5 in lecture format, commenting on certain dramatic or literary aspects of the plays with an acute sense of both their interest as works of art and their relevance as statements on the human condition. Mr. Rathburn is well aware of the need for class discussion, and the balance between discussion and lecture. De­pending on the size of the class and students' decision, an extra class period is being considered as an option in which the class may discuss the plays, listen to records, see films, do readings, etc. Mr. Rathburn succeeds extremely well in making the stu­dents appreciate and understand the plays rather than merely venerate them from a distance. The presentations are lively and open-minded with the result that there is much discussion and room for independent interpretation by the student. 
READINGS: The text will probably be either Hardin Craig's or the Pelican edition of the complete works. 
ORGANIZATION: There will be one paper on 1 play not covered in class. A mid-term and a take home final are given. 
Co~U!ENT: One of the reasons for the popularity of this course is Mr. Rathburn's attitude. Having a thorough knowledge of the material in which he is deeply interested, he is able to inject the interest into the students. On the personal level, Mr. Rathburn has a sincere concern for the progress of the individual student. It is a course where one doesn't have to decide between staying in bed or going to class -going to class will definitely win out. It is a course that makes one feel good on a gloomy day. 
Ernest Sandeen English 327 Intro. to Poetry 
English 527 Poetry as Genre 
ENGLISH 327 CONTENT:· This course is intended as a broad survey of British and · American poetry since about 1700. On the surface, Dr. Sandeen wants the student to experience all the facets of poetry from metre to symbolism. · However, he is actually much more interested in stimulating and bringing forth the poetic soul that lives somewhere in all of us. The only prerequisite for this course is a de~ire to want to learn something about the art of poetry. 
READINGS: There are three paperbacks for this course: The New Modern Poetry, edited by M. L. Rosenthal; An Introduc­tion to Poetry, edited by Louis Simpson; New Poets, New Music, edited by Schmittroth and Mahoney. These books will amount to about six dollars. 
ORGANIZATION: At the outset of Eng. 327 Dr. Sandeen wants six short ( 2 or 3) page papers during the semester. However, as the semester goes on Dr. Sandeen finds himself so delighted by his subject matter that things slow down, and the student may find that he has to write only four of those papers. Dr. Sandeen is not interested in the hard-core academic achieve­ments of his students, but rather in their stimulation. There­fore, the only test will be a take-home final. The average student will receive an A-in this course with a decent amount of effort. 

NOVEMBER 30, 1971 
ENGLISH 527 CoNTENT: Poems selected· from the whole range of British and American poetry will be studied in a genuine rather. than -his­torical context, except that various poetic traditions will, of course, be taken into account. However, emphasis will .be put on the formal dimensions of the poems, structural and thematic, traditional and experimental. · 
READINGS: The Norton Anthology of Poetry (shorter ·edition), eds. Eastman et al.; The New Modern Poetry, _ed. M. L: Rosen-. thal; P<Jetic Meter and Poetic Form, by -Paul Frussal, ·_Jr.·; Poetic Closure, by Barbara H. Smith. · · 
,CoMMEXTs: Dr. Sandeen is far. from -a~· dynamic· lecturer.-His speaking voice is soft, but if one strains to listen he \v:ill realize Dr. Sandeen's knowledge of poetry·is tremendous~ -He_ also pos­sesses a wonderful sense of humor. The bright spot .is Dr. San­deen's ability to read poetry. Here he possesses great ability for reading with just the right tone, emphasis and darity. _Dr~ Sandeen, himself a poet, is able to effectively provide the·vehicle for an appreciation of poetry. He holds sessions for small 'groups of students at his home each week. There the students.. can interact-with the sincere and sensitive man. 
Raymond Schoen­English 310 The Heroic View of Man 
CONTENT: The· course will study_ various artistic presentations of the theory that man is capable of heroic action. The course will attempt to discover if different ages of the world and dif­ferent societies agree that man is capable of heroic action and, if so, what form that action· should· take. There · are, ·no pre­requisites for the course, and the composition of students in the course is general, from sophomores to seniors in all majors. 
PRESENTATION: The class will be conducted by discussion, but · lectures ·will occasionally be given as guides -to the reading. The discussions center around the students' interpretation of the works and not that of the professor. The discussions are very interesting with Professor Schoen always adding insights from his excellent knowledge of the material and its background.· His lectures are infrequent ·but of very high quality ( especially on Milton). · · 
READINGS: The reading list is long. Some of the texts· are Homer's Iliad and-Odyssey, Milton's Paradise_ Lost, Mailer's Of a Fire.on the Moon, and Kazantzakis' The Odyssey, a· Mod­ern Sequel. A_ complete list of the books covered will be avail­able at G-77 in the library during preregistration. · 
'ORGANIZATION: Because of the heavy reading· load, there will not· be much writing. Students will submit four. short, info_rmal · insights { 1 or 2 pages long) into aspects of ·the works. which­interest them, one longer paper (about 5 pages);-and. a finaI: Grades are . de-emphasized. . · · -.--: ·. ·_ ··· ·-· · .

Poetry of the ·Victorian-Pe'riod · -. 
English 468 Matthew Arnold. Seminar 
CONTENT: :The-general _purpose of the course is to assess the imagination of the. period, roughly 1830-1880;-the focus being on Tennyson, Browning, -Arnold, D.G. Rossetti and Gerard Manley· Hopkins.. A good-deal of time is devoted to the various Victorian dialectics; the tension between isolation and public role, the dis­appearance of God and concurrent ache for a cultural ."c·eriter'.', and the. several Victorian aesthetics. · . . . 
--' ­
PRESENTATION: 'Mr. Sniegowski is surely amo~g the most~suc­cint lecturers in·the University. His low-keyed style is deceptive­ly: "easr';'. _.The class'is basically a le_cture class. ¥r: Sniegowski is noted.for J:iis \lncanny_ ability to allow d.iscussion and still avoid 
-confl!s.ion. . 
.READ~-NGS: . With. the exception .of Hopkin.s, · the texts are _the standard Riverside editions. Hopkins is read in the Gardner ·Penguin· edition. ._Where the texts are incomplete, mostly in t_he cas~ of_ revisio_1,1s, Mr. Sniegowski supplies dittoed materials. ­
ORGANIZATION: ·The work load is extremely reasonable; three papers (4-6 pages in length) and a take-home final. There is practically no emphasis on grades as such since Mr., Sniegowski prefers to rely· on his own abilties to stimulate interest in the · m<!~erial. Paper topics are suggested, but these suggestions are by no".'means restrictive. The final is difficult if one is not ·used to working in a theoretical context since most of the questions stress basic lines of force rather than individual poets or poems. The readings here are extensive-though not in themselves.'.'long" ~the only exception being Tennyson's In Memoriam, which is read · 1n full). . -: -. -. . -, · -..• . · 
CoMMEN~:: Though . th~ Victorian Period.·is. pivotal in the · his­tory of literature it is also an art experience in and of itself." Mr. Sniegowski's innate feel for poetry provides a fine balance between the two., \His reading of Browning's, Fra Lippa· Lippi is an · absolute_joy.,-, On·the other. hand, the· half class period devoted to M. H:·Abrams'·The Mirrnr:and.the Lamp'is as good as short 
summary of 19th century aesthetic theory as one is likely. to find. Victorian Poetry is one of . those ·rare . courses that is equally valuable. for sophomore, junior or senior English majors as. well as for anyone with ataste for poetry. Mr. SniegO\vski's approach to poetry is humane and energetic, fillecLwith. the curiosity that 
.is inseparable from his· type of-wisdom.· ._He is extremely ap­proach.able-and -ever willing-to 'help individual students. The danger in "period': courses is· that the lectures. tend to become either0 homages· or apologies:, Happily, Mr. Sniegowski avoids both 6Cthese and presents instead what might perhaps be called a venture.into· the effect of poetry. 
.-ENGLISH 468 CoN'l;'ENT: ·.The intent is -to· critically evaluate Matthew Arnold's achievement as .a man of letters and a prose writer of consider­able--import. His political thought and literary criticism raise problems which typify the age and establish Arnold as a pivotal figure bridging the gap between the Romantic and "Modern" sensibilities. The first segment of the course (about one-third) will take up Arnold's poetry, e.xamining its structure and literary merit. The remainder of the semester will be devoted to Arnold's prose, and here once again, the attempt will be to strike a bal­ance between an appreciation of Arnold's thought and a consider­ation of its significance in a broader historical context. This cour~c 
. is offered on the average of about once every four semesters. There are no prerequisites but prospective students who have not had prior exposure to the Victorian period may.wish to see Mr. Sniegowski before entering. The class will be limited to twenty students. 
PRESENTATION: The course ~ill. proceed as ·a seminar, though individual students will not "lead" classes. As such, presentation will depend to a large extent on the interest and preparation of die s_tudents.. . 
READINGS: _If possible, the central text will be Kenneth Allo~t's Matthew· Arnold, a completely_ annotated edition which is the best. collection of Arnold available. Because it is an English edition, thou~h, difficulties may arise in ordering. In any event, two other· texts will be·used; Culture and Anarchy, by Matthew Arnold,: edited by .Iran Gregor, and Poetry and Criticism .of Matthew Arnold,. edited by Dwight Culler. .The readings will be intensive -but by no means unmanageable. 
ORGANIZATION: There will be two short papers (5-7 pps.), cen­te_ring on some aspect ·of Arnold's poetry and due during. the first part · of the semester. . The major ·work will. be a longer 
· paper (20-25 pps.) on a topic assigned at the beginning of the semester:. :This paper will require extensive consideration of a strain -in .Arnold's thought present in both the prose. and the · poetry and will be due in the latter half of the semester. There ,vill be no tests.

ORGANIZATION: Three pape~, 8 pages in length and a final. The thought and writing style are to be reasonably close to out­standing. 
COMMENT: .Mr. Walton's courses are recommended for ariy stu­dent wishing to conduct a serious inquiry, using a disciplined and refined critical approach to the questions raised in the novels. This attitude calls for interest in the novels themselves as well as an ability to think fairly deeply, for even to keep pace with Mr. Walton's lucid, well-organized lectures is an intellectual achieve­ment not to be belittled. He .allows the students to e.icplore facets of any. novel not directly covered in class, but one finds that this freedom is a heavy responsibility to produce work commensurate with Mr. Walton's own criticism. Beyond the classroom, Mr. \.Yalton is reaoily accessible and manifests sincere concern for stu­dents' .development in his course. 
Thomas· Werge English 383 · . American Writers Survey

READINGS: Prof. Werg;e illuminates the Puritan mind through the. writings of Jonathan Edwards. The Perry Miller te.ict .is used to show the religious sense of quest in America from the beginning of the Puritan migration. This quest is connected to the searching; found in 19th century literature. The reading list is Edwards, Selections (Amer. Gen. Series); Miller.

John D. Garvick 
English 352 
18th Century Literature II 
English 449 English Poetry from Dryden to Blake 
ENGLISH 352 Co:--TENT: This course, a continuation of the 18th-century course taught by Mr. Martin, will focus on the tension between order and disorder in the literature of the second half of the century. Readings will be fairly heavy ..:..._ an 18th-century anthology, Sterne, Boswell, Sheridan, and Blake (extensively). There will be a mid-term, a final and one paper. 
ENGLISH 449 
CONTENT: A "workshop" course, offered for the first time this .coming semester, 18th Century Poetry will be concerned with making value judgments in poetic works. The course will be interested in the evolution of a romantic attitude as realized in William Blake. Mr. Garvick states that the "subject matter will be unusual"; the only prerequisite is that a student "should like Art and have a tolerance for Life." Readings will be heavy ­Dryden, Pope, Colli:ns, Christopher, Crabbe, Smart, Blake ­but beyond that requirements are "liberal." 
PRESENTATION: 1v[r. Garvick's lectures seem to be well planned. Witty, challenging, frequently entertaining, he holds the class's interest well. His willingness to respond to questions and his sense of drama make each session lively. But these same virtues occasionally lead him to digress to a degree which leaves too much of the reading material untouched. His knowledge of the subject and obvious enthusiasm compensate, ·however, and his comments are germane to the student's work outside the class­room. 
CoMMENTS: Young, interesting, accessible, perhaps slightly mad, Mr. Garvick is worthwhile no matter what course he teaches. He should be especially good this semester, as the 18th century is his specialty. Except for their criticism that his lectures should be more tightly organized and better focused, most students rated Mr. Garvick one of the better teachers ·in· the English department. 
Robert Lordi English 341 17th Century Literature 
English 444 . Renaissance Drama 
ENGLISH 341 CONTENT: Since this is a new course, the syllabus is not in final final form at present, but the basic purpose will be to offer a general survey of the two primary poetic schools of the early seventeenth century; the metaphysicals, and the Jonsonian classi­cists. Some dramas of the period will also be introduced, but primarily to provide a route to the historic and philosophic back.: grounds against which the poetry of the day was written. The main focus of effort will be to compare and contrast the styles and statements of the metaphysicals and neoclassicists. 
PRESENTATION: This will depend on the size of the classes~ but ideally the course will employ class discussion as the central pedagogical tool. Professor Lordi customarily regub;es . two or three papers of medium (five to ten pages) length. 
ENGLISH 444 CONTENT: The course is an attempt to give a comprehensive overview of the nature of the English stage between the middle of the sixteenth century and the middle of the seventeenth. This age is generally understood only in the light of its premiere writer, Shakespeare. In reality, it amounted to one of the richest periods of English drama. This course will attempt to introduce the likes of Kyd, Marlowe, Webster and Jonson, and to trace the evolution of styles which moved the English drama from its Elizabethan to its Jacobean age. . 
PRESENTATION: There will be an interwoven series of lectures and discussions, ·whose exact nature will be determined by the size and sensitivity of the class. -. -· · 
READINGS: There will be three primary .texts: English·, Drama 1580-1642, ed. Brooks and Paradise, Webster and Tourner, ed. Symons, and King and No King, ed. Turner. Several supple­
mental collections of criticisn:i will also be suggested (i.e., Shake­speare's Contemporaries, Bluestone and Moral Vision of Jacobean Tragedy, Ornstein). 
COMMENTS: Anyone taking a course from Professor Lordi would do well to note the class size on the first day of class,. and if it exceeds 13, drop the course. He possesses a respectable knowl­edge of the period which has become his specialty and a passable sensitivity to the special beauties of the work he treats. ·He lacks the ability, however, to orally transmit anything but somewhat vague replicas of that knowledge and sensitivity. His lectures seem unable to regularly proceed without becoming occasionally lost in numerous digressions. · 
Howevei;, if his classes are small enough to be run as seminars, then there is hope that Mr. Lordi's remarks can become seedlings for enlightening discussions. His thorough knowledge of his period, especially of sources and textual histories can serve, in a seminar situation, as a check on enthusiastic. first opinions of his students. This hardly ·will be a pair of courses to whet the nonmajor appetite, but they could be of some help to a major willing to pursue this special interest. · 
Maben Herring ·. , English 326 Afro-American Literature II 
CONTENT: For the-Black artist there is the task of continually adjusting the angle of vision between self, race, and the world. According to DuBois and others, this_ problem of double con­sciousness is at the heart of the -Black Experience in White America. Thus the second half of this survey course will con­tinue to explore the diverging and converging cultural theories which aim at the eradication of the conditioning of the double consciousness, which the contemporary Black author views in a much broader context-from integration to ethnic independence. Since each of these ideologies suggests a corresponding aesthetic theory, representative works in which the Black author has responded to the literary scene have been selected. These re­sponses arise from ·concepts beginning with naturalism and extending to a "black· aesthetic" and "anti-literature." This course is being offered by St. Mary's. · 
READINGS: Among the authors are the following: James-Baldwin, Eldridge ·Cleaver, Ralph Ellison,· Charles Gordone, Lorraine Hansberry. Imamu Amiri Baraka -(Leroi Jones),· Malcolm X, John ·A. Williams, Richard Wright. 
ORGANIZATION: One short essay, an oral report, and one long essay. 
COMMENT: As an extremely competent teacher of this. subject, Mrs. Herring will combine stimulating lectures with thougl;it­provoking class discussions. Students will be challenged to deal with a· literature which will probably be new to many of them. The alert student will find ·the course worth taking. 
Sister Jean Klerie 
English 345 
Shakespeare . 
CONTENT: This Shakespeare course presents a view of a few of the. great works. The primary ~mphasis of the· course is on an understanding of the plays and the art of the genius who 
. created them. Periodically, topics relevant to Shakespeare and the.16th century are introduced. It is a requirement for all SMC English majors, but is open to all sophomores, juniors, and seniors. This is a St. Mary's course. · 
READINGS: King Lear, Midsummer Night's Dream, Richard II, Henry IV, Henry V, Measure for Measure, Troilus and Cressida, Othello~ Antho7!y and Cleopatra, Much Ado About -Nothing,The Tempest.-· · 
PRESENTATION: The lectures and the class are well organized. The discipline of the readings with a stress on the mechanical keys play a great prominence in the lectures. .The large amount of plays covered tends to leave little actual time for discussion though that option is particularly encouraged by Sister Jean. 
COMMENT: Sister Jean's course provides a thorough, interesting analysis of Shakespeare. Her knowledge and enthusiasm on the subject are quite extensive, and she persistently attempts to in­still this enthusiasm in her students. Though the grading scale is possibly a bit hampered by nf"r weekly quizzes, she is usually quite fair. 
· THE SCHOLASTIC 

Adolph Soens English 320 Drama 
CONTENT: This course will begin with ancient Greek and Roman comedies and tragedies and work through Medieval and Restora­tion plays into present-day theatre. The plays which will be read include works by Euripides, Aristophanes, Shaw, Pinter and a host of other. A complete reading list is not yet available. 




General Program 
Edward Cronin 
GP 342 
Drama 
CoNTENT: In this course, the student will read and discuss 10-12 plays, ranging from ancient Greece to modern America. The plays will be treated as dramatic texts, not as sociological, psycho­logical, or etiological texts. They will be read as substitutes for dramatic presentations, emphasizing the fact that plays are writ­ten primarily to be performed and only secondarily to be reaq,_ As important as the readings are, the assigned papers which will be thoroughly corrected by Cronin. Frequent visits to his office are encouraged in order to improve the student's ability to write "polished prose." There are no prerequisites and the course is required for General Program juniors. ' , 
PRESENTATION: Dr. Cronin does not deliver formal lectures. Instead, he points out themes and interpretations which interest him, and he asks students to present their own ideas during the class. The class is usually an interesting one because of Cronin's efforts to entertain while he teaches. He is aware of students' soporific inclinations as he is of their love of learning, so that both his ideas and his humor become part of the course. · ­
READINGS: Drama, An Introductory Anthology, alternate edition, edited by Otto Reinert will be used. Also the 10-12 plays men­tioned above. 
ORGANIZATION: Four or five papers of no assigned length will be required. (Cronin has said, "If they're short, they'd better be good;.if they're long,-they'd better be perfect.") No examina­tions will be given. The final grade will be determined by the student's improvement in writing ability, as reflected by the paper grades. 
COl',tMENTS: Dr. Cronin helps the student to examine the plays as dramatic presentations, so that one learns about the theater ·as well as about the dramatic texts. Since a variety of plays are read, one gets a well-rounded introduction to the dramatic genre. Cronin believes that the teacher's role consists primarily of helping students and he encourages students to talk with him about their writing or any other topic {i.e., England, the Cubs, the Repub­lican Party, etc.). In short, few students have come away from Dr. Cronin's course disappointed. 
Harold Moore GP 346 Metaphysics: Theories of Reality 
CONTENT: Metaphysics will deal with the different and sometimes opposing theories of men such as Kant, -Descartes, Aquinas, Hume, and at least on~ contemporary figure. The last time 
NOVEMBER 30, 1971 
PRESENTATION: The course will probably be a. series of lectures and such discussions as may be prompted by students' questions. Flexibility is the key word in any class taught by Mr. Soens. 
ORGANIZATION: No tests will be given, but two or three 8-page papers will be expected. 
COMMENT: Mr. Soens is a "yes" for anyone with interest in drama. His lectures range from intriguing to mediocre, usually closer to the first. Courage is necessary to appreciate his class­room flair. Differing views are welcome and respected. 
Professor Moore taught this course, he handled, on the request of the students, a little phenomonology aJ!d will probably do so again. The course hopes to present the theories of these meta­physicians and, following each to their fullest conclusions, show that there can be better or worse theories of metaphysics. 
ORGANIZATION: The requirements of this course will be left to the choice of the students-either a long paper or a number of tests, or quizzes on each book covered. 
COl',tMENTS: Professor Moore is an enthusiastic teacher, who loves his material as well as he knows it. He is very open to students and very generous with his time--a great asset·for stu­dents when a course as difficult as this is involved. 
Kenneth F. Thibodeau 
GP 244 
History of Science I 
CONTENT: This course deals with the development of thought from pre-rational times to the early Middle Ages. After an examination of the structure and power of primitive thought, as exemplified in Babylonian astronomy and the early Hebrew world view, students will concentrate on the development of Greek rationality. They will also study the relationship of religion to primitive science, and will attempt to explain the apparent dis­appearance of science from the fifth to the twelfth centuries. 
READINGS: Though he plans to use as a basic te.xt Santillana's Origins of Scientific Thought, Professor Thibodeau is especially interested in having students read the orignal works of such im­portant figures as Aristotle, Hippocrates, Galen, and Plato. 
Ivo Tho-mas GP 382 Great Books Seminar IV 
CONTENT: The seminar is intended to familiarize students with great questions raised throughout history, and to promote the development of a coherent world view. 
READINGS: Cellini's Autobiography; Erasmus' Praise of Folly; Luther's Three Treatises; Montaigne's In Defense of Raymond Sebond; Shakespeare's The Tempest; Rousseau's First Discourse; Smith's Wealth of Nations; Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France; Paine's Rights of Man; Hegel's Reason in History; Marx and Engels' Basic Writings; Darwin's Origin of Species; Flaubert's Madame Bovary; Tolstoy's ff/'ar ana Peace; Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class; Freud's Introduction to Psycho­analysis. 
Government 
Peri Arnold Government 438 American .Bureaucracy 
Government 420 
The Presidency 
GOVERNMENT 438 . 

CONTENT: This course examines the character of federal agencies in the federal bureaucracy in light of their founding. The federal a~encies will be viewed as a political arena conditioned by their . point of initiation. Such factors as personnel, clientele forces, and structure (policy formation) will be considered in depth with 
informal comparative reference to European Bureaucracies. 
READrNGs: The reading list is moderate to moderately heavy. 
Readings consist of paperbacks and articles on reserve. Approxi­
mate cost is 10 to 15 dollars. 

ORGANIZATION: There will be a mid-term. a final, and a term paper (10-15 pages). The exams are demanding and require that the student integrate the various aspects of the course into some unifying scheme. 
GOVERNMENT 420 
CONTENT: This is the first time the course will be offered by 

Professor Arnold. It will examine the character and organic 
development of this institution as conditioned by its point of birth. 
Special emphasis will be given to the question of presidential 

power. 
READINGS: The reading will consist of paperbacks, court cases 
and presidential speeches ..There will be a mid-term, final, and 
term paper (10-15 pages). 
PRESENTATION AND COMMENTS: Professor Arnold is new on cam­pus. Students now taking American Bureaucracy. report of his informal lecture style and ability to contemporize the scope of the course. Professor Arnold encourages discussion ·and ade­quately succeeds in giving life to some of the drier readings. For those interested in administration on the governmental level the course will be highly rewarding. · · 
Paul .Bartholomew Gov'ernment 340 American Government 
CONTENT: American Government is a one semester course •offered durini?; both the fall and spring terms. The course is one of the "Big Four" required of all Government majors and deakprimar­ily with the three branches of the federal government; state and local governments as well as pertinent Supreme Court cases are also considered . There are no prerequisites for the course which is closed to all but Government and American Studies majors. 
PRESENTATION: Professo~ Bartholomew's lectures are cordial, in­formative and noteworthy {pardon the pun) and are delivered in. the first person "we." His dry humor provides the_ o_nly relief from an otherwise sleep-inducing presentation. Related interrup­tions from the floor are entertained, and although "filibustering" is discouraged, a good deal takes place towards the. end of, the period. 
READINGS: This course entails a considerable amount of read­ing. The text, Gouernment by the People. ($9.95), is slightly reminiscent of a high school civics book and glosses over ·the many inadequacies and criticisms of our goverrimental system. In an attempt to contemporize the course, cover stories from 
U.S. News and World Report are included in the syllabus. To avoid the reserve book room rush, a subscription would be a good investment. 'In addition, approximately fifty U.S.· ·Supreme . Court cases are suryeyed for basic principles, and Leading Cases on the Constitution, available at the bookstore and authored by you-know-who, proved to be an invaluab~e aid in this area. 
ORGANIZATION: There are four required reports: .home state, bibliography, home area, and governmental unit: (all generally .five to ten pages)-They are for all practical purposes busy work and are graded liberally on a scale from one to ten. The trio of euphemistically labled . "q~ze~," ho'Yever, are a · diffei:ent story. They can be summarized m one succmct ph_rase-memonza­tion of trivia. Fortunately they are noncumulative and togeth~r with the reports comprise 75% of the grade. ~e other 25% is the· final which covers the lectures and text· assignments of the entire·semester. The average final grade ·is a C. 
COMMENTS Professor Bartholomew's course is a trying one. Par­ticular credit for this statement must be· given to his quizzes. The average student will find himself viewing these e:iaminati<;>ns with a disproportionate amount of concern. They are frustrating in that one must depend more on memory ~ rather than on thou{{ht to insure any measure of success. A suggestion; after reading and reviewing all assigned ~aterials. a care~ul study of past quizzes narrows dcwn the sub1ect matter considerably. A Government major confronted with ·this ·course would do well to seek a friend or any· other coinpasionate· human being w!1o has survived the course and who could supply the student with past exams, the test and advice. The bright·spot in this course is Professor Bartholomew himself. A brilliant scholar and a highly recognized authority in the field of. Constitutional Law, he demonstrates this expertise in his _lectures. No matter how a student personally feels about the course, he usually emerges 
with an appreciation of the professor's amazing· talents._ I~ is doubtful that this course· has ever served as a great mspira­tion to emerging students 'of-G_overnment. · It does not_ en­courage one to mull over -theories, concepts. or_ hypothetical~. Rather it teaches the student the basics and principles of Amen­can government, its machinery and institu_tions a!ld their func­tions. American Government need not be mteresting or thought provoking, it will however provide concrete informational ba5-=k.: ground for further examination of the syste~-Understanding this, American Government can be a worthwhile course..

The course 'was, however, offered two years ago,· and the, content· has in all likelihood not sub­stantially changed. The general f~cus, of tJ:e: course ~s ~pon the examination of a number oCtheories of social order m terms of­the development of political philosophy over the ages. This ap­proach starts from the premise that men interpret the .truth m terms· of symbolic forms. Moving from this. ge·neral notion, the course proceeds-to focus upon individual thinkers. In the past, those studied have included Socrates-Plato, Cicero and others of tlie Roman school, Augustine, Machiavelli, Calvin, the Puri!ans, . Hobbes, Rousseau, and David Hume. 
PRESENTATION: Professor Beitzinger's lectures proceed with im-_ peccable logic, and he. skillfully combines individual discussions. with the co.Urse material. Although Professor Beitzinger is "co~:-­servative" in. his political outlook, he is open to disagreements m viewpoint among· the students. Since the Professor is extremely well-versed·· in the subject material, dissident students should be warned -against :presenting ill-founded arguments during a· discussion: ·With this qualification, the student should find it worthwhile · to interject comments during discussions, and the topics ·for discussion have tended in the past to develop into c_onfrontations of basic philosophical attitudes. 
READINGS; It is assumed that students taking the course 'have· been acquainted with the basic texts of political theory. There­fore, heavy emphasis is placed upon secondary· sources.· The exposure to these writings is one of the chief advantages to be derived from taking this course. 
ORGANIZATION: When the course was last offered, _there were three exams, including the final--exam: The exams are of an essay nature, and they are generally based on themes in the works studied. The tests are fair, and the average final grade is B. There are no term papers or projects. · ., · · 
COMMENTS: This course is highly recommended for student'> 
. who are interested in politi~al. theory in· the. "classical" sense of the term. The. smallness oLthe class and the:interplay between student and teacher in coming to_grips•with basic ,questioris raised in the writings help-to niake :this course a significant educatonal 
experience. · · · ·..., · -~ --• · ·

George Brinkley Government 480 Soviet Foreign Relations-
CoNTENTs The · course presents an historical study of Russian foreign policy ~d is divided_ into· five parts: I. Origins and Foundations; II: Militant Advances and Strategic Retreat: 1917­
.1927; III, Stalinism and the Search for Security: 1928:1940; IV. World War _II and Communist Exp_ansi6n: 1941-1953; and peaceful Co-ex!s-tence and Polyce?erism: 1953-1970. 
PRESENTATION: The course is basically lecture, although ques­tions and comments from the ·students are welcomed. Professor Brinklcy,'s lectures are concise and informative. 
READINGS: There ~r~ two basic·t~xts for the course: A. B. Ulam's 
Expansion ·and Coexistence: the History of Soviet Foreign Policy and Russian Foreign Policy, edited by I. J. Lederer. In addition, Professor Brinkley· provides -a_ four-page list-of "recommended" readings. Students are urged to "pick and choose" from the list those books which they consider interesting and worthwhile. At certain points in his lectures, Professor Brinkley refers to some of the books on the "recommended" list, and he is available outside of class if students want information on any of the remaining books on the list. 
ORGANIZATION: There are four tests given. Last year, the first three tests were essay, while the last was objective. The tests necessitate a close study of the lecture notes for the course, and they are an accurate reflection of the student's grasp of the subject covered in the course..Although no papers are assigned, those who have the inclination to do so may submit "extra-credit" papers or book reviews, The final grade for the course averaged 
2.75 with a fair number of A's and A-'s: · 
COMMENTS: This course is highly recommended for students interested in this subject. Professor Brinkley brings to the course a wide knowledge of Russian Foreign Policy and conveys his knowledge well to the students. 
Raymond Cour, C.S.C. Government 432 American Civil Liberties 
CONTENT: The course is intended to treat avariety of current problems involving American civil rights. Topics treated in­clude censorship, conscientious objection, suffrage, racial equality, rights of the accused persons, academic freedom, and other re­lated subjects. A basic course in American Government is a prerequisite for this course. 
PRESEt:<TATION: The course consists basically of lectures; there are lectures every class on assigned topics which follow closely the assigned readings. Little or no discussion is present in the class. -Questions are allowed but not encouraged, and no attempt is made to _promote discussion. ­
READINGS: There are two assigned readings: Civil Liberties Under-The' Constitution by H. Glenn Abernathy and An Intro­duction_ To The Law by C. Gordon Post. There will be addi­tional readings selected later. 
ORGANIZATION: There are two assignments: a term paper and a book report. In addition, there is a mid.cterin and a final examin­ation: The final mark is based on achievement in these -tests, in addition to an evaluation of the student's interest and participa­tion in the work of the course. · · ­
COMMENT: :Fr. Gour dries, ~ot-have a r~putation a~ the mo·st ­interesting or dynamic lecturer on campus. However; though dry, his lectures are very well -organized and treat the topics . very thoroughly. ,In addition; they relate very tjosely to the readings. An . interest in the material · is -desirable, though, -because. the 
. presentation itself is not the kind that will turn anyone on. The work load is moderate, but the course can be tedious if one is not interested in the subject matter. · 
Michael Francis Government 483 
· Latin American World Affairs· ­
CoNT:CNT: The course is concerned-with the-nature of American influence in Latin America. .It, wilr: include ,_consideration· of American business investments-in· this, area ·and developmental problems in Latin America. · 
NOVEMBER 30, 1971 
PRESENTATION: Although Professor Francis presents lectures, the exact ratio of lecture to discussion depends upon the interest of the class. · Last year, when the course was taught, the time devoted to lectures 'and discussion was just about even. Students questioned were impressed with Professor Francis' understanding of the problems in Latin America and with his ability to convey his knowledge in -lectures. Students also commented favorably upon his ability to stimulate discussion. 
READING·s: The readin~s for this semester include Ferguson's Contemporary Inter-American Problems, Williams' Contemporary Themes of Inter-American Relation and a book edited by Bern­stein on Latin America. These readings are different from those of last year's course, so no real assessment can be made of their value. The readings for the course last year, however, were relevant and worthwhile. 
ORGANIZATION: Several tests will be given on the material, and the tests are usually of an essay nature. Students generally believed that the tests and grading were fair. 
·coMl\IENTs: All of the students questioned recommended the course for those interested in Latin America, and some consider it one of the best courses which they have taken in Government. 
Edward Goerner Government 403N Medieval Political_ Theory 
Government 402 Comparative-Governmel)t II. 
GOVERNMENT 403N CONTENT:_ The common focus of the course will be on the problem of the relations of grace and nature in politics, especially insofar as there is a tension. and sometimes conflict, between re­ligious judgments and political judgments and, consequently, between. representatives of religious and political standards. 
READINGS: Readings include: Dante, de Monarchia; Marsilius of Padua, Defensor Pacis; Thomas Acquinas, frC>m the Summa Contra Gentiles: On the Ends of Human Life, from the Summa Theologica: On Law, War, the Right of Resistance to Tyrannical Government, Political Prudence, Justice, Spiritual and Temporal Power; and E. A. Goerner, Peter and Caesar, sections on Giles of Rome, John of Paris, and Marsilius of Padua. Since this course has not been offered recently, no students were available to comment upon the value of the readings. Judging from other courses taught by Professor Goerner, however, one can safely assume that the readings· will be extremely valuable. 
GOVERNlvIENT 402 CONTENT: The main foci of the course will be two questions: what is the relation of politics to economics, understanding the latter to include man's notions of nature and his techniques for acting in or on it? What is the relationship of politics to war, including war seen as the arena for the greatest and most glorious human deeds. 
--. 
READINGS: The readings for this course are heavy, but they are both relevant and worthwhile. They include: Colin Turnbull, The Forest People; Lucy Mair, Primitive Government; Homer, Iliad; Tacitus, de Germania; H. Frankfort et al., Before Phifoso­phy; C. Stephenson, Medieival Feudalism A. Andrewes, Th!: Greek Tyrants; Aristotle, The Constitution of Athens; Hannah Arendt, The Human Condition; and Joseph Pieper, In Tune With the fVorld, A Theory of Festivity. The readings for the course cover materials from African tribes, pharaonic Egypt; ancient Mesopotamia, ancient Greece and the Middle Ages in western Europe. However, the course assumes that the student is already familiar with, modern politics in the United States and western Europe. Comparative Government I is a prerequesite. Compara­tive study will, consequently, have a broader scope than the readings. 
PRESENTATION: If registration is large. the format for these courses will be lecture-discussion with two examinations and a paper. . If, happily, registration is small, the format will be seminar. with papers and no other examinations_ Whether the format's lecture or seminar, both of these courses will be challeng­ing and rewarding. Professor Goemer's lecture style is captivating and -dramatic. The intellectual depth of his comments stimulates serious reflection on the part of his students. If examinations are given in his courses, they are eminently fair and measure the extent to which the student has thought carefully upon issues raised in the course, rather than the extent to ·which he has managed to assemble a massive array of trivia. Since his ex­aminations require serious reflection and knowledge of subject material, they would not be too appealing to the student who has relied upon "snow-jobbing" .profs, or to the students whose _in­dependence of thought is limited to the feedback of information dictated at him in lectures. 
COMMENTS: Anyone who has had Professor Goerner for a course needs no encouragement to take him again. He is one of the finest teachers at the· University. In addition to his intellectual brilliance, which is evident in his lectures and in his penetrating comments during discussions, Professor Goerner po~sesses a personal excellence and warmth, which serve to make his courses ex-periences in learning to live as a man, as well as opportunities to grow in knowledge about political phenomena. One should be warned, however, that if a student has become convinced that the study of Government involves only the analytical ordering of empirical reality and that any further reflections upon this data are altogether subjective and "non-scientific," he may be some­what fr~strated and overwhelmed by the depth of thought which Professor Goerner brings to his thorough grasp of concrete political eJ.1)eriences. For those students, however, who are open to the possibility that a serious study of political phenomena should be placed in the context of larger and more basic questions about man and his dealings in a society, either of these courses by Professosr Goerner will be one of the high-marks of their educational experience. 
Theodore I vanus Government 444 Government and Politics of Communist East· Central Europe 
CONTENT: This one semester course examines in a non-behavior­alistic fashion the various social, political, economic and cultural forces at work in Communist East Central Europe focusing on how such forces effected deviations in the Marxist ideology. Spe­cial emphasis will be given to the effect of such deviations on Soviet foreign relations especially Soviet-Yugoslav and Sino-Soviet. Various topics ranging from polycentrism to totalism will natur­ally be included. Since the course is geared to post WW II and due to the many recent occurrences in the area, the course is highly contemporary and lends itself easily to discussion which Professor Ivanus is willing to entertain. 
PRESENTATION: Professor Ivanus is an excellent instructor, highly knowledgable in his field. His ability to contemporize the course in light of recent developments makes the course quite interesting. Professor Ivanus' lecture style is quite informal with numerous references to the New York Times and other political journals. 
READiNGS: Readings consist of paperbacks and articles on reserve. Although the reading list is long, ample time is given for the completion of each assignment. · 
ORGANIZATION: There is one term paper, a mid-term, final and one or two book reviews all of which are fair tests of the stu­dent's comprehension of the material. Grading is fair with the average grade of B. · 
Stephen Kertesz Government 464 International Law 
CoNTENT: This course will concentrate on the study of the principles and rules of international law in a twofold perspective: the progressive evolution of the law, and the operation of the law in a divided world with growing interdependence among nations. By way of introduction, the course will discuss the nature and function of international law in the contemporary world society, and the sources of international law and its development through­out the ages. The body of the course will concentrate on the fol­lowing topics: the subjects of international law, international law and the individual, questions of territorial sovereignty and in­ternational transactions. (Professor Kertesz's summary.) 
PRESENTATION: Professor Kertesz tries to split his class between a -reasonable number of lectures and a more than .adequate number of seminar-type discussions. His lectures are very well ordered, lucid and informative. But it is usually in the class discussions that Kertesz really shines. His genuine concern for the students' questions and opm1ons, coupled with his. pervasive knowledo-e of political science and his personal expenence as a diplomat all add up to make_ this p:irt of the _coui:se one of the most valuable learning experiences m the .Umvers1ty. 

READINGS: The text for the course will be Gerhard von Glahn's Law Among Nations. It gives a COIIlJ)rehensiv:e survey of inter­national law and significant cases ·are summarized. One or two other case-study books are recommended and Kertf:SZ pro~des the students. with an excellent bibliography for outside readmg. A good deal of outside reading is expected to be done preparatory to the writing of a 15 to 25 page paper. 
ORGANIZATION: A mid-term and final examination. are given and these tests cover the lecture and reading assignments. A term paper on some topic or problem in international law ~ill be required. This paper is used as a major criterion in evaluatmg the student's ability to analyze. An individual who seriously writes a paper in consl!ltation with Profes~or Kertes~ will find this. ~­perience to be mtellectually rewardmg and f:nJoyable. In add1t1on to the term paper. a number of short wntten reports on cases and articles from the American Jaurnal of Internaional Law are required. Professor Keresz reads each examination and term paper very carefully and as a ·result, his grading can be con­sidered extremely fair. 
COMMENTS: A large amount of written work is involved in this course, and a student who is not serious about his academic pursuits perhaps ought not to take it. But Dr. Stephen Kertesz is a rare teacher, manifestly interested in his students; he en­courages· them to consult with him concerning course material, term papers, or general in!ellectual int~rests. He is remarkably open to all thoughtful opimons. Reflective students ought not to pass up this rare opportunity. 
John Kromkowski 
Government 240 Politics 
CONTENT: The course, in theory, is designed to present a gen­eral look into the offerings of the government department. There are no prerequisites for this course. An interest in government might be helpful, for the lectures tend to be technical. 
PRESENTATION: The class, divided into four sections, gives a brief look at the fields of American Government, Political Theory, Politics, International Relations and Comparative Government (the last two considered as one section). Each section has 25-30 students and lasts for five class sessions. The remainder of the classes are taken up by Mr. Kromkowski's introduction and sum­mation. Because of the large number of students in each sec­tion this year, discussion is limited. Both sections meet on Tuesday and Thursday which means that the class periods are an hour and 15 minutes long. At times, when the technical details are abundant, this length is more conducive to sleep than to learning. 
READINGS: The reading list of the Political Theory section reads like an English syllabus. It includes such literary figures as Dostoevsky. Melville, Beckett and Saint Exupery. The Inter­national Relations section consists of such books as American Foreign Policy Since World War II (John Spanier) and other related texts which may be subject to change. The best text of the whole class may be Herbert Storing's anthology of black political writings entitled What Country Have I? which is dealt with in the American Government section. No readings, only Mr. Kromkowski's lectures are required for the Politics section. 
ORGANIZATION: There is one exam-a final. Four '(3-7 page) papers, one for each section, are also required. All sections will accept extra credit papers. The papers each count 15%, the final, 20%? and class participation 10% of the final grade. 
COMMENT: Unless you are interested in government and its workings, this is not the course for you. Its descent into the technical jargon of the field (particularly in the politics section) leaves too many disinterested students stranded in the clouds of their own daydreams. If your interests do lean toward this sort of thin~, the course can be a rewarding sampling of the govern­ment department. A very accurate one, too. The TA's and Mr. Kromkowski himself make themselves as available as possible to 
the students for "consultations" on different topics, wliich are organized for. a number of students, and for one-to-one meetil!gs with the students to assist them with problems they're having or just to discuss some point of interest. · · · 
THE SCHOLASTIC 

Peter Moody Government 456 The Government and Politics· of Asia 
Government 458 Chinese Political Thought 
GOVERNMENT 456 CONTENT: This course covers India and the countries of South­east Asia, countries belonging, however loosely, to the Indian cultural area. The main exception is Vietnam, which derives its higher culture from China. The approach will be comparative and, to some degree, "theoretical," stressing patterns and problems common to the various countries in the region. 
PRESENTATION: The course is set up for discussion of various topics; however, the size of the class will probably be the deter­mining factor for the format of the couse. 
READIGS: Lucien Rye, Aspects of Political Development; Hunter, Southeast Asia: Race, Culture and Nation; Morris-Jones, The Government and Pplitics -0f India; Vietnam: The Origins of Revolution, McAlister; Vandenbosch, Changing Face of South­east Asia; Luttwak, Coup d'Etat: A Practical Handbook. 
ORGANIZATION: There will be .a mid-term and a final examina­tion. In addition, each student must prepare three analytical reviews of books not on the required reading list, but pertaining to material discussed in class. 
GOVERNMENT 458: CONTENT: This course provides a very brief introduction to Chinese political thinking from classical times up to the present, with a heavy bias toward developments since the mid-nineteenth century. There will, of course, be attempts to examine and evaluate the writings of the various thinkers in terms of systems of ideas per se, but the main stress will be upon an examination of ideas and actual political behavior, or, as Chairman Mao puts it, between "theory" and "practice." 
PRESENTATION: The course will consist mainly of student reports on selected works, with discussion following each report. 
READINGS: Liu and Tu. Traditional China; Kreel, Chinese Thought from Confucius to Mao Tse-Tung; Levenson, Con­fucian China and Its Modern Fate; Chow Tse-Tsung, The May Fourth Movement: Intellectual Revolution in Modern China; Wright, From Revolution to Restoration: The Transformation of Kuomintang Ideology, Tozer, Taiwan's Cultural Renais­sance: A Preliminary View; Schram, The Political Thought of Mao Tse-Tung; Schurmann, Ideology and Organization in Com­munist China; Lifton, Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism; Doolin, Communist China: The Politics of Student Opposition. 
ORGANIZATION: The student reports will be delivered orally; but each report must also be converted into a short paper and turned in after the report has been delivered. In addition, each student must prepare a term paper on some topic related to the material covered in the course. There will be a mid-term and a final examination. 
CoMMENT: Dr. Moody is a fine lecturer and obviously possesses a vast amount of knowledge in his area, which simultaneously amazes and frightens the student. Papers are graded quite fairly, and Dr. Moody has an easy classroom style that allows for a refreshingly free exchange between student and teacher. He is interested in the individual student, and is open to discussion and disagreements. Although there is considerable work in­volved, his courses are excellent for the serious student. 
Gerhart Niemeyer Government 342 Political Theory 
CoNTENT: "Political Theory" is concerned with the study of the major concepts of political thought. The core of the course deals with the great classical political thinkers: Plato, Aristotle and Augustine. Dr. Niemeyer's subsequent lectures deal with Aquinas, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Burke, Marx and Mill. The course is required for all government majors, and there are no prerequisites. The size of the class is usually large, consisting mainly of juniors and seniors. 
PRESENTATION: The basic format of Dr. Niemeyer's class is two lectures and one discussion period per week. His lectures are well organized and well presented. It is quite easy to follow the logical and basic developments of his lectures because of his ex­ceptional and careful preparation and presentation. Dr. Niemeyer is open to questions; however, the size of the class generally limits discussion during the lectures. The worth of the discussion groups varies according to the groups. 
READINGS: Traditionally, the reading list has been Aristotle's Ethics and Politics, Augustine's City of God, Hobbes' Leviathan, and Rousseau's Social Contract. This spring Henri Franfort's Before Philosophy will be substituted for Rousseau and will be read first. The readings, while not excessive, are very rigorous and must be done with much care. 
ORGANIZATION: Weekly half page papers on the readings are required. The purpose of these is to demonstrate whether the student has grasped the basic concepts that the weekly readings contain. Two 1¼-page papers on a topic assigned by Dr. Nie­meyer are also required. Although the papers may seem easy, they require a thorough understanding of the material and an ability to reflect critically on the problem raised by the topic. The shortness of the papers usually adds to their difficulty; pre­cision and consiseness are demanded. There are also two e."<­aminations, which are difficult but fair. The examinations cover both the lectures and the readings. The final grade is based on the weekly papers, the mid-term, the two term papers and the final. Each counts one quarter of the grade. The final grades usually average out to about B. 
Co11n.rnNTS: Students have often criticized Political Theory for its lack of "relevance." "While relevance should by no means be the sole criterion for taking a course, it should not be altogether ignored. Any serious student who comes to this course with a firm desire to be open will soon find that there could hardly be a more relevant course. 
Chris Osakwe Government 479 International Problems 
CONTENT: This course is being offered for the first time by Professor Osakwe, who is in his first year of teaching at Notre Dame; he divides his time between the Government Depart­ment and the Law School. The foreign policy of the Soviet Union from either the end of the Second World War or since 1949 (the Communist regime in China began in that year) and the major problems encountered in the Soviet Union will be the subject matter for this course. Though the areas covered in the class, such as the Sino-Soviet split and policy towards the "third world" may seem "topical," they are selected for their illustration of the problems the Soviet Union must deal with in executing its foreign policy. Professor Osakwe's intense aware­ness of these problems draws the student to reason to his con­clusions, rather than to offer opinions. A respectable under­standing of post-World War II history and various Soviet efforts is invaluable as background for the course. 
PRESENTATION: The course is conducted in a seminar-type format. Professor Osakwe begins each class with a background lecture on the material to be discussed, and a student follows with a presentation of a paper on an assigned topic. There is then a roundtable discussion, which Professor. Osakwe keeps ti~htly connected to the issues ~y asking provocative questions. If there is no student presentation, Osakwe's questions and direc­tion keep the class period lively and interesting. 
READINGS : The readings for the course will center around Brzezinski's Soviet Bloc, Rubinstein's The Foreign Policy of the Soviet Union, and Ulam's Expansion and Co-Existence. Whatever texts are finally decided upon, they are well worth reading. The basic texts for the course are supplemented by an extensive bibliography on each topic. 
ORGANIZATION: In addition to the class presentation, each stu­dent will probably be required to write a term paper of respect­able length. Topics for both are selected on the basis of Osakwe's suggestions. Since these are the major basis of the grade and contribute much to the knowledge which is derived from the course, students are expected to put much effort and thought into them. Participation in the discussions, in a thoughtful and lucid manner, is also expected. 
COMMENTS: The material covered in the course is, by itself, interesting and worthy of attention. Coupled with Professor Osakwe's disciplined mind and provocative presentation, this is a course well worth taking. One must, however, have a willing­ness to do the readings. 

NOVEMBER 30, 1971 
John Roos 
Government 432 

American Political Parties 
John Roos, Thomas Swartz_ 
Government 430 

Urban Studies Seminar 
GOVERNMENT 432 CONTENT: This is a one-semester course being taught for the ­first time by Professor Roos. Although the focus of the course will be the structure and operation of the two major parties in the United States, the scope of the course will go beyond just a description of these in order to reach a better understanding of the theory and operation of political parties. The first part of the course will deal with the theory behind parties and use some comparative studies to elucidate the essential points. The course will then move to an analysis of the party structure in Amer­ican politics. The final part of the course will employ the oper­ations of the parties in the current election year as a case study of the subject matter. 
READINGS: The reading for the course will pro_vide both descrip­tive and theoretic material for the framework which will be established in the lectures. Although the reading list has not yet been completed, Professor Roos has been known -to assemble readings of high quality for _his courses. Michels' Political Parties and other works of interest as well as current materials will help comprise the list for this course. 
GOVERNMENT 430 
CONTENT: This course will be team taught by Professor Roos and 
Professor Swartz from the Economics Department. Despite the 
title, the course will be set up around class lectures rather than 
seminar discussions. The course will treat the economic, political, 
and theoretical aspects of urban problems and government. 
While concerning itself with the current urban crisis, some his­
torical considerations of urban life will be made. Both teachers 
will treat the political and economic questions raised. 
R~ADINGS: The reading for the course will be extensive, putting a fairly heavy load on the student. But the quality of the works makes it more than worthwhile for the student seriously interested in the subject. In the post such works as Anatomy of a Metrop­olis, CitJ1 Politics, The City in History; and Maximum Feasible Misunderstanding have been on the list. ­
O?tGANIZAT~ON: In addition to _the lectures and reading, there 
will ~e a _mid-term; a final, and a term paper of moderate length 
reqmred m each of the courses. The student is ~ven-wide discre­
tion in choosing the topic for the paper. , -· -_ 
-, COMMENTS: Prospective students for either -of these courses should be aware of Professor Roos' teaching method. Through the lectures he establishes a theoretical framework for the course. The readings enlarge and develop the themes set forth in the class­room. The approach demands that the student read criticallv and be .able to perceive the larger scope within which individual problems are discussed. ---------·-', 
Pete-r Walshe Government 446 The Politics of Southern Africa 
CoNTENT:lnitially this course focuses on-the Republic of South Africa-the core apartheid state. -It then shifts to include.Rhode­sia, the Portuguese territories and Mamibia (South West Africa). A persp~ctiv«: of Southern Africa in world affairs• is definitively created m this one semester course whose first half is structured around organized lecture and the second around the involved seminar. -There are no prerequisites for this course. Students enrolled are predominantly government majors but a minority of other majors do participate. 
PRESENTATION: Professor Walshe is a particularly dynamic lec­turer. Lectures are concise and cover a considerable amount of material. Superb organization permits easy note-taking.-L~c­tures both relate to and supplement the reading. and _questions are encouraged. The dynamic quality·of the lectures carry over-into the seminar discussions. · -'·_ , ­
. -­READINGS: Two paperbacks are all that need be purchased ( total ­of $5) : LeMay, Black and White in South Africa and L: Thonip­son, Politics: The Republic of South Africa. While supplement­ary readings are moderately heavy '( mainly periodi~als _and ot~er sources placed on reserve), they are generally qmte mterestmg and mesh with the topics comprehensively. 
ORGANIZATION: There is a midterm ·and a final with one short paper to be prepared for use in the seminar section of the course. Exams are demanding but particularly fair. Questions on exams are predictable at least-in a general way. Professor Walshe readily provides assistance in selecting and organizing the term paper topically as well as finding the necessary material. The final grade is based on both the examinations and performance in the seminars. 
COMMENTS: Politics of South Africa is an excellent follow-up to the Tropical Africa course taught this semester although the course is very much recommended in its own right. Professor Walshe's personal experience of Africa and his intense personal concern for the South African situation provide added dimensions to the course. It proves to be a rewarding learning experience, giving both the sense of complexity of international politics as well as a thorough examination of possible future world troublespots. I highly recommend this course for government majors and non­majors alike. Professor _Walshe will also be teaching "Case Studies in African Politics" (Government 448), a seminar course for students who have completed the prerequisites of his "Politics of Tropical Africa" or-"Politics oL Southern Africa." Beyond a doubt, this man's courses leavl'! you with a lasting. interest in the African continent. In the case of South Africa for example, this interest cannot help but take the form of a particularly heightened concern for the situation -of 17 million victims of racist apartheid policies. Draw your own conclusions·. 
George Williams Government 341 International Relations 
Government 482 National . S~curity Problems 
GOVERNMENT 341 CONTENT: This course is-required for all government majors, so its comp9sition -is mostly juniors. The course will examine in detail such topics as military power, deterrence, moder!}ization, Vietnam, and public opinion with the intent-of allowing each student the opportunity to formulate -and understand his own opinions. · 
PRESENTATION: Professor Williams does not intend to "sp-oon feed," so "bozos" beware. Assignments must be read with the ­purpose of understanding the various conceptual schemes and systematic approaches to the analysis of each topic. Although the responsibility of integrating lectures, readings, as well as ·the stu­dent's own thoughts is left in the student's hands. Professor Wil­
-Iiams is always willing to -assist-the student in his attempt to extend his own cognitive map over such an extensive and complex field. ­
READINGS_: There are about six required paperbacks each semester in addition to the numerous readings on· reserve. All are of high quality .with ample time given_ to complete each assign­ment. Professor Williams distributes· lengthy bibliographies deal­ing-with each-topic, they serve as an invaluable aid for future 
·reference and "on-th~-side" reading. 
ORGANIZATION: There are usually three quizzes, a final -exam ;nd an optional book review. Quizzes are structured to test the stu­dent's insight and grasp of the many analytic co~cepts presented in the course. Rote memorization or bullish-answers do not suffice. Grading of tests ics fair with an average final grade of B.' 
GOVERNMENT 482 CONTENT: This upper-division ~ourse will examine the making of American defense policy in the context of congressional-and 
·bureaucratic bargaining. Special emphasis will be giyen to the Vietnam war and strategic nuclear programs. The course is struc­tured as a seminar with limited enrollment. ­
PRESENTATION: Professor Williams intends that the structure of the seminar be in the nature of a. tennis game. Those who are too lazy to return -or who can't stick to the rules of the game would be better off leaving their tennis shoes at home. Professor Williams plays ·an extremely aggressive game-on a court; he is 

THE SCHOLASTIC 

quite kuowleclgeable, with a willingness to entertain any on­coming volley. Professor Williams' engaging style and ability to analyze politics in a multi-faceted fashion ( extending into the social science "grab-bag" of related disciplines) makes the course a multi-dimensional experience. 
READINGS: Readings include Enthoven and Smith's How Much Is Enough? and the $20.00, four volume collection of The P.en­tagon Papers (Senator Gravel edition), along with the usual 




History 
and valuable readings ·on reserve. Heavy emphasis will be given to lengthy research papers. 
Cm,1MENTs: Professor Williams (a Yale graduate and student of Harold Las.well and Karl Deutsch) is extremely well read and knowledgeable, not only in the field of political science but also in such areas as sociology and psychology. His ability to utilize advancement in these disciplines to the study of politics makes both of these courses worthwhile educational experiences. , 
Leon Bernard History 322 French Revolution and Napoleon 
CONTENT: This course is an· in-depth study of the men and events of the first modern revolution of continental Europe. The course studies the intellectual, cultural and political factions of France as their influences rise and subside during those hectic years and examines Napoleon both as a son and reaction to the revolution. The major emphasis of the course is on the men and ideas which prepare and lead the revolution. While there are no prerequisites, a general knowledge of European history helps prepare the student. The class, in the past, has been com­posed mostly of juniors and seniors. A high percentage of the students are nonhistory majors. 
PRESENTATION: The quality of lectures is excellent. Professor Bernard. speaks slowly enough so as to· facilitate note taking. Yet, he is not dry. He mixes in humorous stories of French leaders and makes the men of the revolution appear more human than the texts might lead ·you to believe. Dr. Bernard also interjects personal reflections which complement the texts. His tests are based on this same combination. 
READINGS: The readings in the past have been very good. This year they will consist of six or seven paperbacks which include: R.. R. Palmer's, Twelve Who Ruled; G. Lefebvres', Coming -of the French Revolution; Arthur Young's, Travels During the Years 1787-88-89 and Holtman's; Napoleonic Revolution . . 
ORGANIZATION:. There will be a mid-term and final,.of the essay variety, and one ·term paper of about. ten pages. Professor Bernard wants students to write about matters that interest them. •He believes cultural and intellectual history. is as impor­tant ·as political history and encourages students to explore these areas. The average grade for. the course is B. Full A's have to be earned but .ire not impossible and C's are not guaran.; teed. The tests do not nit-pick but are more concerned in seeing that the students understand the concept behind the revolution and rise of Napoleon. . . 
COMMENTS: Professor Bernard's course is definitely an excellent educational experience. The past students, in general, have been very impressed by his knowledge of the subject as well as his friendly personality. Professor Bernard teaches his course in such a way as to put nonmajors at ease. His aim is not to over­whelm one with facts but, rather, to give the student a feeling for the times and people of the Revolutionary a?d Napoleonic age. 
Anthony Black History 342 Twentieth-Century' Europe 
CONTENT: Survey from World War I to present, emphasis upon military aspects with little reference to sociological or cultural aspects. There are no prerequisites for the course. Smattering of history and non-majors. The course is offered at SMC. 
PRESENTATION: Dr. Black is a ·very interesting lecturer which explains why his format does not usually leave much room for class discussion. Readings are from the text and one outside source. 
NOVEMBER 30, · 1971 
READINGS: Valuable text, but rather uninteresting outside source. Pace was ra>Jid, but not overwhelming. 
O~GANIZATION: There will be one ten-page paper, three tests, and a final. It is necessary to be very thorough and inclusive in ·test answers. 
COMMENTS: The class on the whole is quite good, marred only a few times by · boring-lectures. Could be further improved by more discussion and smaller class size to facilitate this. 
Robert Bums 
History 434 
England 1815-1914 
CONTENT: Description of the goals and emphasis not available at this time. In the past such courses have been comprised primarily of junior arid senior AL--most of them history majors. No prerequisites. This course is being offered for the first time and continues Dr. Burns' series on British history, beginning with the Tudors. PRESENTATION:Dr. Burns' lectures in the past have gained a reputation· as being quite dry, but, nonetheless, very direct, chronologically unified, and excellent supplements to the assigned readings. 
READINGS: Not available at this time. 
ORGANIZATION: On both of this writer's previous experiences with Dr. Burns the final grade was based on three tests and one assigned paper. Past grades have usually been from A to B-. 
CoMl\rENTS : It should be stated here and now that the lecture style of Dr. Robert Burns will never make him a threat to either the picking· up of any trophies in Atlantic City or appearing before rallies at Sproul Plaza, Berkeley. However, it would be foolish for anyone to dismiss consideration of this course solely on this basis. Dr. Bums has both an apparent personal interest in and scholarly dedication to the area of British history. In such areas as the history of the Irish Parliament, which is apparently the subject of his life's research and inquiries, he is without peers-anywhere. This course would be recommended 
for not only the history major seeking to fulfill his European requirements, but also any business or science concentrate who might want to take a history AL elective before graduation. The final word about Dr. Burns would be that there is another side of him, which for some reason he has camouflaged in the classroom. At times in the past it was periodically unveiled when he would tell of his travels in the British Isles or of his associa­tion with Sen. Abraham Ribicoff. However, for the most part he has been content to simply read his notes, answer questions and depart. Perhaps this time will be different. 
Lawrence Bradley History 380 American Constitutional History 
CONTENT: This two-semester course traces the development of American constitutional principles from their origin in Medieval England to their present form. Most of the forty students in the course are history and American studies majors, and the over­whelming majority are pre-law students. 
PRESENTATION: Dr. Bradley's lectures seem well prepared, but at times become dry. However, when_ asking frequent questions during his lecture, Dr. Bradley displays a good personality along with a solid grasp of constitutional law. He welcomes ,questions from the class, as he probably realizes that_ thes~ sessions are the strength of the course. 
READINGS: One textbook is used for both semesters: The.Amer­ican Constitution, Its Origins and Development by Kelly and Harbison ($10.75). In addition, the course requires three short supplemental works for each semester. The text is thorough and well written, and is definitely worthwhile reading. The supple­ments are of less value, usually providing a sketchy highlight of a single constitutional issue. 
ORGANIZATION: In addition to the readings, a 10-12 page paper comparing two books of the student's choice k required. The books must represent somewhat opposing views of a constitu­tional question. Two exams and a final are given. The exams are comprehensive and fair. The average grade should be near B. 
COMMENTS: This course is recommended oniy to those. who plan a career in law. Others will find it difficult remaining interested. Although Dr. Bradley is a lawyer, he is much more comfortable with European history, as he earned his do_ctorate in that field. He was assigned to teach this course on _rather short notice in order to replace Prof. _Menard. Thus, he is still rather unsure of himself in the field. of American History. However, considering his open attitude and. good effort, it seems certain that this course will improve in both quality and interest. 
Rita Cassidy 
History 319 
Afro-American History 
History 354 Sub-Saharan-African· History: II 
HISTORY 319­CONTENT: There ·are rio prerequisites for the course. It IS primarily composed of sophomore, junior, and senior students.­The course emphasizes the position of the black man in -history, through the Civil War to modem times._ This course is offered 
at SMC. . . 
PRESENTATION: The course is presented both with ~ectures_ and discussion. -However, the discussion is maintained on a v·ery in­tellectual level, ·and the student must back his view with facts. The reading normally presents aview different from that of the lectures. This course is offered by St. Mary's: . _ 
READINGS: The :readings are generally worthwhile, and..the professor gives sufficient time for the student· to complete them. The readings are found in books held in reserve at the _SMC library. -
ORGANIZATION:cFour book reviews are required f~om the student. There are three exams --an exam on the readings, a mid-term, and a final. The_ basis for the course grade rests on test grades and the _quality of the student's book reviews. _The average final grade is usually a B-to B. 
COMMENTS: The course is a significant educational experience. The discussions are thought-provoking, the readings worthwhile, and the professor is-an excellent lecturer. The class,is not com­posed solely of history majors. and,_ therefore, not a ."major" course. 
HISTORY 354 _ . 
CONTENT·: The course is concerned with modern Africa and its -role in the modern world. Black..:white relations are discussed. The only prerequisites for this course are some knowledge· of 
· basic world history and a desire to become intellectually in­volved in African problems. The course is offered at SMC. 
PRESENTATION: The lectures are largely factual. _However, many interesting sidelights about native African life are given. Miss _Cassidy has travelled widely in Africa and understands the ,African's problems. Discussion is minimal -questions, though, 

are answered readily. · · · · ­
READINGS: There are few outside readings for the course and there are no required· texts. -Tlie information from· the lectures is the material used in testing. · 

ORGANIZATION: Two book reports on novels -written by African writers are required: Most of the novels are short and interest­ing. One paper, _15-20 pages, that deals ·with ·the geography, population, peoples, and politics of a certain• African country, is required. There is only one test, a mid-term. The final consists of each person presenting his or her paper to the-class, with the other students discussing its· merits. , T,he average grade is a B. 
COMMENTS: The ~ourse is b~th. interestiri'g arid worthwhile. All students can appreciate ·a. basic knowleage of Africa. However, several problems are apparent. An increased number of outside reading is needed. Also, the class meets for_ three hours once a week -atime span that sorely tries the student's· concentration. 
James Corbett History. 334M History of. t.he Middle Ages II · 
CONTENT: History of the Middle Ages II is a survey course of the history ·of Western· Europe from around 1050 to about 1400. Professor Corbett covers all-of the major topics of Medieval History but because of the survey nature of the course, he · understandably emphas,izes t_he political and Church areas. Since this course is the second-semester part of an optional require­ment; most of the students are history majors. As Jar as pre­requisites go, it would be wise for the student to. have taken the first· semester course. · 
PRESENTATION: P;ofess~r.·Corbett has bee~ teaching -this for 
_many· years. His lectures are always well organized and coherent. Because of the amount of material. to be covered, there is not time for much class aiscussion. The lectures do not· duplicate the readings but provide a fine complement to them. 
.. 

READINGS: Since about four of the books from the first semester, e.g., Mark Bloch's Feudal Society, will be used again, the cost for the second semester will be minimal. Three or four new books -a total cost of $7-will be assigned. The readings are well­known Medieval histories, quite interesting, and some also fairly difficult. There is plenty of-,time to read them. · 
ORGANIZATIO,N: .There are two very fair examinations, a mid­term and· a ·final; they are predominantly essay -but with some objective questions. · Dr. Corbett · also assigns a 3-4,000 word 
-research paper whose topic must be narrow-enough to be treated adequately. He-places a goodly.amount of emphasis on this·paper for determi_nation of the grade. . · 
CoMME~T: In the ~pinion of this reviewer, Professor Corbett is a fine Medievalist and particularly knowledgeable about the Church·history of the Middle Ages. If some students feel that he overly stresses the Church in his course, it must be pointed out that the Church was the most important institution :in the life of the Medieval man. As a final note, I must add that 
. Professor Corbett is one of the kindest and most personable faculty members that I have had the pleasure of knowing while at Notre· Dame. . · · 
Vincent P. DeSantis History 372-572 Americ:an Political History Since· 1917 
CONTENT; This cou;se covers the major themes of American politics since 1917, with emphasis on the Presidency and politi­cal parties. AU classes are represented with several graduate students included. There are no prerequisites. 
PRESENTATION: Professor DeSantis knows the subject well, so the lectures_ are full and punctuated with anecdotes and per­sonal experiences. The lectures, however, tend· to drag because of the 75-minute periods. Questions are welcomed but discus­sion is minimal due to the large size of the class. Professor DeSantis' mellow voice makes the back row a bad place to sit -you miss out on the content of his lectures which are the nucleus of his course. 
READINGS: The readings consist of memoirs and biographies that add background to the lectures. They are slow reading, packed with detail, but not-difficult. Approximate cost -$15. 
ORGANIZATION: Grades ·are based on the midterm and final. There are no papers. .The test questions are taken from the lectures and readings and consist of 2-3 essay questions. He asks 
THE SCHOLASTIC 

for good litereray style ·in your-writing along with g~d content. A's are hard to get and C's or lower are rare. · 
CoMMENTS: This is not an. exciting course· -nor is' ·Professor DeSantis exciting in-his presentation,. but for a ·student· of con­temporary politics it would be a -very beneficial · course; The course could be improved by _Professor DeSantis being more lively· and controversial in his presentation: He is a B grader and favors his graduate· students, -but the course is still worth the effort. 
Jay P. Dolan History 378 American Religious and Ethnic Groups: 
CONTENT: The course will study the history of immigration in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the anti­immigration climate and legislation in the U.S. and the Black and Mexican migration to the North and South of the U.S. It will then treat the various theories of assimilation. With this background it will then study the Irish,. Italian, Polish, Black, Jewish and Mexican experience in the U.S. The major empha­sis of the course will be the assimilation of ethnic groups and the role of the church in this progress. The students will be both undergraduate and gr_aduate. 
PRESENTATION: Lectures ·are ·factual and interesting. Father Dolan presents enough information to make the class interesting, but not so much as to make it dull. Any questions are handled immediately, and are answered fully so that there will be no doubt as to the real situation.· 
RE~DINGS: Seven paperbacks will be required for the class; an average of about 200 pages of ·reading a week will be necessary. The readings are relevant to the discussions, and· are usually interesting. 
ORGANIZATION: Students will be expected to do the readings and participate in some student panels. The grade for the course will be based on a final exam covering the readings in the course and a paper analyzing some aspect of the ethnic e.'Xperi­ence. Slides· and film will also be used in the course. The readings· will· include immigrant novels, primary sources and secon~ary studies. 
COMMENT: Father Dolan is a must for History majors with a concern for. ethnic groups and urban problems. He has a great style, and-at the end of.each period the student feels as though he has really experienced the topic discussed. The class, how­ever, is riot jock, and is not one for people who need an easy A, but rather is for. those among us who are concerned and dedi­cated History students. 
Bernard ·Donahoe, C.S.C. History 316 , Recent U.S. History. 
CONTENT: This course, which :is taught only in the spring semester, is concerned ,with the· history of the lJ_nited States from Wilson to the present. It deals primarily with the ideology of historians concerned with the major events of this period in history. A working knowledge of American history and current events is invaluable to-the course. Primarily, the class is com­posed of junior and senior history majors. · 
PRESENTATION: Bernard Donahoe's lectures are extremely inter­esting-and informative. The lectures are tightly organized, well thought out, and add greatly ·to the material read for class. The lectures are not merely a stream of historical facts, but they en­compass a broad expanse of social, economic, and ideological concerns of the period. Bernard Donahoe's lectures primarily afford additional material and controversial material to the books assigned. He presents his own insights into historical events and his students cannot help but marvel at his knowledge of the sub­ject. There is little discussion, if any, in the course, but it is not sorely missed. 
'. 
READINGS: .Most of the readings are extremely interesting and very worthwhile. About orie book-per week and possibly more is required. 
ORGANIZATION: There ,are n~-p;pers ~ssigned_ clue 'to ·th~. ·hea~ reading list. The course. is extremely weUorganized and is kept 
NQVEMBER 30, 1971 
·. on schedule. There are four tests, weighted approximately equally with _a little more emphasis on the final. The final is not really 
· cumulative, but does require a good conception of all the material covered.· The examinations are fairly difficult and do require a good deal of preparation. The final grade is based on. the percentage of the four examinations. The average final grade is . a B. However, there is some difficulty with the material covered. The examinations are fairly difficult and do lectures; · 
Cm,n.tENTS: The course is excellent and very worthwhile. It clearly explains the principles and philosophies of noted Amer­icans and the crucial importance of the events of recent U.S. History. The course explains the "why" of political actions. 
Matthew· Fitzsimons ·History 381 History a.nd Historians 
History 398 Special Studies m Chinese Civilization 
HISTORY 381 CONTENT: History and Historians will consist of readings from historical classics to illustrate the various views of history in different civilizations, and at different periods in Western Civili­zation. Among the historical classics will be selections from Herodotus, Thucydides, Gibbon, Macaulay, DeTocqueville, Marx, Henry Adams, Lord Acton, and Arnold Toynbee. Dr. Fitzsimons plans to lecture no more than once a week. with the other two class meetings consisting of conferences, discus­sions and reports. There will be nvo examinations during the semester, with a report on one historian taking the place of the final. , 
COMMENT:' This course is being offered for the first time this spring, and considering the subject matter and the teacher, it should prove to be an intellectual experience of the highest order. The question of how men view history is certainly a pertinent one in an age when a good portion of humanity has become enslaved because -of one view of history. Fitzsimons is_ a universal man, and unequivocally qualified to teach the course. The opportunity to know him and work with him should not be passed up by any serious student, whether he be a history major or not. 
HISTORY 398 
_CoNTENT: This specially arranged reading course will deal with the origins and formation of Chinese Civilization .from its beginnings to the end of the Han Dynasty. Among the topics to_ be dealt with are: an overview and some misconceptions, geography, archeology and prehistory, the foundation of Chinese civilization, fundamental traditions and great teachers, the Ch'ing Dynasty and its empire, and the Han Dynasty. 
READINGS: The load for this course will be extensive and defi­
nitely not of the dilettantish variety. 
ORGANIZATION: There will be a mid-term examination and three one-hour··conferences with Dr. Fitzsimons. The students are, also expected to arrange one-hour conferences with the five or so faculty members who have interest and competence in the field of Chinese Civilization. For the latter half of the course, each student is asked to prepare a seven-page analytical history of the Han Dynasty (plus a one-page explanation of method) and a paper on some aspect of Chinese Civilization in the Han period. Each course member will also be required to look at the Art Department's slides on Chinese art and the illustrations of early Chinese art in several of the standard histories of Chinese and Far Eastern art. 
. CoMl\lENT: Obviously this is not a course for those desiring a low-pressure elective. Nor is it one for the second-semester senior to use just to fill out his schedule. But it is a fine course for someone with a sincere desire to get a firm background in a subject of-which more Westerners should be aware. 
.Trunes Kritzeck History · 304-504 The -Near Ea~t in the 20th Century 
Co,NTENT: Although he is no stranger to the Theology depart­ment, this is Professor Kritzeck's ;second. semester in the De­. pirtmerit ·or. History. His" course,. "The Near East in the 20th 
Century," will be offered for the first time this spring. The course covers the history of the "Near East" -from Morocco to India -from 1900 to the present, with attention to causes and results of the World Wars. The Arab-Israeli conflict will be analyzed from 3.I1 historical perspective. However, the course's emphasis will be on cultural rather·than political history, includ­ing the three "isms" -imperialism, nationalism, and socialism. 
PRESENTATION: The course will not be the standard, straight­lecture type, but will be a combination of lecture, audiovisual presentation, and occasional seminar discussion. 
READINGS: General required readings will be minimal, but there will he an extensive list of suggested readings to form an "indi­vidualized:' bibliography for the student. The exact course requirements have not been established at this time. 
Co:r.DIENTS: The course is unrestricted and there is only one requirement -a sincere interest in studying the Near East. For this reason, and because Professor Kritzeck is a· strong believer in a professor's having a personal knowledge of his students, he requires a meeting with the student for admission -a require­ment which, Dr. Kritzeck emphasizes, is not designed to frighten away the prospective student. 
Donald Mattheisen · History 327-_ Germany: 1789-1917 
CONTENT: This course concerns itself with the history of Ger­many from the time of the Napoleonic period until the eve of the First World War. The major themes in the study of this particular period are the political unification ai;id the constitu­tional evolution of the modern German state. Special emphasis is placed on the revolution of 1848, the ministry of Bismarck, and the foreign policy and diplomacy which led to World War I. There are no particular prerequisites· for the course, .it's open to all who are interested. Those enrolled are for the most part junior and senior AL students. History majors, as can be expected, have a slight majority, and there are usually a few graduate students. 
PRESENTATION: While Dr. Mattheisen's lectures are not the most dynamic you'll ever hear, they show excellent organization, and are outlined in a manner very conducive to good note-, taking. The content is fairly interesting and lucidly presented, and the five-minute break Dr. Mattheisen gives half way through the class helps to ease the strain that 75 minutes puts on one's attention span. Questions are welcome, and discussions usually arise on the, topics of any of the short papers assigned. The quality of the discussions, of course, depends on the stu­dent's willingness to participate. The lectures are well inte­grated with the reading material in that they form a good structural outline which the readings fill in. Both the lectures and the readings, therefore, form the basis of the tests. · 
READINGS: The reading list ·has changed considerably since the course was last taught. The general textbook is the same, Ger­many: A Short History, (Semon). This provides an adequate general summary of the period in question. The rest of the books are the following: Restoration, Revolution and Reaction (Hamerow), Bismarck and the Development of Modern Ger­many (Pflanze), and Imperial Germany (Rosenberg).! The readings in the past have usually been of good quality, both interesting and informative. 
ORGANIZATION: There are three short project assignments re­quired for the course, with which the student should encounter little difficulty. Besides a map assignment, there are two three­page papers which summarize readings assigned from the reserve book room of the library. The combined three grades of these projects form one third of the final grade. The student has two options open to him in regards to the midterm. There are two midterm tests, spaced about three and one half weeks apart. The student may take either one of these tests, having it count one third of the final grade, or he may take both, having each count one sixth. The final exam counts as the last one third of the grade. The tests are divided into two parts, one section of term identifications, and the other an essay. Each section is worth half the possible points. In regard to the essay, the student should be prepared to use his arsenal of facts to defend, discuss or develop a given hypothesis, not simply to· 
regurgitate them.. The average final grade is around the B to ~-range.. 
COMMENTS: Dr. Mattheisen's course is certainly interesting and worthwhile, and is to be highly · recommended to any history major in need of his Modern European History credits, as well as to any student in search of an elective. In light of Germany's controversial and formidable role in the twentieth century, the study of the. background of this role cannot help but be somewhat fascinating, in particular the aspects of Bismark's statecraft. Dr. Mattheisen is no easy grader, but the workload is hardly what you would call prohibitive. Those nonhistory majors who have unpleasant memories of history survey courses taken to fill the AL history requirements should not let these memories prejudice them against this course. It has its drier moments, as does any historical study. But it does provide some valuable insights into a historical development, which, in the past, has been subject to both ignorance and misunderstanding. 

Fredrick B. Pike ~istory 386 _ Spain and Spanish America 
CONTENT: Professor Pike. is a concerned teacher. He is also an acknowledged expert in the fields of Spanish and Latin Ameri­can Studies, .and·he carefully explores the interrelation_ of these two areas. He approaches an -ideal balance in providing sub­stantial detailed information, on -the one hand, and generalized integrative insight, on the other. 
PRESENTATION: Professor Pike speaks from the perspective of firsthand living experience and original research. Thus, his lectures are solid and casual at the .same time. His style is lucid and witty.· This course is well: structured, and requirements of the student will be explicitly presented. 
READING: None have been given as yet. 
COMMENT: Professor Pike: is fairly demanding in course work and sufficiently rigorous in grading policy. The course will be stimulating and excellent. 
Charles Poinsatte · History.412 . Study of American Culture II 
CONTENT: This course; which ·is :taught only in the spring semester, dealt with the cultural pattern of the U.S. after the Civil war. It attempts to bring in factors which are not in them­selves the subject of the course but which have had an influence on American culture and history. These factors include religious, philosophical, educational, artistic, soc!ological, and musical. The course is primarily filled with seniors and is offered by St. Mary's. 
PRESENTATION: The course is primarily lecture by Dr. Poinsatte. This is no faul~-his lectures are always interesting and expansive: 
READINGS : There are no textbooks• used in class. However, there are outside reading _works, yet these, from the Brown Decades to W. DuBois, are excellent. 
ORGANIZATION: There are 2 tests in the· course, a mid term and a final, the final being extremely comprehensive. A 10-15 page paper, which involves considerable work· by the student, is also required. The grade for the course, which usually fluctu­ates between a B and an A-, is based on the grades of the tests and paper. 
COMMENTS: Students who have taken this course feel that it was useful to them, but that it required too much work for the 2 credits given. At times, the professor tended to be "picky" on the style of the paper, especially concerning footnotes. How­ever, judging overall, students are urged to take this. course, regardless if they are history majors or not, .if they are interested in American culture. 
Samuel Shapiro History· 368 . Afro-American History 
History 390A . ... _ History of Mexico -. 


HISTORY·368 . 
CONTENT: This course deals with the'histoi:f'of Black people· in America ·from the Reconstruction-· Era· (1865:-1877) to the present time. The approach is roughly chronological ·with read­ings, lectures, and discussions centered around the major epochs of Black history during the last century. 
PRESENTATION: There ·will be occasional readings and lectures on the history of the Black people in Africa and Latin-America. Since enrollment in the second semester of this course is usually somewhat smaller than in the first, the opportunity for class discussion will be greater. . 
The film series is a required part of the course. If you are unable to attend both the Monday and Wednesday classes, and one of the Tuesday (6 pm), Wednesday (1:15, 2:20, 3:25) or Thursday (8 pm) film sessions, don't enroll in this course. 
ORGANIZATION: The may be unannounced quizzes on the 
readings, otherwise there is only a major paper and a final. 
READINGS: Wiedner, A History of Africa South of the Sahara; 
O. Uya, From Slavery to Public Service; Three Negro Classics, {Avon); Richard Wright, Black Boy; G. Osofsky, Harlem: The Making of a Ghetto; Richard Wright, Native Son; and White Man, Listen; Elliot Liebon, Tally's Corner; E. · Franklin Frazier, Black Bourgeoisie; Charles Silberman, Crises in Black and White,; W. Huie, Three Lives for Mississippi or Hersey, The Algiers Motel Incident. 
COMMENTS: Doctor Shapiro is known for his outspokenness in class and lack of organization both inside and outside of class. This is less harmful than would be expected. He is very knowl­edgeable and gives the impression of knowing everything and of having· taught in every university and college in the U.S. The readings and films are excellent in every sense. The work load is heavy but not impossible. The final exam covers every­thing and a student must be up-to-date on all of his work as it covers everything presented in the course. This is not an easy course, but for the student who is interested in the Black. Ex­perience, it is well worth the effort as Doctor Shapiro does an excellent job. 
HISTORY 390A CONTENT: This is a two semester course. The first semester covers Mexico up until the ·Diaz regime. The second semester will begin with the Diaz dictatorship and survey the history of 
· Mexico and Mexican Americans in the 20th Century. There are no prerequisites for the course. The composition of the course is mainly history majors, however, non-majors will find this course an interesting one. 
PRESENTATION: The second semester course will combine lecture with discussion. There are generally fewer students than during the first semester which makes discussion more productive. Professor Shapiro's 'lectures are very informal yet well organized. His personal experiences and his approach to lectures enhance the course and are quite interesting. Professor Shapiro will also use_ slides and three-movies which· are related to this period of _ Mexican-•history. His lectures are related to both the required books and his tests. 
READINGS : The readings of the second semester will consist of twelve paperbacks including three Mexican novels. These books are relevant to the lectures and there is usually one book to be read each week. 
-ORGANIZATION: There are two major tests, a midterm and a final. Professor Shapiro also requires a one page commentary on·each of the assigned books. In addition to this, each student must read one outside book and write a 3-5 page paper on it. The two tests combine objective and essay questions. The final grade is based loosely on the tests and papers. The average grade for this course is a B. 
COMMENTS: Professor Shapiro's course should be interesting to both majors and non-majors. This course is not overly difficult, although :keeping up with the reading may at times be tedious. The deadlines for papers are not inflexible and Professor Shapiro is understanding and sensitive to the students. Professor Shapiro's 
. classes also take occasional trips t~ museums, migrant-labor farms, and even to his home for a Mexican·dinner. Some students may find the lectures too loosely structured but most will find the course an extremely interesting and educational one. Professor Shapiro is also quite willing to meet with students outside of class time. · 
NOVEMBER 30, 1971 
Marshall Smelser History .362 British New: World Empire II, lMWF 
History 363 American Revolution II 
HISTORY 362 CoNTENT: This .is the second half of a two-semester course dealing primarily with the cultural, social, religious and eco­nomic formation of the British American colonies benveen the mid-1600s and the end of the French and Indian War (1763). Offered every spring, this class is small (fifteen students}, being primarily composed of history majors and several graduate stu­dents. There is no prerequisite for this course. 
PRESENTATION: While the material covered in this course can become very dry, Professor Smelser's thorough knowledge of the subject matter and his fine sense of humor help to make the lectures interesting. The lectures follow the general outline set forth in Dr. Smelser's manual of American Colonial History. 
READINGS : The basic text for this course is the manual written by Dr. Smelser. There are also three books of documents which tend to be rather boring and four other more enjoyable and seemingly more valuable readings required. There is more than adequate time given to do the reading. Cost for the books is approximately $25. 
ORGANIZATION: The grade is based on a midterm which deals exclusively with two of the readings, four one-page book analyses based on a prepared form and a final. The midterm is usually an essay test with the final being an almost trivia-based objective test covering the lectures and three books of documents. Dr. Smelser is a very meticulous corrector and grader and conse­quently takes his time in returning the tests and papers. The average grade for this course is a B, but an A can be had with a good deal of work. 
COMMENTS: Professor Smelser is not only an outstanding teacher but an historical scholar as well. While being fairly demanding in this course, he is also quite fair. This course is highly recom­mended for all history majors and any student looking for a truly intellectually stimulating class. 
HISTORY 363 CONTENT: American Revolution II completes the in-depth study of the revolution begun in the fall semester. The course will begin in the period between the surrenders of Burgoyne and Cornwallis (exactly where is determined by the ending of Amer­ican Revolution I) and conclude with the election of Washing­ton in 1789. Since the course is a continuation of first-semester work, completion of American Revolution I is a necessary pre­requisite for this course. Those who were not in the class first semester will be asked to drop the course. The class is largely composed of Arts and Letters students, with the majority of these being junior and senior history majors. 
PRESENTATION: Professor Smelser is an interesting lecturer who possesses an acute knowledge of the Revolution period. The student's lecture notes are the core of the course. The readings supplement these notes, but it .is the student's job. to relate them to each other. Professor Smelser describes the events in his own style and assumes that the student is independently pursuing the readings. The atmosphere is friendly and informal, and questions are encouraged. 
READINGS: The reading list is exactly the same as the one used · this semester. The basic texts are Alden's The American Revo­lution, Gipson's The Coming of the Revolution, and Smelser's own American Colonial and Revolutionary History (Second Edition). The supplementary readings are Colburn's The Colo­nial Experience: Readings in Early American History, Hawke's 
U.S. Colonial History, Readings and Documents, Walsh's The Mind and Spirit of Early America and Morison's Sources and Documents Illustrating the .American Revolution (Second Edi­tion). The readings are quite good. The student is only required to read those parts of each book which relate to' the period covered in the course. 
ORGANIZATION: The student is required to do four one-page book reviews. Two of the books are the course's basic texts, Gipson and Alden. The other two can be done on any books selected by the student from the bibliographies contained in the required readings. The due dates for these papers are spread throughout the semester and must be strictly adhered to. In addition, there will be. a midtern and. a finaL. The tests con­

COMMENTS: American Revolution II is an''~c~lle~t. cours~: Professor Smelser, in addition _to possessing unbounded _know!-. edge_ of the period, takes a genuine. interest in '.his ·students. This course should be avoided ·by those seeking only ·a high grade.. _For those interested:in experiencing the American Revo­
lution, this course is a must. · · · · ·

-READINGS: The text used for this contemporary pffairs course was .published ·in 1954 which hardly seems contemporary: It 1s _ entirely historical in treating all the post-World War II con­

COMMENTS: The history section of the course seemed to be emphasized far too much for someone who is a non-major.

Hulllanistic Studies 
Schlesinger and Schu1er Humanistic Studies 424 Colloquium IV 

CoNTENT: Seminar discussion is-the focal point of the Humanistic Studies Colloquia. Consisting mostly of Hust . senors, the two sections of the coloquia discuss works including Burke's Reflec­tions on the French Revolution, Marx' Communist Manifesto, Newman's Idea of a University, J.S. Mill's The Subjection of Women, Ibsen's The Doll House, Chardin's Phenomenon of Man, McLuhan's Understandin[! Media, Camus' The Plague, Roszak's Making of a Counter Culture and Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth, in their historical, and cultural context. 
PRESENTATION: Sessions are Jed by Miss Monica Schuler, but Dr. Schlesinger participates -freely, and discussion is usually lively. Guest lecturers are brought in on occasion, adding another view­point to the discussion, but at times squelching any desire on the part of students for discussio11 of the book or topic handled. 
AssIGNMENTS: There is a final exam, usually in the form of two or three essay questions on the books discussed. Class particiapa­tin and results of this test form the basis of the final grade which on the average is B. 
Cor.n.tENTS: As this is a major HuSt course, the orientation of discussion is naturally that presented_ in the Culture courses. Those interested in an "unbiased" or diversely oriented semmar would not be encouraged to take the course. 
Monica Schuler Humanistic Studies 326 Expansion of Europe 
Humanistic Studies· 324 Humanistic· Colloquium 
HUMANISTIC STUDIES . 326 GoNTENT: This course is the first elective to be offerred in the 
· Humanistic Studies Department. It is open to all students but is composed mostly of junior and senior Humanistic Studies Majors. The course covers European expansion throughout the world from the 15th century to the 19th. The major emphases are on the means employed by the different countries in setting uo their empires in foreign lands and a close look at· the institu­tion of slavery in these different empires. 
PRESENTATION: The classes mainly consist of lectures, given by the instructor. Class discussion is minimal although not dis­couraged by-the teacher. Miss Schuler is obviously well· versecl in this subject, particularly on slavery. The lectures while sticking closely to the assigned readings are also supplemented· by Miss Schuler's personal knowledge. · 
READINGS: The readings are generally considered . to be heavy ·and equally split on worth. One of the major drawbacks of the course (in this student's opinion) is that the readings are assigned from textbooks which are kept on reserve in the library. There is e;enerally only one copy of eadi of the·many texts which· are· used. The problems this _would. present for any orie · student ·would depend on the size of the class and that particular student's preference for the iib~ary. In addition·t9 the 20 some texts on. reserve, three paperback'. books were required. 
-----, 

ORGANIZATION: The class~~ :required to write two (8-10-page) book reports. There are iw_o 'testSj a midsemester exam and final. The ·test. essay and _generalizations will bring ·no better than a C. At this point it· is hard to tell how the final grade will be determined. It seems that this course will follow the usual path of Humanistic Studies· courses. That means the grades will not be an objective averaging of the grades received on the papers and tests. The subjective view of _the teacher will probably influence the grade..This should not .scare _the student as it usually works to his or her advantage. 
Co:r.tMENTS; I believ~ 'it to be .the ge~eral fe~ling of the students now taking this "course. that it is' ·not worth the work required. Most of those; who .are · taking the · course now express no desire to take the. sequel to it. next· semester, nor would the majority recommend it to ariyone else.·. In all fairness, it must be remembered that this is the first semester this course has been offered. I am sure Miss Schuler would -have no objection· to working with the students to make it more palatable to them: The main problem seems to be the amount of readings required and most students .,imply ·are neither willing nor have the time to do them all. · 
HUMANISTIC STUDIES. 324 CONTENT: This . course, consisting almost entirely of Juniors, is the complement to Cultural History (which is not, however, a requirement for this course), and attempts to give the student direct exposure to· the culture-of the period under·consideration (approximately 1300-1600). Elements of the culture which are studied include: literature, art, music"and philosophy. 
PRESENTATION: The classes are conducted almost entirely as discussions, and as such, are subject to the problems of any seminar: specifically, a lack of student participation ( and interest) and digressions. into incidentals rather than essentials. A great deal depends ori the attitude and enthusiasum of the class. How­ever; Miss Schuler has·displayed an ability to maintain discussion without' ·dominating ·it, by posing significant problems and ques­tiqns. Both hei: firm grasp of the subject matter·and her genuine interest in the students further enhance the atmosphere of the class. 
READINGS: Readings in ·the class include· selections from the following: Travels"of Maro Polo, Toynbee, Civilization on Trial, Records of the Trial of Joan of Arc, Dante, Inferno, readings on Renaissance art, readings·on Renaissance music, Machiavelli, The Prince, Erasmnus, Praise of Folly; More, Utopia, Michelangelo, Cellini; Autobiography, ·Luther,-Freedom af a Christian. All are available in P.aperback; none of the selections are unreasonable in 
length. · · · · 
ORGANIZATION:··The ·assignments consist of selections from one of· the above books each week. There are no papers and no projects. There is one two-hour ~xam, consisting _of three essays. Class participation and this exam .are the determinants of the final grade. .· 
COMMENTS: The course is probably most beneficial and interest­ing to students majoring in Humanistic Studies who are simul­taneously studying the history of the period under consideration. The_classes can be extremely interesting and productive. However, a great deal depends on the mood of the particular class and their interest in the topic under discussion. Nonetheless, any student sufficiently interested can profit by merely reading the selections which are ·generally highly beneficial in themselves.

Josephine Barallat Spanish 212 Survey of the Generation 1898 & 20th Century 
CONTENT: This ~ourse meets three times a ~eek and is based on the literature of Spain since 1898. Several literary fragments are read, · including. some novels and plays of modem Spain. The aim of the course is to grasp the real life of today's Spain through literature. This course is a semi-continuation of the first semester course , of , N ea-classic Spanish Literature. However, the first semester is not·a prerequisite. The course is required for Spanish majors and offered only in the spring. 
PRESENTATION: Discussion of the texts is the method used in class. Lectures are in Spanish, and the prerequisite. for both majors and non-majors is to have passed intermediate Spanish. 
READINGS:· Miss Barallat utilizes five different texts: Antelegia de la literature Expanla II, by del Rio, Niekola. ·by Unamuno; Zalacain El Aventu.rero. by Pio Baroja, Obras Escogidas by Gracia Lorca, and LaJamilia de Pascal Duarte by Cela. · 
ORGANIZATION: Written tests·include.one take-home. One· paper is required throughout the semester. The basis of the final grade is class participation, papers·and tests. 
CoMl\lENT·s: Miss Barailaf has a good open lecture style. She e~courages persona! opinion. In papers and· in oral work the stress is on originality and sincerity..She has a great enthusiasm for her subject which carries. over to the students. Along with her great interest and knowledge comes fair grading. 
John M. Bomer French 202 , · Modem,French Readings 
CONTENT: The purpose of this course ·is to serve as a transition for majors between-language and literature courses. Prerequisites for the course is,Intermediate French 121-122 or the equivalent. The majority of the students who enroll in this course are sopho­mores :although fres.hmen and juniors may 'also take .it. The course equally emphasizes reading, conversation, composition and translation. .This is a St. Mary's course. , 
' ' ' 

PRESENTATION: Dr. Bomer's course material will primarily be composed , of nineteenth century novels and poetry (Flaubert, La Martine, Vigny) in addition·to the eighteenth century novel Manon Lescaut. ' 
' . 

ORGANIZATION: There will be a niiriimum 'of three short papers in addition to a midterm and a final exam. The exam material covers the. readings and discussion; thus, the exams are·fair_ and not extremely difficult if one has followed the course. · 
COMMENTS: Although this is the first time Dr. Bomer has taught this particular course, past experience with other courses indicates that this will be a profitable educational experience. In addition to teaching experience in upper-divison courses, he has an excellent command of spoken French and a good workng know­ledge of the literature of this period. This course is not required for students studying abroad their sophomore year. . 
Amalia de la Torre Spanish 451 Latin American Poetry 
PRESENTATION: Mrs. de la, Torre fosters a,genuine exchange of ideas ·by promotin{{ and provoking students' • questions, and she is sensitive to the direction in which these questions may lead. His lectures never drag or ramble, but rather she keeps to the points she wishes to emphasize. Whether she is setting a background and !~e of _reference for a new series of readings, or whether she 1s discussing the fine details of an author under examination, her presentation makes it vital to attend class if a sudent wants any grasp of the assigned material. 
ORGANIZATION: Written assignments vary in length and number, but Mrs. de la Torre always gives them careful attention. 
NOVEMBER 30, 1971 COMMENTS: Mr. de la Torre is well-liked by students for good reason, She is an excellent teacher, open to the questions and interests' of her students on one hand and dedicated to her sub­ject material a_nd·her profession on the other. 
·Miss Dworski French 456 Modem French Theater 
CONTENT: Modem French Theatre is an upper division French course which studies the development of drama in the twentieth century through the work of representative authors such as Clau­de!, Genet, and Beckett. There are no specific prerequisites for the course, but facility in French is definitely necessary. The course is. limited to 20 students, usually juniors and seniors, and is offered at SMC. 
PRESENTATION: The presentation of the course takes the form of a discussion with leading questions and background material being presented by Miss Dworski. There is a large amount of material to be discussed, and often the discussions become too undiscip­lined to treat all of it. 
READINGS: The readings themselves follow somewhat of a chrono­logical sequence from 1900 to the present. This year Miss 
'Dwqrski plans to include Ubu. Roi by Jary; L'Annonce Faite a Marie, Claudel; La· Guerre de Troie n'aura pas lieu, Girau­doux, and La Reine M orte, Montherlant. She has also elect­ed to include Beckett, Ionesco, and Genet, but will allow the stu­dents soine choice as to which plays will be covered. 
ORGANIZATION: Assignments are to include a number of small papers, open-book exams, and perhaps one major paper. These are· not usually given strict letter grades, and the final grade is based subjectively on overall course performance. 
COMMENTS: Modem French Theatre is a worthwhile course depending on the amount of time willing to be spent on it. However, Miss Dworski is a demanding professor who does know literature quite well and is able to relate it to the students. Also the amount of time allowed for the course is often not sufficient for the material to be discussed. Even non-majors would enjoy the course, as modern theatre is a topic that is interesting to most. students. If the student already has some knowledge of French theatre, there is much to be derived from this course. Some stud1:nts find Miss Dworski's personality a bit too forceful and her accent too anglicized. 
Raymond Fleming · l\1odem Languages 236 Italian Literature II 
CoN;~NT: This is the seco~d half of a two semester survey of Italian Literature. The first semester conc.::ntrated on the Inferno by Dante '(and rightly so) with a study of earlier poets as an introduction into the movement of literary style from the scuola siciliana to the dolce stil nouo. The first semester .ends with an introduction into Petrarch. The second semester begins with Pe­trarch and covers a variety of authors: Boccaccio (Decameron), Machiavelli (11 Principe), Goldoni, Leopardi, Tasso, Foscolo, and whomever else time allows. The student should have a working knowledge of the Italian language. Because of Llie language problem and because of the survey nature of the course, the study of the literature is not an exhaustive one. The readings are not long, primarily due to the difficulty of translation. The class is comprised of students majoring in modem language, those majoring in literature, and those who wish to fulfill a language requirement. They are sophomore~ juniors, and seniors. 
PRESENTATION: Mr. Fleming gives excellent introductory lectures into the material. These lectures deal with a variety of topics from the literary, social, and, of course, political condition of the periods to personal critical comments on the material. Class discussions take over on the specific works themselves. The dis­cussions remain pretty much on the surface with Mr. Fleming very often attempting to lead the students into deeper thought by his timely interjection of comments and factual information. 
READINGS: The readings are in Italian and are taken from a four volume anthology of Italian literature: Scritori d'ltalia, edited by N. Sapegno, G. Trombatore, and W. Binni. Handouts and some reauired readings in criticism are not uncommon. Mr. Fleming chooses these readings with care toward the quality of the criticism. The cost is about $15-$20. 
ORGANIZATION: There is a midterm or class presentation and a final exam. There is also one critic.al paper (7-12 pages). The final exam may be a take home but this will depend on the situa­tion at the end of the semester. Most of the grade for the seme­ster '(over _50%) will be based on the students contribution to the class. The grades have been high in the past but this should in no way suggest that this is a "jock" course. 

COMMENTS: The course gives a good view of the literary deve­lopment of Italian literature and allows the student to develop a greater proficiency in the language. Mr. Fleming's approach also strengthens th«; students' critical ( as opposed to a discursive) study of literature. If those entering this course were already proficient in the language, the cJass would be improved a great deal. Nevertheless, this course is recommended for any student with a knowledge of the language and an interest in the litera­ture. 
Frau Freida Grosser German 236 German Literature II 
CONTENT: German Literature II begins where German Literature I of first Semester ends, that is, the end of the 18th Century to the present. It is a general survey course which includes Goethe and extends to the German authors of Romanticism, the En­lightenment, Realism, Naturalism, WWI and WWII. A knowi­edge of the German language is a prerequisite for the course, and language majors, especially German majors are strongly urged to sign up with Frau Grosser. This course is offered at SMC. 
PRESENTATION: Frau Grosser's lectures are in German, but she gives special consideration to those who have not studied abroad, speaking slowly with precise and accurate German. She separates those students who have not studied abroad from those who have, meeting the two groups occasionally at different times, and mak­ing special assignments for majors. She adjusts the assignments to the students' capabilities. Frau Grosser relates her lectures to the reading material but does not hesitate to bring in other ideas from her tremendous knowledge of German literature. She welcomes student discussion and places much emphasis on sharing ideas of the mind, especially critjcal analysis. 
READINGS: Two major texts will be used; Age of Goethe by Stuart Atkins, and German Literature Since Goethe by Feise and Steinhaur. The students, however, will not read everything· in­cluded in the two books. 
ORGANIZATION: Assignments are not difficult and .usually con­sist of short papers relating to the reading material. Frau Grosser considers a certain amount of written work essential for majors for practice in writing German. Grades are based on reading and understanding the assignments, class participation, written assignments and one final exam. The final exam is either a take-home or in-class essay, depending on the student's choice. The final also consists of a. short factual exam in which no choice is given the students. 
COMMENTS: This is Frau Grosser's last semester teaching before she retires. Her classes are stimulating partly because she herself finds German literature rich in its relationship to real life ex­perience, and partly because she, as a person, is full of an earthly wisdom and perspective. She is not only open to new ideas, but 
she welcomes them. She has written critical essays about Goethe, etc.,-in German· literary reviews. Frau Grosser passer her own perspective and love of German literature over to the students. For example, she has commented to her students why an older person loves and understands Geothe's Faust II with a deeper appreciation than the younger student. It is part of the life­understanding that comes with time and growth. She feels the beauty of sorrow and joy. Frau Grosser takes interest in her stu­dents as persons, wondering why some students rarely contribute, leaving her own course open to criticism and change. Anyone with a knowledge of German, be it fluent or otherwise, should take this course, not only because the teacher is personable and excellent, but because students will not have the opportunity al;clin to participate in this significant educational experience. That is, to learn of life and literature from a warm-hearted, in­tellectual professor who is completing one part of her career at . SMC. _ -' . 
John N. Hritzu 
Latin 334 
Lyrics and Elegiac Poetry 
CONTENT: This course is being offered for the first time in two years. It deals with elegiac and occasional verse, that_ is, little poems written on certain _occasions which express a personal emo­tion. Hritzu will begin the course by discussing the Greek deve­lopment of the elegy using as examples, Alcaeus and Sappho, the basis for the Roman elegy. The students will see how the Romans took over a meter from the Greeks which was almost not suitable to them because it wasn't lyric. The Roman writers, Catullus, Tabullus, Propertius and Ovid will be covered in·class. Hritzu will compare the developments of lyrics and elegiac poetry to those lyrics and elegies written after the ancient Roman culture up to the English and American elegies such as Gray's. 
ORGANIZATION: Assi!{llments will be based on Hritzu's own choice of material available. After understanding and learning the development of the meters used in elegiac poetry, the student eventually is expected to write an ·original stanza using the differ­ent meters learI)ed in class. l'hus, a good foundation in Latin is required, especially since the play on words or figurative meaning of the emotional outbursts in the poetry are often personal des­criptions difficult to understand. Some understanding of Latin literature is advisable. Hritzu will take time for the proper back~ound of the material before he plunges ahead. The exact number of texts for the course is not available at this time. 
COMMENTS: Mr. Hritzu has excellent command of his field, and this is inevitably revealed in the many explanations of gram­mar points and literature which he gives whenever the subject matter allows it. He is patient and very available to those who want and need to see him, although he has no specific office hours. For the most part, the classes comprise translations which are assigned for homework and are reviewed in class. The tests are fair but long, entailing a passage to translate and two essay questions to answer. Often questions arise in class which the students may or may not feel free to answer. Mr.-Hritzu makes the Latin alive by complementing modern phrases or notions, eauivalent to the Latin studied. The course material itself is not overly rigorous, although a good command of Latin grammar and vocabulary is necessary. Mr. Hritzu does expect outside readings used in the comparison of works and to ,enhance com­p!'ehension of a particular author. What one gains from Hritzu's course depends on how much effort one wants to put into it, and what one expects in return. Mr. Hritzu is fair, and naturally expects more from the student with a better background in Latin. Whether or not you take a course with. Mr. Hritzu, you should drop by his office for a pleasant chat. He says that the Greek word for 'scholar' means leisure, in that a student must take his time to learn. He believes that college students and faculty often rush back and.forth to classes in various buildings never having the time to communicate with each other, to discuss thoughts of a class at leisure.. Any student would welcome his personableness _and interest for other's feelings. 
.T. William Hunt Modern Languages 452 . Nature of Tragedy: Aeschylus to Ibsen 
Latin 400 Latin Literature in Translation 
MODERN LANGUAGES 452 CONTENT: An intensive analysis of the varied development of the tragic genre, aimed at an inclusive definition of its nature and significance. Through close study of works drawn from four leading periods, the puroose will be to formulate a comprehensive comparative view. Authors treated will be Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Shakespeare, Racine, Ibsen, and Faulkner. The per­iods considered will be Greek classicism, Elizabethan renaissance, French neoclassicism, and modern; the course should develop beyond composition in one period a capacity to deal with the genre through its development. 
READINGS: Oresteia, Antil(one, Medea and Hyppolytus, Othello and Romeo and Juliet, Phedre, Rosmersholm and Bygmester Sol­ness, _and Absalom, .Absalom.

LATIN 400 
CONTENT: ·A semester course designed to acquaint literature majors with latin classical works at the source of the tradition _ they study, and thus background understanding of original sources. Authors treated will be Catullus, Lucretius, Cicero, Virgil, Taci­tus, Juvenal, and Ovid. Basic problems will be considered re­lated to epic and lyric poetry, philosophical essay, historical an~lysis, satire and mythology. The aim is an appreciation of the historical origins of some major literary forms and a familiarity with the sources of many later ideas and patterns, characteristics and ·symbols, themes and allusions. 
READINGS: Lyrics of Catullus, De Rerum Natura, De Amicia and De Senectute, Aenid, Annuals of Imperial Rome, Satires of Juvenal, Metamorphoses. 
PRESENTATION: Class discussion and occasional lecture. 
ORGANIZATION: There will be one final:and two papers, one short and one long. Some reading knowledge of another language is helpful but not required. 
COMMENT: Since this will be the first time these courses are taught at Notre Dame, it is impossible to ·give an evaluation of the course proper. However, Mr. Hunt began teaching this fall, thus an evaluation of his teaching style can be made. Mr. Hunt brings to Notre Dame a healthy intellectual aura as well as th'! additional presence of a man whose major field is comparative literature. He is anxious t.:> enter into the life of the N.D. com­munity and he is always interested in student thoughts. In his courses, he places major emphasis on reading of the individual texts, yet this study necessitates that the reader formulate com­parison~ and ideas which make the collected reading intelligible. In helpmg the student to attain a good comparative sense of the literature, Hunt is a ~fted teacher. He comes to class well­prepared with notes and ideas to stimulate discussion. He pro­vides texts and dittos that give the student secondary language, philosophical, and historical information on the authors. His chief talent, however, lies in class discussion. Provoked by a student question or seized "by the Muse" of his own thought, Mr. Hunt will launch into an elightening explication de texte alluding to music, art, literature of other languages, or contem­porarY: ev~nts. His scope i? th<: humanities is especially wide. ~he. hyeher the student d1scuss1on ·and questioning the more hkely 1s Mr. Hunt to expound his knowledge. To make Mr. Hunt's courses full educational experiences the student is advised t? read the works closely, to come to class prepared for discus­
sion, but, most of all, listen to Mr. Hunt when Calliope has in­spired him. 
Randolph Klawiter German 485 Erasmus, Luther and Humanism 
COMMENTS: Professor Klawiter's courses are mostly centered on a discussion and reflection between the students and the professor. Although his ~tudents are concerned with the numerous books, every student 1s very enthused about the course. It is important for the student to feel that he can contribute to the course altho1;1gh h_e isn't as learned in the field as the professor. Professo; Klawiter 1s an excellent teacher, because of his tremendous knowledge of European philosophy and because of his respect for the students' opinions. Any course with him is worthwhile since the student comes in grip with his own concepts in relation to others. He is a personable professor, one whose office hours are at the_ Pay_ Caf from 4-5, Mon. through Fri. You can sit and tal~ with ~1m over a cup of coffee, and more than that, you will gain from 1t. Professor Klawiter has a special interest in Erasmus and _he_ is writing _a book about him. His bibliography on Stefan Z~e1g-_is a~ready m the Notre Dame Library. He is a professor with h1stoncal perspective, one who can relate ideas of different eras to any topic of discussion, one who will leave his work aside to converse with a student. 
Walter Langford Spanish 482 Latin American Civilization and Culture 
CoNTE}'JT: This course is being revived after a few years' absence and will be offered this spring in a revised form. It will cover 
NOVEMBER 30, 1971 Latin America. Since the class will be conducted in Spanish, students wishing to take the course should have had two semesters of elementary college Spanish with an additional semester of practical readings or the like, or nyo semesters of intermediate Spanish. 
PRESENTATION: Students taking this course should find Professor Langford's lectures well-prepared, well~delivered, and interesting. The class will probably be small ( 15-25 students), which will allow for discussions once the students have done some reading on their own. The quality of the discussions will depend on the students' willingness to read. Professor Langford is always willing to field questions on lecture material or readings. 
READINGS : There are few good texts available dealing with such a broad topic, so there probably will not be an established text. Students will be expected to read on their own, with the professor helping them to find suitable material available in the library or bookstore. 
ORGANIZATION: There will be one or two quizzes and a final exam. Those who attend class regularly and do a reasonable amount of reading should not find the tests too difficult. In ad-· dition, each student is e.xpected to give one or two short reports in class, and must write a term paper {approximately 10 pages) dealing with any topic which he finds interesting and is related to the course. Grades will be based on the tests, reports, and the final paper, as well as on class participation. Those who show interest in the course and are willing to do a reasonable amount of work will probably receives A's and B's. Those who don't work can't expect to receive good grades. 
COMMENTS: Most Americans are very ignorant of what is going on in Latin America today. This course will provide its students with a good start in trying to understand Latin America and its p~ople. Professor Langford possesses a broad knowledge of the history, culture, and political and economic situation of the Latin American countries. He has spent time with the Peace Corps in Chile and directed Notre Dame's foreign studies programs in Cali, Colombia and Mexico City. Students seeking a personal and friendly classroom atmosphere will find it here, as Professor takes an interest in each student. Both the course and the teacher should be most enjoyable. 
Klaus Lanzinger German 459 American-European Literary Relations: Seminar in Comparative Literature 
German 469 Cqnternporary German Prose 
CONTENT: The aim of this course will be a study of the 20th century German novel. This ·will be accomplished by reading the works of four, possibly five novelists. This course is open to all majors, but is meant to attract juniors, seniors, and grad stu­dents. There is no limit to class size. 
PRESENTATION: Professor Lanzinger will conduct the class in German; the student should be able to understand speak and write German. The lectures will relate to the book ~t hand and releva~t literary topics of its time. There will also be periods devoted to seminar-type discussion of the works. Professor Lanz­inger lectures and discusses in a colloquial, easily understood style, and willingly anwers questions. 
READINGS: The readings will consist of Thomas :Mann's Zauber­ber!f, Robert J\.fusil's Der Mann Ohne Ei!fenschaften, Franz Kafka's Das Schloss, and Gunter Grass' Die Blechtrommel. All will be paperbacks. These are all in German, and in the case of Mann especially, the style isn't leicht. They will however be read in snatches of about 50-70 pages per week, or about four weeks per book. 
ORGANIZATION: There will be three papers, in German, of about 5-7 pages e~ch. Correction of the p~pers will be for ideas; good grammar will be assumed. There will also be a midterm and a final. A good effort in the course will probably bring a B; with a little {not much) luck, an A can be earned. 
COMMENTS: Professor Lanzinger, an Austrian, has an excellent 
knowledge of German literature. In the past, this writer h~ found him a stimulating teacher, wi!ling both to m~e cl.ear his <?Wn beliefs about a work and consider others. He IS easily accessible out of class. He off~s a very worthwhile learning experience, and this writer would take him again. 
MODERN LANGUAGES 459 CONTENT· This seminar will be a cross-Atlantic study of themes similar a~d different in literary works of several countries. Cultural attitudes in the U.S. and Europe will be examined. Topics considered will be from the 19th a_nd 20th centuries. in which the works were written. The course will be open to English, American Studies and Modem Language majors though limited to twenty studen~, juniors and seniors. There !s no prerequisit«;, however, a reading knowledge of French, Italian or German IS strongly recommended. 
PRESENTATION: This course is a seminar. Though Professor Lanzinger will lend direction, heavy student participation will be expected. The discussions will center around the cross-cultural aspects of the works. Whether the course is interesting will depend on the students; Professor Lanzinger will do his part. The class will be conducted in English. 
READINGS: The following paperbacks will be read: Alexis de Tocqueville., Democracy in America, J. F. Cooper, The American­Democrat, Nathaniel Hawthorne, The Marble Faum, H. Melville, Redburn H. Adams, The Education of Henry Adams, H. James, The Eur~peans, E. Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises. There will be a book assigned every two weeks. 
ORGANIZATION: One or two research papers will be required, and there will be a midterm and final. All written work will be in English. The emphasis for the grade will be on the paper(s}. 
Cm,n.rnNTS: Professor Lanzinger's ability to synthesize European and American literature is outstanding. Here is where he is at his best. He is a recognized expert in American· literature, espe­cially Melville. He sums up this course as "trying to find a definition for American literature by contrasting American civili­zation with European civilization." His intellectual capabilities will make the attempt a success. This is the first time this course has been offered, and Professor Lanzinger will bring to it his great enthusiasm and knowledge. · 
Michel !1arcy French 205 Prose Composition 
CONTENT: The major aim of this course will be to acquaint the 'Student with the technique of writing composition. There will be intensive practice in creative and informative writing in order to develop a clear, accurate style and a command of the mechanics of the French language. Advanced grammar lessons will be in­cluded as an important part of the course. The student will find this knowledge of French grammar put to practical applica­tion in his compositions. In addition to the obvious writing practice, the student will also find himself developing writing in his critical ability. Members of the class will exchange con­structive criticism concerning one another's compositions. A fairly good command of the French language is imperative. Most of the students will be juniors and seniors, many of whom have participated in the Angers program. 
PRESENTATION: Lectures will consist of presentations of the technique of writing prose composition and also patterns in_French grammar. A more elaborate explanation of the grammar les­sons in the required text will be furnished in the lectures. Class participation will be required w.hen reviewing assigned grammar exercises. Constructive criticism of the individual composition 

_will be given openly each week. 
READINGS: Required text for the course has not yet been decided. 

ORGANIZATION: One composition per week, the length of which may vary, will be required throughout the semester. Topics for this weekly assignment will generally be suggested by M. Marcy. In addition to the weekly paper, it v.ill be necessary to prepare exercises in grammar. Quizzes both announced and unannounced will be given regularly on the grammar material. Thus, it is im­portant for the student to keep up with his work. The final exam will test the student both on his knowledge of French gram­mar and his skill in writing a prose composition~ Average final grade for the 1970 fall semester was a B. Cm.rMENT: Students who took this course with Marcy in the fall of 1970 found it to be highly worthwhile. The writing ability 
of the members of the class varied. although all remarked improve­ment in their composition work after the se~ester w~s oyer. The improved writing method was seen as a defimti: asset in literature courses requiring papers. Th~ grammar exerci~es generally were good as review and as a basis for strengthenmg knowledge of the French language. Some of the grammar covered was decided to be too elementary. The new text required for the cour~e should hopefully eliminate this criticism. Regular attendanc~ m class is necessary. M. Marcy is a fine instructor, . well qualified and interested in his students. He demands quahty work from each student and spends much time correcting individual prob­lems His enthusiasm for the class is evident. Grammar les­sons ·which have the natural tendency of degenerating into total tedi~, were, on the contrary, lively and interesting. This course is highly recommended (and necessary) for those students who are seriously pursuing a study of French. 
Rejane Moreno French 236 French Literature II --: 
CoNTENT: This cours~.is a continuation of French Literatur~ I and will deal with literature francaise from the 18th to the begm­ning of the 20th century. The aim of this cou~se is t~ acquaint students with the major French writers of these centuries and to give them a sense of the historic continuity of their ideas and ~tyles. A student should have language experience beyond a beginning ,course for French 236. 
PRESENTATION: Mrs.. Moreno will -lecture en francais on the thought and history of the different centuries as v.:ell as _on aspects of a particular author's form and style. She will provide some ditto sheets on French literature in addition to her lectures. However, this semester she will encourage more discussion by students. She prefers the students use French in the discussion and in their class questions. 
READINGS : The text is the same one used for last semester's course, Sommets Literaires francais, $8.95. The selections in this book are not difficult. In fact, the book contains footnotes on each page which translate any difficult phrase in a poem or story. Several complete works representative of the 18th and 19th cen­turies will also be used. 
ORGANIZATION: This semester there will be no exams. Rather, the student must write 4 papers-two· on the 18th century and two· on the 19th. The student will have a choice of topics and whether he wishes to write the papers in French or English. If a student does the required reading and writing, this course will not bring down hi5 grade average. 
COMMENTS: This course is excellent for a student who wants an 
introduction into French Literature, and Mrs. Moreno helps him 
(or her) make this first step. She provides commentary and 
opinion as only a Frenchwoman could-giving students insights 
into the French language and customs. She is friendly, and will­
ing to explain, in English, what a student may miss in her lecture. 
The only criticisms that can be leveled at this course are the 
small amount of literature the student reads and the lack of dis­
cussion in class. However, Mrs. Moreno hopes to solve both these 
problems with more discussion and reading-French literature 
during the 18th-_20th centuries is much more readable than that 
of the moyen age. Part of the responsibility for these problems 
also falls on the students, who either do not have the ability to ex­
press themselves completely in French, or who fear to_ try._ 
Louis Philippe German 242 Prose !tlasterpieces II 
CONTENT: P~e Masterpieces I is not a pre-requisite for Prose Masterpieces. At the present time, the content of this course is undecided. If the students taking Prose Masterpices II have not taken Prose Masterpieces I, the second semester will be taught. like the first semester. The text used will be Kafka, Brecht, Boll. If students from the first semester continue through into the second semester, another book will be used. 
PRESENTATION: Professor Philippe serves more as a guide than as a teacher. A reading knowledge of German is assumed; there is no rehashing of grammar as in Russian courses. The readings will prove challenging to the student with only a beginning German or an intermediate German background, but they are possible. Aside from the readings· there are sometimes translations to be 
~ . THE SCHOLASTIC 

i 
i• 
Co111MENT: The course this semester consisted of 11 students: 1 Innsbruck returnee, three from :Beginning German, and the rest frorµ intermediate. The atmosphere was extremely friendly, and despite the fact that the 60 pages of Kafka became nearly un­bearable at times, all survived. For the student interested in learning German and who is taking other difficult courses, Prose Masterpieces is ideal-with little busy work, the opportunity to work on your own, and a great deal of translation. Grades are assigned primarily on class participation, but·with oniy 11 in the class there is no place to hide your mistakes. 
Charles Parnell French 350 
. Literary Translation 
CONTENT: This is an upper-division major course recommended for French majors, former Angers students and graduate students. It should be taken as an elective only if the student has an excel­lent command of the French language. · A considerable amount of outside preparation will be necessary, but Dr. Parnell's classei. are always demanding in a very non-pressure way. 
READINGS : The name~ of the text is not · available at this time; the major emphasis of the course, however, primarily will be translating from English to French, including both poetry and prose from many periods of literature. Also included in the translations are "surprise" literary works from every imaginable source. 
ORGANIZATION: In addition to the translations done during the semester, there is a comprehensive final exam. 
COM111ENTS : Dr. Parnell gave this course two years ago and more recently this past summer in a Master's program. Judging from the reaction of the students who took this course, the translation course is Dr. Parnell par excellence. It is highly recommended by all the students. It is a delightful and profitable experience for French majors who want a challenging course outside the limitations of the standard French literature offered each seme­ster. 
Thomas Renaldi Spanish 460 Cervantes 
CONTENT: This course will be based on two works by Miguel de Cervantes, one of which is Don Quixote. The course is open to all undergraduates, and it is also open to graduate students as ,vell. It will be a literature course consisting of the student reading certain passages out of Cervantes; then a lecture will be given on the readings and any background material considered relevant by the instructor. All lectures are in Spanish. Therefore the student should consider his ability to understand spoken Spanish before taking. this course. Spanish grammar is not em-done, sometimes questions( to be answered in German) at the end of a selection, and sometimes short papers. These are not a burden. 
phasized, but it does not hurt if one has a good background in that area of the language also. 
PRESENTATION: If one can understand the lectures they are found to be relevant to the material assigned. Any historical, social, or political events influencing the work are introduced. The style of writin~ whether symboli~, ironic or any other are brought out in the lectures. One must be able to understand Spanish with pretty good proficiency or the lectures will be totally worthless. 
READINGS: Don Quixote is quite long and, consequently, the reading assignments will be quite long. 
ORGANIZATION: A term paper written in Spanish will be part of the assigned work. There will be one hour exam and the final. The tests given in previous courses were usually one long essay and short answer objective type questions. If one understands the material the tests are not too difficult. Of course, that is not saying too much. 
COMl\fENTs: Overall, this course would be good for those think­ing of majoring in Spanish. Those looking to get rid of their language requirement really should look for something else. For the language major it is really a good opportunity to increase proficiency in. all phases of Spanish, speaking, reading, listening, and writing. 
Aleksis Rubulis Russian 538 Literature of the Soviet Republic 
CONTENT: Literature of the Soviet Republic is primarily the survey, of Soviet literature, with an emphasis on Caucasian liter­ature. The area of study includes poetry, short stories, and ex­cerpts from the novels of many of the Soviet Republic's early and contemporary writers. It also includes a study of the Cau­casian national epics, among them, Manas, which is the chief epic. 
PRESENTATION: Mr. Rubulis possesses an excellent knowledge of Soviet Literature, and his enthusiasm for it often carries over to his students. Mr. Rubulis alternates class lectures with student readings of the material, and occasionally shows slides which have a bearing on the particular area under study. 
READINGS: Since there is no single textbook available which con­tains an· that Mr. Rubulis wishes to cover in this course, the readings consist entirely of handouts carefully chosen and pre­pared by Mr. Rubulis. The student is allowed to keep these for reference. 
Cm,n.IENTS: This course is offered for both undergx:aduate and graduate students. There are no prerequisites for this course, and gradin~ is determined chiefly by three non-cumulative tests. The aim of Mr. Rubulis is to expose his students through literature to the mentality of a different area of culture. Mr. Rubulis is more than generous ,vith his time, and he is most willing to consult with his students about any facet of the course. This course is highly recommended for all students. 
NOVEMBER 30, 1971 

Music 
Charles A. Biondo Music 230 · Fundamentals 
CONTENT: The course is a very basic music theory class. · It begins with the study of scales and chord structure and proceeds through the basics of music analysis and arranging. This is by no means a ~ajor course, but it does involve_ considerable work in the techniques of music. Dr. Biondo presents the class with a great deal of material that is of great interest to the casual stu­dent of music. It is up to the individual student as to how much he wishes to get out of the course. Sufficent theory is taught to enable the student to analyze all types of music and construct simple arrangements. The emphasis is on popular music and it is -very helpful to aspiring musicians. 
ORGANIZATION: The lectures serve as the basis of the course, -as there is no text. Dr. Biondo supplements the lectures -with hand­outs that are closely tied to them. Each class is a workshop, and ­every topic is well illustrated by Dr. Biondo on the piano or the . blackboard. There are three tests during the semester, each is announced well in advance -and the material is always reviewed beforehand. An assignment is given each day and they are used to determine how well the student understands the material covered. 
CoMMENT: All in all, this is an excellent course for -anyone for anyone interested in the techniques of music. It is an enjoyable course, and a very rewarding one if any effort is made at all. Di. Biondo emphasizes that an understanding of the background of music increases the enjoyment, and one must_ agree with him. 
Carl Hager, C.S.C. 
Music 215 
Meaning of Music 
CONTENT: Father's course introduces the average studenfto the various types of serious music. The major emphasis is on being able to characterize certain pieces of music-and make distinctions between them through listening. The listening done in _class is quite enjoyable and leisurely, a necessity if the ·novice music student is not to become lost in detail. Father's skill in selecting those points of note is evident. There are no prerequisites, and the course is made up of Arts and Letters juniors_and seniors. 
,-. ' ORGANIZATION: Father's lectures are brief and sketchy.' -The music which he chooses to play occupies most of the classes'. _time. He uses quite a few films to present profiles on the_.differ­ent musical periods. These films are usually -correlated. ·with historical periods and -artistic periods so as to. give a general -background to the nature of the musical mood -of ·the time. There is no required text or readings. There are 3 tests and a final. The tests are very challenging and test the_ amount of time one puts into listening to the required selections. The tests are always on minute details. But these details are all covered · in the class notes. Tests are open-book and consist of two parts: multiple-choice listening and multiple-choice writing. Three reports on concerts of a "heavy" nature are required. 
COMMENTS: Father's course can be worthwhile or worthless, depending on the student's attitude. He makes it meaty enough -·to sti~1rnlate the novice. However, for the musically experienced it is a bore. In this sense Father's course serves its purpose.· It can be used as a "jock" course by those who have musical back­grounds. Then it is abused. But its purpose as a general survey course is well served by the fact that Father does present mean­ingful and intellectually stimulating academics for the non­-musically oriented. It is like any other course in the sense that it is what you make it. I think the scope of music is fine. Some claim that if you cover less and treat a few periods in greater detail, the student could sustain interest. His course is not designed to foster a particular interest, but to open all the _doors . -he can without becoming too cursive. I think he has achieved -this balance by remaining within the confines of serious music_ and by using his -own judgment in selecting the more worth­while. There is definitely a place for a course of this nature. -I feel Father's course is not at fault this year. If any one is at fault for not making it a good course, it is the student. In the 
-. _ past, this course has been deemed "jock." Father Hager plans to·eliminate this conception while keeping the course interesting · and enjoyable. 

Michael Q. Hennessey
Music 211 -. . . 
Music Literature 
CONTENT: The ~ouise· is i-survey of Music Literature from the year 1200 to the present. Basically Mr. _Hennessey's. idea is a survey and basic understanding of the style of music. It is to be understood that·this does not· deal with the· folk or popular music, but mostly with the "serious'_' music ofthe Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic. and Contemporary:· periods. The maj~r emphasis is on listening and the question: ."What do you hearr' This is a St. Mary's course. · 
PRESENTATION: On the whole, the format for the course is half lecture and half_ discussion. The tests are based on the texts, the lectures, and the listening of' the various examples. 
READINGs·: ·The required texts 'for-this cotirse are The Enjoyment of Music by Joseph Machlis (the shorter third edition) and This is Music.by David Randolph, which is on the whole.a very enjoy-· able book. The cost of these two books totals about ten dollars._ 
. . . ORGANIZATION: The final-grade is based on a mid-term, a final, a paper, and some quizzes. Most of the final grade is the mid­term, final, and. the paper which are treated, approximately equally. The paper deals with a general music topic. There is no· other outside work. · 
COMMENT: This ~ourse is ~aimed at· the. non-inusic major who must fullfill a -fine arts requirement. -As the title of the text im­plies the aim is for the enjoyment and appreciation of music with an exposure to style. Most of the listening is done in class fol­lowed iriunediatelv with a discussion which forces the student to be a careful, critical listener. . 
Sister -Dolorosa Hipskind Music.21f · · Survey: of l\1usic_ Literature_ 
CoNTENT: The course is -a st:iidy of'the materi~ls of music, styles, and composers of various periods, from medieval to contemporary developments, post-WW II.--Discussion includes each_ period as a whole and the relation of music in each to the. other _arts and historical background. This is a St. Mary's course. · ­
PRESENTATION': Informal lectures corresponding to readings in the text, ·c1ass_ participation in discussions, and supplementary in­class listening comprise the basis of the course presentation. 
READINGS: The readings are taken from Joseph Machlis' The Enjoyment of Music. Two to four chapters per class is the.11sual assignment; and :four hours per week of independent listening normally required. Outside readings are not required but are encouraged. (The text retails around $7.50, but one can usually purchase it from someone -who has previously taken the_ course for less.) 
ORGANIZATION: Assignments other than the readings include two scrapbooks of critiques of 10 concerts attended,· clippings from magazines and newspapers, and a list of listening done in the home. Charts, outlines of symphonies to an extent, and small papers -are assigned. Small tests and quizzes are given between three major semester tests. -
CoMMENT: I enjoyed this course tremendously, perhaps because I am learnine; something I've ?Jways _wanted to learn. -It is of social relevance today and my appreciation of music as an art has increased tenfold. I am not a music major but I' would recom­mend this course to non-majors and make it a reqiurement for music majors. _It has enhanced my enjoym~nt. and listening plea-. sure._

·THE SCHOLASTIC 

1ors and sophomores. This is a St. Mary's course. 
PRESENTATION: Informal, well prepared lectures, supplemented 
by frequent recordings of associated music comprise the presenta­
tion.-The course doesn't really lend itself to discussion, but being 
a small class, questions and comments are always welcome. Dr. _Lawrence's extensive knowledge of music 'history is evidenced in 
his lectures. 
READINGS: One very worthwhile paperback text, handout sheets _and supplementary recommended -readings comprise the basic course material. In addition, he usually requires students to read a book of his choice on the period and present a brief oral 
report. 
ORGANIZATION: Assignments are three or four short papers, the oral report to the teacher, and two essay-type exams, midterm and final. Exams are thorough but not especially difficult, based on readings and lectures. The final grade is based on all the above assignments and exams. The average final grade may be 
B. 
CoMMENT: This course is certainly a significant educational ex­perience as one is able to thoroughly study one period of music history in relation to other artistic, literary, and political events of the period. The music literature course is an assist as a pre­requsite to this course. It is geared toward music majors, but many non-majors take the course and Dr. Lawrence makes allow­ances for the non-majors. He often requires different papers from the majors. Dr. Lawrence has a strong interest in the student. I highly recommend this course and would ·certainly. take another from him. · 
Daniel Pedtke Music 212 Classical -Masters 
CoNTENT:· There-are no prerequisites for this course; 1t 1s open to all students; and it appeals mainly to the student who is fol-filling a fine arts requirement. The major purpose of the course is to present and acquaint the student with symphonic music of the Classical Period (late 18th and early· 19th Century}; em­phasis is placed on the symphonic works of Mozart, Haydn and :Beethoven and some works of :Brahms. 
PRESENTATION: Dean Pedtke begins the course with familiariza­tion of the "language" of musical notation and some simplified forms; most of the class periods, however, are snent listening to the representative works of the Classical Period. Class participa­tion is minimal due to the amount of class time taken for listening to the symphonies; the class stresses development of acute listen­ing skills. 
READINGS: Dean Pedtke does not require outside readings. Out­side work amounts to familiarizing oneself with the themes and forms of the symphonies studied. 
ORGANIZATION: Outside listening is the only homework needed for this course. Tests '(3 per semester plus final) are of the "drop-the-needle" type; identification of a work is required where­ever Dean Pedtke drops the needle on a record. Easy quizzes for ·attendance are given periodically. Grades are based mainly on the final (of the type mentioned above) and on a notebook to be handed in before the final class period; previous to the final all test grades are used only as an indication as to how well the student is grasping the material presented in class. Due to open­notebook tests and the de-emphasis on test grades other than the final, grades generally range from A to B-. 
COMMENT: Could be valuable for the student without a decent background in music; however, for the musically experienced student the course becomes quite boring as the semester pro­gresses. ·Perhaps a wider chronological spectrum in the music presented would make the course more interesting, less monoton­ous.. A comparative approach to the music of the Classical. Ro­mantic and Modern Periods would render this course valuable even Jo the musically orientated. Also, more class lecture time would allow Dean Pedtke to display even more of the knowledge and enthusiasm which he obviously possesses for music of all periods .

Philosophy 
Sheila Brennan Philosophy 3·43 Existentialism 
Philosophy 424 1\1etaphysics 
PHILOSOPHY 343 CONTENTS: While not classifying herself as an existentialist, Dr:. Brennan finds a real worth in studying existential philosophy.. The major theme· that runs through the course is. that of man ma.king himself. There are no prerequisites for the course, and this enables one to come into the course claiming lack of know!-· ed2:e of the subject matter though chances are that one has at least lectured to his friends about, or incorporated into his life, the philosophy of the existentialists. 
READINGS: Desiring to . cover a few existentialists well, Dr. Brennan has limited lier readings to Kiekegaard, Sartre, and Marcel. Selections from these authors are obtained from mex­pensive anthologies. 
ORGANIZATION: This is the same course-that was offered first semester in all respects. One cannot· help but feel. that this professor views the study of philosophy as being a happy thing. With respect to work, there-will oe three or four short papers with one larger paper. This course is not extremely difficult grade-wise, with a B being about the final average grade. Class att!!ndance is . essential for obtaining a real knowledge of· the philosophers discussed. . · 
PHILOSOPHY 424 
CONTENTS: Most of the members of this class will undoubtedly . be majors, but this is not said to scare away n·on-majors. · There are no prerequisites for this course and Dr. Brennan feels that 
• any one with an interest in the subject matter should be able to h~dle the course. The course will. focus primarily on Plato, Anst~tle,_ and. A. N. Whitehead. There will be a. preliminary exammat:Ion of the nature of metaphysics which . will, then be followed by ~ comparative study of these three intellectual giants. The study will try to reyeal the intrinsic harmony among these · three world views. ·This is the first time -metaphys.ics is .being taught by· Dr: Brennan at Notre Dame. · -· . 
. REAi>I;;Gi: Majors~ will: find-deligh{ :i~ this-cour~e ~-;ith r~spect to expense because the sel_ections from· Plato and Aristotle can -be f,:mnd in the collected ·works of ·these authors ·which most majors now possess; The selections from A.·N.

CONTENT: The basic aim of this · course is to explore questions concerning: man and ·soci~ty. Though there are no prerequisites for this course, it is composed mostly of seniors. 
. ' PRESENTATION: The lectures provide an excellent. structure for the course. The readings are worthwhile and supplement the lectures. 
READINGS: There are about twelve books which cost from $20­$25. However, several of these books .are common and if you· don't already O'Yll t.h.em they are probably floating around. your dorm or house. Only one of the readings .is rather lengthy. 
ORQANIZATION: There are no papers. Only two "serious writing engagements" and a final are required. These constitute .the basis for ·the final · grade. · 
CoMMEN.TS: This· .course is· not only recommended for majors, but non-majors as well. -Orie way the course might be improved. would be a smaller__ class~but size does not really present a problem. It is. suggeste~ that a prospective student should speak to sorrieone who has had the course. in order to get a feeling for it.. Any student will profit from contact with Professor Evans.

Philosophy 427 Philosophy of Religion 
PHILOSOPHY 225 B _ CONTENT: The'. general thrust of this course will be to synthesize a body of argumentation supporting the reasonableness of belief (and in this case, the reasonableness of Christian belief). Within this framework, two· positions will · be considered: . classical "proofs"_ and the nature· ofthe belief of the average man. While not diminishing the importance of classical proof$, they will definitely take a back seat in this course, based on Dr. Mcinerny's assuinptiori that men were capable of faith before Anselm. The arguments against the reasonableness of belief, which will also be. considered, again will be relegated to the periphery, for the sake of ·the main thrust of the course. In this area, the linguistic school of Wittgenstein and Austen and the whole issue of modern empiricism will be considered, especially their attitudes toward the notion of meaning behind language, and the use of analogy. 
PRESENTATION: The basic format for this course will be lecture.' The _lectures ·should be highly-charged with logic, insight and factual content, sprinkled liberally with a most refreshing low-key humour. Within the main body of any given lecture, learned asides will be added; illuminating various points· either in the·lec­_ture itself or in the readings. 
READINGS: The basic texts will be: John Henry Cardinal New­man's The Gra:mmar of Assent, St. Thomas Aquinas' Summa Theologiae, Ia. q. 1-13. and Peter Geach's God and the Soul. 
·While _no specific readin1!S from Kierkegaard will be required, he will, as with Newman and Thomas. be one of the main sources for discussion. Optional entertainment (to the tune of $8.00) will be Boyce Gibson: Theism and· Empiricism. The cost for the required readings should be, under $10. 
0RGANIZ~TIO~ :' Bei~g primarily a lecture class, the' grade ~ill be· based on -two_ take:.home exams, a mid-term and a final, as well as a longer book review (10 pages) on a book from a, list other than -of: required readings which Dr. Mclnerny will have pre­pared as -a bibliography.

. Email McMullih, C.S.C. and Gary Gutting Philosophy-434 ,­Philosophy of.Science 
CONTENT: Previously taught by Dr. Gutting alone to graduate philosophy students, this course is being-offered now to under­grads of any major. Consequently, it will be taught differently. The emphasis will be on .the role science plays in the culture, and how it affects the culture and arises from it. To do this they will handle it in two parts: 1.) scientific revolution (Coper­nicus, Galileo, perhaps Darwin)-how science changed people's outlook; 2.) contemporary and genetic problems -physics ( its effect on the general view of nature). and psychology (behavior -control, freedom and artificial intelligence)-these will be con­sidered in regard to their impact on all fields, not merely science. 
PRESENTATION: Although it is Professor Gutting's desire to intro­duce material in other than strict lecture form, class size will determine the frequency of discussion. 
READINGS: Readings will tend to be contemporary, especially in the latter half of the course. Whitehead's Science in the Modern World~ mentioned as a possibility for the course, is such an example. 
ORGANIZATION: Exams and papers will be. merged into two or -three take-homes, composed of three or four interpretive ques­tions. These will require a knowledge of the texts and the class discussions along with the student's independent interpretation. 
COMMENTS: As this is actually a new course, it can't really be 
criticized. However, Dr. Gutting's lectures are generally well­
-received by his students and evaluated accordingly. With Fr. McMullin supplying some historical background and occasiona}ly another viewpoint, it has the potential to be a worthwhile ex­perience, and relevant to today. 
Kenneth Sayre Philosophy 321_ -Formal Reasoning· 
CONTENT: Formal Reasoning is a course intended for philosophy niajors and others serious about doing philosophy. It will be an introduction to formal reasoning attempting to enable the stu­-_dents to ·apply formal reasoning to their own philosophical prob­lems. The course will be conducted in two phases. The :first will concentrate on building a workable understanding of some of the major formal systems of logic: propositional calculus, syl­logism. predicate calculus, theory of relations, and the foundations of mathematics. The second phase of the course will concentrate on applying these tools of reasoning to various problems of -historical and contemporary philosophy. · _ 
-PRESENTATION: The course material will be presented in lectures -augm~nted by regular supplementary readings. Dr. Sayre both · enjoys and takes his philosophy seriously. His lectures are usually 
interesting and thought provoking. ­
READI_N_Gs: The basic test for the course will be Quine's Methods of Logic, a cloth bound·book. · Other reading material. will be made:available in-other'forms. :----. . , .

D. Chris Anderson Psychology 354 Abnormal Psychology 
CONTENT: :Beginning with a definition of abnormal behavior, the course will then examine the historical development of the present medical and behavioral approaches to abnormal psycho}-. ogy. Assessment techniques will be considered as an approach t_o understanding how a patient is classified as abnormal. A defin!­tion and theories of anxiety will precede a dis_cussi~n of the ':an­ons neuroses, including phobias and ps~choso~atic complamts. Character disorders, and severe behavior disorders, · such as chronic depression and hallucinal:ory behavior, will~ also be con­sidered. The final part of the course : will· examme both -the traditional and empirical approaches to the treatment of ab­normal behavior, in light of the models studied earlier. 
PRESENTATION: Dr. Anderson has an insight into the· type of classroom atinosphere that studerits appreciate, along with an excellent knowledge of his discipline, all of whi_ch makes for an enjoyable and educational experience. His lectur~s are extrem_ely well organized. which gives him the freedom to_ digress to a wide variety of personal anecdotes and relevant sidelights. Dr. Ander­son strives to stimulate the student intellectually, and rewardc; questions with knowledgeable answers and sometimes . points. Students who have audited the course in the past have. compared it to a fireside chat about abno~ psychology. · 
READINGS; There will be a_ textbook, Funclamentals of-Behavior Pathology, along with a .paperback consisting of_ case ,stiidies and the approach to treatment. There. is a. poiisibility of class_ hand­

psychology which is sometimes referred .to as a third force between Behaviorism and Psychoanalysis. It is primarily an orientation t~m'.ard the whole of psychology rather than a distinct area or school. The content· of' the course consists of looking at the various theorists who contributed to this movement such as · Heidegger, Binswanger, jung, Maslow and Rodgers. This is· a St. :Mary's course. 
PRESENTATION: The amount .of reading was left ·entirely up to the student. It is a loosely structured course with the lecture and discussion being the general format of the class. 
ORGANIZATION: A midterm e.xamination is given with the alter­native of writing a paper. The final is a take home examination given to the class _a week before it is due. 
Cm,IllfENT: At the beginning of the semester the course seems somewhat disorganized and the objectives are unclear. · Once the direction is taken the course proves to be both worthwhile and . interesting. 
EHen Ryan Psychology·341 Statistical Experiments I 
CoNTENT: This course is required for all psychology majors. The focus of the course is to help the student gain a knowledgeable command of the statistical methods used in evaluating experi­mental data. The course, being concerned with data analysis, often seems more like a math course than a psychology course. However, the student need not have a formidable math back­ground. The student needs only a strong . will and a definite desire to continue in psychology. A student interested in major­ing in psychology should not base his final decision on this 
. course; for it does not offer an appreciation of the whole realm of psychology,. only experimental data analysis. 
PRESENTATION: ·The course consists of two lectures and a lab per. week .. ,Labs are an integral part for they are used to give · explanations, examinations, and examples .of lecture material. Weekly quizzes are also given in lab sessions. 
ORGANIZATION: Three exams are,given during the semester. The exams are not meant to be cumulative; but usually are, due to the mathematical nature of course material. Weekly quizzes are basically :used to aid the students in the assessment of his grasp of the material and do not.weigh heavily on the final grade. 
CoMlllENT: Doctor Ryan is an excellent lecturer, has a fi~ grasp of the material and takes ari interest in her.students; but by. •_nature: of the material this course is for definite psychology ma1ors only. \· 
Thoin~s· Whitman .Psychology· 487 AN 11ental 'Retardation 
9o~TENT:' The phenomena ,of merital ·retardation are presented m a novel· and dynamic approach. · Novel because retardation is defined at the onset of the course so that much broader criteria for'. retardatiori· are' establishea, making envoirnmental etiology at.leas.t. as .important as genetic and physical factors, resulting in an enormous increase •in the numbers of people.who· can be con­sidered !eta~qed ·and . riientally subnormal.--Dynamic because· the retardat10n 1s ·not seen as a· pervasive whole, but is broken down into· component. elements ,which are. considered amenable to· therapeutic:techniques:. Due to .the· volume of material, how­ever; the course las't spring was traditional in that the major eITiphasis was. on childhood and adolescence. As implied previ­
~ . ; -~ ---' ­
ously, the course is not structured to present a series of classifica­tions with their so-called "appropriate" symptoms and diagnoses_ Instead, starting with the broad interpretation of retardation, the attempt is to delineate this new conception by examining such areas as etiologies; symptom patterns (if any exist}; theories; therapies; and special problems, such as family adjustment. This general overview is the primary responsibility of the text, whic~ had stron~ foundations in research data. The lectures were reserved for introduction of new material and extensive student discussion. They were not used to re-hash the text, and they hatl a great deal of flexibility as a result. More outside lectures from retardation specialists from South Bend are planned than were . ·given last semester, due to a large influx of such people in recent months. There is also the possibility of a field trip to Fort Wayne in order to tour what Dr. Whitman said was supposedly one of the most advanced institutions in the country. No research projects are required, but the student has the opportunity to engage in practic work at Northern Indiana Children's Hospital if more extensive experience is desired. The major goal of the course was not to force the student to memorize specific studies, but to present many important general points which the student 
.could consider in light of his prior training in psychology, and discuss during class. Student participation is actively encouraged, so that much of the success of the course rests on the interest and involvement of the class. 
ORGANIZATION: There are no major exams, with the possible exception of a final geared to have the student integrate the material covered throughout the semester. It is not oriented toward specific data. In place of major exams, there will be periodic quizzes on the text and lecture material, which means the student must keep· up with the work. A term paper on a specific area in retardation (e.g.: behavior modification, mon­golism) is also required, and some students who write on topics of special relevence will be asked to give a presentation. This is one course, however, where grades are not made the primary motivation for performance; last spring the students were assumed to be capable of producing at least B level work. There­fore, the students were not forced to prove themselves, and much pressure was relieved. 
READINGS: Last spring's book, The Mentally Retarded Child, was 546 pages long and· gave an adequate survey of the area. This year. the text may be changed. but the final decision has riot yet been made. There were few outside readings, but doing the library work for the term paper certainly provided an ample substitute. The reading load is,· therefol'e, moderate; but must be read. carefully to adequately prepare for the quizzes. 
COMMENTS: It should not be assumed that it will be possible to let the reading slide. Most of the academic rigor of the course comes from having to keep up with the text and lecture material for the quizzes. Also, an adequate paper will require a fairly constant effort throughout the semester. The real significance of the course lies in the fact that it takes retardation out of the backwoods and brings it right into your neighborhood. Further­more, Dr. Whitman does not just leave the student dangling with lots of facts and nothing to do wtih them. He is an ardent 
·and capable spokesman for the basically optimistic approach of the course, and has many ideas on just what should be done for the· retardate or mentally subnormal individual. Without a. doubt, one of the most important points he stresses is how the very word "retardate" can easily bias persons toward a pessimistic view of the afflicted individual. An especially relevent facet of the course is the new perspective it gives on the problems of, and facing, individuals in the socially deprived classes of the nation. This. course is, however, highly restrictive in numbers, and the student· must s_ee Dr. Whitman to· gain entrance. It is not a cours.e for beginning majors or _someone out to pick up an elec­tive. since the course is structured on the assumption that the students .are reasonably well-versed in. psychology and should therefore be able to offer intelligent comments. In fact,· Dr. Whitman is rather selective, and not everyone who asks is ad­mitted._. For the well-versed major, however, the course is both relevant and. eye-opening. . 

Sociology 
Donald Barrett Sociology 4 7 7 Family Sexuality 
CONTENT: -This course is fundamentally designed -to study sexu­ality in the family. -The nature of sexuality itself offers -the funda­mental starting block. From here the course looks at the evolu­tion of se,aiality. Sexuality is seen as --defining male-female relationships. One of the major premises of _the course· is that sexuality has no meanning unless it can be put in some context, and, since the family is the most common arid accessible social group, sexuality is studied in the family context. 
P.RESENTATION: Lectures are well-structured, . _interesting, and very well-prepared. Professor Barrett adds a certain charm to his lectures by incorporating_ personal experiences into the lectures. 
"The classes are unusually informal and provide the student with the opportunity -for discussion.. He uses -quite a few articles, books, and other sociological reports as a sp~ngboard for. his lecture topics. He continually_ encourages the student_ to -form his own opinions and offers any· needed assistance in-familiariz­ing the student with his individual project.' 
-READINGS: There will be rio assigned -text. 
ORGANIZATION: "Approximately twenty books will be reviewed by the students of the course, every student is not required to read each book. There will be a mid-term and a final which are both integral to an individual project which each student will choose early in the semester. The mid-term will be oral and-1?:iven to Professor Barrett in the form of a :progress report. · The final wil! be oral ( usually accompanied by a short paper) and 

_the student -will be asked to make his project presentation in 
approximately one half hour to forty-five minutes. -_ ­

and Dasilva in· the fall. It is, however, not essential to have had the fall course as a prerequisite for "Population Dynamics.'.': This course will be primarily _concerned with the dynamics of population as related to the vital processes ·of fertility; mortality, and migration. The student wiU become familiar with the fac­tors that impinge on the vital processes. He is also familiarized with crude birth and death rates and their relation to the patterns of change and growth-of population. The intent is to aquaint · the student with the variations contrasts and characteristics: of the··changing population. 
PRESENTATION: The team·of Dodge and Dasilva offers a pretty stimulating" group of lecturers. Dodge is the more dynamic of the two, integrating relevant stories within his lectures. Both professors know their material well and are open · to questions. They do not become impatient with students who are · slow fo · comprehend. In fact, they are sure_ that each student has ade­quate comprehension of the -material before going on to new . material. -· 
READINGS: There is one text used in the course, Population 'by Peterson. · There is also a reader by Ford and DeJong, Social Demography. 
ORGANIZATION: The. major part of the students' grade will be contingent upon a project due at the end of the semester. · It is not something that ·can be thrown together as a. result of a couple of night's work. Dodge and Dasilva expect a detailed and comprehensive project dealing with som_e aspects of the population problem. There will be one or two smaller . tests throughout the semester but grading is done primarily on a pro­gress-report basis. That is, the student who shows. continual im-. provement and perception of the material is the B student. 
Donald Horning Sociology 377 The Family 
CONTENT: This course deals with the family from a ·societal per­spective, from the point of view of how it fits iI)-tO the larger social system. The course e.xamines the past history of the {amily­and its development to the -present day. Some projections are also made toward the future. A combination of both an institu-­tional and functional approach. to the family offers the basis by which institutions of courtship, marriage, -and family life are analyzed. The family will also be examined through a cross­cultural perspective and analysis of varying family systems. This is ·a· St. Mary's course. ·

John.Koval Sociology-376 
_~ex ·Roles ·in Society 
CoN~ENT: · As Mr. Koval takes a look at Sex Roles in Society 
. with his junior and senior class, the primary emphasis is upon how society assigns other -sociological roles to individuals as a response to' the se.xual reality. One of the major premises is that a sense of self is transmitted in society through sexuality. The course attempts to comprehensively, examine the effect· that sex­uality·and sex roles have upon the individual, the family, and the. community. as they relate to the entire social system. 
PRESENTATION: Although some students are initially "turned off" by John Koval, don't despair. He does not come off as the most dynamic lecturer you'll run across, and he probably won't be.-But, he is good. He knows his material well and is always 
-willing to accept questions and arguments. He does not tolerate dozing in class. Expect an object, usually a paper ball, to inform the tired student that he is not in bed, but in John Koval's cl!1SS-­
READINGS : There will be no assigned text, as such, for the course. There will be; however, a series of assigned readings (probably reserve readings at the library) through which Mr. Koval will attempt to elucidate his lectures and those of his guest ·speakers. · 
ORGANIZATION: The class will be visited by six:. participating lecturer,;; during · which Mr. Koval will remain in attendance thereby p;1.rticipating with the students.. The lecturers will be 
·both male and female and will be concerned primarily with se.x · roles as they are related to education, economy, literature, religion and the feminist· movement. There will be a brief midterm and a final paper. 
Col\l~!ENTS: It is going to be a unique and interesting class. The students will find it worthwhile. The class will be limited to approximately thirty students.

Thom.as Sasaki Sociology _.362 . Medical Sociology 
CONTENT: Designed as an upper level course, the class consists primarily of juniors and seniors in sociology and premed: The course gets off the ground with. an introduction to the social science approach to medicine. Social epidemiology is treated very satisfactorily before the course moves on to social organiza­tion. The organization portion consists of evaluation and examin-· atior. of the patient-physician relationship, the patient as an individual, the hospital, the nurses, and other practitioners. Social psychology finds its place in the course as cultural and subcultural perspectives are integrated into the area of medicine and health. The course is summed up by investigating the com­munity aspects, medicine in other societies, and the "developing world." 
COMMENT: This course offers an excellent opportunity for the premed student and the sociology student to broaden their perspectives concerning. medicine, health, and the dotor-patient relationship. · 
Julian Samora and Joseph Scott Sociology 441. Minority Lectures 
Co~TENT: Briefly, what this course entails is a comprehensive investigation into the problems of minority group encounters in America and the ways in which they deal with the problem. 
ORGANIZATION: The course is designed as a Seminar class. _·Scott and Samora will introduce the students to nine guest lecturers: three Chicanos, three blacks, and · three Puerto· Ricans. Dis­cussion and questions will follow each ·lecture._ 
CoMMENT: Scott and Samora aie genuinely interested in the minority problem. Their dedication· and concern for the points in questions make the course very stimulating and worthwhile.

COMMENTS : The course material itself is extremely worthwhile in that it offers a new view of society that is relevant both in other classes and in everyday life. Mr. Schnabel displays complete. devotion and interest in sociology, and his concern for students and· their suggestions is praiseworthy. The course is strongly recommended for anyone considering sociology· as a major or simply trying to broaden his education. (N.B., This is one_ .<>f eight setions offered in "Man in Society." Content is basically the same, but·readings and presentations differ.) • 
J oseph_.Scott Sociology 1-i 6 Social and Political Thought of Black Americans 
CONTENT: This course is offered as a two semester sequence, though. second semester involvement does not necessarily require the first semester. The course begins with a sociological analysis 
·of-the history of the Afro-American experience. The student will become acquainted with the strategies that white America has used in an attempt to subjugate and contain black America. Scott will also delve into the black American strategies of self­liberation from the institution and examine the outcomes of such movements· and counter-movements. The second semester places primary emphasis on looking at the major black, socio­logical, political and economic thinkers from slavery until the present. An attempt will be made to analyze the conception of the "Anglo-over-Black" problem. 
PRESENTATION: Mr. Scott is extremely involved_ in his material and shows more than adequate concern and enthusiasm for both his students and the cause itself. Consequently, the course is extremely worthwhile. · 
READINGS:. There are two texts which are integral to the lectures: Before the· Mayflower by Bennett and Black Nationalism in America by Bracey, Maier, and Rudwick. 
Eve Simson Sociology· 353 11:inorities 
CONTENT: Minorities is an Upper division sociology course that centers around discussion of all types of minorities in the US such as ethnic, racial, religious, and other minorities. Emphasis is on majority-minority .relations as well as the implications of those relations. This course is offered at St. Mary's College. 
PRESENTATION: Lecture is limited by the professor as she en­courages class discussion and participation. The professor has each student present a minority group in class after having read and analyzed a book on the chosen minority. 
READINGS:· Students are urged to attend outside lectures and movies on minorities and to write brief comments on their re­actions. Books are read outside class concerning minority groups, and tests include information from these books. Books run about $18. 
ORGANIZATION: Four tests a semester are usually give~. 
Col\Il\lENT: . Emphasis in· this course is ·on the student. ·He or she can make the class. worthwhile. or not depending upon the amount of. work and concern he puts into it. The professor is 
·always willing_to discuss anything with the students and is gen­uinel(interested in their •interesJs.

. ·crirriinology 
CoNi~~;.~::Di. ·Vasoli's -c~urse-.is structured .to cover the three : basic .. areas : of criminology:: 1) Causation or Etiology; 2) Crim­inal iLaw;;: and< 3) ·the area of Penology -and .-corrections ..The course·_covers ,many:_of the· theories ·relating to crime, and recent ·court~cas_es that have affected the area o~ criminology. ·. 
PRESENTATION: Dr. Vac;oli's lectures are never lacking in interest, and hold the attention of the students. Dr. Vasoli freely inter­jects many of his own personal experiences and insights into ,the evokings of the legal and non-legal aspects of_ criminology. One may find, however, that Dr. Vasoli's views are hard if not im­possible to change, by any form of argumentation in class. Tests· draw from readings and. the lectures. 
READINGS: There are four or five required books for the course, mostly paperbacks and articles. 
CoMMENTs: Dr. Vasoli feels that a C is what niost students deserve, and accordingly his tests are extremely hard, although by no means impossible or.unfair. For a truly interesting course, this course is definitely worthwhile. A sociology background is not necessary although helpful and the .non-major can ·fairly compete with the· major.

CONTENT·: . Sociological Theory is a senior seminar open only to sociology majors.. The course will attempt.to give a theoretical perspective on sociological· theory. ·. Initially the seminar will be concerned with defining. theory. The class will th_en be given .a sociological and historical view of. theo11•-revolutions. ·From this point the course moves into a · sociological and theoretical explanation of the everyday knowledge of reality. Professor Wei­gert gives examples: of large scale sociological theorizing.

Charles .Ballinger Speech and Drama 3 7 6 Acting.II· 
CONTENT: In the course, the student studies and performs from the different acting periods of history. Starting with the Greek age on upward till modern-day drama, the student has a chance to explore the different forms of drama. 
PRESENTATION: Lectures and demonstrations are given through­out the semester on the different acting methods; No great deal of outside reading is required, only one text is used. A large amount of time is spent working individually with Mr. Ballinger. Much attention is spent on the student and his potential acting talent. 
· ORGAJ\TIZATION: Classroom 'performances' and individual growth over the semester comprises-the bulk of the final grade. No written tests, but many discussions. among the students and the instructor occur. . 
COMMENTS: This is an excellent ·class for .the· student .who is earnest in developing his potential:and' skills in acting a~d who will work diligently. It is definitely not an easy· course, not one to be. taken for. an easy A. , The atmosphere of the' class ,is very free.

.and there are no papers. If the studen( puts. in his nil}.ety· hours . he will get a good grade. · · READINGS: There is a text for the course, and the student is expected to read .it on his own. He will not be tested on the material, but it is necessary to know in ·order to really work in the theatre. 

CoMMENTS: It is up to the . individual to learn-he has ·the opportunity; without concentration, however, he· will end up having spent ninety hours merely sawing logs. instead ·of really learning the craft. The course is recommended for those inter­ested in worki_ng hard to )earn the craft and theatre.

Theology 
Maurice Amen, ·c.S.C. Theology 131 · Man and Faith 
Theology 105 . D~velopment of_ Belief 
PRESENTATION: Father Maurice Amen for two lectures a week and one meeting ·each week in a small group with a graduate student as the discussion leader. 
READINGS: Bhagavad-Gita, Siddhartha, The Painted Bird, 
·Night, Steps, Narcissus and Goldmund, If War Goes On, No Bars to Manhood, Stories of God, Beyond Theology, The Cour­age to Be, Love, Power, an~ Justice. 
CONTENT AND Co111MENTS: Father Amen's theology course strives to establish a personal bond between the student and professor and to give the student something which will be im­portant in his life. The course is structured around a nucleus of twelve modern works by such different authors as Kosinski, Watts, and Tillich. Each of the works deals with different ideas · and situations, and even after the end of the course, it remains difficult to see how they are related to each other and to de­velopment of belief. Yet, taken together, the different works make the student aware of who he is and of the faith, or lack of it, which man exhibits in God and especially in his fellow man. The course and readings are planned in such a way that the student must open himself up to the books and self-analysis. Every other week the student is required to turn in a journal of reflections in which he relates his thoughts and feelings about the previous readings. The purpose of the journal is to get the student to think about the things he has read and their meaning to hini. Each journal receives a grade according to how well the student has opened himself to the works and can relate his own feelings on them. 
Furthermore, Father Amen's lectures, although spontaneous and often' hard to follow, serve to guide the student through the maze of new ideas which come about through the readings, a.nd once a week. the students meet in small groups to discuss the readings. There is no midterm or final in the course and the grades usually range from A-to B-. Father Amen's course frees the student to do and think what he wants and asks only that the student open himself to the works. The rewards of the course ·are proportional to the amount of energy the student ,vishes to expend. . 
Robert Antonelli,· C.S.C .. · Theology -245 Prophetic Scripture· 
C~NTENT: This one-semester course deals with the ·religious crisis of the Israelite people from David to Post-Exilic times ( ca. 1000-500 BC). During this •period the Israelites were faced with . the· difficulties of the transition from a nomadic to a· sedentary style of life. ·This provoked the need for a new understanding of th_eir God. . An· attempt to provide this understanding was made by the Hebrew Prophets. Father Antonelli has t_aught an intro­ductory course to the Old Testament (Theology 301). This 
·course. represents. a more detailed. analysis of one segment-of _that c~ursc.. There are no requirements. The course is open to anyone.. 
PRESENTATI~N: The lectures a~d .discussions center on. the ~ead­ings, and. they are,usually-aimed at, presenting background ma-_ terial as well is aiding students ,in gaining· insight into the ma­terial. .The balance -of lecture and discussion will depend upon the class 'size. · · · ·

an opportunity to integrate his personal research and insight into the prophets with his present experience. Depending on class size papers may be followed by a short meeting with Fr. Antonelli 
· to discuss 'the student's ideas. 
Co111MENT: Father Antonelli is new to the campus this year, coming here after a year of post-doctoral study in Archaeology at the Ecole Biblique in Jerusalem. Tales of experiences at digs in the Holy Land make the places in the readings. more con­crete and immediate. The Prophets speak for themselves as Fr. Antonelli winds the visions of Ezechiel into their historical context of Babylonian imagery and Israelite religious history. The wider cultural and religious exchanges among the Mictdle Eastern peoples are traced in their historical context. Any signi­ficance the prophets may have for our world is better understood against this background which is ably represented by Fr. Anto­nelli. 
Leonard Biallas, C.S.C. Theology 243 Church in Crisis 
Theology 240 Theology of Revolution 
THEOLOGY 242 CONTENT: This course attempts to broaden one's perspective on the dignity, responsibility, and freedom of man by analysis and· discussion of various 19th and 20th-century religious-philo­sophers and theologians. It must be considered in light of Christian existentialism and Christian humanism.. The course attempts· by a "theopoetic" odyssey to reflect critically on the unavoidable implications of all the advances in ·western cul­ture. The course may be described in various ways: a funda­mental course in Christology; a theology of secularization; the humanity of God and the divinity of man; or the aftermath of the Death-of-God phenomenon. It is person-oriented rather than content-oriented (i.e. the instructor is more interested in personal involvement on the part of the students than m "covering all the material"). 
PRESENTATION: Father Biallas env1S1ons himself as quite a re­volutionary theologian, which he well may be. However, as a result, Father Biallas often strays from academic pursuits and finds himself caught up in his own impressive revolutionary life. 
· · This can turn the lectures into a soap box performance by the instructor. · This is an attempt to involve the students that usually does not come off that well. "When he does lecture, Father Biallas displays a deep interest and knowledge in the very worthwhile subject matter. Discussion is encouraged, but questions in class often turn into entire period discussions be­tween the instructor and one student. This tends to make the class slip into sleepy apathy. The ass-!gnments (papers, tests, etc.) can be very relevant to the course, but the student must make them so. There are no set rules to follow. · 
READINGS: The texts to be used next semester are: Nietzsche, Thus Spake Zarathustra (Penguin 1.95), Kazantzakis, The Last Temptation of Christ (Bantam 1.25), Berdaev, Dream and Real­ity (Collier 1.50), Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents (Nor­ton C._ Norton 1.95), Kierkegard, Fear and Tremblin~ (Princeton Univ. Press 1.95), Dostoevsky, Grand Inquisitor on the Nature of Man (Lib Bobbs 0.65), Bonhoeffer, Letters and Papers from Prison (Macmillian 1.45), Camus, Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays. (1.65, and possibly Niebuhr, Moral Man and Immoral Society (Scribner 2.45). This is an impressive and heavy !ist, to say the least.. The fall semester's reading was a lot less, and not ,difficult to read or to get done. This list may be more difficult on both counts. · 
ORGANIZATION: There will probably be two ten page papers and a final exam. There also may be an in-class exam sometime dur­ing the semester. The papers and tests are graded fairly and leniently. The average student will probably·receive a "B" in this: course· with · a moderate amount of effort.

Theology No. 6; Berger and Neuhaus, Movement and Revolu-· tion. 
COMMENTS: For the student who has never been exposed to the ideals behind Christian revolution, this course will serve as an eye-opener. It is recommended for those students who would like to experience a priest of the new, left. The course is de­finitely suitable for non-majors since very little classic theology is involved. The course could probably be improved by more organized presentation and discussion of the excellent material by both instructor and student. 
Joseph Blenkinsopp Theology 415 Israelite and Ancient Near Eastern Wisdom 

CONTENT: The lectures and discussions will concentrate (and Dr. Blenkinsopp DOES mean concentrate) on the concept of wisdom; the typology and history oCliterary forms and genres; the identity of the wisdom teachers; and the problems dealing with all of these. There will be a survey of the Wisdom liter­ature in the ancient· Near East, especially Mesopotamia and Egypt; a survey of Hebrew literature; some modern problems, 
. e.g. wisdom and law, wisdom and prophecy, wisdom and priestly lore. It will also concentrate on the Yahwist writer and Ancient Near Eastern myth and wisdom writings, especially the epic of Gilgamesh-the problem of life; Ecclesiastes-the problem of death; Job and the problem of suffering; and The Song of Songs-the problem of sexuality. The course will probably con­sist of juniors and seniors in Theology. Perhaps some graduate students. 
PRESENTATION: Dr. Blenkinsopp lectures most of the time and often "invites" students to comment or join in discussion. If.the class is small, there is more discussion. His lectures are packed with information. He is a good listener to good questions and probably can answer any of them. He is well prepared and hands out organizational and informational sheets regularly which prove extremely helpful. Often Dr. Blenkinsopp brings in related modem literature. The course is a well organized one which is absolutely necessary for all the information given out. 
READINGS: Dr. Blenkinsopp requires five books · to be read and recommends seven others. During the lectures he recommends many more. The readings are good and necessary if you want to understand him and to follow the material as the semester proceeds. 
ORGANIZATION: Dr. Blenkinsopp has negotiable forms of evalu-. ation:-reseach paper. short papers and oral presentation. One can pick from the wide area of readings to do· his work but the work and quality demanded is high. This is not an A course without a serious. scholarly and academic .effort. With a fair. amount of work one can get a B or C. 
COMMENT: Dr. Blenkinsopp is extremely interested in -his work and demands the same from his. students.· If.one . is seriously interested in this course there couldn't be a better prof around but you had better be prepared to work. Dr. Blenkinsopp "in~ . vites"· one to comment and places little stress on the readings or tests. However, he expets the caliber to be · high. He often relaxes into discussions and ·welcomes personal interests. He can provide _the students with almost any help they seek with th<! course material· or. related ·fields. But this is ·not a course ·to be taken to fill a requirement, it is a specialized field with specialized interests and should be taken by those who arc reallyinterested. . 
James T.·Burtchaell, ·c~s~c~ Theology 407 : Theology ·of· Grace · 

CoNTEN;: This course will' clnter .on the theme of grace, the free gift of a loving God to sinful inan, and will discuss tl-ie im­plications of this understanding in terms of theology, liturgy· and · ethics. · . · · ·' . . · : . ­
_, " , ­

PRESENTATION: ·Last year, the structure of the course was based on lecture with-the class broken. down . into "discussion panels" which focused on one of several . historical periods in. which a controversy arose concerning grace ( eg, Luther, Pelagius; the 
•Jansenists, etc.). By and large, these discussion panels were dis­appointing, and so Fr. Burtchaell has·•decided. to take a.different approach. Instead of presenting materials on a period for a class discussion, the groups will be enjoined to investigate the corpus of literature on grace in their period, for the purpose of discussing among themselves as a sort of _seminar, an~ for _on_e or several meetings _with Fr. Burtchaell. With the result~n~. elimi­nation of "influence" in the sense of a' lack of respons1b1hty for a class presentation, the ·degree of benefit derived from these groups will depend in large upon their· own maturity, af well as directions given to them by Fr. Burtchaell, both in meetmgs and in the body of the lectures themselves. 
READINGS : Again, there will be a tighter control of readings than there · was last semester. Five or six books will be required reading, but more· inf<;>rmation is, as yet, unavailable. 
ORGANIZATION: The basic structuring of the work load will be a series of papers, the number of which is as yet unspecified. No length has been set, but Fr. Burtchaell-does consid~z: a ~ve-page paper to be "a table .of contents," thereby ant1c1patmg ten­twelve pages each. There will also be a final exam. 
CoMl\lENTS: The . course. at. its inception, was to have been called "Philemon's ·Problem," but the publication of "Portnoy's Complaint" cut that dream short. Insteaq, the student is brought face-to-face with freely imputed righteousness, for otherwise grace would not be grace. Keeping in mind the obvious inconsistency that iri Theology of Grace your salvation will be by works, this is a unique {and quite -possibly the last) opportunity to share the insights of Fr. Burtchaell's own brand of systematic theology, which is quite good indeed. 
John Dunne, C.S.C. Theology 229 
_Philosophy ?f ,Religion 
CONTENT: Father Dunne_ attempts to deal with the problem of understanding: the understanding of oneself, the understanding of the way of life that one chooses, .and the understanding-of God. He accomplishes this by reference to metaphors, personal allusions. and the lives and works of significant men of history. His illustrations serve to concretize the sometimes rather abstract concepts which he develops. -At times his thought becomes so involved that there is no possibility of asking an intelligent ques­tion to· clear up the ambiguity. All one can do is go home and begin to think it out for himself. 
TEXTS: This past semester there were three texts: A search fOT God in Time ·and Memory, John Dunne; Stories of God, Rilke; and Memories, Dreams, Reflections, C,.G. Jung. He suggests that you r_ead these early in the semester. · 
PRESENTATION: . Father Dunne's presentati~n tends to be_ "by starts and stops. All .the material comes directly from him, mak­ing close attention for the purpose ·of understanding (not for the purpose of passing tests) important. · Sometimes his present­ations· appear too disjointed., This may be attributable both to his own personality, which would. be classified as "intense," and to the fact that· the material being discussed is more personal reflection ·than dogmatic theology. (Some students feel. that Father Dunne is.too dogmatic! The writer disagrees with that viewpoint.· Father Dunne may say things as if they were abso­lutely true· but he doesn't expect the student to accept them that in that way: By analogy, ·scientific researchers submit papers for publication'as if they were absolutely true, but they are the first to be aware of ·their_ own fallibility._. There is a limit to how many· times you can qualify . your thinking without sounding like..you know nothing about .your_ subject.).. · 
ORGANIZATION: .~ There is a· mid-term and a final; both of. the take home variety. There· is 'also a ten page paper.dealing with. a significant historical character. The purpose of the paper is ·to ·allow the_ student to get to know, really know from the•inside, (Dunne alls 'this· "passing·· over") -the man or woman· studied. Biographies are not encouraged, what is demanded is hard; crea­
. ti~e and imaginative thinking. 
COMMENT: At times the course seems like one confused jumble. A student who felt like this last year, found that everything re­solved · itself, fell together, with the last lecture. You cannot, as evidenced above. condense the course into a sentence like, "Theo 229 is about: 1, 2, 3, ... n." When the student finishes, what he has had is a-'«rourse in the understanding of himself, himself and others, and himself and God. Finally, it should be m?ted again that the popularity of Philosophy _of Religion· de­mands that the prospective s_tudent join the ever increasing lines on the third floor of O'Shag ·early if he is serious about taking this course. . · ·· • ·· · •· . ­
THE SCHOLASTIC 

Eugene Gorski, C.S.C. 
Theology 256 
Theology of Man 
Co.NTENT: Father Gorski is teaching this c'ourse for ·the first time. It will be an interdisciplinary (Theology-Anthropology) approach t~ th~ questi?ns "Who Am I"an9-"~hat Is the Meaning of My Life? , It will evolve from a scientific anthropology founded in Humanistic Science and· then a·philosophical anthroplogy draw­ing heavily upon the writings of Heideggar and Jaspers. ' 
CoMl\IENT: Father Gorski is searching for the means to create ~n occasion for students to grow to know and experience both the profane and the Christian meaning of his existence. The course will be concerned with bridging the gap bet,veen theology and life by involving the whole person of the student. 
Kenneth Grabner, C.S.C. Theology 205 Transcendental Experience 
Theology 207 Buddhism and the West 
THEOLOGY 205 
CONTENT: The purpose of the course is to introduce the student 
to the conscious awarenl!ss-oriented religious and philosophical 
systems of the East and the insights into the value of meditation 
for Eastern and Western man. Introductory lectures provide a 
general background in Hinduism, Buddhism, the evolution of 
mythology, Jungian psychology, and a comparison of the basic 
frames of orientation of Western and Eastern religions. Father 
Grabner encour<;1ges students to consider the goals and value of 
meditation, especially as practiced in Yogic systems, and to 
utilize such Eastern concepts as egolessness, the unchanging 
in the universe, and communion with the Other and to in­
corporate them into the transcendental experien~es of one's 
own lifetime. · 
TEXTS: Roszak, The Making of a Counter Cultur.e; Pieper, Leisure, the Basis of Culture; Antoine de Saint Exuperay, The Little Prince; Hesse, Siddhartha; Fisherwood, Bhagavad Gita; I Ching; Yoga Sutras of Patanjali; Teilhard de Chardin, Hymn of the ·Universe. 
PRESENTATION: The course basically consists of lectures on va­rious philosophical and religious systems of conscious awareness expansion, and on the transcendental experience as a state of egolessness and communion. The Western "myth of the ob­jective consciousness" is put into historical perspective in a series of lectures on the development of the ego, individuation and the corresponding myths which evolved during the various phases of mankind's history. The system of ethics of Eastern religions is the subject of another series of lectures, with a comparative description 'of the ethics of Christianity. Father Grabner also imparts .valuable insights into the prerequisites and the presuppositions of meditation, and offers suggestions on how a rational, activity-oriented Christian can best learn how to adapt meditation to his way of life, and how meditation and. silence can enrich and expand the Western man's· con­sciousness awareness of himself and his world. Three seminars are reserved for discussion of texts and of pertinent questions not covered during lectures. A take-home midterm is required in which the student must synthesize the lecture material, as­signed readings and his own -reflections on the subject matter. The option of two short papers on any related .books or. subjects or one longer paper on• the saine order of the take-home mid­term, is offered instead of a final exam. ' 
COMMENTS: Father Grabner presents the wealth of_ insights to be found in Eastern meditative systems to the student in• an enthusiastic yet calm and reflective manner ·so that the student is encouraged to find a method ·or contemplation compatible _with _his own philosophical and religious background. · · · · 
THEOLOGY 207 CONTENT: This course· is envisioned :by Father Grabbner as a start in aiding students to achieve, personally, an understanding of the psychological discoveries uncovered by Buddhism. The success of the class is dependent upon the correlations which in­dividuals are able to make between these ideas and their. own experience. 
NOVEMBER 30, 1971 
READINGS: Next semester's readings have not yet been deter­mined. Readings for this semester included Merton, Zen and the Birds ,of Appetite; Chardin, Divine Milieu; and Hesse, Step­penwolf. 
PRESENTATION: Though the course is largely a· lecture format, discussion and questions from students are welcomed. There are a number of seminar meetings to discuss specific books. The two required papers and class participation compose the stu­dents' grade. 
Stanley Hauerwas Theology 133 Christian Ethics 
CONTENT: This course, though taught before, is being radically revised for the next semester. It is designed to give students an opportunity to "dig around" and discover something about ethical reflection in a disciplined way. The course will examine theoretical ways of operating ethically, ethics as a set of moral rules, ethics as response and action with self, and Christian ethics as a way of seeing, the learning of a language. Concrete issues such as abortion and violence will be studied. The class will, at the beginning of the semester, determine some other areas_ of interest to be studied: e.g., race relations, sex and marnage. 
READINGS: Fletcher, Situation Ethics; Ramsey, Deeds and Rules in Christian Ethics; Neibuhr, The Responsible Self; McCabe, What Is Ethics All About; Douglas, The Non-Violent Cross. The final reading will be contingent upon the topic(s) chosen by the students for perusal. 
ORGANIZATION: There will probably be a number (no more than five) short (2-page) paper and a couple of tests. 
COMMENTS: Professor Hauerwas is an interesting and affable lecturer, willing to spend any amount of time with his students discussing the readings, lectures or anything else. Although there is considerable work involved, this course is ideal for a student who is interested in an instructive course on the basic concepts and formulations of Christian ethical thought. It would be well worth the energy expended. 
Theodore W~ Hengesbach Theology 237 · Theology of Death 
CONTENT: There are very few people who actually try to think out the various meanings of death. Mr. Hen~esbach attempts to provide the stimulus which is needed to get people going on their own personal theology of death. Once people begin to con­front the problem of death, they are in a better position to accept its implications because they have already formulated their own theologies of death. · 
PRESENTATION: The course is divided into two parts. The first consists of lectures given by Mr. Hengesb~ch introducing the student to other people's feeling on death. The second in­cludes seven books which bring out the different feelings, atti­tudes, emotions and • implications of death itself. After the stu­dent works through these readings, he is in an excellent position to move· from a .very ·objective viewpoint of death toward a sub­jective viewpoint of death which is relevant to his own particular feelings on this subject. The texts are discussed in a seminar fashion within the cla:;sroom. 
READINGS: The texts provide the student with many different ways of viewing death. They are very important for the stu­dent in;his attempt to determine the purpose and implications of the course itself. The seven books are: Death anti its Mysteries, Ignace Lepp; A Search for God in Time anti Memory, John S. Dune; The Revolution of Hope, Erich Fromm; In Solitary Wit­Ness, Gordon Zohn; On Death and Dyinf.!, Elizabeth Kubler­Ross; The. Tacit Dimension, Michael Polanyi; and A Rumor of 
·Angels, Peter L. Burger. 
ORGANIZATION: There are three tests which reflect the student's understanding of the -material presented in the first half of the course. . Also, there are , two -book reports required for the first two readings, and a final. Theology of Death which portrays the · student's view of. death after. being exposed to the various ma­terials of. ·the course. Class attendance is required by Mr. Hen­
gesbach because all of the discussion on the lectures and the class is sufficiently small, ·or if large but staffed with a graduate texts are carried on within the classroom. The final grade is assistant then the discussions and a few short papers would make determined by the three tests, the two book reports, the final up the bulk of the w:ork; Fr. Kavanagh,· by his own admission,

·. THE SCHOLASTIC 

prerequisite is a sincere desire to probe the rational and emo­
tion-al bases of belief. ­
PRESENTATION: Since the turnout for previous courses by Mr. Meagher has been large, one can expect a strict lecture· format. However,. Mr. Meagher is open to any and all questions and discussions. · 
READINGS: A .comprehensive list has not been finalized but one can expect readings from Bultman, Jaspers, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche and other prominent-minds. 
ORGANIZATION: As in the past, there will be a take-home mid­term and final (the latter is composed of the student answering · questions of his own asking, under the direction of the teacher). There is an optional paper-to be done if the student expects a very high grade in the course. 
COMMENTS: Mr. Meagher is sensitive, open, and highly intelli­gent. He has utmost concern for the students' understanding and response to the material. He has correspondingly little con-­cern for the "work-a-day-world" matters of grades and the like. Although there has been considerable doubt voiced concerning Mr. Meagher's efficacy as a lecturer (due perhaps to the out­rageous size of his classes-which he hopes to rectify by having a number of smaller, less formal sessions), there can be little doubt concerning the ease with which he handles large amounts of complex material. 
Donald 11cNeil, C.S.C. Theology 230 Theology and Community Service 
CoNTENT: This is an experimental course which was ta~ght by the teaching team. The course will explore the questions about the relationship of theology and community service in the community at large ( tutoring, Logan, etc.). 
PRESENTATION: The class is team-taught by Fathers McNeil, Cormier and Stella. There is a three hour seminar, once a week; there are also workshops several times during the semester, which facilitate sharing and reflections on various experiences. 
READINGS: This semester readings included The ,Greening of America, Transformation of Man, and selected articles (Rahner, etc.) . The readings for next semester will be changed, pending class discussion of their effectiveness. 
ORGANIZATION: There will be written reports during the semes­ter, weekly logs, student evaluations of workshops, -responses ·to readings. The case studies provide an opportunity for integrat­ing the semester in· relationship to theology and other perspec­tives. 
Co:r.tMENTS : The value derived from the course depends to a large extent upon the members of the individual .teams and the team leader. The structure of the class is flexible, ·and the course was enjoyed primarily because of the close associations formed within -the groups. The course comes highly recom­mended. 
Leon Mertensotto, C.S.C. Theology 206 Medical Ethics 
CoNTENT: This . course is primarily a series of discussions on topics of controversy within the field of medicine, covering such subjects as abortion, sterilization, artificial insemination, cosmetic surgery and organ transplantation. It is hoped that the few conclusions reached by the discussions will facilitate the decision­making processes someday to be faced by the class, composed wholly of junior and senior premeds. There are no prerequisites. 
I 
I 
PRESENTATION: At the beginning of the semester, each student is assigned his topic for research. Following the .initial two weeks of Fr. Mertensotto's lectures on basic ethical concepts, the series of student presentations begins; this will· take up the rest of the semester. Each student is expected to encapsulate his research in a paper whose length is determined by the student himself, and to submit it to the class .on the day preceeding · his ·topic's ·discussion. In this way, Fr. Mertensotto says, "The class writes 

NOVEMBER 30, 1971 
their· own text." The discussions are usually fascinating; it's 
almost impossible for the premed to become bored during class. 
-_READINGS: The~e are no assigned readings, although two or three short -papers will be recommended throughout the semester as extra reference ,in a particularly controversial area. In fact, these two or three books, in addition to each student's own paper and his reading of the other students' papers usually con­stitute the work for the semester. There are usually two or three short answer essay tests and these are unannounce~ -the rationale being that the student is spared the time and worry of preparation. The prime indices for standing in the class, however, seem to be participation in class discussion and coher­ence of ideas presented there and in the paper. Naturally, only a small bit of effort makes this an A-B course. 
CoM1'.1ENTS: For the premed, Notre Dame offers no better course. The subject material is both relevant and stimulating, the work load is li!{ht, and the grading i:; liberal. Fr. Mertensotto keeps the class humorous with a very-easy style, and interesting guest lecturers are often added to flavor the course even more. This could certainly prove the most valuable educational experience for a premed's curriculum at Notre Dame. By all means, don't miss this one. 
William O'Brien Theology 226 Problem of God 
CONTENT: Through familiarization with several theological and humanistic works, Mr. O'Brien hopes that the students will gain insight and formulate personal questions concerning the exis­tence or non-existence of God. For the first half of the semes­ter, the students read works and listen to Mr. O'Brien's lectures in order to become familiar with basic questions that have been and should be asked. Then the class is broken into seminar groups during the remainder of the semester, and the remaining works are discussed. There are no prerequisites for the course. 
PRESENTATION: Mr. O'Brien's lectures would hardly qualify as eloquent, but he has the ability to hold one's attention. The student must be open to new and old ideas, and is encouraged to analyse and question his own beliefs. For the seminar, Mr. O'Brien asks about four students to prepare a paper on the sub­ject at hand and to present it to the class as a stimulus to dis­cussion. 
READINGS: Mr. O'Brien is apt to alter this list, but the present class's readings include the following: Langdon Gilkey, Rel~(!ion and the Scientific Future; Albert Camus, The Pla.f!ue; St. Au­gustine, selections from Confessions; Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica; C.G. Jung, Answer to Job; Peter Burger, A Rumor of Angels; Franz Kafka, The Castle; Archibald MacLeish, J.B.; John Dunne, A Search for God in Time and Memory. 
ORGANIZATION: The written work for this course consists of two papers (one for class presentation) and a midterm exam. The final grade is probably based on the written work and on interest displayed in discussions. The written work is more important. 
Cm,Il\lENTS: I would recommend this course to anyone interested in thought-provoking books and human questions. It is not merely a requirement-filler, but is a_ valuable personal and intellectual experience. 
Rev. John Quinn Theology 243 Church in Crisis 
CONTENT·: The conflict between the 17th century-Jesuits and the great French ·thinker, Pascal, provides the springboard for this course, which attempts to show the relevance of recent his­torical controversy and· thought in the areas of ethics, faith and reason, revelation in history, etc., to the challenges and prob­lems confronting the Church and serious Christians today. A satisfying balance is maintained between the exploration of the historical situation and examination of contemporary positions. Last semester, the course was composed primarily of_ sopho­more and junior non-majors. 
PRESENTATION: . Class time is usually -divided between lecture 'and.a-class member's presentation and explanation of an indivi-· dually assigned .reading.· The classes .are not rigidly structured; 
questions and discussion are encouraged,_ and Father_ Quinn's 
informal lecture style lends itself well to this format. . . . . 
. READINGS: The tests include Pascal's Provincial -Lette~s, Rat­zinger's Introduction to Christianity; arid·a selection ·c to be_deter­mined) from the writings of.Newman. ·_These.an~ supplemented · by a number of short~ pertinent mimeographed articles. which provide a look at contemporary positio·ns. (eg., Father Bui-t­chaell's anal~is of:Fletchcr's Situation Ethics: Stanley Hauerwas': _ recent paper·on the "new morality.") . The·readings are w~rth-: while and provocative, and the.volume of ·reading is no_t burden­some. 
ORGANIZATION: There is a short we~kly. quiz on,the.le~tures and readinf! assignment, a paper, (4-5 .pages) on· an assigned: outside reading which some students presentin dass, and a final exam. 
Col\!lllENTS: Father Quinn is. used to teaching .grad .s~de~ts, and the first day of class last· semester shocked, the stud.ents . by inquiring whether they -were all theology majors, and. whether they could read French and German. He proved, however, that he could easily adapt to the undergraduate classroom. . The course deals with some basic problems which should.be of interest· to anyone who purports to · take Christianity. seriously: What is belief and how do we come to believe? How· does ethics_ · work? What characterizes a Christian ethic? · It is particularly interesting to discover how similar are some of our present moral and theological crises to others which.have arisen in the Church in the past 300 years. Father Quinn is.an.orthodox theologian..::.....:. well-informed and sensitive -to the meaning of current thought . and trends. The course .is recommedned to majors ·and non-majors alike. The subject. is, important; the work-load is reasonable and the format -and presentation promise to .be 
.improved even further. -·

· ·War, 'P~ac~: and Revoluti(?Il' 
CONTENT·: Di. Yoder has' not off;red this course for two years, 
· · but_ he .does not foresee much cha_nge i~ the general content. The course. will include debates concerning Christianity and violence, beginning._with ·a consideration. of the "just war" logic. He also plans to discuss significant theories of nonviolence and violence throug~out the course of Church history. 
· PRE.SENTATION: Well-planned, informative lectures constitute the class format, though it has been. commented that the historical nature of these.lectures often becomes dry. Dr. Yoder, however, 
· is -a\Vare of this drawback, and encourages class discussion. The . class will meet once a week, for thre~ hours, and as it is generally a· la_rge class, will include lecture as well as discussion. 
0RgANI~ATION :, Course assignments have tended in the past to . come· primarily at the end of the semester: most of the reading, 
. two short.book reports or_ one more extensive paper, and a final ex~..(essay) concerning "the classic . options" covere_d in the course. The midterm will deal with the factual, historical dis­cussions of hisJory which have been covered. 
_COMl\IENT:· :b~. Yoder is one of the most emminent Mennonite historhns.· He is also a renowned· Ethicist, though this is only .a hobby. His.familiarity-with the elements of the radical reforma­tion·:and all dimensions of the pacifist position make his course a most valuable experience .

LeClair Eells Finance 475 International Finance One-semester course . Offered both in the .spring and)n,the fall 
CONTENT: The course is· concerned with international trade, balance of payments, instruments of foreign exchange,· the prob.:. lem of international liquidity, international investments, new developments, international institutions, and proposals in inter­
. national finance. There is no prerequisite and it is operi to all students, however the class consists mainly of seniors in business administration. · 
PRESENTATION: The lectures are beneficial to those interested in the subject matter, somtimes dry due to the· technical nature of some of the topics. Professor Eells presents the material in an •in~eresting manner by relating class work with current and past· events in the financial world. In areas of current impor­tance, the syllabus will be set aside in favor of a class session upon a topic· of interest. Discussion is usually limited to questions which are encouraged and answered in length. The scheduled lectures follow· close to the reading, with Professor Eells often supplementing that lacking in the assignments. The only pit-· fall lies in certain aspects of the material itself; Professor Eells has trouble elucidating the somewhat more complex material. 
. . 
'READINGS: The texts prove· invaluable because the lectures fol­low close to the readings. There is one basic textbook plus several books on· reserve in the library. The first half of the semester concentrates upon the text, while the second half con­siders· topics in the reserve books. A reading is given for every dass meeting, however often two meetings are given for particu­
lar. assignments. 
ORGANIZATION: There are ·no papers or written homeworks. The grade is based upon thirteen· unannounced quizzes (drop . lowest three), three tests, and a noncumulative final. The tests repre­sent a fairly thorough appraisal of a student's understanding of the material. Attendance is important for three reasons: 1) rigid cut policy, 2) missed quizzes count as zero, 3) tests come largely from class notes. 
COMMENTS:. Fin. 4 7 5 ·is definitely helpful to those students interested in international financial complexities. · Its relevance can be realized by merely looking in any magazine or news­paper.· The knowledge learned in the classroom can' be aptly applied to situations nonacademic in nature. The subject matter changes as do world events, therefore the student must constantly keep abreast of current news.

C_oMMENTS: Principles is recommended for anyone who has any curiosity or desire to learn about the mechanics and techniques of investing. Most students asked said they would definitely take the course again. Improvements could be made. Perhaps allow­ing each or a group of students to build and manage a mock portfolio would increase participation. The practicality of the course as' well as the material make this course a low-pressure elective as well as a rewarding experience. 
Raymond,P. Kent Finance 473 Managem~nt of Financial ·Institutions One-semester course offered both in the fall and spring 
CONTENT: As aptly described in the Bulletin of Information, this course is "A survey of the types of financial institutions; their importance in the economy; their source of funds; types of loans; credit standards and analysis; their investment policies and practices." The prerequisite for this course is Finance 362­Money, Banking, & Monetary Policy, which is also taught by Prof: Kent using his own text. The students in Finance 473 are for the most part senior finance majors who are taking the course as an elective. 
READINGS: With the exception of several outside readings on 
reserve,· there is no assigned reading material. 
PRESENTATION: The course can be broken into two parts of almost equal size. During the first half of the semester, Prof. Kent gives his students a survey of the major management deci­sions of financial institutions in general. Prof. Kent's lectures may at times seem rather dry, but a touch of wit is often inter­jected;· possibly at the thought of a financial institution becoming 
· insolvent. While Prof. Kent is a noted authority on financial institutions, he would find it very difficult to prepare specific. problems of the many institutions for a class lecture; instead he leaves this up to his students which has worked quite. well in practice with his class of approximately 30 students. The stu­dents spend the second half of the semester researching a partic­lar management problem of their choice in one of the 15 or so major classes of financial institutions. 
One has to admire Prof. Kent. for his knowledge of this field and -for ,his interest in his students' ideas, which are freely aired along with the high degree of student participation in this course . 
ORGANIZATION:,_ There are three to four exams spread out over the· course together with a 10-page paper and oral report deal­ing with the management problem researched by the student. · 
. The .exanis are not difficult if. the student takes adequate notes . and is attentive in. class. The ·exams and paper are weighted equally and the average grade is a "B." 
·COMMENTS: To really get the most out of this senior course, a background in .business is needed 'along with an interest in the· material. Finance 473 is-recommended for finance majors, and ·secondly for business students interested in financial institutions.

.· lV(oney, Banking,·,~nd:J\iionetary~ Policy Course offered' ih both' fa]l and spring 
CONTENT:. This course deals 'with .the financial structure and 1!10netary policy· of the, American economy. Emphasis is placed upon .the ·role of "financial ,intermediaries" in our economy, in­·ternational financing, credit theory, and historical backgrounds. 
· Principles of .Economics 223-224 is a prerequisite. The class :·:consists mostly of junior business majors. . , 
PRESENTATION: Professor Kent's lectures coincide with his text, . 
:,. although ·this past semester he has brought' out many new topics which he will· employ in his ,sixth. edition ..He readily welcome_s · those ·questions· the students may have, .many of which are asked 
for .clarification purposes. . . . . . . ., 
READINGS: Professor. Kent us~s his o'\iri text ( presently the fifth. 
edition). His sixth edition should be out sometime next year. The readings aren't too difficult; although each chapter contains a great deal of factual material. · 
ORGANIZATION: ·There are four examinations· throughout the semester, each one covering approximately. five to six chapters. The tests are straightforward,· each .based on material directly out of the text. Professor Kent grades the tests himself and can readily point out missing facts. · · 
· Co111MENTS: It would be hard to estimate Professor Kent's vast knowledge of the financial ,vorld. It's too bad that so. many students take this course to merely get on by, although I'm sure that most finish the course knowing more than· they did before 
· they began. As mentioned, the course deals basically with·factual material -you either know it for the test or you don't.· This is a worthy field of study, especially. the role of creait in the econ-· omy. But, unfortunately, only business students, . particularly finance majors, would find any real interest in this course.

Kraig Adler Biology 404 Vertebrate -Zoology 
Vertebrate Zoology :is-_ a, fundamental course which should be taken by every student who wishes to have· a broad well balanced background in Biology. It, along with ·Entomology and Inverte­-brate Zoology are three basic -courses needed before more ad­vanced work in Zoology should be ,undertaken. Dr.' Adler is emi­nently qualified to speak on the vertebrates, and has all the the personal knowledge needed to make the course both interesting and stimulating. Lectures, although well organized, were some­times too long. This resulted in the use of laboratory time to com­plete given topics. In a few lectures, material which could have been handed· out was merely dictated. This resulted in difficult note taking, and the wasting of valuable time. However, in general, _most lectures were excellent. The laboratory is primarily. _devoted to vertebrate systematics and morphology which is totally relevant to a survey course of this nature. Exams in both lecture and laboratory were hard, but fair; although, at times they were rush'ed. Vertebrate Zoology is a course which can be heartily recommended to any and all biology students. · 
Harvey-Bender Biology 504 Developmental Genetics 
CONTENT: The course will deal with the mechanisms . of gene action and the role of genes iri -the embryology, morphology, physiology and behavior of organisms. 
-PREREQUISITES: Fundamental Genetics (303) or its-equivalent. 
0RGAN;ZATION: The course is li~ited to 10 students due to· the close teacher-student relationship to be developed in the course. The. students will be upperclassmen and first-year graduate students. The lecture part of the -course will consist ,of two lectures and one seminar per _week; There will be one three hour_ lab ( open ended) per week. The labs will be structured for about one-third of the course, after which the _students will be free to pursue lab projects _in areas of their ·particular interests, guided and tutored by Dr. Bender. 
READINGS: There is no required_ text. Selected .readings from 
journals and textbooks will be used instead. · 
ASSIGNMENTS AND TESTS: There will be a midterm and a final 
exam, consisting of ·open-book,· _essay· type questions covering 
· the readings and the lecture m'aterial. The. final grade will be based upon . the student's performance _in the tests, .in . his laborat9ry project, arid upon his presentation and perfo~ance in ·the seminars. · 
COMMENT: Dr. Bender has structured this course as intermediate between undergraduate and graduate courses. The individual · student-will have plenty of freedom· and encouragement to study _ topics of his particular interest, under the close guidance of_ Dr. Bender. The course won't be easy but should be interesting arid worthwhile _to any _student who is since!ely interested in genetics. ·

Robert McIntosh· · Biology ·241 _Gene_ral Ecology 
-CONTENT: . Possibly one-of the· more interesting courses ~ffeied 
_ by _the Biology Department. The course deals with organisms as populations and as· members of ·communities. Special emphasis is placed upori the concept of the ecosystem and the relationship of the oraganism to the environment. 
READINGS·: The principal text is Odum, Fundamentals pf Ecol­ogy. -Throughout the semester several papers from the periodicals a_re placed on reserve and are assigne_d as supplementary readings. 
ORGANIZATION: The course is divided into a series of lectures on the various topics of_ Ecology, with a well-integrated lab. The labora·tory -consists mainly of organized field trips in Indi­ana and Michigan to _different types of indigenous ecosystems. fo general, grading is based upon-two tests and a final. ­
-COMl\lEN;s: I would recommend this course to all interested students. The lectures _are well organized and presented, and because of the laboratory set-up, a good deal of the course is taught out ip. the field. Since Ecology is usually not elected by the preprofessional oriented -students, there is little pressure and the atmosphere is very relaxed. Lately Ecology has become ~ diche e.xpressing a hope to find new ways of more profitably raping the earth with impunity. This course delineates what 
· Ecology as a science really is, and if nothing else impresses the student with the organization _and beauty of nature.. 
_Howard Saz Biology 516 Physiological Biochemistry of Parasites 
CONTENTS: This course is a somewhat unique e.xperience since much of the material which is discussed has come from labs which Dr. Saz has been associated with. Dr. Saz's familiarity with the subjects presented coupled with _a talent for lecturing makes each class period -not only ·educational but also usually enjoyable. ·Students in this course can expect to be e.xposed not only. to principles and conclusions but also to a large amount of data taken from the original literature. 
PRESENTATION: Presentation of a large amount of data during a lecture can be tedious, but it does have its value. One might guess that one of Dr. Saz's goals in this course is to have the students learn to· critically evaluate· data and not just rely on other people's interpretations._ The biochemistry of parasites is 
a. relatively young and rapidly changing . field, therefore, this ­course is not for the student who is looking to study an area ,vhere-all the answers (or-even a majority of them) are known. From the -very beginning of the course fr is obyious that there 
-are fundamental ·differences as well as similarities between the metabolism.of_ m~malian and·parasitic systems. 
.ORGANIZATION: The lab periods are well organized and designed _to be finished within the lab period (a. rare experience in the biology dept.). Rather than just redoing someone else's work, the ,students are many times .asked to apply known biochemical . tools to as .yet unlooked at problems. There is a midsemester 
-and a final examination, but it appears that personal evaluation by· th·e instructor .is an important part of the grade-determining pr_ocess. 
~~IN~s: From necessity, ·reading assignments must come from 
the original literature since there are no textbooks available. 
Ccmr.iENTS: 'This -course should be avaluable eJqJerience not only.:. for· .the. parasitologist . bu~ ·also for the biochemically_ inclined. . -· .-, _ . -_

'CONTENT: This-course-is 'an in'-depth survey-of inost:'of the ·parasites-of man. -Di-. Thorson. covers the morphology and life 
cycle of each organi_sm or group of organisms and the symp­toms, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of each disease. · The lab work is done in conjunction with the lecture course.and in-. eludes microscopic studies of both living and fixed specimens. 
PRESENTATION: Dr. Thorson is one of the world's leading para­sitologists and has been all over the world in pursuit of further . knowledge concerning his .specialty. Most_ of his lecture material is based on personal scholarship with some ,reference to the course text. The individual touch makes his lectures both in­teresting and captivating. · · 
READINGS: Foust, Beaver, and Jung: Animal Agents· and Vee-. tors of Human D'i,sease. · · 
. ORGANIZATION: There will be four or five exams includi~g ·a cumulative final. All of these exams count equally towards the final grade. The nvo lecture tests are based mainly on ·the class notes, but the text is also covered. The one or two laboratory practicals involve finding and identifying parasites· in live fecal samples with the possibility that nothing is present. The ·average grade for the course is a B with a few A's and C's. 
Coll!MENT: As in General Biology, Dr. Thorson has a way of finding what a majority of the students don't know and putting it on the test, but since General Biology is a prerequisite, every­one should be prepared and know how to study. The only dif­ference is that the Parasitology tests· are in• essay ·form. Dr. Thorson's dedication to. his field is· definitely . felt through the enthusiasm he shows in both the lectures and the lab. He is always available during the Jab to help, and there is little if anything that he can't answer concerning this,. field. Parasit­ology is a natural for premed students.· ·

CONTENT: This course. entails a detailed study.o( the major classes of the Vertebrate·sub:.phylum. Special ·emphasis.is placed on the Mammals and the phylogenetic events. they recapitulate in their ontogeny. The laboratory work includes a dissection of , the basic body systems of a cat and a dogfish, shark. 
ORGANIZATION·: There are four lecture·. exams ·c40% of final grade) based ·on material from the text and the notes. The three laboratory practical exams · ( 45 % of final grade) are based entirely on the dissections · performed in Jab. The ·final exam is cumulative (15% of final grade). · The median· grade for the course is B, although it i~ not impossible_ to get an A. 
READINGS: The Vertebrate Body, Romer/ and V irtebrate 'Dis­section, ·Walker. The student..'Yill also ·need ~ dissection· kit. 
Cm.t:r.rENT: Since emphasis is placed on the mammal, the.cours'e provides an excellent background in. anatomy for premedical 
· . students. The lectures have been described as boring, but the material. covered is. essential.': The laboratory work is well. co;:. ordinated· with the lecture material and it makes · the job of rote learning_· of ·anatomical terms ·less · tedious. '. · . ·

Biology· 51'2 Helminthology : : · · 
----_...._ 
-·.,_ CONTENT: Any. person who "attempts.to cover' helminthology in one semester must become , somewhat frustrated, for there is simply too :mtich. material which··_should be covered but . can­not because ·of the·. time element. Nevertheless Dr. Wein­stein does a remarkable· job of presenting· as much material as 
. he can in the short ·time ~vailable: · · : · · · 
PRESENTATION: Dr: Weinstein draws· on his vast knowledge of 
· the area to present lecture's which although fuJl of details em­phasis concepts and·principles.·. During the. course of the. semester a wide· variety of subjects are covered; these include taxonomy, morphology, evolution,-physiology, .immunology, pathology, and epidemiology of nematodes, cestocle_s, and ,trematodes. One should note, however,· that very little . is said about th_e many free­living and plant-parasitic ·nematodes: This bias towards animal parasites is a result of the interests: of th~ instructor as well as the interests of most of the st1:1:dents at Notre_ Dame. 
LAB: . The ·laboratory .. sessions . . are· an · important· and • very enjoyable part of.the ccnirse: Rather than· concentrating on dead, prepared· ·material,' Dr..:Weinstein has-chosen. to . use livin~ specimens most of-the.time:~ It"is a real treat for someone whu 1s interested in-helminths to ·observe -living· specimens· rather than having to be content with j!,}St reading. about them or studying dead organisms. It should'be,mentioned though that lab sessions using:living specimens generally.require'more time-and patience than do lab ·sessions i_ri which pr_~pared: material is used. 
ORGANIZATION: Grading is based ·on~a:rnidterm and·final exam-_ ination· as well as a. lab, notebook· and the very important per­sonal evaluation .by t~e· inst~ctor._ . .

Co111~rnNTS: T~e st~dent in this course must possess a good· chemical and biological background, be able to take copious notes, work problems _and should have some interest in the chemistry of the body. ·.If· these criteria are met, he will truly enjoy Biochemistry .420. 
Francis· Castellino Chemistry 337 Physical Chemistry· 
CONTENT: This course is fo~ the serious·student who .wishes to understand the physical-chemical aspects of biology. The course includes the Gas Laws, Thermodynamics, Chemical Equilibrium, Elec~rolytes, Kinetics. and ·Nuclear_ Chemistry. . . 
PRESENTATION: The basis of Dr. Castellino's lectures is the text. He adds the biological concepts related to physical chemistry. His intent is a very thorough course with, at times, great stress on details. · 
READINGS: The text, Basic Physic'al Chemistry for the' Life Sciences, is· written by Williams· & -Williams. The course may also include supplementary paper ·readings. The. text is a rip­off at $11.50. Of course, it comes in a brown-paper wrapper which may reflect something more worthwhile in the content. · 
ORGANIZATION: Dr. Castellino's ·class tends to be difficult at times. It includes two exams, no quizzes, and · a large set of mandatory problems. Both the tests and the problems are very difficult. 
Co111111ENTS: Unlike the present teacher's lectures which· are a sure cure for the raging insomniac, Dr. Castellino's lectures promise to hold the students' interest. The course is intended for pre-professional majors. Dr. Castellino as teacher will make the course very .worthwhile. 
Thomas ·Fehlner · 
·chemistry329 Quantitative Analysis 
ORGANIZATION: This is a one-semester course, taught last semes-. ter by Fr.. Walters and the spring semester by Dr. Fehlner, consisting of lecture and lab. Lab_ meets for three hours twice a week, but sometimes runs till· near• five. There -are· tests in the lecture course, but in lab, the grade is assigned only on the basis of the accuracy of one's determinations. 
0 

CONTENT:· The· course consists ~f a survey of the different··. methods of analytical chemistry. In other words, you're trying to find out just how.much of a specific substance is present in a· . given · sample. The · lecture attempts to provide the basis for · 
· these techniques; the lab attempts· to acquaint the student with . the actual doing of these techniques.-One cannot approach the· lab .with the free-wheeling, "get-it-done-:quickly-attitud_e" . that is so·metimes fourid in other . chem labs. ·Quant lab is like throwing darts; the only problem is that· you are. expected to score a bull's eye on each throw. ·The·lab write-ups are.··merely . reporting the percentage of a given element present (usually). : In ,g·eneral, calculations are simple and the, heart of the course · lies in 'good,. precise, lab· technique. .. · . · . .. : · This ·course applies chemistry· that . the student has learned in· 
Computer Programming and.Problem Sol~g: 
. CONTENT: In general, the course will consist of consideration of several different ways in which mathematical thinking and ideas, and the high-speed digital computer · have been and can be brought to bear on analyzing situations, and solving problems in the "real world." The:theme, if any, will be how to see what is going on around you in terms of things called "multi-stage processes." According to Goldstein, the only formal pre­requisite· for the course is "familiarity with some programming language." 
PRESENTATION: Professor Goldstein will teach PLl at some 'tinie in the course. Also each student will give a presentation on · som~ problem. Thus the format 011 approximate that of a 
seminar;: 
READING: None are really "required"· but students will be urged strongly to· read "Introduction to Operations Research" by Kauf­man and Faure. Other references will be·"A Guide to·PL-1" by Pollack and Sterling and "Non-Linear and. Dynamic Program­ming" by Hadley. 
OimANIZATION: Professor G~ldstein does not intend to have tests unless he feels that a large part of the class is not taking the subject matter seriously. .When asked about his .grading system, he said that it was "easy," and then that he wanted to be deliberately "vague" about . describing it until he got to know-his students. My.own experience is that he is very hesitant 
. to give any other grade but "A" but, on the other hand, he wants mature people and does not put up with non-achievement. 
Coitl\!ENTS: Such a course has nev:er been taught at ND before, and it has tremendous potential. The ideas to be presented are literally "as new as today." Professor Goldstein hopes for a class of talented· and enthusiastic people. He would prefer ··to act more -as an advisor than to "tell people how to do it." He is distinctly· reluctant, and at times seemingly unable to work out "the details" of his lectures, or answers questions about the '°gram­mar" of the languages he discusses. This is bad news in a course like Math 211 where the basic activity turned out to be the teaching of programming languages it probably will not be that serious·in a course like 212. 
· Profess9r Goldstein practically cries for people to come and see him· outside .of class. Besides that he can make the worst jokes in the world sound funny. Frankly, the organization of this course is still rather undecided and if you want more informa­
. tion, or just want to rap about multi-stage processes, go see him in Room 207 CCMB.

· Mathe:rn'atics· 517 Numerical Methods 
CONTENT: Prerequisites are two· y~ars of Calculus through dif­ferential . equations and an ability to program p_roblems for computer solutions. . 
· This course, which is comprised of seniors and graduate students, but is also open to juniors, deals with basic numerical methods which are analyzed to promote understanding of how ··.they work as well as why they may fail to work, so that the · student can go on to devise and experiment intellectually with other methods. Relations between various methods are pointed . out and the applicability to modem computing equipment is stressed. Topics include iterative solutions of non-linear equa­. tions, theory of polynomial approximations, divided differences, interpolation, numerical integration and initial value problems 
. 

for ordinary differential equations.

There is not an extreme amount etc.) in place of Quant. · of reading in the course due to Dr. Haaser's need and desire to 
:-NOVEMBER 30, 1971 
spend enough time' on-each of the·methods to get a thorough . grasp of ·them. 
ORGANIZATION: The student is assigned-a:problem or tw~ every two weeks on the average. He is allowed sufficient time to work on them. 'These problems involve the use of different num~rical. methods such as Bairstow's Process, ·Newton's Method or La Grange's interpolating polynomials and also need some knowl­edge of computer language such as APL, ~ASIC or FORTRAN.­Throughout the semester, no tests were given. The final _;grade will be comprised of possibly three things: accuracy and prompt­ness of assignment completions, individual student-interest,-and 
-a final exam, which may oe a take-home -o_r an oral test. ­
. ' 

COMMENTS: This course is recommended to math majors and. 
-engineering students who have .had a -thorough _backgi;o~nd in Calculus and Linear Algebra and who are inte_rest_ed _in __ com­puter programming applications in solving m~1?-ematical · J_Jrob-. lems to a high degree of accuracy.. The educational expenence received from this course comes from the realization that Cal­culus can only be used to. a certain·ex.tent -in computations.

. estimates· are used more frequently to· solve equations.

·· The C~u~e E;aluation Booklet has been a difficult thing for . airinvolved: The one thing that must be. made clear is that these evaluations are individual opinions of, primarily, single students. Things have changed at Notre Dame. No longer is a good teacher ,necessarily kept on. Our administration last year embarked upon a policy of high turnover in untenured faculty. The Course
epilogue Evaluation has felt the pressure of this move. No longer do we feel entirely free to provide or attempt to· provide this evaluation booklet. The honest work and livelihoods of many very goocf men and women are on the line. These evaluations have, perhaps, negligible effect upon the 
· lives of these men and women, yet we can never be sure. At times, in discussing the necessity of this booklet we seem to be faced with a choice between silence or destruction. The administration and their policy has left us little chance to participate in a con­structive act. We possess the great fear that our criticisms of an. excellent man and teacher will not act as part of an on-going re-construction and constructive discussion of our immediate educational situation, but instead will help only to cause his dis­missal. 
We have, however, ·choosen not to be silent, and we hope, subsequently, not to participate in the administrations destruc-· tion. So we speak of our teachers, honestly we hope; and we speak, in these final paragraphs, of how. our administration has hampered this honest discussion.
