TRIBUTE
A National Champion—Notre Dame, in this wartime season of 1943, has once again proven herself the capital city of football.
Driven on by the fire of the Notre Dame spirit that flamed to white heat in the Rockne era, the Fighting Irish machine rolled through the toughest schedule in history, a winner. Laboring under handicaps never . before encountered, the men of Leahy sweated under hot summer and fall suns till near perfection was achieved. With most of the squad garbed in the green of the Marine Corps and blue of Navy, less time than ever was devoted to the grasswork of Cartier Field.

Afternoon classes, early supper, added scholastic pressure and ineligibility stirred the gridiron caldron to a foam of uncertainty. In spirit, however, the team was solid, a rock. Marines, civilians, sailors—all lost uniform distinction on the gridiron, and this spirit of cooperation, of oneness, aided swift development into a versatile mechanism of pigskin destruction.
Time and concurrent events proved them a great team, a throwback to the 1924, 1929 and 1930 clubs of the “Rock”—the brawniest ever to ramble over foreign fields wearing the green and gold. Experts tabbed them -the top team of history, coaches heralded them the super eleven of collegiate competition, American fandom rained upon them the flora of glory—until the disaster at Great Lakes.
Fair weather friends reversed their compliments; jealous observers, waiting for just such a moment, pounced upon a fallen brother. “Notre Dame is not a champion,” cried a minority of the rabble.
But the names’of these men of Notre Dame will live —not because they wear a National crown—but because they were the Fighting Irish—fighters in victory and fighters in defeat. Triumph does not test the heritage of a thoroughbred; it is loss that tries his true mettle. \
It is this spirit in these men of Notre Dame that is the spirit of America. It is the spirit of a champion.

Facing the most difficult schedule in Notre Dame's long football history, head coach and director of athletics Frank Leahy can look back upon the past season with a true sense of pride. His five year coaching record has now produced 44 victories, five defeats and three tie games. A product of Rockne school of Irish footballers, Leahy was a tackle on the National Champion 1929 eleven. He started his coaching under Tommy Mills at Georgetown, then moved to Fordham where he developed the Seven Blocks of Granite as line tutor under Head Mentor Jimmy Crowley. Succeeding Gil Dobie at Boston College Leahy led the Eagles to the Cotton and Sugar Bowls in successive years. His 1940 eleven on the Heights of Chestnut Hill claimed the National Championship on the basis of an undefeated ten game schedule and a post season victory over likewise undefeated Tennessee. Answering the call of his first love Notre Dame, Leahy once more returned to the shadow of the Dome. The Irish rang up the first undefeated season since Rockne in 1941, the first year of his reign. A 7-2-2 record in 1942 and the National Champion Irish of 1943 complete the story. Today, Frank Leahy stands out as the outstanding football coach in nation.

COACHING STAFF
Edward W. Krause
edward c. McKeever
Notre Dame's backfield coach is a native of Texas, although he spent many of his younger years in Oklahoma. He spent his freshman year at Notre Dame, but transferred to Texas Tech, where he played regularly in the 1932-33-34 backfields under Coach Pete Cawthon. now of the Brooklyn Dodger pro team. During those years Texas Tech won thirty out of thirty-five games played. McKeever did most of the passing and called signals as a junior and senior. When Frank Leahy was made head coach of Boston College in 1939, he appointed “Mac” his backfield coach, and when Leahy came to Notre Dame in 1941, McKeever came with him. His backfields at Notre Dame reflect the calibre of his coaching.
EDWARD W. KRAUSE
The only Notre Dame athlete in history to be given a special trophy by his fellow students, Ed Krause climaxed a brilliant career as a Notre Dame player when he was appointed to the Irish coaching staff in 1942. Born and raised in Chicago, Krause won three football, three basketball and one track letters, made All-American three years in basketball, and one in football. During his school days he broke all existing Notre Dame basketball scoring records. He coached at St. Mary's College, Winona, Minn, for five years and was line coach at Holy Cross for three years before coming to Notre Dame. In addition to his football duties, Krause is also head basketball coach, having been appointed to the position formerly held for twenty years by the late George Keogan.
HUGH J. DEVORE
A native of New Jersey, where he starred in football at St. Benedict's Prep School in Newark, Hughie Devore entered Notre Dame in 1930. After playing on the freshman team, Devore gained a starting berth at end as a sophomore on the 1931 team, and was a regular for the next three years. Named team co-captain and AllAmerican in 1933, Devore gained a reputation as one of the most vicious blockers in college
football. Devore was assistant freshman coach at Notre Dame in 1934, then accepted a line coaching job under Jimmy Crowley at Fordham, where he remained during 1935-36-37. In 1938 he became head coach at Providence College in Rhode Island, staying there for four years, before moving on to Holy Cross, where he was assistant to head coach Ank Scanlan. This spring he returned to Notre Dame as a line coach.
WALTER J. ZIEMBA
Wally Ziemba was born in Hammond, Indiana, where he was educated in the public school system there, and attended Hammond High school. At Hammond High he gained a state-wide reputation as a fine football prospect, and showed his versatility by playing end one year, fullback his second year and tackle in his junior and senior years. He entered Notre Dame in the Fall of 1939, and played tackle on the frosh team of that year. The following Fall he gained a varsity tackle berth. In 1941, Coach Leahy shifted Ziemba to center, where he was an immediate success. Last year, in spite of knee injuries, Ziemba's performance at the pivot post was good enough to win him All-American honors. Ziemba was given an honorable discharge from the Marines last July because of a physical disability.
C. J. (lake) KLINE
A native of Pennsylvania, Jake Kline entered	■
Notre Dame in pre-World War I days, and played on the 1915-16-17 baseball teams. His feat of hitting three home runs in one game in 1917 to beat Michigan is still talked about when-	|
ever Notre Dame fans gather for talkfests. Kline	।
passed up several big league offers to enlist in the , I Army in 1917, and spent 1918 and 1919 overseas. After several years managing minor league	w
clubs, Jake returned to Notre Dame in 1931,	J

THE FIGHTING IRISH. 1943 NATIONAL CHAMPIONS
Notre Dame 41; Pitt 0
Notre Dame was on the threshold of another season. The Fighting Irish had lost the services of 23 lettermen from the previous year including nine regulars. Coach Frank Leahy made his tentative winter plans on a set of nine returning monogram winners, Filley and Bertelli being the only starters back from the ’42 edition. When the colleges and universities throughout the country inaugurated their various military programs, potent gridiron material was shifted around almost overnight.
Contrary to common opinion, ND received only a small percentage of newcomers. Vic Kulbitski and John Perko had been regular fullback and reserve guard respectively for the Golden Gophers until coming here. The highly touted Julius Rykovich, a freshman star from Illinois, joined the squad but was yet untested in any type of college varsity competition. Ray Kuffel, an end from Marquette, was initiated into the Irish style as were Ray Davis, Mike Todorovich, Ed Trumper, and Verlie Abrams. Only Rykovich and Perko were later to win starting berths.
All that was apparently known of the Pittsburgh Panthers was that they had a newly acquired mentor in the personage of Clark Shaughnessy, the man who temporarily rocked the football world with a stinging revision of the “T” at Stanford only two years before. Since the news of the recently installed“T” at the steel city was at a minimum, most fans came to the conclusion
that there was something worth while in store, knowing the cleverness of Shaughnessy.
At the kickoff time the ND unpredictables readied themselves to receive from the smoky secrets. For ten minutes, the boys battled on an even keel. Finally, the Irish took advantage of a Panther fumble on the latter’s 35 and slashed a path to the four, where Creighty Miller toted the oval over. Not long after that bit of scoring potency, Miller again cruised through right tackle unmolested and left 40 yards in his wake as he chalked up the second TD.
Angelo Bertelli and his able assistant, John Lujack, only had to entrust themselves with six heaves during the afternoon as the ground attack netted enough, without having to resort to the air. Bert, himself, picked up a fumble by Kulbitski on the Pitt two and raced around end for the score. The fight turned into farce as the green and gold clad laddies turned on the heat. Bob Palladino and Julie Rykovich added prestige to the score as the former gained one TD and the latter a pair.
Pitt’s biggest and best offensive drive merely enabled them to trespass Rambler territory as far as the 32, that being accounted for by Joe Mocha’s sole aerial completion of the day to Clair Malarky. Despite the offensive weakness, there were spurts of defensive maneuverability by Shag’s eleven, the particular instance being their staunch stand on their own one, thus having kept the score from reaching even larger proportions than 41-0.

Irish 55; Georgia Tech 13
Up from the cotton fields rambled the Engineers of old Georgia Tech. With a surprise victory over favored North Carolina to gloat over, the Yellow-jackets of ► Coach Bill “The Great” Alexander were confident of another triumph.
Little Clint Castleberry wasn’t making this trip. His brilliant running as a freshman had paved the way for the Yellowjackets’ unexpected triumph over the Irish ' in 1942. But fullback Eddie Prokop, a thunderbolt line cracker and a “bug on water” in an open field, could always be depended upon to churn up the yardage. Tech’s line was tough and ready, the few gaps filled by V-12 transfers from Vanderbilt, Clemson, and Alabama. At center, “Mutt” Manning, all-American candidate and K newly elected captain, was a tower of strength. The “slide rule” boys from “Peachland” were ready for a fight to the finish.
Behind the Kelly green portals of ancient Cartier, the men of America’s football capital drew up their de-& fense lines, oiled their tanks and made ready the artillery for the impending assault from the south. The Pitt Panthers, an all-civilian club, had been thoroughly trounced the week previously. Georgia Tech was to be the first real test of Irish strength. More than that, however, the fighting men of “Sorin City” were out for revenge.
। In the words of end coach Hughie Devore, who had been scouting them, “The Yellowjackets were truly the Michigan of the South, packing the power and finesse to end up on top.” All week Coach Frank Leahy had stressed crisp, hard blocking and vicious tackling to stop the Dixieland gang. Private Bertelli unlimbered his pay-
L off “wing” for it was sure to be needed on October 2.
In beautiful baseball weather, the green-clad Notre Darners jogged from the locker room to unveil a mighty “T” machine which literally pulverized the highly touted Tech squad. The adding machines showed the final count, 55-13—a display of striped field might and magic which left the 30,000 stunned onlookers speechless. It was the most crushing defeat the Yellowjackets had suffered since 1929. Tech yielded 24 first downs, 450 yards rushing, and eight touchdowns to the irresistible charges of the Irish warriors. These figures tell the story of a powerful forward wall which stood ready to smash open a path at every “Down, ready, hike” from Angelo “the Arm.” These figures tell the story of the power, speed, and deception of Mello, Rykovich, Miller and Bertelli, as fine a set of backs as Notre Dame followers have seen since the days of Schwartz, Carideo, and Brill. But most of all, these figures tell the story of a coordinated display of machine teamwork.
The complete surpremacy of the Irish was never in doubt. Before the game was thirty minutes old, the stadium had become a touchdown town. Bertelli tossed touchdown passes to Rykovich, Miller, and Kuffel, while “Big Jim” Mello crossed the double chalk line, down around zero territory, no less than three times. One ■ apiece were credited to frosh stars Bob Hanlon and lineman George Sullivan.
Revenge was ours. There no longer existed any doubts, and coming headlines were forecast by this successful completion of ND’s first big test. Once again, the football world looked to the banks of the St. Joe. The “Victory March” echoed and reechoed across the nation for the battle cry was on and Notre Dame was rolling.

Notre Dame 35; Michigan 12
Sport headlines christened it the ‘game of the decade,’ and a record crowd of 90,000 flocked into the Ann Arbor Bowl to eye the fray. In the press box was seated the widest radio and newspaper coverage ever to watch and air an athletic event. On the field the two top ranking teams in the land stood face to face.
The Michigan powerhouse was a combination of service transfers from Wisconsin. Minnesota and six other smaller pigskin centers of the Mid-West, plus the backbone of a very strong Wolverine eleven. The starting backfield of Daley (Minn.), White (Mich.), Hirsch (Wise.) and Weise (Mich.) had been duly dubbed the ‘dream quartet’ and threatened to break out in a rash of touchdowns as they had done as individual stars in 1942.
A determined Irish eleven answered the opening whistle in the battle that promised to be for the National Championship. It was the game of the year. Clear in the memory of every Notre Darner was the Michigan jinx that had seen the Wolverine walk away the victor in ten out of eleven previous encounters. The green and gold were a slight newspaper favorite, but even staunch Irish supporters feared the worst.
Creighton Miller snapped the contest wide open in the sixth minute when he churned through left guard, broke off to the right, and legged it 66 yards for a score. Michigan’s human tractor, Bill Daley, bashed his way to a score in the minutes that followed, but Pregulman
failed to equalize Bertelli’s point after, and the Irish were never again threatened. Four plays after the kickoff. ‘Angelo the Arm’ faded from his own 30, and threaded the needle-point of Freddie Earley’s arms at midfield. The stubby scatterback galloped the full 50 yards unmolested. Minutes later, Miller sliced into the open on the ND 43 and cleated a zigzag path for the prettiest tally of the year—only to have the play nullified for offensive holding. An unsuccessful drive to the 9, a Michigan punt, a Bertelli to Zilly pass and a four yard plunge by Jim Mello racked up a hard earned six-pointer. The Irish rolled up 172 yards for this single score.
Early in the second half, a 40 yard punt return by Rykovich to the double Blue’s 30 ignited the fuse that exploded when Bertelli plunged over himself. Accurate Angelo speared big number 35 for the final marker, after runs by Miller, Mello and Rykovich had gobbled up 65 yards. Michigan scored on the last play of the game and attempted the try for placement after the final gun.
Miller floated over 159 yards of green in but ten attempts for his- best showing of the year, while the Springfield Rifle completed five of eight passes for two TD’s and 172 yards, scored one himself, set up another, and pendulumed five attempts through the sticks. The defensive highlight of the afternoon saw the Irish reserves blast back the mighty Daley twice in bucks one yard from the promised land.

Notre Dame 50; Wisconsin 0
The powerful Irish grid machine coasted to its easiest victory of the season in mid-October as the smooth functioning Notre Dame club smashed a helpless, undermanned Wisconsin eleven, 50 to 0, at Madison.
Although the 50-0 indicates the trouncing suffered by the Badgers, the tilt was even more onesided than the score. The Madisonites were completely outclassed, and outplayed in all phases of the game. The Dairy state club was held to but five net yards rushing.
Wisconsin pitted a very inexperienced eleven against the highly favored Notre Dame team. It was the Badgers who last year dampened the Irish hopes by holding the Leahymen to a 7-all stalemate. Such men as Schreiner, Harder, Hirsch, Negus, Wink and others who this year would probably have given the Irish their toughest bat
tie, were all transferred to other schools. In their place, Harry Stuhlclreher, of Four Horsemen fame, had to use freshmen and green naval trainees as a nucleus for his eleven.
Putting his powerful “T” machine into gear at the opening whistle, Angelo Bertelli. the brilliant Irish field general, directed the attack and in less than three minutes had sent the elusive running halfback, Rykovich, over for the first tally. A short time later a plunge by Mello netted the next Irish marker after a 52 yard drive. Another three-minute interval, and the speedy Creighton Miller was in the end zone with another Irish score.
That was enough for Frank Leahy, so he called on the second, third and fourth string teams to finish the contest.	'
The first string came back into the fray for a short time, but 18 minutes was the limit. In that time, the regulars ran 22 plays from scrimmage and scored five touchdowns. In all, Notre Dame scored three times in the first period, once in the second, twice in the third, and twice in the fourth.
Although it was one of the most disastrous defeats in the history of the Badgers, they were far from lacking spirit. The Stuhldreher men did their best in battling the Irish, but to no avail. Only twice did the Madison club penetrate into Notre Dame territory.

Notre Dame 47; Illinois 0
With four impressive victories behind the Irish, Notre Dame fans were confident of the coming Illinois game. However, pessimistic Coach Leahy warned his men not to cross too many bridges, for the Illini had scored in every previous game with the exception of their opener. Bray and McGovern had proved themselves a couple of pony backs who could go the distance. And a deceptive “T” attack had been developed. The Eliotmen would be greatly steamed up to get the season’s prize plum—a victory over the potent Irish.
The war dipped deep into the barrel of promising Illini manpower to strip the school of a potential Big Ten Championship. Purdue’s great eleven was sparked by Butkovich and five other dynamic lads from Urbana, and Notre Dame itself had received Rykovich from the Illinois freshman team.
After a paralyzing opening round blow at the hands of Camp Grant—22-0— the Illini had proved itself dangerous in subsequent games. Its offensive power had struck for three tallies against the Seahawks, four against Purdue, and six against Pittsburgh. They were constantly improving as they perfected the tricky Eliot “T” formation. According to Illinois, it would take the “T” to beat the “T”.
The game was to be Angelo Bertelli’s last home stand. No doubt the “Springfield Rifle” would be out to add a few notches to his already glistening record. Also
Julie Rykovich, a Marine Transfer, would be awaiting an interesting day against some of his former teammates.
To the cool observer, the Notre Dame Juggernaut appeared to be just too much. The Ramblers had been No. 1 team of the nation for three straight weeks. A cast-iron line, which so far had yielded little or nothing to opponents, was counter-balanced on offense by its own victorious down field blocking, Bertelli’s magic ball handling and passing, Rykovich and Miller with their fast-stepping shiftiness, and Mello with his powerful plunges, seemed to spell certain defeat for the weak Illini.
Game-day dawned bright, sunny. Before the contest was even a few minutes old the superiority of the Irish over a fighting Champaign team was demonstrated. A sharp, concerted march brought the ball to the Illinois 25 yard line, where Bertelli tossed the pigskin into the arms of Rykovich as the latter crossed into pay dirt. From then on the Prairie state eleven was practically powerless against the mighty Irish attack. Miller, Early, Lujack, and Palladino, as well as Rykovich, scored. Bray and McGovern hit dead end streets when trying the Notre Dame line.
The game served as a fitting send-off to Bertelli in his last home performance. The crowd gave him a deafening ovation as he trotted off the field after completing five out of seven passes. The Irish powerhouse was on its way to a great season!	—By Joe Murnane

Notre Dame 33; Navy 6
Onrushing Notre Dame moved up another notch toward gridiron glory by defeating the pride of the Navy, Annapolis, before 86,000 hysterical fans, a record attendance for Municipal Stadium. The bombshell in Notre Dame’s lightning attack was Angelo Bertelli, recent winner of the Heisman Trophy, who literally and figuratively sunk the Navy by heaving three touchdown passes and scoring another on a plunge. The “Springfield Riflle,” playing his last game for the Irish, left the field only to be mobbed by photographers, reporters, and spectators alike. Mello, Miller, and Kulbitski hammered, and charged across the white stripes to pick up consistent chunks of yardage throughout the afternoon.
The heralded, undefeated Navy eleven fought val-liantly, with its hard-charging line and Hal Hamberg paving the way for the Middie’s lone touchdown. From start to finish the game was a pitching duel between “Bert” and this one-hundred and fifty pounds of dynamite. For sixty thrill-packed minutes Hal withstood the rushing Irish to hurl thirty-eight passes, eight of which were complete.
Bertelli started the ball rolling on a touchdown pass from midfield to Julie Rykovich, who romped the remaining distance in record time. One touchdown was not enough, however, for Mr. Bertelli, so he took things
into his own hands, fed a short pass to Miller, who sidestepped, stiff-armed, and scampered for forty yards and a score.
With the start of the second half, only one touchdown ahead, the Green and Gold unleashed its vicious power to romp at will over the now tired but game men of Annapolis. A long struggle downfield was culminated as “Bert” threw his third consecutive touchdown pass. The Steamroller came back for more as Mello intercepted a Navy pass and rambled forty yards to the Middie’s 12, where Miller plowed through center for six points. Navy, in desperation, began to throw passes hither and yon, moved to the “Irish” 14, threatened to score, but Messrs. Limont, White, Filley, Coleman, Perko, Czarobski, and Yonaker objected vehemently, and Notre Dame took over on downs. The streamlined “T” machine cut Kulbitski loose as he galloped seventy-one yards to the Navy 8, where the Irish refuelled, sending Bertelli through the middle for the final score.
And so it was that Angelo Bertelli, Notre Dame’s greatest passer, left the gridiron in a blaze of glory as another foe fell by the wayside, but Notre Dame moved ever onward, crushing opponent after opponent, never stopping for a breather. Color, spirit, stamina, and speed had won another ball game for the Fighting Irish.

Notre Dame 26; Army 0
Saturday afternoon, November 7 th, found the Irish invading the East in earnest when they took on undefeated Army. Seventy-eight thousand fans jammed New York’s Yankee Stadium in New York with one question in mind: Could Johnny Lujack replace Angelo Bertelli? That question was answered in the affirmative when Lujack literally stepped in to Bert’s shoes to direct the Rambler attack with all the finesse of an old hand.
Army fielded a strong team, one of their best in a decade. Casimir Myslinski, captain and center of the Cadets, is mentioned on more than one All-American team, and there were a host of fleet backs to function behind a great line. The Irish, however, lived up to their advance notices with room to spare, as the final score of 26. to 0 indicates.
Strength of the West Point line, supplemented by costly penalties, cost Notre Dame a scoring opportunity in the first sustained drive toward paydirt in the first ■ quarter, but the Irish bounced back after being held on the Army three yard line. Kelly took an Army punt and ran it back to the West Point 31. Lujack then stepped back and fired a pass to John Yonakor in a corner of the end zone and the Irish were ahead, 6 to 0.
Surprises came frequently as the Irish opened up with everything. Creighton Miller snatched up an Army fumble in mid-air and ran 26 yards before he was brought down. Jim White, playing the brand of ball that has made him All-American, stole the ball from Army’s Glenn Davis in the third quarter to set up the second touchdown.
It was this surprising blow that broke the spirit of the West Point team. As soon as the Irish got possession of the ball in the fourth quarter they started a drive that culminated in a score when quarterback Lujack sneaked across the last line.
The final touchdown came after a long drive down the field which featured the running of Vic Kulbitski, marine transfer from Minnesota. Fred Earley drove for three yards and the score.	.
Bob Kelly was one of the big factors in the Rambler attack, intercepting two Army passes and carrying the ball eleven times for twenty-seven yards. Creighton Miller was again the Irish workhorse, lugging the ball twenty times for ninety-four yards.

Notre Dame 25; Northwestern 6
49,000 expectant football fans crammed their way into Dyche Stadium at Evanston, Illinois, to see the Northwestern Wildcats claw at unbeaten and favored Notre Dame. This was a new attendance record for Dyche, and, incidentally, the third attendance record set this season by Irish games in various stadia. It was a perfect, brisk football day. The crowd was tense in anticipation of what pre-game writeups had suggested might be an upset, and the spirit shown by both teams from the opening gun kept the excitement of the spectators at fever-pitch.
The contest was especially thrilling in the first half, for during this time Northwestern was able to move through and around the Notre Dame line as few teams had done before them in this season. At one time they penetrated to the Rambler 17 yard line, only to lose the ball on a fumble. Up to the closing minutes of the second quarter both teams appeared to be about on a par, and Northwestern’s hopes for a win were based on a solid foundation.
But then Johnny Lujack loosened up his slinging arm and tossed one to Bob Kelly for the first Notre Dame score. The try for extra point was blocked, and there was no further opportunity for either team to reach touchdown territory again before the half ended.
However, It was a new, or perhaps the old, Irish team which charged out onto the field for the second thirty minutes of play. Notre Dame dominated from this
point on, with the running of Mello, Miller, Rykovich, Kelly, and Kulbitski good for long gains on almost every play. Lujack continued to live up to the passing and ball handling reputation which he had established in the Army game the week before, and left no doubt as to his competence in filling Angelo Bertelli’s vacated post at quarterback.
There was another pass to Kelly good for a score in the third quarter, Miller and Rykovich each accounted for one more before the final whistle. This double-scoring game of Kelly’s was his first collegiate appearance, in Chicago, but he was not completely unknown to the windy city fans, having played All-State ball on the Championship Leo High team in 1942.
With the score standing at 25-0 in favor of Notre Dame in the fourth stanza, one of football’s.flukes gave Northwestern its lone marker. A wide awake Wildcat end crashed through the Irish line just in time to take a lateral, intended for Miller, from the hands of second string quarterback Frank Dancewicz. No one was close enough to stop the thievery, and the surprised but delighted Wildcat went over standing up.
The Irish now turned their attenion to the two remaining games of the season, with the Iowa Seahawks, and with Great Lakes. They had proven beyond doubt that they were a great team; they had triumphed decisively over all collegiate competition. Only two service teams remained.	—By Dick Ames

Notre Dame 14; Seahawks 13
The gridiron world turned toward the campus of the twin lakes when Notre Dame squared off with Iowa PreFlight to decide the National championship. Both clubs proudly waved eight victory pennants. Each had readily . trampled inferior opponents and chalked up basketball scores on one side of the ledger. In the national ranking, number one was meeting number two inside the same chalk lines.	’
Coached by canny Lt. Don Faurot, ex-Missouri mentor, the Hawk’s lineup sparkled with some of modern football’s greatest names. Ex-professional stars who had been the best in the ‘play for pay’ loop spiced the navy eleven with the maturity that made them a rough and foxy foe.
This, however, was more than a football game. It was the reflection of a memory—a biting memory for the Seahawks. Eyes ablaze, they looked back to 1942, to the Golden Dome, a 28-0 defeat, to shattered hopes of country-wide dominance. For a year the sailors had pointed for this the day of reckoning when they might knock Notre Dame from the pinnacle—the pinnacle they once occupied themselves. It was the greatest pigskin event in 1943. Two undefeated, untied behemoths slugging it out for glory before 50,000 fans.
utes of the half, a Lujack to Yonakor pass covered 50 yards, and another to Kelly reached the three. The next second the gun barked out the finish of the march.
The Irish—the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame—would not admit defeat. They had just begun to fight. After the opening kickoff of the second half, Mello, Miller, Ryko-vich and Lujack squirmed and smashed their way down to the Navy 17. A completed aerial, Lujack to Kelly, ate up 13 yards, and Bob then battered his way over from the 4. Still one point shy of a deadlock, youthful Freddie Earley calmly toed the telling placement.
After an exchange of punts, the green marched to the Iowa 18, from which point the Seahawks bounced back all the way to the ND six yard-stripe. The line held but an Irish bobble on the 13 gave the Sailors their break. On the first play Dick Todd, spectacular halfback of the visitors, rifled a shot to Burk who toppled backwards into the end zone.
Shocked, the Irish remembered tradition and battled back. With the ball back in their possession they powered down the white stripes to the six yard line where Creighton Miller slashed over for the tying six-pointer.
The score board read 13-13 as Freddie Earley for the second time converted what proved to be the margin of victory.	—By Bill Carey
Notre Dame kicked off, only to be chilled by a quick Iowa touchdown. Two coffin corner punts spaded the Irish on the lip of their own end zone. On the ND ten, Ensign Art Guepe scampered through a cavity at right tackle to score. Bernie McGarry sliced the extra point through the sticks.
Notre Dame was behind for the first time in nine games. The Irish roared back in defiance—but meekly. The Seahawks once again powered down the field, only to be held on downs on the Irish 13. With but two min-

Great Lakes 19; Irish 14
Frozen with excitement, 23,000 sailors winced as Notre Dame trotted from their huddle to the line of scrimmage on the Great Lakes one yard line. The Irish— the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame—were on the threshold of glory, and could not be denied. The long second finger of the time clock that hovered over them spun round dizzily with but one more circle to make.
Eight minutes before, Notre Dame—hailed as the greatest in history—was a beaten team. They were behind an inspired Bluejacket eleven, 12 to 7.
Prancing away to an early score, the green and gold seemed on their way to another run-a-way triumph. Great Lakes showed signs of power, but costly fumbles twice blanketed their advance. Notre Dame raced from the dressing room at half time hungry for a score. For nine straight Saturdays they had been the greatest third quarter club in football. Often stymied in the first half they had never failed to roar back with vengeance.
This, however, was not their Saturday. It was Great Lakes instead that tallied when Emil “Red’’ Sitko, exNotre Dame freshman, scooted 21 yards around left end for six big points. Minutes later fullback Dewey Proctor bulled through left guard at midfield, was staggered in the secondary, but needled his way clear to a second touchdown.
Time, time, time—how much time? The Irish would not lose—they were the Fighting Irish—they could not lose. Fifteen minutes to play—Notre Dame’s ball. One first down, another—then three cracks netted only one yard to the Great Lakes’ 44. Nothing to do but kick. The Bluejackets knifed back fifty quick yards into Irish territory. They appeared headed for another score. Ten minutes left—raw courage rose up and slapped back Sitko, Proctor and Juzwik for no gain. Navy punted and it was Notre Dame, first down on their own 20—
nine minutes to play. The Fighting Irish plowed back up the field. It wasn’t fancy or pretty to watch. There were no long gains. It was five yards here, a loss, two yards, and then the needed three. Twice yardage was lacking on fourth down—but Notre Dame’s spartans spirited their way over the needed inches. Fullback Jim Mello led the way making- 54 of the necessary 80 yards. It took 18 cracks at those rugged Sailors to carry the ball to the three foot mark where it lay. It had been guts —a fire of winning ignited by Knute Rockne—that alone whipped a tired bunch of Irishmen up that gridiron. Now with but one minute to play, they stood thirty-six inches from fame.
On the bench, every man—his eyes glazed—watched and cheered and prayed.
The ball was back—Coleman to Lu jack, a low spin, John’s arm snaked out, a big 37 snatched the oval and hurled the line. Anxious hands pried at the pile. Striped arms signalled a score. Seconds later, Freddie Earley knifed the uprights with a placement and the score read Notre Dame 14—Great Lakes 12.	’
Ross Field was bedlam. This was a champion. This team of Frank Leahy had been stabbed twice in the third period—and had come back. The experts were right, they were the greatest in history. They were Notre Dame.
Wait though, there are forty seconds yet to play. The Irish kicked out of bounds. A ten yard pass put the Bluejackets 54 yards from pay dirt—54 yards and but forty seconds to play. The>ball was snapped to Steve Lach; he faded to pass; three Irish linemen broke through; “he’s trapped” rose a cry; an arm reached out and pulled him off balance; he staggered to his left; free for a moment, he cocked his arm and heaved a mighty effort, 23,000 faces turned downfield and there— alone—stood quarterback Paul Anderson. An easy catch, a five yard run—and there were cheers.
Yes, there were cheers—but there followed a silence that thundered—for Notre Dame had lost. The Fighting Irish had fought in vain. Their brow was clammy cold.

Bertelli Wins Heisman Trophy
America’s greatest football award, the Heisman Trophy awarded annually to the outstanding college player of the year, was won by Angelo Bartolo Bertelli of Notre Dame. Bert, who played in but six games this campaign polled 648 votes to walk away from his nearest competitor, Bob Odell of Pennsylvania with 177.
Thus. Bertelli has completed the most outstanding record ever compiled in winning the award. As a sophomore in 1941, he was second to Michigan’s Tom Harmon and last fall finished fourth when Georgian Frankie Sinkwich was feted by the Downtown Athletic Club of New York.
The Springfield Rifle, as the nation’s sports writers demonstrated by their vote, was in a class by himself in the national gridiron spotlight of 1943. One of the greatest passers in pigskin history, Ange was the life blood of the Fighting Irish ‘T’ formation. Feeding, faking, flinging—the light skinned Italian was the smoothest operator back of center in the country. Calling plays with deftness and subtlety seldom found in amateur ball, he was a coach on the field. Though his own slender right arm packed the brawniest knockout punch in collegiate competition, Bert magnified its potency by using it sparsely. Dubbed by observers the Magnificent Faker— the buggy whip attack of the Notre Dame ‘T,’ that was born in his quick hands, developed into the most feared in football.
Bert bowed out of collegiate competition at midseason against Navy. A Marine reservist he was called to Officers Candidate School at Parris Island where he now totes a rifle instead of a pigskin.
Bertelli played in 26 games, threw 324 passes for 169 completions with 29 of them touchdowns. His three year average is .522.

Paul Limont
Jim White
Captain Pat Filley
JOSEPH PAUL LIMONT
Paul Limont this year campaigned as a junior at a left end position for the blue and gold. A graduate of Jesuit High school. New Orleans, Limont alternated at end, back, and center on a team which won the city and state championship. In 1940 he was named on the all-state and all-prep teams. Limont, now a resident of Hyannis, Mass., claims that his pet peeve is "being teased" and his favorite hobby is sailing. A monogram winner last year, he was aided during the recently completed season by the experience he received in 1942. He is an expert pass receiver and an earnest defensive man.
JAMES JOSEPH WHITE
Jim White, Irish junior V-12 seaman, left tackle from Edgewater, N. J., left an excellent record at the All Hallows High school of New York City, holding captaincies in football, basketball, and track, winning four letters in each sport, and garnering all-city and all-state awards on the gridiron in 1938. His arrival at Notre Dame was the fulfillment of a lifetime ambition. Hoping to be a coach, the one time assistant scoutmaster names hunting, fishing, and rowing as his favorite hobbies. A leading campus handball adherent, he teams with trainer Eugene (Scrap-iron) Young. Varsity tackle last fall, Jim scythed his way through the toughest of opposition to become an important mainstay in the Irish wall during the past season.
CAPTAIN PATRICK FILLEY
Pat Filley, Irish senior, left guard and a South Bend lad, succeeded fellow townsman, George Murphy, as captain of the Fighting Irish for 1943. A graduate of Central High school in South Bend, the likeable guard was a capable performer for the Notre Dame varsity last fall. Being elected captain of the Irish eleven was the stocky lineman's greatest experience of his entire life. An all-state lineman, Pat captained his high school wrestling team
to stay in condition during the cold months and won conference titles in the 155 and 165 pound classes. He has ambitions of being a professional football player and marks apple pie as his favorite food. Pat, who is now a member of the Marine Corps Reserve, spends leisure hours reading Poe.
HERBERT EDWARD COLEMAN
Herb Coleman, a native son of Chester, Va., is a junior at the University this year and played a center post on the Irish eleven. He captained his high school football and basketball teams, earning three letters in the latter and four in baseball. To these, last year, he added his varsity monogram in football. In 1940, he was named on the all-Ohio Valley football team. His greatest thrill, however, came last year when he started the Iowa PreFlight game, which resulted in a 28-0 Notre Dame victory. Herb's most narrow escape befell him when he plunged 10 feet, landed on his hand on concrete and escaped uninjured. He has worked in a steel mill and his ambition is to become an executive in that industry. Career girls are his pet peeve; “How Green Was My Valley" is his selection for outstanding literary value.

JOHN FRANK PERKO
Johnny Perko, left guard, is a V-12 Marine transfer student of Slovenian descent from the mining country of Ely, Minnesota. Playing at a guard position is nothing new for Perko.

Before leaving high school, he won two letters in basketball and two in football. Last season, he covered the guard slot for Coach George Hauser at the University of Minnesota. Bruce Smith is his favorite athletic hero, and beating Michigan last year, 19-16, ranks as his No. 1 sports thrill. John wants to be a certified public accountant following the war.
ZYGMONT PETER CZAROBSKI
Ziggie Czarobski, a right tackle in the Irish line and a junior Marine V-12 student at the University, received his training in football while playing for Chicago's Mt. Carmel High school, under the tutelage of Wally Fromhart, former Notre Dame quarterback. He was a member of the Mount Carmel city championship team in 1939. For two years, he was picked for the all-Catholic team and in his final year was named all-city tackle. Ziggie was a
Jules Rykovich
regular member of the 1942 eleven. His greatest thrill came when playing before 100,000 people in Los Angeles last fall. His narrowest escape occurred when his tie caught in one of his father's meat grinders, nearly strangling him to death. As hobbies, he collects rare plants and stamps.
JOHN JOSEPH YONAKOR
Jumbo Yonakor, right end, and one of the largest men on the Notre Dame squad, carries a total of six feet, four inches, and 222 pounds. Playing for Mechanic Arts High school of Dorchester, Mass., he gained three letters in football and an equal number in baseball and track. To these he added a pair of ND monograms, won in football and track last year. His most narrow escape came when as a child, he almost died of pneumonia. Diving and swimming are his favorite pastimes, with a professed liking for steak running a close second. He is a Marine V-12 student at the University.
ANGELO BERTELLI
Bert Bertelli, senior student who was transferred at the beginning of the current semester to Marine Boot Camp at Parris Island, astounded the football populace this year and last with his amazingly accurate passing. He has been rated as one of the greatest passers in the nation and one of the greatest in Notre Dame history. As a result, he was last season named to many mythical All-American elevens. Although Bert operated from the left half slot during his sophomore year, the "T" renovation in 1942 prompted Coach Leahy to switch him to quarterback, where he upheld his fine flinging repute. He starred for Cathedral High of Springfield, Mass., captaining the football, baseball, and hockey teams, the latter twice. He was named one of the best hockey centers in New England, and his work attracted much attention and brought offers from the Springfield Indians and the Boston Bruins, which he refused in order to at-(Continued on Page 32)

Beginning with the Army game, Kelly's freshman year has been little short of sen- .< sational, improving with every, game. His speed, deception, and elusive ball-carrying have made him the No. 5 man in the-<-Notre Dame backfield.

EXCERPTS FROM THE EXPERTS

NOTRE DAME — THE magic name in football ... a name that commands attention in every state, city, town, and hamlet across our broad nation, from the granite hills and crystal lakes of New Hampshire to the sun-drenched and dew-drowned citrus groves of southern California. From Saturday to Saturday for three long months the sports pages of thousands of newspapers, from 4-page weeklies to bulging 60-page dailies, are highlighted with stories of the name and fame of Notre Dame. And especially in this year of Rambler gridiron glory, when Irish deeds have echoed from millions of mouths and painted green the pages of football history, is it fitting that the immortal words of tribute to our Fighting Irish which have flowed from the pens of great writers be preserved in this — Scholastic’s homage to a great team.
Back in the waning days of August, when the grass still sparkled emeraldlike under a warm mid-day sun, the football situation seemed in a hopeless muddle. Each day’s journal carried stories of additional schools dropping the gridiron game; schedules were in embryonic stages at best; and football mentors daily had to revise muster lists. But even these pigskin previews were forcing their uncertain way to the fore on newsstands and counters. One in particular found a glimmer of hope for the Irish — a glimmer that has since grown into a dazzling stream of glory:
1943 ILLUSTRATED
FOOTBALL ANNUAL
“. . . the suave Mr. Leahy has the makings of an eleven that would be worthy of Notre Dame even in Rockne’s heyday. Yes, the Irish ride the conquering chariot once again.”
That’s the way things looked to that particular writer — but to most the Irish Brigade was still of unproven quality. Once the season opened, however, many of the doubts faded slinkingly behind the blaze of victory. Clark Shaughnessy’s mysterious version of the Pitt Panther came first — and briefly the story went like this:
ARCH WARD, Chicago Tribune •
“A group of boys from the University of Pittsburgh this afternoon went on a man’s errand and the result was inevitable. They were turned back . . . 41 to 0 and even that onesided margin
hardly gives a true index to the victor’s superiority. Notre Dame ... is a squad that will challenge the nation’s best.”
In spite of Ward’s optimistic prediction the majority of experts accounted for Notre Dame’s runaway win in terms of Pittsburgh weakness. The Irish must first prove themselves against sternei* opposition, they held. The test was not long in coming, either. Seven days later the southland invaded Erin’s soil in the guise of a squad of buzzing Yellowjackets, whom many had already named the No. 1 team in Dixie. And this is what took place:
WAYNE K. OTTO,
Chicago Herald-American
“Bertelli, Rykovich, Kuffel, Mello, Lujack, yes and Hanlon . . . just a few of the orneriest, hard-ridin’, Tornadobusters ol’ Notre Dame has had since the Roaring Days of the Four Horsemen and those line-smashing versatile Rocknes of 1930. . . . To be sure Notre Dame won, going away, 55 to 13, but the versatility of attack and the power, obviously harnessed in spite of the massacre-like score, was something over which fans can reminisce for many days to come.”
Such a display of sheer invincibility naturally had everyone in a turmoil regarding just how great a club Frank Leahy had gathered under the Golden Dome in this second season of war-time football! But toss away the bouquets, lads, here comes mighty Michigan. And with the wily Wolverines, billed as probable national champs, came 86,000 record-breaking spectators to witness the “Game of the Decade.” And what a ball game!!!
JAMES S. KEARNS, Chicago Sun
—“Notre Dame won football’s game of the year in the midst of mild chaos here today. The Fighting Irish completely crushed Michigan, 35 to 12, while an all-time local record of 86,000 spectators looked on at a game that was, in its competitive phases a rout. . . . Make no mistake. . . . The Irish No. 1 team, superb in its quick-striking power and .the^deadlines’s of-Angelo .Bertelli’s great passing, completely overwhelmed all the defenses Michigan endeavored to raise against it.”
To this must be added a tremendous tribute:

The Men Behind the Men Behind the Line;
Usher Corps an Efficient Organization
BY AL LESMEZ

A very pretty and rather distinguished young woman came to see the Irish play in the stadium this year. There were many who fit this description, of course, but this individual was exceptionally well dressed, and carried herself with as much poise as that last drink would allow. She had waited a long time to see this Irish squad in action, and at last her wish was to be fulfilled. Then suddenly it happened. She lost her' balance and the heel of her shoe clipped off neatly.
Later, in the second quarter, when Mr. Duley, personnel director, arrived at his office, he found this very pretty young girl Tearfully sobbing that she could not see the Fighting Irish because she had no heel on her shoe. Mr. Duley could not laugh, but he summoned messengers and sent to the carpenter shop for a hammer and nails. Quick, sure hands fastened the heel back in place, and the inebriated lady staggered out quite happy. She was going to see the game after all.... or at least, half of it.
This is one of the many interesting
experiences which faced the staff of ushers at the games this year. Each game brought with it new laughs, new problems, and new incidents.
There is no questioning of the efficient machine Notre Dame fielded, but it is seldom that the supply lines, the planners, the workers behind the team ever get recognition. Theirs is the oil that makes the machine work. The success of this National Championship team means that there were planners carrying out details, and running the show.
Beginning with Mr. Herb Jones and his business department, through Walter Kennedy’s publicity department, all the way down to the program salesmen, all had their particular job to fulfill, and each did as well in his capacity as the team out on the field.
A football machine is a giant enterprise, needing radio technicians, announcers, teletype experts, photographers, newsreel men, scouts, student managers, coaches, ushers, “pop and dogs” salesmen, program sellers, and field caretakers; this machine needs stenograph-

ers, secretaries, publicity men. And too, it needs players. But that’s another story.
Mike Moore is an old Notre Dame standby at the time clock. He has been with the team many seasons, and no “Michigan incident” has occurred with him around. He deserves a lot of the credit for always keeping the thousands of spectators informed correctly of just how much time is left.
The student managers with their traveling field phones and their accurate play by play gains and losses on the score board deserve a round of applause. These student managers perform all sorts of duties which crop up in the excitement of the game. Many times they are the team’s' right hand men.
To demonstrate how unique the various departments and organizations which play their part before, during, and after each game, the Scholastic tracked down Mr. W. H. Duley. major of the Usher Squad, and asked him for the military “dope” on his organization.
With the building of the stadium back in 1930, there arose a need for a body of men to handle the terrific crowds who came in search of the 50-yard line. The human traffic problem became so acute that the present corps of ushers was formed. It resembled in many ways the military order of the army. To this day, the titles of officers are used, from major all the way down to the lowly private.
As was mentioned before, Mr. W. H. Duley is the major, followed by the captain-adjutant, Mr. T. E. Dillon. The corps is supervised by eight captains, staffed by first lieutenants, second lieutenants, staff sergeants, etc. The “army” consists of 77-5 men, spread strategically over 17 gates, 36 ramps, the box sections, and some 20 men patrolling the grounds immediately outside the stadium, seeing that all is well, guarding the team doors, and helping out with the radio equipment that has to be moved from trucks to the roof of the press-box.
Contrary to much popular opinion, these men are all citizens of South Bend, and not from the University. Anyone living in South Bend is eligible to join the staff, providing that there is a vacancy, and also that he has good character references.
Files are set up sometime in July with the prospective members’ names. About three weeks before the beginning of the season, an organization meeting is called wherein all rules are discussed carefully. New men get a chance to acquaint themselves thoroughly with their fellow workers, and also with the rules. Most stringent of these is that no man may drink while on duty at the stadium, and fur
ther, that even a slight trace of liquor on the breath will be sufficient cause for immediate dismissal from the corps. A regulation that is rather interesting to note is the fact that no women are allowed either on the field, nor in the press-box.
After this meeting, the men are ready to take their first real step toward being true ushers. They give a dollar deposit and receive their caps. These are returnable during the last game of the season, with the deposit going back to the men.
If a man is to be absent or late for any game, it is necessary that he telephone. Otherwise he is subject to dismissal.
Mr. Duley is glad to announce that since the beginning of the war, more
“Turn up shirt collars before trashing them . .	•
This fella lias the right idea—it’s just his technique that’s a little sour. Shirt collars will last much longer if they are turned up before being sent to the laundry, for then the crease around the top doesn’t get such heavy rubbing and consequently lasts longer before fraying.	.
Another fine point to remember—when you need new shirts, whether military or civilian, buy Arrow. They live up to their fine reputation for lasting wear and perfect fit. Don’t forget the Sanforized label, which guarantees fabric shrinkage less than 1%.

than 300 ushers have been called to the colors, but that on their return, their old positions, together with their rank, will be waiting for them.
To augment this staff of ushers, police officers are stationed all over the stadium • so that if force is required to remove anyone, “under the influence” or otherwise causing discomfort to the fans, they may be summoned. There is a bull-pen for unruly persons who have had too much excitement; it is located below the stands.
These ushers, especially those with titles, think a great deal of their work, and do everything possible to maintain themselves in their positions. The supervisory officers deserve a great deal of (Continued on Page 36)

The Book-of-the-Week Club has chosen for its selection this week that current best seller Thirty Seconds Over Sweetbriar, or, God Is My Co-pilot. We pick this magnificent bit of English lit. as the most likely to arouse the you-know-■ what of the you-know-who.

IN BED WE CRY
(With apologies to Ilka Chase)
You’ve heard that a lot of the lads are flat on the well known dorsal side in the N.D. infirmary. Do you know how it is to he over in the infirmary? Infirm-mary — that’s a hospital classified 4-F. It’s so crowded over there that the doctors can’t get near the patients. If a doctor wants to listen to your chest, he has to wait till after seven o’clock so that the long distance rates are cheaper. Really, the last man in the ward is so far away from the door that the nurse has to take a Mishawaka bus to go over and take his temperature. And I won’t say that they have the beds stacked on top of each other — not very high — but three times , a day for three days straight my meals when I was over there were brought to me by a ST. BERNARD dog. And the lads over there are really knocked out. There’s a new song

Just to show you what it’s like, suppose for a minute that you are Dripsey Jones, AS, V-12, USNR. You feel terrible . . . your cheek bones look like antlers, youi' eyes are sporting the latest luggage duplex bags with special compartment for electric razor, and your tongue is dreaming of a white Christmas.
The boys of the stethoscope and the tongue depresser have you saying “ah” till you sound like a Sinatra broadcast, disclosing at length that you have cat fever.
A wave rushes you to the infirmary in a station wagon. Have you got a temperature! You discover this when your chauffeur starts making grilled scrambled egg sandwiches on your forehead. You can’t decide whether she’s a fast driver or not until after arriving she makes you wait three minutes for your germs to catch up.
A nurse meets you at the door. The WAVES and the nurses get along famously together. When the two meet, the nurse waves her hankie coquettishly and says, “My dear, that’s exquisite lipstick you’re wearing . . . but isn’t catsup rationed?”
The wave smiles sweetly, “And you, you dear girl, starting a new fad like that . . . off-the-face makeup.” And you’re the one with the cat fever. While the girls are chatting you grab a look at your chart. It’s an impressive document, typed in triplicate with V-12 seals in each corner.

EXCERPTS FROM THE EXPERTS
(Continued from page 26)
H. G. SALSINGER, Detroit News
“His (Leahy’s) present team is unquestionably the best college eleven in the country. Not alone is it the best college team in the country, but it could beat any professional team. . . . Notre Dame comes about as near to being a perfect football machine as any college team is ever likely to come. Its timing, precision, cohesion, and speed are astonishing.”
Yes, the Michigan game served notice on the nation of the invincibility of the Irish. Salsinger’s all-out praise seemed to be justified, as the opposition continued to fall before the green-clad Notre Darners like wheat before the scythe. Wisconsin was next.
JAMES S. KEARNS, Chicago Sun
“Notre Dame’s precision-geared football machine ground Wisconsin to bits here today to roll up a 50 to 0 victory. . . . This rout, worst in modern Wisconsin gridiron history, took shape from the very opening of the game and not even for a fleeting second thereafter did the performance bear the slightest resemblance to a contest, even though the Irish regulars were kept on the bench more than three quarters of the game.”

“If touchdowns were gold, the football Irish co.uld have replated the dome of Notre Dame here today and still would have had enough left over from their 47 to 0 conquest of Illinois to float the fourth war loan drive. The Irish . . . were giving the football the old Midas touch to where they eventually scored almost every time they got the ball.”

JOHN LUJACK
Johnny Lujack, quarterback on the Notre Dame squad and a member of the Navy V-12 unit, hails from Connellsville, Pa. During his high school career, John 'won three letters in football, three in basketball, and three in track. A quiet, well-liked man, John possesses the amazing ability of being able to punt, run, and pass equally well. He believes that the most interesting sports event of his life was the running back of two successive punts against Mt. Pleasant High school (Pa.), each jaunt covering 70 yards. His brother, Al, was a football, basketball, and track star at Georgetown University a few years ago. Being elected president of his senior class in high school was his most interesting experience. As a sideline to football, John collects autographs and photos of athletes.
CREIGHTON EUGENE MILLER
To the left half position this year came Creighty Miller, a junior student at Notre Dame, who switched from right half, where he won his letter in 1942, and from the fullback position, which he played as
a sophomore monogram winner. As a grid star, he has gained widespread publicity as a prodigious ground gainer and an excellent punter. While playing for Alexis I. DuPont High School of Wilmington, Del., Creight earned a total of 13 letters—four in football, and three each in basketball, baseball, and track. His father, M. Harry Miller captained the 1908 team, and his four uncles, Don, Gerald, Walter, and Ray, all played for the Irish. Don was one of the Four Horsemen of 1924. Tom, Creight's older brother, played for the Irish during the past three seasons. His most interesting experience was playing before a home town assembly in Yankee Stadium; and he believes that Notre Dame's 13-0 victory over Southern California last year before 95,000 fans was his greatest athletic thrill.
JAMES ANTHONY MELLO
Jim Mello, junior student hailing from West Warwick, R. I., was one of the three who composed Notre Dame's fullback trio last year. His associates, Corwin Clatt and Gerry Cowhig, are now elsewhere in the armed forces; therefore the brunt of the fullback duties fell toward him this fall. At West Warwick High school, Jim won three letters in football, three in
baseball, and two in basketball. He was named on the all-state football team in 1939 and the all-state baseball squad in 1938. His greatest athetic thrill was starting for Notre Dame in the fall of 1942. The Southern California trip last year proved to be the most interesting experience of his life. Monk Maznicki carries Jim's vote for favorite athletic hero. Jim has a voluminous scrapbook of poems he collects from his friends.
JULIUS RYKOVICH
Julie Rykovich, right half, is a marine V-12 transfer from the University of Illinois. Rykovich gained notice as a fine running back as a frosh under Ray Eliot last fall. Julius, whose ambition is to play in the annual All-Star game, captured five monograms while at Lew Wallace High school in Gary, Ind. three in football, one in track, and one in basketball. Beating Emerson High school in Gary for the N. I. H. S. championship, 19-6, was Julius' outstanding thrill. He traveled over 40 yards three times and counted for all of his team's points. He was a member of the all-state eleven in 1941. An outdoor man, Julie prefers fishing and hunting to the milder pastimes.

He is in the Arts and Letters school. After the Navy game Ray •went, with Angelo Ber-telli, to Parris Island to begin Marine Officer Training.
MICHAEL PATRICK LYDEN, JR.
Big Mike, six foot two inches in height, and weighing 197, hails from Youngstown, Ohio, where he attended Youngstown East high school and garnered five monograms in four years; 3 in basketbail and 2 in football. He was captain of his football team as well as the basketball squad in his senior year. He was selected for the all-state teams for two years consecutively for both basketball and football. Mike is now a reserve center on the Irish squad. He majors in criminology having for his goal in life the Federal Bureau of Investigation. His favorite dish is Irish stew and his favorite athlete is Bob Dove, Notre Dame All-American in 1941.
GASPER GEORGE URBAN
"Gas," a Marine V-12 trainee, is of Lithuanian parentage and a sophomore left guard. He hails from Lynn, Mass., and attended Lynn Classical High school where he won three letters in football at tackle and captained the team in his senior year. He is a major in the College of Commerce. Gas is six feet tall and tops the scale at an even 200 pounds. When it comes to food, Gas likes to dig right in to a dish of sauerkraut and sausage. His favorite study is Spanish.
FRANK A. RUGGIERO
Rooge, who is a tackle on this year's squad, has his residence in Orange, N. J. He attended Orange High school and garnered seven monograms in his four years; four in football; two in basketball; and one in baseball. Frank is majoring in Physical Education and would like to have a career as a coach. One of the biggest. thrills of his life was meeting Jim Thorpe, who is his favorite athlete. When it comes to eating, Frank can enjoy nothing better than a good home cooked dish of spaghetti. He tips the scales at 215 and stands five feet, 8J/2 inches in height which all adds up to power when charging the opponent's line.
JERRY FORD
Ford, a sophomore end, came to the Fighting Irish from Jesuit High in New Orleans, La. His record there in both football and track, in which he ran hurdles, was excellent. However, Jerry has limited himself to football here at Notre Dame.
In 1941 he was all-state end and last year Ford won his numerals at Notre Dame.

A humorous note was struck at the Iowa Seahawks game. People were beginning to leave the stadium after the game when a loud explosion occurred. A curious crowd gathered around the spot. All were calm by this time, except for a young man who had to fight to be able to stand on his feet. He was sure that he had seen a man blown under the stadium avail in the explosion. All the explanation possible was insufficient to convince him that liquor was not the root-evil of this freak accident. And besides, the wall wasn’t even scratched. But the man insisted, and soon went to work with feet and hands, kicking the avail, hitting it. trying to budge it, fighting against calculations of engineers back in 1930, and succeeding in nothing more than seriously skinning his hands.
Together with the drunks, the banners, the college “kids,” both fancied and real, the heavy football blankets, and all that makes the football atmosphere, the pattern includes all these groups and organizations behind the scenes. The wonderful spectacles of the past season will live and re-live in the minds of all true Notre Dame fans. They will remember every fight, every banner, their programs, the drunks, and the scattered sights of interest made possible by a ■working organization, pulling together to make this whole spectacle, this pattern called football, the most exciting to date.
N. D. had National Champions on the field this season, but just as great champions "working in all fields behind the lines. Congratulations all!

OBSERVATIONS
By Lieut. S. L. Beatty, U.S.N.R.
All V-12 pre-medical and pre-dental students now in their fourth semester will meet with the course officer and the Dean of the College of Science in the Law Auditorium at 6:30 on Tuesday evening, 14 December. V-12 students in or beyond their fourth term of pre-medical or pre-dental work who entered Notre Dame on 1 November 1943 should attend this meeting also.
Those candidates who have official letters of admission to medical or dental colleges dated before 1 August 1943 should have them available for submission to the proper authorities, as will be explained in the meeting on Tuesday, 14 December.
This required meeting is for the purpose of beginning the assembly of application papers which are in turn studied by the Director of Training for this Naval district and for rating by the Navy’s committee of five deans of colleges of medicine in this district. There are approximately sixty-three students on station who have completed, as of 27 October, their third pre-medical or pre-dental term. Fourth-term pre-medical students in the Marine Corps unit should attend this meeting, and later seek their proper transfer to the Navy quota of pre-medical students as directed by Captain Finney.
A recent bulletin has been received outlining the plan of the Navy for selecting and educating a limited number of pre-theological and theological students for service as chaplains in the United States Naval Reserve. The number accepted will be determined on a denominational quota basis in accordance with the needs of the Navy. The program of undergraduate studies for such candidates is outlined in detail in the V-12 course catalogue, Bulletin No. 101 which every V-12 student has in his possession (unless he has failed to get it from duty chief in his dormitory).
Those ^eligible for this program, of study as future chaplains include high school graduates, college students, col-
lege graduates, and theological seminary students in a civilian status; officer and enlisted personnel of the Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard, and their Reserves, on active duty on ships or stations (provided the men are high school graduates); and present V-12 trainees may apply for pre-theological or theological training. Applications approved by the Bureau of Naval Personnel will be forwarded to the Chaplaincy Commissions of the various denominations participating in the Navy V-12 program, for necessary selection and

EXCERPTS FROM THE EXPERTS (Continued from page 31) backfield three deep behind a terrific forward wall. Army — whose season is always a success if it can but beat Notre Dame. Army — due after 12 years of victory-starvation in the country’s longest intersectional rivalry.

BILL CORUM,
New York Herald-American
“Too much ‘T’ and too much mustard.
“A truly great Notre Dame University football team, perhaps one of the greatest in the glorious gridiron history of the Fighting Irish, wrestled the old Army mule to the turf in the first half of yesterday’s football game in the Yankee Stadium and then proceeded to kick him around in the closing chapters.
“The final score was Notre Dame 26; West Point 0.”
The Irish duffel bag was filling up, seven in and three to go. Northwestern, one of the nation’s best clubs, coming up and really out for blood. Again all attendance records were broken as close to 50,000 fans jammed Dyche Stadium, wondering what No. 8 would bring.
JIM COSTIN,
South Bend Tribune
'‘For the eighth consecutive time this season Capt. Pat Filley today won the toss, and for the eighth consecutive time his mates followed up their captain’s good guessing by smashing to a onesided tri.umph over Northwestern’s vaunted team which crumbled before

the speed, power and deception of the Irish, 25-6.”
FRED DIGBY,
New Orleans Item
“With the collegiate championship tucked away, the Irish can now add service stripes by beating the Seahawks and the Sailors. At one and the same time they might settle the argument as to whether or not they could beat the better professional teams, as many Eastern experts contend.”
The fact that Notre Dame seemed to be absolutely unbeatable was finally being accepted by all concerned. Where and how could any team even hope to beat the Fighting Irish? That was unanswerable. So in their supremely confident optimism the millions unhesitatingly wagered on the Blue and Gold with four touchdowns to spare against the Iowa Pre-Flight eleven. Against the Seahawks!!!! . . . loaded with some of the pros’ greatest names . . . undefeated . . . and coldly determined to erase the blotch of ’42, so decisively administered by many of these same Irish gridders. Heed your coach’s warning, gents — not so easy. But oh, how tremendously glorious!!!
ARCH WARD, Chicago Tribune
“The greatest team this correspondent ever has seen at Notre Dame today defeated the Iowa Seahawks, 14 to 13, to retain its rating as the No. 1 unit of intercollegiate football.
Only the greatest team in Notre Dame history could, have beaten an opponent the calibre of the one it faced today. Never have we seen a game with better blocking, surer tackling, finer line play, more spirited ball carrying, or more intelligent direction of team tactics.”
HARRY GRAYSON,
NEA News Service
“The 1943 Notre Dame team not only has a perfect right to ask Blue & Gold creations of the misty past to move but that goes for any college combination that ever trotted out on the field.”
now they were facing the seventh. They were one minute away from immortality when the old hag gave her bitterest chuckle and played her cruelest prank and consigned them to defeat in the final minute of the final game.”
