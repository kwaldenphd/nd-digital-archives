NEWS COMMENTARY 

Stadium stormtroopers stomp student section spirit 
They can smell your fear. They sense all sudden movements. They stalk like lions and shoot for the jugular. Who are these prying predators? They are your protection. They are your Notre Dame Stadium ushers. And they are not your friends. Hold conclusion, right? Well, if you find that view far too extreme, you can be sure that the opinions of the 19 freshmen victimized at last Saturday's football game will differ only in the · number of expletives employed in the barrage against these same carnivorous aisle-ornaments. The "19 victimized freshmen" re­ferred to here are the unfortunate members of section 34 who all received escorts out ofthe stadium for a mere show oflrishspiritand collegiate jocularity. · According to the stadium Gestapo, their crimes include the following: reckless endangerment, assault and battery. From the 
· other side of the issue, that of your average Domer, the previous infractions carry more commonly recognized names: people pass-. 
ing, post-touchdown "mosh" pits and a typical fun-for-everyone Saturday afternoon blast. 
Patrick J. Perri 

The point is, these same ushers whose job description includes the preservation of organized spectator seating and collective viewer enjoyment have quite obviously abused their powers and have marred their purpose. Their ardent efforts to suffocate the inspira­tional jubilation of Notre Dame's youngest and finest are wholly unjust and even abusive. -. 
For instance, five students were removed from the game in the third quarter for participating in the post-touchdown people-passing ritual -one of whom included the young lady who served as the "passee" in the incident. It seems entirely unfair and ridiculous to incriminate her in this case since she held little voice in the matter of.her involuntary toss to the top of the stadium. She never even reached the top of the stadium because your friendly neighborhood usher forcefully yanked her from her position atop the dozen hands of her passers while making no attempt to ease her fall. Sadly enough, the four thoughtful and chivalrous ND freshmen who did

break her fall were also quickly corralled and. ejected. The flying 
j\ yellow elbows of the ushers gave them no opportunity to plead a Ii 
case.

i' ! In a separate incident occurring in the fourth quarter, an entire row was graced with the presence of a small, surly, self-empowered, elderly man whose only distinction could be made obvious by the large black letters spelling "USHER,t on his goldennylon wind­breaker. He joined them to put a stop to the celebration incurred by 
. 

JeffBurris' outstanding punt return. Their behavior could be viewed 
as potentially dangerous (in a kindergarten playpen), so this usher 
will escape the charge of "party-crashing." However, his fourth­
quarter ejection quota was apparently not yet fulfilled, so he pro­
ceeded to perform a random student ID check on the fear0 stricken 
freshmen surrounding him. Much to his dissatisfaction, all those 
questioned were actual students. (Surprisingly,-he failed ·10 pros­
ecute them for improper seating arrangements since the two students 
assigned to seats 18 and 19 were standing on seats 20 and 21.) 
After an unpleasant and unproductive stint in row 42, he went on 
to mutter a harsh rebuke behind him as a deterrent to any future 
displays of exhilaration. In reply, a low murmur ofboos and hisses 
could be detected amongst the surrounding freshmen. Yup, you 
guessed it! Asking no questions, the inhospitable mercenary 
grabbed and thrashed at the sweatshirt sleeves of several innocent 
onlooker~. hauling them viciously in trail, successfully dragging one 
young· 1ady through the accumulated muck blanketing the cold 
stadium cement. 

This misuse of power is typical of the ushers as a whole and it 
contributes to the popular stereotype of student-section ushers noted 
in the opening lines of this coqlmentary. Through their own extreme 
overeaction to situations involvingjoy, the student-section ushers 
have managed to exclude themselves from the respect and friendli­
ness shown toward the helpful, considerate and pleasant employees 
representing an institution like Notre Dame. 
· Certainly, the argument can be present~o and proven that they are 
".only looking out for our safety." This position of responsibility 
does not, however, provide· adequate justification for hawk-like 
behavior because freshmen, no matter how naive and helpless they 
sometimes appear, are not deserving of the mistreatment displayed 
by the ushers. 

A Notre Dame football game is an experience made memorable for a Ii fetime not because of the safety and security provided for its viewing, but because of the incredible exhilarated mass of excite­ment and spirit that accompanies a national championship football ·team and a first rate studerit body. Besides, how many students, despite the vocal urges of others, have actually been tossed over the great walls of the home of the Fighting Irish after a successful 
vertical pass through an entire section? . 
Perhaps if the stadium ushers issued a "controlled excitement" 
caution in place of Seargent Tim McCarthy's fourth-quarter drunk 
driving warning, the stud~nt body would be subdued to the state of 
silence comparable to those frequenters of the Hesburgh Library 
across the lawn. · ·

Last year when Floan wrote apiece for

Gay and Lesbian 


Symbols 

The pink triangle is probably the most recognizable symbol of the gay and lesbian civil rights movement. Its roots go back to the Third Reich where the Nazis used it to classify gay men interned in the death camps. Today, it .symbolizes pride and remembers the thousands who died 

·from hate. 

The rainbow flag represents the diversity to be found within the gay and lesbian community, a community that encompasses people from all backgrounds, races and national origins. 

The Lambda is one of the earlier symbols used in the gay liberation movement. Originally a picture symbol for scales, the letter means balance. Ancient Spartans used it to demonstrate that the demands of the state should never interfere with the freedom and independ~nce of an individual citizen.

Sophomore quarterback John Walsh was ranked eighth in the nation in passing efficiency last year before suffering a sholder injury against UCLA. 
by Brian Biro 

If Notre Dame, with its unblemished record, plans on entering this Saturday's contest against BYU in Provo, Utah, with an air of overconfidence, it only needs a quick history lesson to change this attitude. Think back to 1990 when big, bad Miami invaded Cougar Stadium armed with the pre-season No. 1 ranking and a noticeable swagger. The Hurricanes left with their egos firmly in check after being ripped apart by the Ty Detmer-led Cougars before the largest crowd in BYU history. The friendly confines of Cougar Stadium afford the home team a tremendous advantage, as the Irish seem sure to find out on Saturday. Not that BYU needs much help. For starters, the Cougars are led by one of the most successful coaches in recent memory, LaVell Edwards. Now in his 22nd year as head coach, he ranks fifth among active coaches in winning percentage and stands just five wins short of the magic 200 mark. During his tenure, the Cougars have won 15 Western Athletic Conference (WAC)

This summer, Leahy pitched for the Single-A Kane County Cougars. He had an 8-11 record, but his 3.22 ERA was the second lowest in the entire Marlins organization. He had 160 strikeouts and walked-just 42 batters. 
Now that the season is over, Leahy is back at Notre Dame as a non-athlete student, which is a new experience for him. 
·"In away it's not that bad being back here because now I can be a normal student," Leahy said. "I actually have an afternoon class, but I always feel like I should be getting ready for practice. It's different because, except for my own workouts, I don't have obligations of that nature. But it's nice." 
Leahy feels that the university prepared him well for the mental grind of playing professional baseball. 
"I think I know a lot about mental prepa­ration. You learn that if you can get through one thing here it will be easier in the long run," said Leahy. 
And life as a minor-league ballplayer can be a challenge. For a typical home game the players arrive at the ballpark up to five hours before game-time to stretch, work out and prepare. Then they play a three hour game and return home to crash.· Traveling from site to site may be the toughest aspect be­cause there are no planes for minor leaguers. 
Leahy feels he was lucky to be 

in Kane Country because "it was in the center of everything. Our . longest bus trip was four or five hours, where some guys would 
have to drive all day." 
Leahy also feels that the uni- 

versity had prepared him to go out 
into the world and deal with 
people. "I've leaned how to ex­
tend myself to others in a way I 
think makes me respected in the 
[Marlin] organization," Leahy 
said. "In baseball you meet all 
types of people, and you have to 
learn to deal with them. When 
you play with the same 25 guys in 
142 games, you learn to deal with 

situations; some people you like, some you don't." After the semester is over, Leahy will return home to prepare for spring training. 
"I'll probably miss being here; you al­ways miss being around it," he said. "But once baseball starts I won't have a lot oftime to sit around and think about it." 
Leahy hopes to begin the year in the East­ern League's Double-A Portland in Maine. Following that season, he plans to return to Notre Dame and graduate next winter. 
"Right now my focus is to play baseball and get my degree. I don 'treally know what I want to do after that," Leahy admitted. "I never spent any time researching jobs or · getting summer work experience. I was always playing baseball. But I'm still try­
ing, still searching." 

at Kansas, Lennon took a part-time intern­ship with the NCAA and worked for the men's Final Four basketball championship. 
Lennon is happy to be back on campus and is excited about her new line ofwork. But, like Robinson, she admits it is a change. 
"I'm seeing a different side ofthe athletic department. I'm part of the structure not a part of the athletics, so it. rs a bit of an adjustment," Lennon said. "It's nice work­ing for the school, but I have to remain impartial and sometimes that's hard." 
One of the highlights of Lennon's return to campus has been seeing the emergence of the women's soccer team as a national power. Her freshman season marked the first year ofvarsity competition for the team. And now, six years later, the Irish are ranked among the top ten teams in the nation. 
"It's been great to watch it grow. When we first started, we didn't think about rankings, and by my senior year we were trying to make the NCAA tournament. Now ,just two years later, they have a shot at winning the national title." 
For Lennon, as well as for Robinson and Leahy, playing college sports had a lot of benefits: the traveling, the celebrity ofbeing a Notre Dame athlete, and the friendships made on the team. But athletics taught some valuable life lessons. 
"Competition makes you assertive, and you can apply that to the job force or what­ever you do in life," said Lennon. "You learn that you have an opportunity to make an impact. To stand up and try." 

Notre Dame Sports Information 

·'After graduating from Notre Dame in 1991, Karen Robinson played professional basketball in Europe before landing a job as assistant coach for the Irish this year.

Abba's return to the music scene and Whitney's decision to re-release Chaka Khan's "I'm Every Woman" marked a time ofserious trouble for the general public, and this problem transferred to this fall's televi­sion programming. It seems that sitcom writers, dry ofnew ideas, have followed the. Hollywood's trend of recycling old ideas. 
Do not get me wrong, I love old shows ..: in their original forms. Who wants Lo see The Beverly Hillbillies in movie theaters or as rehashed sitcoms? The creators of these "masterpieces" need a major dose ofcreativ­ity because some golden oldies were meant to be nuked, not revived. Recent variations ofStar Trek: Deep Space Nine illustrate this and cross the line of television dignity. A few isolated successes have been smothered by shows that leave a pasty taste in the mouth. Keep watching The Simpson's and cling to the hope that, during this period of reproduction, the return of a show with re­deeming qualities, like -Solid Gold ­occurs. Now that would be entertainment!

If Cool Running, Disney's inspirational story ofthe 1988 Jamaican Olympic bobsled team, does not ring your bell, check out Malice.

A sidenote about this Jillie gem: When the women on the campus discovered this had

"appropriate." 
The new INXS album, to be released on

reviews. I heard the title song, "The Gift,"

Michael Hutchence's sensual voice seems

Dancing at Lughnasa: 
Fall opener comes to Washington Hall 
by Scott Johnson 

Dancing at Lughnasa, pronounced Loo­nah-sah for all English students and theater-goers, will be performed this week­end at Washington Hall. Irish playwright Brian Friel tells the story of the five women who shaped his life. The play occurs in Balybeg, a fictional Irish town during the late sum­mer of 1936. Certain as­pects of the fictional char­acters presented relate not only to Friel' s life but to our own as well. This invigorating memory play, which won the 1992 Tony Award for Best Play, attracted direc­tor Reginald Bain because of the way Friel blends pa­gan ritual with Catholi­cism. This becomes one of the most fascinating and mystical elements in a very captivating play. Dancing at Lughnasa opens with an introduction by the narrator ·Michael Evans, played by Pete Dillard. Michael recalls the summer of 1936 when his family got their first wireless radio set. Throughout the course of the play, Michael recounts that summer where, at the age of seven, wonder and excitement filled his home for the last time. This energy stems from his mother and aunts who are full of dreams and eager about the coming Festival of Lughnasa. However this happiness is short lived be­cause his uncle and legendary hero Father Jack, portrayed by Josh Hartman, returns from a leper colony in Uganda stricken with malaria. Also, Michael is presented with the first opportunity to observe his father, the roguish and suave, Gerry Evans. 
The actors for Michael, his mother and four aunts speak in Irish accents which re­main in character, but also balance the diffi­cult fluctuations in tone and demeanor of speech. Each character is very unique and well performed. 
Washington Hall Players bring Brian Friel's Dancing at Lughnasa to life from October 13-17. 
The female characters create picturesque scenes, but their dialogue sometimes fails to maintain a high level of energy. Interac­tions with one another tend to be awkward 
. and contrived and took up a majority of the show. With the exception ofa few confron­tations between Maggie, the joker of the 
· family (played by Megan Thomas), and Kate, the proper Catholic woman who runs the household (played by Stacey Stewart), the pace of the scenes are very slow. This stagnant pace remains until, of course, they dance. The viewer can see a little of the "Running Man" in some of the 
ladies' Irish jigs. Overall, though, the spir­ited, authentic dances create changing moods of the play, bringing life, unity and vibrancy to the stage. 
When ballroom dancer/swooner (Michael Scarsella) saunters on stage as Gerry, ailing and aimless Jack mumbles and shuffles around. When contemplative Michael softly 
narrates from a corner of the stage, things happen. Conflicts occur. Questions and empathy arise. Thedra­matic elements of the play take place when these spe­cific characters are on stage. The plot advances and reaches its emphatic, stirring climax through Michael's monologues. 
The set -with the beau­tiful sky · blue backdrop, brick furnace and simple layout -creates a power­ful image of a small, early twentieth century Irish 

Brent Tadsen home. I sensed the character's desire to beout­side. The costumes subtly develop and define the 
· characters. Especially the colorful dress of the women, distinguished look for Michael, renaissance man outfits for Gerry, and Jack's change from battered black garb to brilliant white. Dillard's powerful, yet somewhat distant performance, draws out the audience's emo­tions. Hartman portrays a warm, engrossing Father Jack.. When all elements are com­bined, the skilled players atWashington Hall bring Friel's Dancing at Lughnasa to life and provide an excellent evening of enter­tainment. 0

Financing an Education 
Ithaca College recently experienced what it hopes is just a biology experiment gone awry. A security officer patrolling the edge of campus on a bicycle discovered 290 potted marijuana plants. The plants appeared to be almost ready to harvest and have an estimated street value of$400,000. It remains uncertain who is responsible for the plants. Regardless, you have to admire the culprits for trying. With the rising cost of education these days, couldn't we all use an extra buck? 

Strippers Affirm Rights 
Some people just can't take no for an answer. Strippers Elite company, for example, could not content themselves with Kent State University's decision to prevent the company from advertis­ing in its telephone book. The owners of Strippers Elite viewed the publication's decision as nothing less than censorship. In protest, the company sent a person in a gorilla costume, a man in bikini briefs and a scantily clad 300-pound woman to parade on campus. It's hard to believe that this ensemble would generate ari increase in business for the company but, hey, at least they affirmed their first amendment rights. What's a little business loss in the name of freedom?

Putting an Idea in Motion 
It all started delivering pizzas. Three Lawrence, Kansas, resi­dents are starting a food delivery business for University of Kansas students. "Waiters on Wheels" will deliver foods from restaurants that do not run their own delivery system. Students only have to call the business and place theirorder, and "Waiterson Wheels"will take care of the rest. The business also hopes to soon be able to bring students a movie along with their food. New manager Andy Brant sees the opportunity as a perfect career option. "My mom asked me what I wanted to do with my economics major when I graduated from KU. I gave it a lot of thought, and I wanted to use my experiences with delivery," said Brant. So foraU ofyou soon~to-be­unemployed seniors, take heart and get out there and get those 
wheels turning. · · ·

WEEK IN DISTORTION 
A Fresh Alternative to the Typical Weekend 
One student's visit to Memorial Hospital 
by Mary Kate Morton 

So where are you going tonight? Corby's?" "No way, we heard it's going to get busted. I think probably Lafayette." 
"Are you kidding? Everyone knows about that. The cops will be there within a half hour." 
We've all had similar conversations, right? I mean, what else is there to do in South Bend? We try to figure out which bars or off-campus parties are going Lo get busted or what's actually going on on-campus. Everyone's always seeking the proverbial "Good Time." And it's an added plus ifyou c~ be sure that you won't see your name in The Observer the following Monday. 
Well, I have found it! Others have already discovered it---,-and I have seen the light. Finally, an alte~ative for the fresh inen (and the sophomores who hate to admit it) to the 
' typical Friday night dorm party. For the upperclassmen, an end to the pilgrimages to Corby's and Bridget's. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that swishing around in the 2-inch mixture of beer and other bodily fluids that covers the floors of crowded dorm rooms isn't a good time. I'm sure we'd never give up such a , uniquely Notre Dame experience but this is something else. Something ... different. Memorial Hospital. Yes, South Bend's version of the medical world.· Try it-you won't have to worry about having an ID that is good enough, and you might meet some interesting people. I know it was definitely 
the highlight of one of my weekends. 
I owe this revelation all to Dillon Hall, amazingly enough. One completely inno­centevening that ended up on a painful note, as far as I can recall. More specifically, it was a painful slam ofa door that my fingers happened to be occupying. Being slightly impaired, it didn't hurt until about three hours later, and my friends decided that I needed to go to the infirmary. 
Big Mistake! This decision should tell you that my friends hadn't fully recovered from our night out!. As we all know, the infirmary isn 'table to handle emergencies in the middle of the day, let alone in the middle of the night. 
Somehow, we ended up at the emergency room at Memorial. It was like I had come home to a Noire Dame class reunion or had wandered into the bookstore on a football weekend. Everywhere I looked, there they were-"-Notre Dame students. Lots of them. Apparently, I was not the only one who'd had a rough night! Since we're all members of the Notre Dame family, I struck up con­versations with several ofthe other wounded who were waiting to sec the one doctor awake in South Bend at 4:00 a.m. · 
The first guy I saw looked I ike he had been on the losing end of a major fight. He was dragging his right leg behind him, and he appeared to be in serious pain. Actually, someone accidently had dropped a full keg on his foot al Turtle Creek. I didn't think things could gel worse than that, but I was there for a long time so I saw EVERYONE! 
°There was the girl whose loft ladder had a mind of its own and toppled over with her still on it, and another girl had tripped out­side her dorm as she was running around pretending she was an airplane (Don't even try and figure out why!). 
At first, I figured I had just gotten lucky and hit the hospital on a good night, butthe secret is out-it's always like that! Really. Since I tend to hang out with the particularly accident-prone members ofthe Notre Dame campus, one of my friends had a similar experience. Al I the people I met were just a prelude to what she saw -the ultimate sacrifice for good ol' Notre Dame. 
One Stanford sophomore's noble injury, all for the sake of football. Those crazy football managers will do anything for the team!! This guy had an unfortunate encoun­ter with a paint can as he painted the football helmets with 14K gold lacquer, leaving himself blind for the evening and sporting a nifty patch over his eye for the next few days. Forget Rudy, this Domer gave his sight for the team. Now that's loyalty! 
Of course, I can't guarantee any time othcrthan late at night, so I'm not sure ifit's strictly an after-midnight thing. But who knows, if you find itexcitingin the day time, let me know. I'll have to check it out. After all, Sunday afternoons around here can get a liLLle boring! 
And I still see some of these fellow vic­tims around campus -waiting for hours together is a real bonding experience -so ifyou ever find yourself in the same situa­tion, keep an open mind and start talking. You never know where you '11 find your next SYR date! . D

FINAL WORD 



HELP WANTED 
Notre Dame Needs to Support the Disabled 
by Lori Miller 

No one is perfect. Everyone at some point in his or her life encounters some sort of challenge. For the disabled, everyday challenges can become major obstacles. Too often disabled people are slammed in the face with the phrase, "No. You can't do that." Others might shrug this discouragement off and try 
I have found Notre Dame very accommodating to my needs, but some sort of organization needs to be established that is on par with those of other schools. 
Campus life has treated me well. I have found readers to help me with my studies, thanks to the Hall President's Council. However, academics are not the only aspect of a good education. This means that I, 
something else, but a disabled person usually takes the _ and every other student, have the right to be involved

initiative to prove his or her capabilities. Perhaps this is the biggest obstacle for a disabled individual: He or she has to spend time convincing others that he or she is competent. 
I can relate Lo all the misconceptions and obstacles the disabled face. I, Lori Miller, am a freshman at Notre Dame. I am a completely blind student who has faced and conquered many challenges during my life. I have devoted the past eighteen years to proving to people that I am perfect! y capable ofdoing everything a person who is not disabled can do -and more. I don't want to be treated differently, and I think I can speak for anyone with a disability on this subject. 
Coming to Notre Dame has opened many doors for me. There are so many options, opportunities and possibilities to take advantage of. But no matter how independent! try to be, there are a couple ofissues that need to be addressed. It is necessary to have some type of support service available for disabled students on Notre Dame's campus. · 
I acknowledge that I am not the only one who has problems. Each disability involves its own needs. I sincerely believe that the best way to address this neglected issue is to begin with a disabled student organization. 
Ironically, one of the main reasons that I selected Notre Dame was becauseitdoesn'thavesuchaservice on its campus. Such a group would allow disabled students to express their feelings and frustrations to one another. The group would bring attention to the problems of the disabled. Statistics prove that a group of a nl!_rriber of people pull more weight in similar situations. 
in other activities. Unfortunately, I have been denied participation in certain activities., I feel that these discouraging rejections are simply caused by lack of awareness. This discouragement could be avoided if there was a coordinator whose job it was to inform and assist in making sure that a disabled student is not denied the activities of his or her choice. 
I have spent many hours trying to find a solution. But it is difficult. Afterall, other students don't spend their time proving that they are capable of participat­ing. 
J strongly believe that Notre Dame needs to initiate a program. Who knows better than the students. I am personally interested iri fanning an organization of students who have disabilities, whether they are physical learning difficulties. · I feel that a lot of progress could be made with this approach. I also encourage any individual who is simply interested in helping or learning more about different disabilities to be associated with this group. Currently,I am search­ing for all interested people. 
I am always open to any questions.· Don't worry, nothing offends me. If you don't ask, you'll never know. I would rather have someone question whether I could do something rather than make the assumption that I absolutely can't do it. I have always served as a resource in my community, so why not continue my efforts. 
After you read this article, I would appreciate any response. Jt:is going to take communication to make this. ~hole idea happen. .
