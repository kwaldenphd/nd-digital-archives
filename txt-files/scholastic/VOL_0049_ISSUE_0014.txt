The Team.
BY EUGENE MCBRIDE.
^HE season is o’er and the Team home once more From fields where they’ve fought and they’ve won
And they’ve all crept away in the old modest way, To talk o’er the deeds they have done.
No thund’rous applause, or def’ning hurrah’s Were waiting them when they returned.
In modest affright, they came in- the night,
. And shrank from the praise they had earned.
They strove with the best in the South and the West, In the East they repaid an old score. -<
In manner so true, the old Gold and Blue.
They raised to the prestige of yore. . *

And it oughtn’t to count—these scores that they mount Or yet that they lost but one game—
The one thing that ought, is the fact that they fought To the finish for old Notre Dame.
I
Well, we didn’t turn out "with deafening shout” . As the newspapers usu’lly quotes.
We came to them then, and chuckled:—“Well, men! And then something rose in oiir throats.
1.

But we’ll bet our hand that they understand.
As they grasp ev’ry loyal old palm;
Each yell that we raise is a paen of praise, ‘ And ev’ry hand-clasp is a psalm.
For ’twbuld be the same, if they’d lost every game, If never a laurel they’d won,
. Their Mother at home would smile from her Dome, On the deeds of .each warrior son. '

The Varsity of Other Days.
The tired old world moves on apace, and the wand of progress rests with the same easy familiarity upon the sturdy shoulder of the football hero, as it does upon the motor car, the aeroplane and the telephone. All former models are giving way to new and better ones. Notre Dame’s football history is a chronicle of glorious achievement, yet there are those little details that compel a smile that often trespasses upon the expansion allotted to a broad grin. Imagine, if you can, the Michigan team of 1915 giving Notre Dame a few minutes of preliminary practice before staging the regular clash. You smile broadly, no doubt, and with excellent reason. Yet that is what the Michigan Varsity of ’S6 had to do before Notre Dame’s neophyte eleven felt that it knew enough about the game to proceed with the contest. After watching the visitors play a few minutes, the local lads began to have certain inklings appertaining thereto, and the battle that ensued with the Gold and Blue’s volunteer eleven, although a one-sided win for Michigan, was a good showing for the local’s extemporaneous endeavor.
By 18SS the game had taken root here, and was in flourishing condition. An Omaha paper recently ran a picture of the Varsity eleven that battled for Notre Dame’s athletic prestige almost thirty years ago. Gene Melady, now a well-known business man of Omaha, played tackle on what was then significantly designated as the “rush” line, and his reminiscences will, no doubt, arouse a train of memories in the minds of many a Notre Dame alumnus. Mustaches were in fashion in those days, and the uniform consisted of pants and jacket, almost as substantial in cut and texture as a present day basketball uniform.
The flying wedge was the most approved style of play. Melady was the lightest man on the team, weighing only 175 pounds. The wedge was a sort of compromise between a steam roller and a 42-centimetre shell. No “overhead” game for the_ Varsity of other days. The principle of the old style of “rush” play was not to evade, or elude, but to overwhelm and exterminate. The center was under no particular obligation to pass the ball. When the spirit moved him he started through himself, with the entire team concentrating its
weight and enthusiasm in the small of his back.
The other team, meantime was concentrating	]
such weight and retaliatory zeal as it could	1
muster in the pit of his stomach.	■
Sometimes the opposing line gave way. More I frequently, however, it was the sandwiched “ centers’ spine or diaphragm that yielded. Notre 1 Dame was much given to annual contests with the Physicians and Surgeons of Rush Medical. The score always went democratic, so the only purpose the Irishmen must have ' had in engaging their easily vanquished foes, ' I was ready medical talent when a center was i ground to atoms between the upper and nether	,
millstones of “rush” aggression.
Harry Jewett, considered the fastest man |fi on the team, retained in after life, his pre- | dilection for things speedy, and is at present ~ the head of the organization that manufactures Paige - Detroit Motor Cars. Notre Dame’s * Eighty-Eight team defeated all opponents that " year in a style of football that combined everything from rugby through to a clinical demonstration of the survival of the fittest. Alelady x says that the game is gentler now than then. He points out that it is even considered bad form nowadays for more than seven men to * stand on a prostrate player at one time. But in the good old golden era, no football star ever felt comfortable enmeshed in the mixing * unless he was under three times as many, _ or standing on the crest of a pile of sardined combatants ten feet high.	;
Skill no doubt had something to ’do with .» . the triumphs of the eighties and <nineties. u But skill was never permitted to sneak into <- I the limelight along with weight, blood-thirstiness _ I and an earnest ambition to trample the opposing eleven deep into the torn sod. The path to a touchdown in the old days of center rushes	■
and mustached heroes, was not Jaround or f through the opponent’s line. It was over it, . j and not by the “air route” either. The trium- 1 phant registrar of winning tallies marched to | victory over the prostrate wishbones of the 1 line that had interfered with the oncoming .jB wedge, not wisely, but with direful results.

THE NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC
The 1915 Football Season.
While Joe Dorais stood in the center of Rice Field on the afternoon of November 27th with arms outstretched to receive a Rice punt, Referee Quigley blew one shrill blast on his whistle and Notre Dame’s 1915 football season
had passed into history. It is with mingled feelings of pride and sorrow that we come now to ’ review in brief the achievements of the last few weeks,—sorrow because many of us
have experienced for the last time the sensation that our classmates are battling for us on the
gridiron; pride because our team has left behind it a record that is rich with real achievements.
The beginning of the 1915 season really dates back to this time last year when we first began to realize that Eichenlaub, Jones, Finegan, Kelleher, Pliska, Duggan, Berger, Mills and Bergman, nine of the greatest men who ever wore football shoes, had played their last game for Notre Dame. With the realization that these men would be missing, we looked forward to the 1915 season with a despair so complete that it amounted almost -To fear. As the winter months passed, the situation was canvassed a thousand times by every loyal supporter of • Notre
Jesse: Harper, Coach
Dame, and still there was no hope. A Then the schedule
. was announced,—one of the
hardest that a
. Notre Dame team has ever faced. Our doom seemed sealed.	‘	.
No one realized the desperate situation better than Jesse Harper, the man behind Notre Dame’s athletics. Harper realized that there was just one solution of the difficulty,— work./ Work was begun at the earliest possible
moment/ . Winter was scarcely oyer when the	sorry' . exhibition of the great college sport,
football, squad was,, called out and-turned over .

who spent Tfie^past year studying law’ at'.Notr&v;

reported to Kelly were good men, but at that time they were certain!}’' green. Kelly worked . - like -..a demon;' and. he secured results. The
worst defects soon began to disappear. But summer came on quickly and the warm weather put an end to football when the work was only begun.	.
There was *a lapse in the work until September, and yet not a complete lapse, for while the players had scattered to all parts of the country
the coaches must have taken no vacation. For when Captain Fitzgerald led the 1915 football squad on to Cartier Field last September, Coaches Harper and Rockne were waiting
with as fine a set of plays as any team has ever used. But the task of finding men who
could execute these plays still remained. Callahan, Culligan, Ryan and Whelan, four of last year’s freshmen who had shown great promise,
failed to return. Larkin and Lathrop, monogram men who were eligible for another year of football, were among the missing. Only the remnant of a line remained and the backfield situation was even worse. But the men seemed to realize that Notre Dame’s reputation hung in the balance, and they went to work with . a splendid spirit that was bound to bring results. Every man was given a chance by the coaches. No combination of players was left untried.
Three weeks of' practice were soon over and the opening game of the season was
at hand. The Varsity faced Alma with Rydzewski at
center, the veteran Keefe and Captain Fitzgerald at guards, Stephan and “Hoot” King at tackles, El ward and Baujan on the ends, Bergman at . quarter; Bachman at fullback and Cofall and . Malone at the halfbacks. After seeing the Alma game we were convinced that our worst fears were about to be realized.

backfield into the game. Phelan at quarter and John Miller at full showed the form that was to make them two of our most valuable backs. Owing to the good work of these men the final score was 32 to o against Alma.
After the Alma game the rooters sat moodily in their rooms awaiting the deluge; but Harper had only begun to fight. Every weak spot in the play had been noted in that opening game, and it was a vastly improved team that took the field against Haskell on October 9th. Hugh O’Donnell had recovered from injuries, that kept him out of the Alma game and replaced Rydzewski at center. Mclnemy started the game at tackle in place of King, while Phelan went to quarter in the place of Bergman, who was shifted to halfback. The new combination worked so well that the gloom that. had hung over us for five months was dispelled in less than five minutes. Haskell presented a formidable lineup, and the Indians were especially pointed for the Notre Dame game. However, they were powerless before the onslaughts of Cofall, Bachman . and Bergman. O’Donnell and Stephan played brilliantly in the line, and the team showed
such vast improvement that ■ the big games of the season were no longer feared. .

After the Haskell game two _	~

weeks were spent m desperate
efforts to whip the team, into shape for the Nebraska game. Scrimmage with the freshmen was an almost daily occurrence. Rockne worked wonders with the line during those two weeks. Rydzewski. was shifted from * center, where O’Donnell was playing in faultless style to tackle. There “Big Frank” played a much improved game and was chosen to start against the Cornhuskers. Bl ward and Baujan developed beyond the expectations of their most ardent admirers. Best of all, the men went into the Nebraska game knowing that it would take the best that was in them to win. There was no false confidence; instead there.was a grim determination.
In one of the best football games ever seen in the West, Nebraska defeated. Notre Dame,
20 to 19. The defeat was a-.peculiar one. .-On classics was quite as spectacular as either of straight football Notre Dame swept -’.the the-two preceding games between the Army
Westerners off 'their feet. The ball was in Nebraska’s territory at least two-thirds of the time; the Notre Dame backs were able to gain with ease. But disastrous penalties coming after our best gains set the splendid work of our backfield at- naught, and the Nebraskans were able to find a weak spot in the Notre Dame defense—our inability to check the . forward pass. Forward passes and the fine playing of Chamberlain, Nebraska’s star end, account for the three touchdowns scored by the Cornhuskers. After Nebraska had the game apparently won, Notre Dame came back with a spectacular attack which fell but one point shy of tying the score and which would have surely turned the tide of battle had there' been a few more minutes of play.

opponent. The Coyotes however, anything but In order to keep his

Between • halves Cofall, Stephan,
Bachman and .Elward warmed up and they were shot into the fray at the start of the second half. Still the Coyotes kept fighting, and the third quarter was almost over before the Varsity’s most effective play,—the famous . Cofall-to-Bergman criss-cross,—sent “LittleDutch” over for a touchdown, the only score . of the game. The poor form displayed in this ' game can undoubtedly be attributed to the natural reaction that was bound to follow the hard Nebraska conflict.	-

and Notre Dame. Each team had one victory to its credit and each was anxious to “make it two out of three.” The injury to “Ducky” Holmes, who suffered a broken leg just three days before the game, was a severe blow to Notre Dame, as the veteran tackle was just rounding into shape and he was expected to play a prominent part in the defense against the West Pointers. In this case, as at all times throughout the season, the team showed a marvellous ability to overcome difficulties. The men placed the Army on the defensive from the very start with a smashing attack that the Cadets had great difficulty in solving. Time after time the ball was advanced within the Army’s thirty-yard line only to have the Army put up a stubborn defense that prevented scoring. Thrice Cofall tried to boot a goal from the field. Two of the kicks were partially blocked and the third was carried wide of the goal-posts by the wind. The last quarter arrived and a scoreless tie seemed certain. Then the Army succeeded in getting possession of the ball on Notre Dame’s 48-yard line from whence Oliphant, the Cadets’ greatest star, attempted a place kick. The ball was aimed squarely, but the kick was just an inch short, for the ball struck the bar across the goal posts and bounded back into the field. This narrow escape seemed to rouse all the fighting spirit in our men. Starting from their own 20-yard line with but a few moments to play they covered the eighty yards that separated them from the Army goal in just three plays. First. Cofall tore around the Army’s end for twentyseven yards; then Bergman hit the line for a short gain. The next play was the most sensational of the game. On a punt formation Cofall dropped back to his own 45-yard line where he received the ball on a direct pass from O’Donnell. Then he shot the ball twenty-five yards down the field where it landed in the arms of Bergman who was fairly flying down the field. Needless to -say there was no one on the Army team who could overtake the “Tittle Dutchman” before he had registered a touchdown. Cofall kicked an easy goal, and Notre Dame had vanquished the Army, 7 to o. . ..
After the Army game the Varsity was never pushed;' Creighton proved an easy victim at Omaha on November 13th, the final score being.41. to p. The game was featured by the -spectacular 5 work . of Cofall . and John Miller in the backfield. -The Creighton fans felt
greatly relieved when Miller replaced Cofall, but John was just as good as “the good-looking demon,” which is Nebraska’s idea of Cofall. Bachman, too, was in the midst of the fray, making' many long gains. Every one of the twenty-two men who were taken on the trip got a chance to play and each proved himself worthy of the chance. The interference running in this game was splendid, as was also the generalship of Phelan and Dorais. The ability of the linemen was well displayed when Creighton recovered a fumble on Notre Dame’s 1-yard line and was unable to put the ball over in four attempts. We have no doubt that Omaha fans will long remember the visit of our team to their city.
’ The invasion of Texas formed a fitting climax' for the season. The entire squad was taken to Chicago on November 20th to see the Chicago Illinois game and incidentally to give the Conference stars the “merry rawz.” After the game George Hull and Michael Calnon, two of our most loyal supporters, were hosts to the squad at a splendid banquet at the Hotel LaSalle. The next day Coach Harper and twenty-three of his men, accompanied by Father Farley, “Hullie” and “Mike,” boarded the -rattler and were off for the Southland. The team whipped the Texans so decisively that it seems a shame that they were not sent on down to Mexico to clean up that Republic’s many fighters. '
The Thanksgiving Day game with Texas University was not as easy as the score indicates. The Longhorns were well prepared and put up a stubborn fight. However, it has become a tradition for the Notre Dame team to make a splendid showing at the close of the season; and the 1915 team did not violate the tradition. The Longhorns were smothered to the tune of 36 to 7, and two days later the Rice Institute Owls were buried under a 55 to 2 score. .The entire Notre Dame team starred in both, games. The Fitzgerald-O’Donnell-Keefe combination in the center of the line, worked like a German army, while the “Irish” backs never failed to gain when a-gain was really necessary. In the Texas-game Bergman broke, into the headlines with a 65-yard sprint for a touchdown. Cofall had to be content with; short .gains in this game, his best effort being some eighty yards in three attempts. However, it was;in the Rice;game that “Stan” really surprised the natives. Rice played a

criticised early in the season unjustly, and his ignoring the injury to his feelings in an effort to better himself in his position showed the character of his work and his character as a man. He was out to help in the making of a good team and he did his best. His success would be seen in telling over the stories of the line gains of the past season. Charlie’s track ability helped him wonderfully in developing himself into a fullback, for he was particularly good at starting fast, and the speed he showed this season would be hard to find in another man of his size and weight. This is Bachman’s second year on the team; so we expect big things from him next season.
Harry C. Baujan, End. ’
The only other veteran on the team was Baujan who played end last year alternating with Mills. Harry had an exceptionally good year this season, and was strong on both defense and offense. His catching of the passes, his speed and his tackling ability, rank him with the best; for no team was able to make gains around either end and some of the teams • encountered, made this feature their main asset; but when they tried their end running on Notre Dame, they found good men at both posts who could stop the onslaught as many times as it was tried. Butch is a good running mate for Elward; for both play the same hard, consistent game on the defense and both are about equal at catching passes. Butch is ver}' fast, and he uses more than ordinary care in getting himself in condition, and consequently is never out of the game on account of injuries.
Hugh O’Donnell, Center.
Probably the best of the new men on the team as a regular is O’Donnell, the peppery center who added a world of strength to the Varsity this year. Hugh was a sub last season, but this year he is spoken of as one of those who starred. He not only- made the team, he made it better by his presence, and there are few centers anywhere who can compare with him. Again his lack of years kept him from being noticed, but the man he outplayed at the Army game is heralded as one of the greatest in the country. The inexperience of O’Donnell on the team as a regular ought to add to his achievement instead of detracting from it, for he made himself a star in a short time. At the first of the year he was impeded by injuries, but he refused to stay out of the work, and as a result he was hurt time and again,
but he finally recovered, and the last half of the season he was in good shape for all the games, and the write-ups showed that he was in the game the whole time. At Texas the papers said the holes opened up in the center of the. “Long Horns’” line were large enough to drive' drays through, which speaks well for the center of the Varsity line.
Dutch Bergman, Halfback.
Arthur Bergman stepped into the shoes of his big brother this year and came as close to filling them as anyone possibly could, and that is saying a great deal; for “Big Dutch” was our only all-Western man last year and he won several games by himself. In this respect Al had little on Arthur, for more than once during the course of the season, the ball was given to him to shove over the line when an exceptionally large number of yards were needed to put it over, and nearly ever}' time

he turned the trick. His speed made it almost impossible for the opponents to get him after he once had a fairly clear field. His big play was the criss-cross which he worked to perfection. This is his first year on the Varsity, and we cannot imagine what he will do the next two years. It looks as if even Walter Camp will have to put him on the all-American team.
Mervin J. Phelan, Quarterback.
The problem of finding a quarterback to fill “Big Dutch” Bergman’s place was one that ■ bothered the .coaches'for some time before the season opened; but in the first few games, Phelan demonstrated what he could do in the way of handling the team, using his head, passing, kicking, and a few other things, and the position was no longer in doubt. Phelan first came to prominence in Interhall where he starred for St. Joseph by his kicking ability, .defeating some of the best teams. His passing has been good all year, and the way in which he runs the team shows that he will be a valuable quarterback to next year’s team and that of the years to follow. His head should make him one of the stars of the country in the near future.
Frank Rydzewski, Tackle.
“Big Frank” graduated from the Freshman team of last year and this season held down the regular tackle position on the Varsity. At the first of the season Frank was slated for the center position, but O’Donnell showed up to so great an advantage- in the early games that Frank was shifted to tackle. Here he played all year, upholding his side of the line to good advantage and time and again breaking through the opposing line to throw the backs for a loss. He has a powerful build and his mere strength alone makes him a valuable man to the team. He has two years more to play and in that time should develop into an exceptional linesman. -
.Arnold M. McInerny, Tackle. ‘ •
Mac is one of the biggest men who ever played on a Notre Dame team, tipping the beam so far . above the 200 mark that it makes him nervous to think about it. He was in nearly all of the games and . started some of them as it was hard to- select between'him and Frank. Mac is a hard worker, has almost unlimited power, and although exceptionally tall, he is a good tackler and a hard man to play against. Hedid his share in the scoring of victories during the year, and his next two years should
be even more successful as he is practically ; ■sure of a regular berth next year.	j
John Miller, Halfback.	y.
As a substitute for Cofall it would be hard ? ‘to get one better than John Miller, who < attracted great attention wherever he played.	j
At Creighton he advanced the ball over a	।
hundred yards, and the Omaha papers gave	|
him a big write-up, saying that when Cofall	I
left the game the Creighton spirits rose only	j
to be killed as soon as Miller was given the ball. .	)
Another game* in which he got a chance was the South Dakota game when he ran through ' '
• and around the Coyotes at will. He is an J exceptional • man, but there are two others on the team who - are sensations. He was on the squad last year and will make a strong bid for a regular place next season. ‘
Grover Malone, Halfback.
Another halfback who showed ability this fall was Malone, who was very fast and a good ground gainer, but lost his position on the regular team to a more experienced man. It ' was Malone’s first year, and this fact cost him the position, for he lacked a little of that which makes Varsity men,' and the position which at the beginning of the season seemed his went to an older man who was showing phe- , nomenal work. Malone is a great back and by	A
next year should make the best of them hustle for his position. .	■	’
Gerald Jones, Guard.
■The presence of two star guards kept Jones from the regular team; for there are few men in the country who cduld beat out two men like Fitzgerald and Keefe, for -although a sub, , Jones got a few chances and showed that he had the stuff that good linemen are made of. -In the South Dakota game, Jones got a chance to show what was in him, and he certainly did; for he was through the line breaking up play •after play and opening wide holes for his own men to plow through. He played with the <Freshmen' last year, and this year has shown k 1 such an improvement that we feel confident | he will be a regular next season.	I
•	Hollis. King, Tackle.
.Another reserve who did his part in making 1 . the line what it was, was “Hoot” King, who L T substituted'for Stephan; the physical consti- I tution of.the latter gave “Hoot” scarcely a f chance, for Steve absolutely refused to be laid out; and as a consequence King got few chances. ’ He started the South Dakota game, however, f
THE NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC
and showed his worth to the team. “Hoot” was on the squad last year for the first time, so he has another year to play. Next year he should make the first team.
Ray C. Whipple, End.
Whipple was in much the same fix as the rest of the good substitutes; for he was fresh from the first year team and had two excellent veterans to buck. He too got his big chance in the South Dakota game, and in this game displayed the ability which gave him his monogram, although while subbing in the games away from home he showed up well, especially on the defense. He is a hard tackler and keeps fighting the whole time, so it is hard for the best backs to get around him. He should prove a world beater next year.
George Holmes, Tackle.
Although “Ducky” did not receive a monogram this year, he deserves to be considered with those who did receive them because he was kept from it by a broken leg, sustained in the middle of the season. Ever since then he has been confined to the hospital and will not be out for another week or so... This accident cast a veil of gloom over the season which was otherwise successful, and the. entire student body offers heartfelt' sympathy, to the .man who suffered so much in fighting for his Alma Mater. No one ever doubted “ Ducky’s” football ability because he had already, won a ‘ ^monogram before this year. He was a dependable man always on the aggressive and a consistent fighter. He would have won another monogram had he not met with the . injury.
Besides the monogram men there are many others who aided in making the season a success but because they were not quite as good as the regulars, they had to watch the games from the sidelines. The work done by these men is harder than that done by the regulars, , for they go out night after night to face a team of superiors, and the best they can hope for is a chance.to get in some gamb for a few minutes. Their work is all hard work and no praise; so let us take this opportunity to express our appreciation of the sacrifices and of the real work done by the “subs” in doing their share in building up the team that met with so much success.. Those who deserve mention are: Slackford, Eranz, Yeager, Tom Ring, Dorais, F. Jones, Voelkers, DeGree, Ellis, W. Miller, Wolfe, Dickson, .Murphy, Andrees, Hardy, Cook and Beh.

The Freshman Team.
Old Deacon Jones has done many a good turn for Notre Dame, but nothing in his life here becomes him quite so much as his masterly handling of this year’s youngsters. In the three years that have elapsed since the three-year rule went into effect, Notre Dame has been particularly fortunate in possessing some of the best green football timber in the land; see Yale’s interest in our last year’s squad. However, giving preceding teams their due, we doubt if there was ever gathered together on Cartier Field at one time before, so many

promising candidates for the Varsity as the aforementioned aggregation possesses. Somehow or other, they didn’t turn out to be the “Horaces” and “Reginalds” that our stiff correspondent wrote of so pleasingly last September. Bven had they been as bad as painted, a few weeks of coaching by our old tackle would have turned them into stars.
They played only three games, but those games afforded us ample opportunity to detect their sterling worth and to prophesy for their future. On October 10th they descended on the little town of Kankakee and battered St. Viator’s to the tune of 27 to nix. On the pre
ceding Saturday they had besieged Culver in their lair on Lake. Maxinkuckce and handed them the wrong end of a 35 to 6 score. On Thanksgiving Day, while the Varsity was taking the Longhorns into camp, they upheld our old prestige in Michigan territory by defeating Detroit University School 7 to o. The last score is by no means a fair measure of the work done in the game. The Freshmen’s splendid interference and wonderful defensive work; the two brilliant runs of quarterback Murphy for twenty-five yards each; the dashing attack of the backs, Fitzpatrick, McDermott and Miller, brought well-earned praise from the

Detroit papers, and anything they hand us up in that section must be true. Just before the final whistle Murphy heaved a forward pass of twenty yards to Peaison who was downed on the five-yard line just as time was called.
The work of the Freshmen would speak for itself were there no Scholastic to give it fitting form in print, and for that reason we hesitate to chronicle their deeds, fearing to give too much praise to one and not enough to another member of the team. All three games were played on foreign fields, so we must depend on the newspaper reports of the various sections invaded, along with the scrimmages

with the Varsity on Cartier Field which we witnessed ourselves, in order to give credit where credit is due. We- will now cease to generalize and mention a few names.
First and foremost, all hail to Fitzpatrick! Captain and left half of the team. Before coming to us he was given the position of allMichigan fullback in recognition of his work on the Alpena High School team. His red head, like the plume of Navarre, was the oriflamme of the team in every mix-up of the season. Always a good ground gainer and goal kicker he will undoubtedly prove a valuable addition to the Varsity backfield next year.
Miller, at fullback, was also a consistent
line bucker and ground gainer. He will certainly live up to all that we expect of one bearing his name in the years to come. McDermott at right half was a worthy running mate for Fitz. Murphy, quarterback, was a huge success. His handling of the team was entirely satisfactory, and his two runs of twenty-five vards each in the Detroit rame ~	o
lead us to believe that Dorais and Phelan will have an able substitute in ’16. Pearson’s work in the backfield was consistent and at times sensational. Allison, right half, was always ready to tear things up when Fitz showed ennui, and O’Hare ditto for Miller.
The line particularly showed the coaching of our former star tackle and Varsity captain. Let’s start at the right and go down. Thomas, right end, never seemed to be afflicted with hookworm throughout the season, but
succeeded in stopping about ninety-eight percent of the men who essayed to sneak around his end. Whitteried at right tackle filled his position like a veteran. Zoia, right guard, played the game every minute and was equally good on defense and offense. We expected big’ things of Coughlin at center, and were not disappointed. We now understand how he held the position of center on the all-Cook County team for two years. Jim Cook filled the position of left guard with the same easy freedom and happy smile that marks him on the campus. Andrews at left tackle proved an able linesman and will probably be Varsity material next year. Berkey, left end, vied
“Dear” Jones Freshman Coach.
with Thomas in keeping his end clear, and played a good offensive game. Carey was an able substitute for Coughlin at center, and Meagher ditto for Thomas. Philbin, right tackle, will prove a terrible contender for a line position on the Varsity. Along with his size he possesses the form and science of a true student of the game. Maddigan’s injury, received early in the season, kept him out of the big scraps,-but we witnessed enough of his work to realize that his football days at Notre Dame are not over.
Well, that’s about all we can say for them, man for man, because the space allotted will not permit us to be more explicit. If they feel
the least bit disappointed, let them turn to the Scholastics of former days and read the meagre write-ups of the greatest stars on our present Varsity. Then let them be solaced with the thought that thev are the Varsity men of to-morrow.
We (speaking editorially) called on the “Rev. Jones” in his suite in Walsh Flail last Sunday at 10:00 A. M., and requested an interview. Wiping the soap out of his eyes with a towel, he grinned and pleaded for mercy. All he would say was that the Freshmen team of this year is the best ever seen in these parts, and that he couldn’t say anything that would mean half so much as their work on the field. He expressed entire satisfaction with the way they have co-operated with him and the manner in which they have handled themselves throughout the season. Outside of that, he gave
us permission to say whatever we liked, but we came away feeling that not much else was left to be said. The work of the Freshmen speaks for them; far be it from our bungling pen to add or detract one jot or tittle from the merit they displayed or the praise that is due them for the very successful season that they have just gone through, winning our admiration. If we said more, we might repeat and become wearisome, so w*e rise, make our little bow, and propose—The Freshmen of to-day—the Varsity of to-morrow—may they, in days to come, fight for the colors of the old School with the same loyalty and fervor that they displayed in the season just ended.

The Interhall Season.
The Interhall football season just closed has been a most successful one. If for no other reason, it would be called a success because of the promising material it discovered and developed. But aside from that, some mighty good football was played; the games-were all warmly contested, and an interest keener than ever before was shown by both players and fans.	J; ;
It must surely be admitted that some good
football men were discovered in ’ the season but the following team was selected at a con-
which has just ended, many of them looming up as possible star material for the Varsity next year. If only this has been accomplished, the league has certainly served a purpose. McGuire, the young husky linesman of Walsh; McDermott, Klein and Coughlin of Corby; Miller of St. Joseph; Murphy of Brownson; Fitzpatrick of Sorin, and others all promise to make a hard fight for the Varsity eleven next year. This list is not complete as each hall had its share of stars.
There was but one regret of the season and that was the disbanding of the Sorin Hall team. The championship cup will be awarded to Brownson, but it seems that the Sorin • team should be at least recognized in some way, since they tied the strong Brownsonites early in the season. It is to be regretted that the eligibility rules forced this team out of the running as they would undoubtedly, have been in the fight for the cup at the finish.
. In the first game of the season Sorin and
Brownson fought to a 7 to 7 tie, the feature on this mythical eleven. They are fast, sure of the game being the-excellent work of Morales tacklers and both have mastered the knack for Brownson, and the playing of Fitzpatrick, of- receiving forward passes. McCourt was
McConnell and Corcoran for Sorin. On the afternoon of the same day, St. Joseph held the strong Walsh team to a scoreless tie. Grady, for Walsh, proved his ability as a consistent ground gainer, while Freund and Andres of St. Joseph , excelled in line plunges and long, end runs.
A week later, outweighed to the man, Walsh went down to defeat before Brownson to the
score • of 21 to. 9. . Walsh did not have her The center position - was . the hardest one to strongest line-up in; the game, which accounted fill, .not because of the lack of good men but for the large score piled up by.the Brownsonites. - because of. the number that were worthy of A pretty drop kick from the 3 5-yard line the honor.

Brownson defeated Walsh.by the score of 6 to o, and a week later, during a young cloudburst, nosed out Corby by the narrow margin of one touchdown, winning the championship. Brownson certainly had a good team which played consistent ball during all the games, and deserves credit for its work.
The wealth of good material this year makes an all-star interhall selection extremely difficult,

McConnell. McKinney is a bit too light, but would have received -the position had it not been for the exceptional ability of the other two. Coughlin is a football player—there can be no doubt of that—but his real worth has not been tested. He is the better passer of the two, but McConnell is a more aggressive player. He is in on every play, and his presence in the game always enthuses fight and pep into the rest of the team. So he has been selected all-interhall center. Red Brown of Walsh was ' given the quarterback position over Murphy because of his superior generalship. Murphy is a better forward passer, but does’ not run a team with the generalship and coolness of Brown. Allison was selected as right half. He is a good forward passer, a good open field runner and a demon at line plunging. The other halfback position was given to Carlton Beh of • Corby. It has been pointed out that he was . Varsity material and should not be considered on an interhall team, but nevertheless he is given a place in the backfield because of his kicking
and his ability to make first downs whenever affair and the same pep which has marked
1
called upon. The fullback position was never in doubt. Ward Miller of Corby was by far the best in the league, which does not mean that there were not other good men for this place. But Miller is a star of the first order and will give all a hard fight for the fullback position next fall. He has the driving power of an Eichenlaub combined with speed.
This selection may not contain the stars ' of the interhall league, but it surely presents a well-balanced team, one equally strong on the defensive or offensive. It would be especially efficient at the open style of football. With such a strong line, Allison to hurl the passes, and two such ends as Cook and Barry to receive them, the eleven should be an efficient scoring machine.

Varsity Football Banquet.
At the Oliver Hotel -last Sunday evening the 1915 Football Season was officially closed. It was a fitting end to a very successful season and an event that will be long remembered. ■
Coach . Harper had personal charge' of the
his work on the gridiron was brought to bear upon the conducting of the banquet.
The event was characterized by the presence of the two loyal N. D. supporters, “Hullie” and ‘‘Mike,” and their brief but humorous remarks . brought considerable laughter from the guests. The outgoing members of the team, Captain Fitzgerald, Keefe and Elward, made their farewell remarks amid laughter and sorrow. Professor Benitz gave his usual toast, as also did Assistant Coach Rockne. During the time that the “training table appetites” . were in their glory, music was furnished by Messrs. Riley and Martin, and it is needless to remark that this line of entertainment was well taken care of.
To show their appreciation for the Coaches the Varsity squad, through the medium . of Captain Fitzgerald, presented : Harper and Rockne with a cigar-holder, cigar case and a box of cigars.	.	-
After Cheer-Leader Gargan had led' the Squad members in giving cheers for Harper and Rockne, the monogram men adjourned to the adjoining room where they elected

Notes and Comments.
The following interesting statement from A our old friend, Mr. Fielding Yost, together with the comment thereon appeared in a recent . edition of the South Bend Tribune:
Cites N. D. as Example.
In my opinion, teams using men four years should play only with teams following the same rule. The additional year makes a great deal of difference in the possibilities for a team. The case of Notre Dame - helps make my point.
Until two years ago, Notre Dame under the four-year rule was a dangerous adversary and defeated some very strong teams, including Yale and the Army. Last season Notre Dame adopted the three-year rule, barring first-year men, and since then she has not been heard from so- prominently. It surely makes a difference.
,	(Editors’ note: Mr. Yost is writing these articles
£ for the Tribune under his own name, so we are forced to print the matter whether it is right or wrong. Distinctly, Mr. Yost has wandered far from the facts in making his point on three-year athletics. It is to be conceded the four-year schools have the advantage. There is no argument there. But to use Notre —Dame to sharpen the point Mr. Yost shows regrettable ignorance of the football record and rules of one of ' the leading universities of the world. In the first place Notre Dame never defeated Yale. Her victories over the Army were both scored when the freshmen eligibility rule was in force; when she played Yale * she observed the one-year residence rule, of course. _ As for Notre Dame losing her prominent place in football news, the fact remaine'd that she outplayed the team which is regarded generally as the strongest in the West this vear, Nebraska.)
4 ’ ...
Mr. Yost is certainly deserving of criticism since such elementary ignorance of football history is unpardonable in a man of his ~ standing. He is of course right in saying that “Notre Dame under the four-year rule was a 1 dangerous adversary and defeated some very • strong teams.” As a splendid Illustration of this , point, Mr. Yost might have referred to Notre Dame’s victory over Michigan in ’09. No matter z how hazy his recollection of our other achievements may be, we feel quite sure that Mr. Yost v has not forgotten that victory. If Mr. Yost wants ' to demonstrate his point by showing how much weaker Notre Dame is with the three-year rule in force than she was before the rule was ' adopted, we suggest that he arrange for a meeting between the 1916 Michigan and Notre Dame elevens. Since the Freshman rule was • adopted at Notre Dame we have won five out of seven big intersectional games, thus .pre
venting the Bast from establishing a definite claim to superiority, a claim that might well be based upon victories of Eastern teams over Michigan. Certainly if Notre Dame is losing “her prominent place in football news,” Michigan must have been long since relegated to oblivion.
*
As is customary at this time of the year, a number of all-star elevens have been chosen. Camp’s all-American has not appeared as yet, but we have no doubt that Walter will display his usual generosity toward the West and especially toward Notre Dame by placing six or seven of our best men on his eleven. The all-American selected by the Detroit-Times honors Captain-elect Cofall with a position on the second team. The all-American selected by Parke H. Davis, sport writer for the New York Herald, is a representative selection. His choice is as follows:
All-America Eleven.

The Indianapolis News for November 27th has the following dope:
Another football season has passed into history, and once again comes the arduous duty of honoring football men who have . distinguished themselves on Indiana teams this season. The News has departed a bit from its custom this year, and its selection for places on the all-state and all-secondary teams is made by a number of football coaches, sport writers and others who have followed the game closely. The selections, therefore, represent the composite opinions of many and not the opinion of one.
A short review of the football season is in order. Notre Dame gets first place because it has been defeated only once this season, and then by one point. It has played an unusually hard schedule; and that Harper's men should come victorious through a season when the first material looked anything but promising, is a credit both to the, coach and the fighting spirit of the men. The game with Rice Institute to-day should be a victory for Notre Dame, if dope counts for anything.

The season of football is over,

The injured are now convalescing, ‘

The captainship next year to fill.

And Elward has got to go too, But Bach has a year yet to give us

“The Birth of a Nation.”
Through the extreme kindness of Mr. H. G. Summers of NewYork City, Mr. H. B. Aitken, and Mr. D. W. Griffith, the faculty was enabled to present “The Birth of a Nation” in Washington Hall, thus saving most of the students the price of a gallery perch at the Oliver. Probabty never in the history of the University were seats in the campus theatre so literally fought over as on Friday morning, December 3rd.
So much has been written and told about “The Birth of a Nation” that a detailed account of its splendors is unnecessary here. And well that it is so, for we feel it to be vastly beyond our power to express in words the feelings to which this wonderful spectacle gave rise within us. The gush of compassion succeeded the thrill of excitement; laugh followed sigh. Furthermore, such ones as found the tear of sympathy welling in their eyes during the performance need not accuse themselves of softness. Such a combination of splendid photo-drama and stirring music would affect the most indifferent. How much is added to the total impression by the efforts of the well-trained orchestra that travels with the film it would be impossible to estimate.
“The Birth of a Nation” is an imposing panorama of the Civil War and Reconstruction periods of United States history, correct in every detail. Infinite care was used in the production of such scenes as Lincoln’s assassination and Lee’s surrender, and we see them on the screen exactly as American annals narrate them. So realistically is the whole depicted that the interest never wavers. Tensely we watch the Ku Klux Klansmen gallop across the country to the rescue, while fair Beauty languishes in distress. With sinking hearts we see the personal bodyguard leave his post ■ behind Lincoln’s box, because we know what is to follow. Cheers rise to our lips as we witness the remnant of a gallant Confederate regiment charge hopelessly against their entrenched fellow-Americans. Entirely superfluous lumps find their way to bur throats at the sight of a stricken mother’s repeated sacrifices for the .Lost Cause. We leave the horrible glory of the ; battlefield to look upon the afflicted family -gathered at home to beseech the Almighty’s help for their loved ones. in danger; or to
mourn over the loss of one who lies alone on the battlefield, forever oblivious to War and its attendant sorrows.
The cast of the picture is a noteworthy one, all the important roles being well filled. On the program we find such well-known names as Henry Walthall, as the dashing Southern colonel; Lillian Gish, Miriam Cooper, and Wallace Reid. The last-named actor’s appearance was short but crowded with action. He it was who handled very effectively a coterie of negroes in true William-Farnum style. Mae Marsh’s appealingly pathetic portrayal of the little sister, who to save herself from dishonor found it sweet to enter the opal gates of Death, is, to our mind, one of the prominent features of the film. Other notable character delineation are the roles of Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, Austin Stoneman, Silas Lynch, and Lydia Brown.
Truly every American should see “The Birth of a Nation.” It has the power of stirring one to his most patriotic depths, as was witnessed by the uncontrollable enthusiasm of the Notre Dame audience. Toward the crushed South we can feel nothing but honor for their sincerity, admiration for their struggle, and sympathy for their defeat.	•	.'
As an offset to any ill-feeling that might arise against the negro race, the latter part of the picture gives us glimpses of the work that is being done in various institutions toward educating apd refining the emancipated African. We should also remember in this regard that the freedom-crazed slaves were supported and incited by the diabolical white men, known as carpet-baggers, who sought to further their own interests at the expense of nationality, religion, and all that man holds dear. .
“The Birth of a Nation” is America’s answer to the charge that this country must go to Italy and George Klleine for its magnificent screen spectacles. • To the genius of D. W. Griffith we owe the most inspiring feat of photography in the history of animated pictures. His mind conceived the stupendous idea, his unlimited ability carried it out. Mr. Griffith is an artist in his line as much as any great painter, sculptor, etc., ever was. The remarkable night battle scenes; the gathering of the clansmen;

Frank W. Holslag, one of our students, has; among many other interesting papers, an original ritual and also the secret code with an explanatory sheet of the famous Ku Klux Klan.
These rare articles were given to Mr. Holslag by a close friend, Col. G. C. L. Stansel, nowdeceased-, of Pickens County, Alabama. He-was one of the organizers -of that splendid, society that did so much to eliminate the-sufferings of the South during the dreadful, days of the Reconstruction.
A detailed article describing the Klan and~. its work and some of the trials of the southern people may be supplied by Mr. Holslag at a later date.	‘
As this information comes directly from people who were acting characters in this period, and from one who has lived with these people, and who is from those districts, it should, be very interesting.	'

THE NOTRE DAME. SCHOLASTIC
Safety Valve.
More trouble than ever has been taken this year to pick all-Hall teams that will show the various stars hidden beneath the smoke of interhall conflict. The Editor has considered eveyone, and after carefully weighing their merits has selected three teams which speak for themselves.
FIRST TEAM.
Bernard Heffernan	LE	Brownson	Mr. Mark Hackett is a blonde who has a complexion
Simon Rudolph	LT	Sorin	like a freight car and has been given the position of
Robert Bushman Carr	LG	Day Student	right tackle for his ability to argue on both sides of
Erich Hans DeFries	C	Sorin	a question at the'same time, without touching either
Allerton Dee	RG	Walsh	side. He has a voice that sounds like the last gurgle
Mark Hackett	R T	Brownson	of a bath-tub which would scare away the opposing
Harry McCollough	RE	Walsh	player. His first name “Mark” sums up his disposition.
Tip Hogan	Q	Sorin	We have placed Harry McCollough at Right End
Earl Hawxhurst	LH	Walsh	for his ability at finding holes. A man that has found
Elward Haskens	RH	Brownson	a hole large enough to admit him into Walsh Hall
Robert Sellick	F	Carroll	at 10:30 without being ^discovered by the prefect
SECOND TEAM.		•	should certainly be able to squeeze through an oppo-
Oberwinder	LE	St. Edward	nent’s line. Harry is perhaps the trickiest player in
Ford	LT	St. Edward'	the game.
Sharp	LG	Day Student	For quarterback we have chosen “Tip” Hogan,
Garlick	C	Brownson	because he has only about a quarter of him in the back,
Spears	R G	Brownson	three-fourths of him being in the front in the form of a
Abbott	RT	Holy Cross	breadbasket. He is swift and buoyant and could go
Windoffer	RE	St. Joseph	around the field like a butterfly, shouting signals,
Lightfoot	■ Q	Brownson	forming interference, and. blowing his nose, all at the
Wolf	L H	Day Student	same time. His head is full of cube roots, arches,
Lamb .	R H	Brownson	surds and absurds and no opponent could ever, hope
Shepard	F	Brownson	to fracture it. Our one difficulty would be in getting

tion of Left End as he has undoubtedly. earned it for neatness in arranging his books and perfect enunciation. He has a high voice which penetrates like a hat pin and he would find little trouble in throwing kisses to opposing players which would so bewilder them as to make them useless. While they were in . this coma he could easily carry the ball to the opposite goal post if he did not get homesick on the way.
Simon Rudolph has been picked for left tackle on account of his gall. He has a forty-two centimetre mouth capable of shouting forth five hundred words a minute. All opponents must succcumb to his nerve, otherwise he would bribe them and attain the goal. He has never handled a football and probably couldn’t distinguish one from an ice-cream freezer, but if one were given him he could be sassy enough to make people flee from him and in this way he could secure a touchdown.
Robert Cushman Carr is the only perfect lady on this year’s eleven, and has been selected for left guard for his ability to guard or to care of children. He is perfectly charming, bis manners are lovely, and perhaps no one is better at crochetting than he. His ability to look bored has been a consideration in choosing him.
Erich Hans DeFries is by all odds , the best center ' ability to pierce the line of any team. Pearson will substitute for them. Garlick.is the. strongest man on
on account of his stretch. It is said that he is able to ^stretch the distance from one goal post to the other. He has an adam’s apple on his neck as big as a footfall and would have his opponents guessing where the ball was. The only possible hope for his opponent would "be to carry a nut cracker—Erich is afraid of them.
Allerton Dee has been chosen right guard in spite of the fact that he was picked last year for all-American pest. His proficiency at eating soup is the chief factor considered by the judges. The fact that he never .shaves and seldom gets his hair cut is in his favor and in everybody else’s way. No one could endure his company for a whole game and his opponent must therefore run away enabling Al to make a touchdown.
football pants to fit him, we could, however, clothe him in a tube skirt.
We have chosen as halfbacks, Earl Hawxhurst and Elward Haskins on account of their sweet dispositions and deep blue eyes, as well as their ability at parting their hair. Both are social lions and from the way Earl Hawxhurst holds the hands of the fair ones we know he would never let go of a football if it were once given him. Both have corns and like apple sauce.
To Robert Sillick'of Carroll Hall we have granted the position of fullback. He will undoubtedly be able to go anywhere if he is not pinched for moping on the way and it would be just like him to turn up behind the goal posts at the most unexpected times. He has been with us for the last three months and has not discovered yet where the trunk room is, nor is he aware that there is any dome at Notre Dame except his own. His beauty would bewitch the opposing team.
On the second team we have placed Oberwinder and Windoffer as ends thinking that they would equalize each other and even the team. As tackles, we have'placed Ford and Abbott and have Car as a substitute if Ford should not be able to go. We have placed Sharp and Speare as guards because of their
the team and would easily hold his own and drive back his man: . Lightfoot is our choise for quarter and,we have placed. Lamb and Wolf at the halves but have been careful to put Shepard between them so that he will be near lamb arid keep off wolf.
