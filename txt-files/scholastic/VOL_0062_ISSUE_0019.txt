KRESGE’S

What other College Men have done with KRESGE’S

“In 1918 I graduated from Ripon College, having majored ia chemistry. After following my profession several years I concluded that my personal advancement was limited. In 1923 I entered the employ of the S. S. Kresge Company, worked hard and many long hours, but today, as manager of a new store, I am proud of my membership in the great Kresge Organization. My future is unlimited.”
An Illinois Wesleyan University graduate, class of 1915, says: “My eSorts with the Kresge Company have been amply repaid and now, as store manager, I feel sure that any man who gives his best eSons to the Kresge Company will not be disappointed.”

One of the many successful Kresge store managers is a graduate of the University of Diinois class of 1920. His advice to ambitious young college graduates is: “Prepare yourself now for future success. Cast your lot with the Kresge Company."
J
I ?
A graduate of the Ohio State University writes: “I am not boasting of my success as a manager of a Kresge Store, but I know that financially I am far ahead of most of my college pals. A man's ability is practically the only thing limiting his success.”
WANT MEN to grow with Kresge’s. We are now operating 510 stores and are opening new stores at the rate of 75 to 80 a year; thus creating opportunities for men who join our organization. We offer to train college graduates to be the kind of men we need . so that they may reach the kind of positions they desire.
If you have a trained mind and a well-rounded personality, you possess the first two requisites. If you are willing to work hard, to learn the details of every phase of store management and to start at the bottom on a small salary, we may very possibly do business together. For the reward is well worth the earning. To those who follow out the Kresge training plan, we offer store managers’ positions paying very attractive salaries.
It’s like having a business of your own, plus the added opportunities in a corporation with $150,000,000 sales annually.
A Kresge representative, possibly a graduate from your own college, will be sent to tell you personally of the opportunities with Kresge if you write our Personnel Department.

Another successful store manager, a graduate of Indiana University says: “The young men of today who are willing to begin at the bottom and work their way to die top will be tomorrow’s leaders in every field of endeavor.” The Kresge Company will train you for greater responsibilities. *

e coughed—the NillainX
and the love scene had to be taken all over!
Madge Bellamy explains the growing popularity of Old Golds in Hollywood "The 'hero’ in a movie may easily become the 'villain’ if he coughs at the wrong time. A cough isn’t ever nice, but when it interrupts the taking of a movie scene, it’s a calamity! The high tension of movie work makes smoking a vital relaxation. But we relax with old colds. They’re as smooth as the polished manner of Adolphe Menjou, who himself is an OLD cold fan. While they’re the most enjoyable of cigarettes, old colds mean absolute 'fade-out’ for throat-scratch and smoker's cough.”

Mud is a most relevant subject. Relevant, in one sense, to me because it is going to help fill this page,' and relevant to you because your shoes are covered with it. Mud has been responsible for a great many things. In fact, for nearly everything; it was, at least, figuratively, the material which begot Adam, and it is literally the substance of mud pies. After one has partially digested a course in Anthropology the exact status of Adam and his errant rib is somewhat confused, so we shall be limited to the more pertinent discusion of mud pies. Slap-stick comedians have a traditional tendency to convulse audiences by hurling pies at the scenery and their fellow actors. Now it has been hinted that the writer of this column has descended to slap-stick tactics, and moreover, that the pies he hurls are filled with insinuating-mud. The only thing I can suggest is that those pies which struck Ashtabulans and others on the nose, and blinded the farsightedness of some impetuous maidens, were made of a chimerical mud. That is, my pies will not stick to anyone who hasn’t asked for them, and not too long to those who have.
William Shakespeare thought of some peculiar things. Some of them were peculiarly poetic while others were merely peculiarly peculiar. Yet he was never peculiar enough, I warrant, to think that a play of his dealing with one Julius Caesar would be presented in a school that was meant to be Irish as part of a Saint Patrick’s Day program. The Gaelic sheep herder, the baldest Roman of them all, and the son of the Stratford tanner—crowd something of all three of them into any one day’s activities and the Hibernians will never have a doubt as to whose glory shines the farthest. The University Theater is to be congratulated on attempting a Shakesperian drama, and with Professor Kelly injecting into his players the Irish spirit that moved McCormack, Shaw, and John Drew there can be no doubt as to their success.
Everything comes to him who waits, and waits, and waits. Even a cigar store Indian. For twenty odd years most of us have been waiting for something or other to happen. Now if we can wait another forty years or more something will happen, and then the mourners will smile through their tears when they recall our wistful, waiting gaze. They will say, “He seemed always to be looking off into the future, as though he expected some happy dream to come true.” Back in the days when little boys—with one hand squeezing a nickel, and the other clutching the handle of an empty dinner bucket—ran down to the German saloon for papa, many of us were on terms of friendliness with cigar store Indians. We admired the Indian, he did riot seem to resent our admiration, and we envied the proprietor* of the store his adoption of our playmate. But the Indian differed from us. He was impervious to rain, higher education, and table manners. Still it is good to know that we now have our Indians. Not only have Indians, but are Indians. For Doctor Cooney in his friendly way has opened our eyes to the fact that we students are all cigar store Indians incarnate. Further, the Doctor has implied that the stolid Indian of the tobacco store may well bury his hatchet in resigned submission to a
greater stoicism. We shall call ourselves the Five Nations, after the five colleges, and hold a pow wow on the slimy shores of Badin lake to determine which tribe among us is the most indifferent.
Last year was a good year for suicides. Particularly college suicides. Leap year is frequently overcrowded with despondent males who end all with a gas hose, a vial of poison, or a marriage license. Although the vogue for student suicides sterns to have passed, still, if anyone wishes to revive the custom, we have an offer to make. To any student, who has been disappointed in love, who has flunked the Novel course, or who has neglected to pay his last semester’s cigarette bill, and who shall remove himself eternally from this muck and mire, we will gladly offer one column of our page for an obituary. A panegyric eulogium with details as to your favorite breakfast food, method of cleaning teeth, and opinions on the causes of bald-headedness will be the reward. It is understood that we have no desire to decrease the University’s registration, but have suggested this amusement simply because it is no little bother to fill this page every week. Applications for the use of the University’s firearms must be made to your night watchman.
Lindberg and Joe MacNamara are not very well acquainted. But they ought to be. They have a common grievance, and nothing makes for friendship like companionship in trouble. Lindberg could fly anything anywhere, so long as it had wings and a propeller. MacNamara could win any debate, so long as he had an argument and a platform on which to stand. But despite the wholehearted recognition accorded to each of them by their particular worlds, they met defeat in a strange manner. Lindberg took his fiance into the air, and fate dealt harshly with him. MacNamara took his debating team to Saint Mary’s, and prejudice dealt unfairly with him. But we’re betting on the Funny Fellow, and will accordingly remind everyone that she who laughs j last was probably sitting in the back of the hall and didn’t I get the joke at first. Ox* else she didn’t like the Juggler 3 ‘quips on blind dates and bait dances.	|
Have you seen the man who has seen the first robin? Or who says he has seen the first robin? Don’t be dis- . appointed if you haveri’t, because the chances are that it wasn’t a robin he saw at all. Brother- Alphonsus has been g the infallible herald of the robin’s return, and unless those 1 announcements are verified by his binoculars, don’t put faith ] in the robin rumors. Notre Dame is a bird sanctuary now.	j
As yet the birds do not seem to appreciate our sentiments	|
in turning the grounds over to them, but this is explained by our failure to advertise properly. Testimonials from con- a tented cuckoos, and shrill voiced greckels, acting as sanctuary j policemen, will be necessary before our ornithological civiliza- | tion can be said to be advanced. Robins, however, are the | knights errant of the feathered world, and they will soon be . dissecting Hoosier worms even though they have no bird baths and three-storied houses.

GLEE CLUB MAKES FIRST APPEARANCE OF SEASON BEFORE CAPACITY AUDIENCES The University Glee Club made its first official appearance of the year at Dixon, Illinois, February 22, where it sang to a capacity house, under the auspices of the Dixon council of the Knights of Columbus. The club presented the same program at Rochelle, Illinois, Saturday evening. They returned to Dixon Sunday morning to sing Gounod’s “Mass in A” at high Mass in St. Patrick’s church.
Press notices from the two cities gave the club much praise, both for the ensemble singing and the work of the individuals. The club sang twelve songs on each appearance and were well received each time. The solo singing of Fred Wagifer, president of the club, and Anthony Kopecky were well received.
The club is considerably hampered by the loss of most of the personnel of last year, but Director Joseph J. Casasanta has worked out a combination that will approach the clubs of other years. The next trip of the warblers will be taken during the Easter vacation when they will head eastward on the annual spring tour.

VARSITY DEBATING TEAM APPEARS AT SAINT MARY’S
Eight members of the debating team of the University were heard at St. Mary’s, Monday afternoon in an exhibition debate at four o’clock. The affirmative team, composed of Captain Charles Haskell, Fred Beamer, Francis McGreal and Charles Hanna (alternate), i-eceived the decision of the judges by a vote of 13 to 7. The negative team included the following men: Captain Joseph McNamara, James J. Walsh, Thomas Happer and Robert Baer (alternate).
The subject of the debate was: “Resolved, that the Criminal Code of the United States be reformed so as to correspond with the procedure of the British criminal code.” The debate which was judged by the sociology classes of St. Mary’s, was enthusiastically received by a large number of faculty members and students at the institution.
Reverend Michael Mulcaire, C.S.C.; Reverend Charles Miltner, Reverend Hugh O’Donnell, C.S.C., and Reverend Paul Doherty, C.S.C., were among those present at the debate.
The varsity debating team will meet De Pauw University tonight in Washington Hall at eight o’clock. The same subject will be debated that was discussed at St. Mary’s Monday,, regarding the adoption of a criminal code in the United States similar to that of Great Britain.
The Notre Dame team will consist of the following men: George Beamer and Francis McGreal. The visiting team will include: Franklin Cole, Robert Small and Alvin Rockwell. Professor Elwood Murray, of Purdue University, will be the judge;- Professor Clarence Manion of the Law College of Notre Dame will be chairman.
SCRIBBLERS’ ANNUAL POETRY CONTEST CLOSES TONIGHT
The Scribblers’ Annual Poetry Contest will close at midnight tonight. Entries in the contest will be received up until that time, but no poems will be accepted after tonight. Letters containing entries which bear a post-mark of March 1 or before, will be accepted. Poems should be brought or mailed to Louis L. Hasley, chairman of the contest, 425 Walsh hall.
The contest is. open to all undergraduates of the University. Entries have been coming into Mr. Hasley steadily since the contest was first announced by President Young- of the organization several weeks ago. Judging from present indications, the number of entries in this year’s contest will closely approximate, if not surpass, the number received in last year’s record-breaking contest.
Katherine Bregy, and Theodore Maynard, internationally known literary figures, have consented to be judges in the contest. A third judge will be announced in a few days.
A prize of $15 will be awarded the poem receiving the highest number of votes from the judges; another prize of $10 to the entry receiving the second highest number of votes; and a prize of $5 to the contribution receiving the third highest number of votes.

PREPARATIONS FOR MONOGRAM “ABSURDITIES” VIRTUALLY COMPLETED
The Monogram Club “Absurdities” have become a Notre Dame tradition, as evidenced by the interest being shown in advance of this year’s show. With the initial preparations for this year’s production vii-tually completed, nightly rehearsals of the various skits are being held, and all predictions are that the 1929 edition of the “Absurdities” will be “bigger and better than ever.”
Joseph Abbott, vice-president of the Monogram Club, and Coach Tom Mills, director of the production, are putting the letter-men through their paces and the show is rapidly taking form. The chorus, one of the features of the show, is being given special instruction by a prominent South Bend dancing teacher.
Since the first “Absurdities” were presented in 1924 the show has annually been developed a little more than the preceding year, and has become a matter of interest to South Bend as well as to Notre Dame. The 1924 show was given only once, while this year three evening performances and a matinee will be given in order to accommodate the number of people expected.
Past “Absurdities” have featured some of Notre Dame’s greatest athletes. Tom Lieb, who will return next year as	1
assistant football coach; Harvey Brown, football captain, and	I
Johnny Montague, track star, were stars of the original fe production. The second show was featured by Jimmy Crowley’s prohibition speech, Harry Denny’s orchestra, and Adam 4 Walsh and the Four Horsemen as. members of the chorus.	,
John McManmon was the feature of the 1926 show, while the stars of the following year’s offering were Gene Edwards, i Johnny Nyikos, and Ike Voedisch. Last year’s show will be | remembered for its several “bits and hits,” including Bob | Kirby and Fred Collins.
In former shows such prominent writers as J. P. McEvoy and Harry McGuire have contributed skits to the club, and , several surprises and treats are said to be in store for the audiences this year. Fred Collins, with the experience gained in last year’s production, is expected to be one of the leading performers.	_
March 20, 21 and 23 have been set as the dates for the three performances in Washington Hall.

MEN YOU KNOW
COLONEL WILLIAM HOYNES
1862, when he volun-
There is probably no man on the campus who deserves more veneration and praise than Colonel William Hoynes. His life has been a romantic one, and we may truthfully state, an eventful one. He is a familial* figure at Notre Dame. The Law School which he built stands as a monument and silent tribute to his genius and ambition. The successful lawyers before the bar today, and they are numerous, who matriculated at the Hoynes College of Law, owe their entry to the profession to this man.
Colonel Hoynes was born in Ireland, near Callan, County Kilkenny, on November 8, 1846. He left his native land in his early childhood and came to America. He began his career with the La Crosse, Wisconsin, Republican, as a printer. He served in this capacity until June 9,
teered in the 20th Volunteer Infantry, to help fight for the Union. He was given a place in Company A and was the youngest member in his regiment. The regiment was sent to the southwest to fight, and managed to participate in most of the important western battles. Colonel Hoynes was severely wounded in the battle of Prairie Grove, Arkansas, in 1862. He stayed in the service, however, and participated in the capture of Van Buren on the Arkansas river, and saw active service in the siege at Vicksburg. His wound, however, threatened his health and he was discharged from the service, but soon after re-enlisted in the Second Wisconsin Cavalry. The rest of his wax* record is an honorable diary of skirmishes and active service. He was mustered out of the service as a commissioned officer.
After the last thunders of war were over, Colonel Hoynes entered the University as a student in 1868. He received his A. M. in 1878 and his LL. D. in 1888. He had received his LL. B. at Michigan some years before. In 1873, he became editor of the New Brunswick (N. J.) Daily Times. He traveled west to Chicago, where he soon became associated with M. M. “Brick” Pomeroy, in editorial work. Later on he became editor of the Peoria (Ill.) Daily Transcript and held this position for two years, 1881 and 1882. He tired of the newspaper profession and established a law office in Chicago for two years. In 1883 he became a member of the Notre Dame faculty and remained as a member until 1918, and since then has been Dean Emeritus of the Hoynes College of Law.	,
As a member of the faculty, he was responsible for a great many changes in the University. He organized the University Light Guards in 1887. He wrote in lecture form many treatises for students on Contracts, Torts, Pleadings, Evidence, and many othei* legal topics. He was a regular writer for legal magazines and press publications.
Colonel Hoynes was also a prominent political figure. In 1872 he was admitted to the Supreme Court of Michigan, and in the same year was appointed to the United States Circuit court. He was a judge of the Supreme Court of the United States in 1875, and a justice on the Supreme Court bench of Illinois in 1877. He was a Republican candidate for Congress in 1888 and in 1904 refused the nomination for Congress. He was appointed United States Commissioner in 1890 to treat with the Turtle Mountain (N. D.) Indians.
Colonel Hoynes is engaged at present in the preparation of treatises on law subjects, but even his literary activities
have lately been retarded, due to war wounds and failing health. He is a member of the Catholic G. A. R. and was appointed Knight in the Order of St. Gregory by Pope Pius X in 1912. The new Law building was formally dedicated by him in June, 1919. He is a familiar figure to every student on the campus. For years, the crowds have looked for Colonel Hoynes and his tall hat at the football games, and while he has attained a ripe old age, he still maintains a keen interest in athletics and manly development.

* COLLEGE OF COMMERCE NOTES *
❖	James E. McCarthy, B.S.C., Dean	❖
Each year a number of firms send their representatives to the University to confer with the students of the College of Commerce about possible placements in their firms after graduation. In former years a large number of the graduates have gone into the employ of these firms who have sent representatives to the University. These conferences furnish an unusual opportunity for the students and enable them to establish excellent business connections with reliable firms before graduation.
Mr. E. T. Rhodes, of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, of Akron, Ohio, will be here about March 15 to talk to the students interested in that branch of business. Mr. Rhodes will be followed throughout the remainder of the semester by representatives of other firms. Members of the General Tire and Rubber Company, Jewell Tea Company, Kresge Stores, Indiana Bell Telephone Company, Traveler's Life Insurance Company, Aetna Life Insurance Company, and members of several mortgage and investment firms of Chicago, will be at the University some time between March 15 and June 1.
¥
The first of a series of Commerce lectures was to be given this afternoon in the North room of the University library. Mr. R. 0. Morgan, credit manager of the Oliver Chilled Plow Works, of South Bend, was to speak on the subject, “Analyza-tion of Financial Statement.”
Mr. Homer J. Buckley, president of the Buckley-Dement Company, of Chicago, Illinois, was scheduled to lecture last Wednesday afternoon but was unable to be in attendance because of business which necessitated his presence in Chicago at the time. He will speak in the near future, however, on “Direct Mail Advertising.”	’
Dean McCarthy advises that all Juniors and Seniors are required to attend these lectures which are given in the North room of the University library. All other students in the College of Commerce are invited to attend. Bulletins will be issued from time to time, giving the speakers'and the date of theii' appearances.

MUSIC AND DRAMA
Devotees of instrumental music on the campus are waiting with constrained interest the reappearance of Miss Margaret O’Connor, talented harpist, and Mr. Harry Farbman, popular violinist, two of America’s younger instrumentalists. Miss O’Connor and Mr. Farbman are to entertain next Wednesday, March 6, in Washington Hall. The concert will consist of classical and semi-classical arrangements for their instruments. Both of the entertainers appeared at Notre Dame last season and were received with a wealth of enthusiasm, winning the commendation of the entire audience.
Complete mastery of the most difficult of musical instruments, and a personality that reaches across the footlights and appeals to every member of an audience, have combined to place Miss Margaret O’Connor among the leading harpists of America.	■
Mr. Farbman has appeared with symphony orchestras and in recitals in all of the metropolitan cities of this country. He is one of the outstanding violinists of the United States and four years of concert tours to South America and Europe have developed the self command of this young artist, broadening his style to that of an individual interpreter.
Miss O’Connor received the greater part of her harp education from Enrico Tramonti, one of the most illustrious of harp teachers. She has worked constantly for a clearness of note, an absolute control of volume, and a delicacy of shading. That she has been successful in this undertaking is verified by the reception she has received in her country-wide recitals. Since her first concert, at the age of twelve, she has appeared in all parts of the United States, and has made an extended tour of the Panama Canal zone under the sponsorship of the United States government. This wide experience has given her an easy, unaffected stage presence, which is enhanced by her natural beauty and the perfect ease with which she handles her harp.
Miss O’Connor and Mr. Farbman will include in their recital several of the selections that were so popularly received at the time of their last appearance, and will include many other well-chosen numbers in their program.

NOTRE DAME “TRAVELING LIBRARY” TO BE EXHIBITED IN LEADING CITIES
Thirty-nine books, written by prominent professors and writers of the University, are included in a display known as the “Traveling Library” which is being sent to various metropolitan cities in the United States in an effort to acquaint the people of the country with the literary works that have been written by Notre Dame men.
The display was featured in South Bend several weeks ago and is now in Indianapolis. The tour will include all of the major cities of the country in its scope.
Included in the group of books is “Rime of the Rood,” the latest of Reverend Charles L. O’Donnell’s works. The Reverend Patrick J. Carroll, C.S.C., has four of his popular-writings, “Heart Hermitage,” “The Man-God,” “Songs of Creelabeg,” and “Round About Home” in the group. “High in Her Tower,” “The Doctor’s Wooing,” “The New Poland” and “Teacher’s Year,” from the pen of Professor Charles L.

MID-WEST STUDENT CONFERENCE FROWNS ON HONOR SYSTEM AND PROFESSIONALISM The council of the Mid-West Students’ Conference, which was held February 22, 23 and 24 at the University of Cincinnati, voted against the adoption of the honor system and the tolerance of any form of professionalism in college athletics, to decide the most important questions of the meeting. Although the question of the honor system came to a vote, it was learned that it has been practically abandoned in the forty schools represented. The conference approved the method of giving employment to athletes who were forced to work their way through school.
William H. Krieg, chairman of the Student Activity Council, and Lawrence A. Moore, chairman of the Blue Circle, were the representatives of the University at the conference. Krieg was chairman of the committee reporting student elections, while Moore was chairman of the committee on nominations for next year’s conference.
Many suggestions were offered to devise a system of acquainting the new student with the . traditions of the universities. Among the solutions offered were an intensive and extensive program of orientation for freshmen; appointment of a tradition committee of the student councils; publication of traditions in the student handbook; and a strict enforcement of all traditions.

CAMPUS PERSONALITIES

Bart McHugh is Notre Dame’s official newsboy. He hrs red hair; lives in Sorin (first floor, not the sub); believes Cincinnati to be the best city in Ohio, and that Ohio is the best state in the Union.
Bart goes in for activities on a big scale; in fact, one not knowing him very well, would be tempted to think him somewhat of a “racketeer,” but such is not the case, as all his activities are legitimate and above suspicion. At present, he is Chancellor of the Knights of Columbus and President of the Cincinnati Club—both responsible and dignified offices. He is also Treasurer of the Law Club, showing the trust that the future barristers have in his
sterling worth and integrity; for if any office requires spotless character and infinite tact, it is that of a Law club treasurer.
Last summer, McHugh was appointed to the post of game warden for the grounds of the University. Though this position seems a sinecure, Bart had his hands full, as cats and small boys with sling-shots made the life of “our feathered friends” miserable.
No account of Bart’s activities is complete without mentioning two very important things, both not very well known except to upperclassmen. Before his other activities absorbed all his time, there was not a better outfielder in interhall baseball than Mac. All those who desire further particulars about his baseball prowess should see Father Lavin —who will gladly give them information. Secondly, the football postal cards of last year and the quite famous “Last Minute Extra Special Football Number” of some years back originated in McHugh’s fertile brain.
Bart is a senior in the College of Arts and Letters and a sophomore in the Law College. He should made a good lawyer.	—e. l. t.

DR. BONINE TO SPEAK BEFORE ACADEMY OF SCIENCE
Dr. Fred Bonine, of Niles, Mich., whose outstanding successes in treatment of eye diseases has made him" a medical figure of national prominence, will speak before the Academy of Science next Tuesday night in the University Library. Robert J. Schulze, president of the Academy, announces that only a limited audience can be accommodated and that members alone are allowed to bring outsiders.
The paper of the famous specialist will most probably put forward the preventative idea. Artificial light has given the eye much trouble, especially when used improperly. This, along with other causes of eye disease, will receive attention from Dr. Bonine, primarily to enable an audience to understand its eyes and to keep them well.
Although information concerning the anatomy and physiology of the eye will be given, the paper will find an interested audience even among those not grounded in the sciences.
The session will be a regular semi-monthly meeting, and other business will be taken up as usual. Dr. Bonine will begin his talk at about 8 o’clock.

BOOK REVIEWS
“THE SLOWER JUDAS,” G. B. Stern; Alfred Knopf, New York, 1929. $2.50.
“The Slower Judas,” a charming collection of thirteen short stories, or to be technical, tales, is this latest work by that charming writer of equally charming prose, G. B. Stern. The amazing success of “The Matriarch,” of its sequel, “A Deputy Was King,” and of Miss Stern’s last novel “Debonair,” should be equalled if not surpassed by her latest volume.
Miss Stern, singularly enough, is one of the few writers who seems to feel that she can leave propaganda and “missions in life” to others. She tells a story, an interesting tale, and tells it in a fascinating manner. Few of us can lay aside one of G. B. Stern’s novels once we have started to read it, so engrossing is the theme and so interesting her handling of characterization.
In “The Slower Judas” we find short stories of every conceivable type: of character, of situation, of plot, and the others. Even one “dog story” is found in the group. Fortunately, however, we did not know this when we borrowed the volume, or we would never have read the twelve delightful tales which Miss Stern relates. We refuse to consider the “dog story” in treating of “The Slower Judas,” for “dog stories” remind us of “Strongheart” and “Strongheart”— well ....
At any rate, there are twelve fine bits of prose, stories which prove to be completely enjoyable. We suggest for your perusal: the title story, “The Slower Judas,” “Empty Tables,” a charming tale of an Italian wine shop and of the domestic problems of its owner, and “The Road,” a very satisfying sketch which concerns itself with the property sense of a young Italian and of the nonsense of his English tenants.
All in all, Miss Stern’s latest book should prove more than satisfying to those who enjoy her prose—and we cannot understand how anyone could fail to enjoy it, unless, perhaps, a sad case of arrested development.	J. de R.
“CAWDOR,” by Robinson Jeffers; New York, 1928; Horace Liveright. $2.50.
This book, the fourth in twelve years from the pen of Robinson Jeffers, comprises the long narrative title poem, and several shorter expressions of an emotioned thought that has more of an affinity with the quiet depths of plant roots and rock fingers deep in the earth, than with anything, or things, of the fashionably poetic world.
“Cawdor” tells the story of an elderly Californian rancher and his unhappy marriage to a much younger wife; and ends in tragedy, with the aged protagonist tearing out his eyes and turning his back on the world. ’ '	• - •'
In the work there is a powerfully symbolic passage con. cerning the killing of a caged eagle which seems to have impressed some reviewers as perhaps the finest part of the whole poem.
The passage is, admittedly, exquisite; but, it seems to me, its full significance has, so far, eluded the grasp of its commentators; it is more than a remarkably fine stream of thought, more than a flow of poetic beauty; rather, in its spirit and gist it reveals an amazing seconding, actualizing, of the polished marmoreal admonitions contained in Elinoi* " Wylie’s “The Eagle and the Mole.”	~	-
The slender mortalities of both poets were fired by the red threads of genius that, very occasionally, flutter from the
sun and spear to flame the souls of earthly creatures. Once combustion occurs we have a body of work, in any medium of art, that gains for its author the name “genius.”
But the process of this sudden ignition can be described, adequately, only in sound; only in tonal groupings, fleetingly	,
fiery and solemnly moving as they may be, can we find fitting	>
picturing of the weaving of these threads.	J
And so, in Music, Robinson Jeffer’s moled and eagled H genius burrows and soars in Stravinsky’s “Fire Bird”; and Elinor Wylie’s earthwalking genius, that can only touch the ! mole beneath its feet, can only wave at the eagle above its >= head, dances to the jagged tempo of flame in de Falla’s “Fire Dance.”
The inevitable line of artistic demarcation between the 4 sexes finds a supreme illustration in the relative attitudes f j of these two poets; one, a man, can couple with the subsoil J and with the stars; the other, a woman, can only sing of < the beauties of such mari'iage; the feminine temperament is . j not so constituted as to be able to savour of extremes; it j may talk of them—but that is all.	'-j
The shorter poems in this book, on a variety of subjects, J are all tinged with their author’s elemental nature; in the , last one, “Meditation on Saviors,” Jeffers sees “unconsciousness” (death) as that occurrence which gives to mankind a .< certain modicum of dignity; one wonders if this paraphrase < of accepted death (as it is) is not, fundamentally, an un- 7 orthodox paraphrase of orthodox tenets? And, again, might | not the poet have something in common with established 7 religious thinking?	|
Mr. Jeffers is no longer “promising”; he has, quite | definitely, “arrived”—and, fortunately, he is not without • honor even in his own country. Which, in this age, is a consoling reflection!	—M. H. L.

Mr. J. Coran gave the first paper of the evening. His humorous prophesy as. to the future of the Pharmacy Club was thoroughly enjoyed by the members present. He showed what he thought the various members would be fifteen years from now. Mr. R. Schultze’s paper on Rejuvenation answered the question, “Can a worn out body be rejuvenated?” He cited experiments wherein glandular extracts were used but the results of these were most dissatisfying. Transplantation seems to provide only temporary rejuvenation. Other non-transplantation experiments seemed to have only fair success. The discouraging results so far obtained, together ■with the lack of energetic experimental work indicate that it will be many years before much advancement will be made in this field.

As he began to make his way through the mob that collects about the elevator between classes, a little freshman co-ed who could not wait until the grades came out, rushed up to him and drawing him to her with a startling Greta Garbo effect, asked him in a bird-like tone, 'Did I pass your course, and how much did I make?’
“The tall professor’s ears took on a hue which may be found on the inside of furnaces on cold winter days. He dismissed the fair young maiden with an air of unworldly renunciation as he murmured, T don’t know.’ ”

“Chatham stated that until he was twenty-two days old, he had a very sparse growth, but by the time he was in the ~ first grade, he was shaving three times a day. After giving J; $5 of the prize to one of his roommates for putting up with f him, and the other five-spot to-the other roommate for not stunting the growth of the beard by smoking, Chatham intends to donate the brush to summer quarter geology students.”	7

The decision was made after investigations showed that nearly all class officers failed to fulfill any particular duties, and that W the positions of vice-president, secretary, and treasurer were unnecessary. These offices were ordered to be discontinued by the student council.

The Notre Dame
Of Other Years
.	BY JOHN J. NANOVIC
THERE is a boat house on St. Joseph’s Lake that is deserted today, except in the warm early summer when the bathers make use of it. Some students venture a guess about its past, but very few are acquainted with the story of the Boat Races and commencement regattas of other years when the boat house sheltered a number of “rigs,” and the rooms above were used as club rooms by the boat club members. It is sixteen years since the rhythmic sweep of oars dipped into the lake, and the paths that furnish many an evening’s walk were “grandstand seats” for colorful boating events.
St. Joseph’s lake was used for boating not only by the students, but by various groups of the vicinity. In “The Scholastic Year,” the weekly university publication, forerunner of the Notre Dame Scholastic, “A Friend” submitted the following communication in the September 14, 1867, issue, the second one of the first volume:
“Why have not all the tars of Notre Dame taken to the water yet? Where is the fearless captain, Louis Moran, who commanded the Lady of the Lake on
our beautiful St. Joseph? Where is the pilot, G. Myers, and the well tried mate, James Scott? We understand that the captain will-return when the white fish of St. Claire River will give him leave of absence, and his mate, now owning a beautiful craft on Lake Michigan, when the bad weather sets in. We wish them a speedy return trip. In the meantime, it would be well for the surviving members of the St. Joseph Boating Club to get ready for some lake excursions during the Fall, and have the sails and riggings of their boat in repair at once.
“The Social Rowing Club seems, for the present, to have suspended all business. Their boat is laid up for repairs. More boats on the lake would be very desirable, as it would give us a chance to see some of those exciting races, so popular in our age. A few energetic men could do a great deal in the way of getting up the object desired.
“A Friend.”

The Boat House as it looks today—deserted and forlorn.
Whether by the insistence of “A Friend,” or in the natural course of events, at any rate a Boat Club was organized shortly afterward, and a note in the Scholastic g± September 23, 1871, tells us that “Two splendid sets of oars were received by the Boat Club a few days ago from T. Bagley, of Chicago. The club has not yet fully organized, but by the accession of new members, hope may be entertained that its success this year will be equal to that of preceding years. The boats have been nicely painted by Mr. T. R. Renshaw, and the boat house repaired and generally overhauled.” That the Boat Club was an important campus organization at the time is shown by a further comment in the same issue, “Chief-Justice Chase honored the Boat Club with his company aboard one of their boats and handled the stroke oar against Colonel Dunbar, bow oar. We must confess that as pilot, the Chief Justice did himself much more credit than as stroke oar. Pilot, he may win—stroke oar, he will not.” A year later, reports published the number of members of the Boat Club at twenty-two, and a year after that, hope was expressed for several boats to be added.
The early organization and development of the Boat Club owed much to the Reverend M. J. Regan, C.S.C., for twenty-three years Prefect of Disci-

held during the year, with the greatest one at commencement time. Because of certain conditions, however, the boating activities were limited. The size of St. Joseph’s lake prevented any long course, and the events usually consisted of the length of the lake and return. This required a special boat, and was the main reason why Notre Dame’s crews in the years of their existence held no meet with other schools which had the advantage of regulation courses and boats. The contests here were limited to teams selected from the students, and the winning crews were awarded anchors for their work. The crews enjoyed a duck dinner each year, the ducks coming from the flock that was on the lake. Among the oarsmen of these days mention may be made of former United States Congressman Timothy Ansburry, Judge Eggeman, prominent Indiana jurist, and former Congressman Nicholas Sinnott, of Oregon, who is now a judge of the United States Court of Appeals in Washington, D. C.
Interest in the races must have been equal to the interest shown in today’? major sporting events, as can be seen from this report of the commencement race in June, 1875:
“.The boat race which took place on the twenty-second was a very good one. Long before three o’clock, the time appointed for the race, the banks of the lake were thronged with ladies and gentlemen who took an interest in the contest of skill between the crews of the rival boats.
“A little while before three o’clock the judges and umpires took the places allotted to them; the ‘Minnehaha’ and the ‘Hiawatha’ were rowed out from the boat house;- and, greeted with cheers, took their positions. . . .
“The two boats started off in good style. Each had its favorites on the shore, who shouted to them words of encouragement. The race as arranged was the length of the lake and return; the boats made it in good time; the ‘Hiawatha’ coming in two lengths ahead, thus winning the race. The victorious crew were heartily cheered by the people. They worked well for the honor, and deserve it.”
In 1888, the reports refer to the Lemmonier Boat Club, mentioning two four-oared brigs, and two six-oared barges as belonging to the club'. The races and banquets were becoming bigger events each year, attracting considerable attention. In addition to the two boats named in the first race, the “Yosemite” and “Montmorency” were also mentioned.
Club notices of membership, improvements and additions, and the commencement regattas continued until the year 1906, and then there is an interval in which nothing is mentioned of the Boat Club until in October, 1908, when an effort to arouse interest in the club is made in an editorial:
“The boat house these days looks almost as deserted as Jerusalem did after-the trouble; it has maintained that air- for a long time, too—for four years, to be specific. True, two half-hearted attempts to rejuvenate the old time interest in crew work were made, both died in their infancy. A snappy regatta would be a most entertaining feature for commencement week, and October is none too early to put in some light fall practice.

AttKEfJINS THE ’’MICIAHI” 7
As a bit of impudent Phariseeism we commend a column of recent editorial adventure in the Columbian Spectator of Columbia University. The writer is lecturing President Charles L. O’Donnell for what he said about Notre Dame football and football athletes in his address to the New York alumni: and while slapping the local school for its athletic behavior the writer gives the greater New York institution cakes and a pond lily. Listen, brothers: “Certainly it would be highly out of order for us to suggest that some f of Rev. O’Donnell’s remarks should be taken with a grain of salt. Especially as far as the behavior of Notre Dame players just before the game is concerned, it might give readers of collegiate magazines a rude shock.” We could furnish you a carload of commendations about the good conduct of Notre Dame * players out of and in the game, but any man small enough to make a statement like the above is not big enough to retract it.	.
✓
“And there are those irreverent smarties among us who are tempted to say that without the ‘bubble’ of glory which surrounds the Notre Dame football team and attracts annually hundreds of thousands of fans to its contests, the stadium and law school might have remained a beautiful dream.” The stadium *■ would so remain undoubtedly. The law school would not. Whether we have or have not a football team we will have law students, and law students—having length, breadth and solidity—need lodgment. Besides we have had school buildings before we have had athletes, and of all the great schools in America we are the only one now without a stadium. We are not rich, Mr. Spectator. We have no very large endowment. We run on our work. What we have accomplished we have accomplished with our little all, and our little all has never been much in finances. But we will have a law school and dormitories and an engineering building, and let us hope, a commerce building. And the athletic returns will not pay for M them either. Because we have been building these physical additions to this plant even when athletic receipts were not equivalent to two cents per annum.
“The analogy of Notre Dame to Columbia is a negative one. The reputation of our football team is ‘ based on the prestige of the University, not on the number of formidable opponents it has conquered. *■ Notre Dame is trying to emerge from a football University into one of scientific renown. Columbia (at least, some of its members) are anxious to develop a football team from what is admittedly a University of supreme standing in America.” All of which of course is impudence and bad manners and an exhibition of bumptiousness one would not expect from a writer associated with a great school. But let it	s
stand as an example of how college papers may suffer when conducted by one who has never seen life	j
except through his high school windows. We could quote and quote and quote just one foolishness trip- * j ping after another that is still more foolish.
And then it comes to us that once—some centuries ago, long before we were—there was a great school	J
in a great city which excluded (we quote) “athletes of inadequate scholastic standing, a principle which	**•
—more than any other single factor—has kept Columbia from glory on the sport pages of the press. But both universities will have to make the important choice between scholastic and athletic fame. A combination of the two seems somehow impossible; even a happy medium is rare.”
And then there was a time several years ago when this great school wanted a coach and certain things were done which were not so academic. You know, there was a “choice between scholastic and athletic • fame.” And the scholastic had some trouble trying to explain itself when the great school of the greater city seemed more eager to build up a reputation for athletic rather than academic yardage.

64 A ND you say you want me to ring all the Smiths l\ until you find the one you want?” asked the
/“A operator.
“Yes, if you please,” replied George Bennett not a little embarrassed as to the way his request had been repeated.
“But it would take considerable time to make all the rings. Don’t you think you could get your party sooner by calling the information operator?”
“No I am afraid not. At least not in this case. I don’t know what Smith to ask for. You see—well all I know is that I want to locate a girl friend I met just recently at a dance. She told me to call her tonight but didn’t give me her number.”
“In that case you are up against circumstances, are you not?” asked the operator in a more interesting tone than she had previously adopted.
“Yes but I am willing to bargain. If you make these calls for me I will give you a box of Whitman’s best.”
“Fair enough,” agreed the operator, “we’ll start in right away.”
“Hello.”
“Hello, could I speak to Jane Smith please?”
“Who.”
“Miss Smith, if you please.”
“You surely haven’t the right connection. There are no Misses that live here. My daughters used to be but they have done got a past that.”
“Well I guess I have the wrong number. Thank you.”
“Hello.”
“Hello, would you call Jane to the telephone please ”
■ “Why, I didn’t know she was in town. Who is this talking?”
“This is George Bennett speaking. Miss Smith told me to ring her tonight.”
“Well this is certainly a surprise. But I’m sure she hasn’t been here and I don’t know where you can find her. You see she left here about three years ago and went back to Chicago right after she was married.”
“Well if that is the case—well there must be some mistake. The lady I have reference to isn’t married, I know. Sorry I have taken your time.”
“Having any luck?” asked the operator after George had finished his second call.
“No, not yet. The last call gave me a little encouragement at first, but then I found out there was a flaw in it and everything went on the rocks.”
“Well that will happen you know and especially when one is dealing with so many Smiths.”
“That’s true all right, and there are certainly enough of them in the directory. What do you say we try another, there are still eighteen left?”	'
“O. K. but in the meantime don’t forget your promise!”
“Hello, would you call Jane to the telephone?”
“There is no one here by the name of Jane.”
“This is Smith’s residence is it not?”
“No, you have the wrong line, this is Smith’s Drug store.”
“Well, that doesn’t matter particularly. Could you give me some information concerning Smith?”
“No, I don’t believe I can. The only acquaintance I have by that name is the proprietor here and the Smith Brothers —‘not a cough in a carload’—but you might get some information from any of the other Smiths.”
“Thank you very much. I’m sure I’ll find her.”
“Learn anything?”
“Nope, just like all the others. I’m still on the rocks.”
“Are you sure the girl you are inquiring about didn’t give you any number?”
“Yes, I’m positively sure. All she said was, ‘call me Thursday night between six and eight.’ ”
“Well, I am going to tune you in on the information operator.”
“But how in the world can she help me ?”
“You never can tell. They sometimes know a lot about names as Smith. And besides it is almost time for me to get off of work.”
“Information operator.”
“Did central tell you the party I am trying to get?” asked George when his connection had been changed.
“Hello.”
“Hello, who is this speaking?”	’
“This is Jane.”
“Well, for the love of—. I have been trying to call you some time. This is George, you know you told me to ring tonight. What are you doing? Could I come out or—”
“Why most certainly you can come out. As for my doing, I have been trying to fulfill the promise I made to you a little over twenty minutes ago, I’ll be off of duty in about five minutes.”
“The promise?”
“Yes, you haven’t forgotten already I hope?”
“Oh yes, well no not exactly. I was just thinkin’ you—. And you say you will be off duty in five minutes ?”	-
“Yes, its five till eight now. I’ll see you in front of the telephone office. And.incidentally while you are on your way here you might bring the box of Whitman’s Samples.”

Muddy Water
TED. J. RYAN
THE monstrosity! The inconcinnity! The preposterousness! The. . . the . . . the very idea! Perhaps I anr naturally somewhat hypercritical. . . I don’t know ... if only it hadn’t been raining ... if the weather really was nice, no doubt I would have thought nothing about it, but as it was . . .
The snow was still several inches deep in most places— dirty, soot-speckled, mucky snow that had been tracked and trampled for weeks. Sidewalks with their supercoat of watery ice were far better suited for skating than for walking A fine rain, like a shower in April, (such things are common in Indiana) drizzled its way from the heavy skies, and a thick vapor, like the white smoke from burning leaves, damply stifled the earth. From opposite directions two thoroughbred Hoosiers approached, and in passing greeted each other thus:
“Good morning.”
“Beautiful!” .
Imagine my nausea! Picture my disconcertion! Was ever a tiling more ridiculous? More paradoxical?
Perhaps “if God sends rain, then rain’s my choice” is the aphorism of Hoosierdom, and certainly it is grand to be optomistic, but still I see no reason for calling the good bad, or the unpleasant beautiful.
The opinions regarding Indiana weather are somewhat diversified here on the campus of the You-immerse-ity of Notre Dame of the Lake. It is quite natural, of course, that the opinions of the aspiring shipmen of Sop’em-o’er and Fresh-main halls should be prejudiced somewhat, since their ternary marches to the dinings halls involve the utmost in aquatic skill. However- we find the opinions of the nautical
aspirants of Moorish-sea and Lines the least adverse. That is quite natural, though, since the Lazy Landlubbers have advantages of terra firma brought about by a nearer contact with sidewalks and pavements.
My old friend Joe Overshoe of Walsh hall says he’d “just as soon have no -weather at alC as have this of Indiana.” Joe is a P. G. (Professor of Gondoliology) and is being recognized more and more as one of the world’s greatest seamen. I notice, too, that several of the Able Oarsmen of Shore-in hall_have changed the traditional “Hello men” to a more appropriate “Hi mates”! Adaptation! That’s it. Nature is adaptation.
The chief promoters of the peace and general welfare in Northern Indiana are fearful lest a sudden appearance of the sun should throw the natives into a chaotic lethargy of some sort wherein a fear for the arrival of Doom’s Day would be the most predominant characteristic. Of course, it is hardly rational to think of the sun coming out here in Indiana, but, though very improbable, such a thing is, after all, extrinsically possible and a reasonable cause for anxiety.
There is an old Indian tale of a somewhat legendary character which tells us that once upon a time, several hundred years ago, the sun (believe it or not) actually did shine on these verdant hunting grounds. And the Webb Feet Indians, who occupied the country were terror stricken. The story goes on to say that the savages stared in awe at the fiery thing until their eyes became weakened and they, everyone, had to wear glasses forever afterward!
Friends! Romans! Ears! Lend me your countrymen! Spread the news! Paul Revere it around a bit. Let’s not have any such calamity here at Notre Dame.
Ecstasy
RAOUL CONNOR
IT had been a dull day, starting off wrong. I had missed breakfast, the meal which, when made, lends a different aspect to the whole day, but which, when missed, causes life to assume a deeper gloom. My “eight” had been boring. In my ten o’clock class a quiz had been given concerning problems of which I had but the faintest notion. The afternoon had started off rather auspiciously. Dinner had been wholly tolerable, and in the first class of the afternoon the prof only gave us thirty questions to do. With the ringing of the bell for my 2:15 class the momentary elation waned, and it was only through the greatest exertion of will that I managed to sit through the fifty long minutes.
Then the miracle happened! Returning to the hall after the 2:15 class, disconsolate and dejected, I happened to yawn —and straightway the world assumed a- more joyous hue. The sun peaked out; the birds started chirping (or whatever it is that birds do); the snow thawed perceptibly. I became a magician, a man possessed of diabolic powers which were denied to other men. For a brief moment I paused to ob
serve the passing throng of ordinary humans with a feeling akin to pity. What object had they in life? They pursued their pathless way from the beginning to the end of breath. In contrast to this the magician not only had a definite object in life, but he attained the goal which he had set for himself.
The cigarette was burning short. The smoke from it filled my eyes. The spell of the moment was broken. I took the cigarette from my mouth and started to cast it away negligently, but an impulse prompted me to stay my hand; and in response to the promptings of this impulse I carefully ground out the flame and placed the charred butt in my pocket. That butt became a' magician’s wand to me, symbolic of the time when I first discovered that I was a magician. .
Oh yes! We’re a bit off the track of our story. To return to it—I yawned and the cigarette in my mouth adhered to my lower lip.

Diamonds or Glasses
W. RICHARD LAUGHLIN
HERE was a man that caused you to wonder, one look at his lean angular face with a sort of peaked nose and compressed lips and you knew he carried many things in his mind that would be interesting to hear, ' his eyes too, with their cold, grey, far-away look impressed you that sometime in his life, some incident, probably of importance had stamped itself in his mind and he couldn’t erase that sub-conscious memory of it.
His clothes were contradictory to his features for he wore ’ a plain gray suit, neatly pressed; it bespoke a man of the business world; he should have been clothed in the garb of a seaman.
It took but a few seconds to make this mental inventory of the man as he stood before me.
• A minute elapsed before he spoke and when he did it was . with a low, yet soothing voice, the kind that a minister assumes when addressing a group of children.
“I wish to see your showing of diamond brooches, something different,” he said.
“Yes sir, certainly sir,” I answered, “brooches, of course.” . I led the way back to about the middle of the store where we keep our exceptionally fine jewelry and taking a few trays of brooches from the case, lay them before him, I didn’t think to use the usual sales talk on him and even if I had,
it probably wouldn’t have done any good, he wasn’t the type to be sold by a stereotyped sales talk.
The stranger examined them for a short time and then selecting an attractive one, he picked it up.
“What is the price of this?” He asked.
I realized that something must be wrong, the price was plainly marked on each brooch, every article in our store being marked the same way as Mi-. Devore was very particular about that detail of the business. I looked up and the minute I saw his face I was chilled. You know the feeling; his eyes, already narrow, had thinned down to two slits and he had a peculiar sort of smile on his face. I couldn’t help but notice that the expression complimented him.
Many thoughts entered my mind, was this man a thief, did he intend to burglarize the store, or was he a maniac? I had been reading so much about crime recently and I pictured the headlines in tomorrow’s paper, Large Uptown Jeic-elry Store Robbed—Clerk Murdered; this pleasant mind picture brought me back to realities and I realized I must act quickly if I was to foil this marauder. I looked about in a helpless way and the thought to tell him the price never entered my mind, so intent was I on determining this strange man’s intentions.
He spoke again, “what is the price of this please, my eyesight is nearly gone and I left my glasses at home.”
On Ferryboats
JAMES J. WALSH
SOME slight fragrance of old New York, a New York of horse-cars, Tweed politics, and dinners at the Waldorf, still clings to the ferries that ply the waters of the Bay. Forty-second Street is no longer “uptown,” and society has emigrated from brown stone fronts to suffocating Park Avenue apartments, but one still travels to Hoboken on the ferry, and, it may be remarked, returns in the same manner. The service is undeniably poor and the accommodations similar to those of a Nineteenth Century cattle boat, but for that real, honest-to-goodness, “down-to-the-sea-in-ships” feeling, I’ll pick a ferryboat every time. Here, beauty hides behind greasy accouterments, and romance masquerades in the guise of the utterly prosaic. A “Bagdad-on-the-Subway” is all very fine, but I wouldn’t trade the friendly arms of a ferry slip for all the modern catacombs in the world.
To tell the truth, I have always felt that the ferry is a world apart, an unaccepted Utopia. On its broad, receptive bosom, men of all classes and nations melt into a single, simple verity. There are the inevitable musicians, squat, swarthy men, with soft, liquid Italian eyes still mirroring the blue skies of Naples and the crystal waters of the Mediterranean. Tiny, dirty, and altogether lovable ragamuffins scramble in mad confusion to black the shoes of the Wall Street broker. Swedish bakers, Irish sailors, and Hungarian pretzel venders crowd the deck. Complacent suburbanites gaze anxiously at well-thumbed time tables, irritably at a passing barge, and curse softly at the prospects of a cold dinner. Only the ferry is undisturbed, supremely indifferent, playing the tortoise in the glorious
rush of progress. I smile. You see, I’m slightly amused at it all; but then I’ve had my dinner.
It’s a curious sort of call they have, these ungainly water bugs. Low, mournful, with a peculiar sobbing resonance, the tone is heartrending, unique. Surely with such a call must Charon summon his fares. Over the water rolls the sound. Perhaps it penetrates the confined fastness of a down-town office. A clerk hears it and looks up and dreams. The boss sees him. To-morrow he will lose his job. Perhaps it reaches a dingy tenement room. A sleeper stirs, wakens, stares with mascara-lidded eyes at a battered clock. Perhaps youth hears the sound and laughs; age hears it and weeps. I hear it—and think.	’
Life is inseparable from its tragedies. Not, of course, that I contemplate existence with a jaundiced eye or- with gall and wormwood in my heart. On the contrary, it is the very optimism of sorrow that lightens my passage between the two Unknowns. The brightest day will always dawn tomorrow, and the sweetest story has never yet been told. The ferry has seen many to-morrows, not all of them bright, and it has heard many stories, not all of them sweet. So it knows life, earnest pulsating life; it knows tragedy, dark and relentless. For many it has been the gateway to death. For others, the ferry has opened the door to happiness. Scented love parades the deck at night, under.the stars. And so it goes.
The great fun of any journey always lies in the departure and arrival, and it is in this respect that a ferry trip is far superior to an ocean voyage. An ocean voyage becomes excessively boring, not to say sickening, after a few

The Notre Dame Scholastic
days on the water. A ferry trip, however, is always delightful. There is the excitement of boarding the boat, fifteen minutes of salt-air tang, the colorful activity of a busy harbor, a jangle of bells, and the trip is finished. Behold, an inexpensive yet concentrated Cook’s tour. There are those—I feel the guilty crimson flush my cheek—who remain on one boat making as many return trips as they deem necessary to satisfy their almost insatiable desire for this famous outdoor sport. This is most pleasant—and convenient. Consider the fares one saves.
Then there is the subject of driftwood; driftwood has always intrigued me. It is so unresisting, so passionless, heavy, sodden, decayed. Bump into it and it doesn’t move. Brush it aside and it is passive. It drifts with the current, going nowhere, getting nowhere. Eventually it becomes waterlogged and sinks—and is not missed. There is a man slouched beside me against the rail of the ferry, slovenly, unkempt, a vagabond of the city. When we dock he does not move. A deckhand sees him and orders him off. He
----------,-------* *
goes—uncomplaining. Where? No one knows, and he himself least of all. For he, too, is driftwood. Soon he will sink, softly, without a trace. Life little heeds the passage of a solitary atom—there are so many.
A ferry is, indeed, interesting enough in the daytime, but at night it is a floating fragment of beauty. On a summer evening, the tall stacks, and the slender tapering masts of the boat silhouette themselves against the jeweled purple of the sky. Rubies and emeralds hang overhead, and to the left and right, the water is shot with golden gleams. To feel the soft caress of air on your- cheek, to catch the scent of distant ports, ah, this is adventure, beauty, happiness. See the city, basically grim and powerful, but topped with delicate spires and blazing with a million points of brilliance. Wonderful, ecstatic—but wait! This beauty has a cause. That distant brilliance falls upon the wan faces of weary scrubwomen who wash the floors of the marts of commerce. Infinity has become pathetically finite.

“To it come visitors from the four corners of the earth. There is no language that is not spoken in this horizontal Tower of Babel. This motley throng is chiefly composed of writers, of painters, of sculptors, of models, French and foreign, besides the usual hangers-on of the army of Art.”
He sees much in the doings of the “mad bad glad sad” Quarter that is sinister. The following is an unfair—because extreme—example of what is set down as deplorable, even though amusing, in the new Art:
“Ronald Dorgeles, the writer, carried out the farce of attaching a paint brush to the tail of a donkey, of letting it swish colors on a canvas, and of labeling the result ‘Sunset on the Adriatic.’ The picture was hung in the Salon and was admired by the critics.”
Another:
Picasso made a sketch of packing cases of various sizes on the banks of the Seine. What should he call it? He had an inspiration. He entitled it ‘Portrait of My Father.’ Thus began the craze for eccentric portraits composed of fiddles, cube-sugar, and newspapers.”
Despite the follies of the practitioners of Art, Huddle
ston conceives a possible future when their incoherencies will evolve into something understandable, and great. He bases his contention on their everlasting dissatisfaction with what is pedantic or paltry, on their aspiration toward something greater than has ever been done before, and on the fact that they unceasingly live up to the keyword of the Quarter, which is Try.
Similarly he points out much that is good in the work of the modern writers. The movements, Dadaism, Surrealism, Unanimism, and the other group vagaries, are phases which quickly—and happily—pass, but which in disintegrating leave a sediment of their best thought which is of permanent value to Literature. Joyce, in spite of his eccentrities, is the best of the moderns, and proves the worthiness of the whole movement. It is interesting to note that Huddleston, intimate of practically all literateurs whose light has shone, whether ever so feebly or with blinding brilliance, during thirty years, considers Hilaire Belloc the master of them all. Huddleston favors the traditional in Literature, and therefore his choice is perhaps indicative of that in contemporary letters which is most likely to be traditional itself one day.
The book is only partially concerned with Art: it is chiefly concerned with artists. Even though one disregards, as no doubt many will, the author’s opinions of the product of his subjects, the book is highly valuable for its galaxy of swift pen-portraits of the great in contemporary Literature and Painting.' They are all excellently done, and are generously interlarded with revealing anecdotes. Especially notable for their amazing clarity of characterization are the sections devoted “staccatto” Ezra Pound, “Red” (Sinclair) Lewis, Paul Claudel, Sherwood Anderson, “soft-eyed, silent, a dreamer,” and Hilaire Belloc, “a tramp to European police,” Sarah Bernhardt, the supreme artist, always courageous, is there, as are Isadora Duncan, Anna Pavlowa, and a multitude of others.
Paris Salons, Cafes, Studios,—it is truly a mixture—une coquetele Parisienne of the Cocktail Epoch—a glittering glassful of gossip, with an infiltration of critical observation and a dash of high wit, and impregnated with the romance of Paris. ' _	. '

Northwestern Bows to Notre Dame on Track
Warne Sets New Pole Vault Record as Nicholson ’s Charges Smother Wildcats, 55 1-3 to 30 2-3
Registering their most decisive triumph of the current season, the Blue and Gold trackmen came within a few points of doubling the total of their Purple opponents, last Saturday night in the University gym. The final score was Notre
CAPTAIN ELDER
Dame, 55 1-3; Northwestern, 30 2-3. However, in spite of the comparative measure of victory, the meet was highly interesting and replete with thrills at all times. Several of the events assumed the aspect of an intra-team affair with Blue and Gold men waging bitter duels for. first honors. The dash, shot put, and two mile run, events in which the home team scored clean sweeps, were particularly unique in this respect.
The outstanding feat of the evening was achieved by Tom Warne, the visitors’ pole-vaulting ace, who soared gracefully over the bar at the height of
13 feet, 3 3-8 inches. This phenomenal accomplishment bettered the former gym record of 12 feet, 10 inches, set by Glazer of Marquette in 1927. The height was first announced as thirteen feet, six inches, but subsequent measurement by the judges fixed the mark a few inches lower at the point which is now the official record. Two of Warne’s team-mates, Klarr and Ingle, tied with Slattery of Notre Dame for second place.
In the course of this scoring avalanche, the Blue and Gold athletes won seven of the scheduled ten events. Besides walking away with the dash, shot put, and two-mile run, they chalked up first and second places in the high hurdles and in the mile run, along with first and thirds in the quarter mile run and in the high jump. Assuming an impressive lead from the first event, they were never headed nor seriously menaced by their guests, who fought stubbornly but unsuccessfully all the way.
Harry Sylvester, of Notre Dame, also romped to a splendid victory -in the 880, overtaking his team-mate, Quigley, who had assumed a short lead at the start, in the back stretch of the final lap, and breasting the tape several feet ahead of Captain Gorby, Northwestern’s star middle-distance runner. Referee Lightbody, however, forfeited all three places to the visitors, alleging that the Blue and Gold
runners had been unnecessarily rough in “boxing” Captain Gorby and Ralfe Wolfe several times during the race.
The mile relay was another thrill-producer. O’Connor, running first for Notre Dame, led his rival, McAuliffe, to the tape in the first relay by a good five yards. But Fox, of the Purple team, assumed the lead in the next relay, and thereafter Northwestern was always in front. Kelly, the Irish anchor man, ran a beautiful quarter in the final relay, but was unable to match Gorby’s powerful sprint in the home stretch and lost by several yards.
A number of new stars were uncovered during the evening’s performance. Boagni ran a’ remarkable race in the sixty-yard dash, Captain Elder taking second place, with Nichols third. “Nordy” Hoffman won the shot put, although Herwit came within a few inches of first place. Conlin, a monogram man from last year, won the high hurdles, hard-pressed by O’Brien, who has been the best point-getter of Notre Dame hurdlers this year. “Bob” Brennan turned in the commendable time of 4:30 1-5 in the mile run; while Vaichulis, stocky little newcomer, covered the two-mile event within fourteen seconds of record time. Tom Quigley repeated the splendid achievements of other meets by winning a gruelling quarter-mile race from McAuliffe, of the visitors. Summaries:

NOTRE DAME BEATS MICHIGAN STATE IN TWO OVERTIME PERIODS, SCORE 28-27 A replica of the Michigan State-Notre Dame game here last year was enacted in the Spartan gym at Lansing last Friday night and the Blue and Gold were forced into two extra periods before they succeeded in eking out a well-
•	deserved 28-27 triumph over their fighting hosts.
». Notre Dame jumped into a three point lead in the opening minutes of the game, but the Spartans soon found the basket with two field goals. From then on the game seesawed, neither team gaining an advantage of more than foui-points at any time. Col rick, flashy Notre Dame tip-off man, led the scoring for the Blue and Gold in the first half with
•	four two pointers.- The half ended with the score tied at y 13 to 13.
Both teams tried desperately to gain a substantial lead in the second half, but their efforts were futile. The regular playing period ended with the score 24 to 24.
The first overtime period found both bombarding the basket furiously. Haga, Sparton guard, registered first, and , with only a fraction of a minute to play, Donovan, Notre Dame guard, found the basket from the middle of the floor ; tying the score. Donovan repeated in the final ovei’time period with the winning basket while Michigan State could collect but a single point by virtue of a free throw.
Michigan State made seven of the thirteen free throws and Notre Dame scored six out of twelve. Co-captain Crowe was removed from the game with four personal fouls and his place was taken by McCarthy.
_	Donovan and Colrick were the outstanding pointmakers
for the Irish, while Haga and Dickinson starred for Michigan State. Summary:

CAGERS SUBDUE SCRAPPY DETROIT QUINT *	WITH 18-16 SCORE
A fighting University of Detroit quint displayed unexpected strength in its own gym Saturday, February 23, and # the Blue and Gold players were extended to the limit to nose out the Automobile City outfit with a close 18-16 score. A sensational rally in the last few minutes of play in which » they came within two points of tying the score, featured the play of the Vikings.
Led by Colrick, Notre Dame center, the visitors easily obtained a comfortable lead in the opening half. During , this period Detroit, who had been handed a severe lacing a few weeks back by the Keoganites, concentrated most of its ■ attention on endeavoring to break up the opposing attack. At half time the score gave Notre Dame a five point margin, 12 to 7.	'
Detroit came back in the second half with a fierce attack which forced Notre Dame into the defensive. ’ This rally
was lead by Dawson and Aaron who together gathered nine, points. Twenty-five fouls were called during the 'contest, thirteen on Notre Dame and twelve on Detroit. Donovan and Smith, Notre Dame guards, were ejected from the game with four personal fouls each.
Co-captain Crowe and Colrick -were the outstanding performers for the Irish. Summary:

MARQUETTE AND BUTLER ONLY REMAINING FOES ON BASKETBALL SCHEDULE
Tomorrow night Coach Keogan’s basket-tossers will engage in the semi-final contest of the 1929 season, having the Marquette quintet as their guests. In the previous encounter of these two years, Notre Dame emerged the victor by a 29-27 score. Upon that occasion, the plucky Hilltoppers fought stubbornly to restrain their visitors’ high-powered scoring tendencies. Their defensive ability has been the outstanding phase of then* play all this year; and this element is expected to play an important part in to-morrow’s return engagement.
The Blue and Gold eagers will conclude their season next Friday, March 8, with the Butler game, always a most interesting and uncertain battle. Except for a close 24-21 defeat that -was administered to them at Indianapolis a few weeks ago by Notre Dame, the Bulldogs have lost but one game. Incidentally, they number among their victims the mighty Pittsburgh five in an early-season game. A certain degree of sentiment will also be attached to this final struggle, in as much as it will mark the last time that such veterans as Crowe, Jachym, Colrick, and Bray will play together as a Notre Dame team.

BATTING AND INFIELD DRILLS FEATURE VARSITY BASEBALL PRACTICE
Under the watchful eye of Head Coach Tommy Mills, the varsity baseball men have reached the batting and infield practice stage in their daily work-outs in the gym. An unusually large number of candidates answered Coach Mills’ call this year, and with the help of his assistants he has found it possible to devote more time than usual to the many new men that have reported. Assisting Mr. Mills in his capacity as head coach, are such noted baseball figures as “Big Ed” Walsh, famous hurler for the Chicago White Sox some years ago and at present coach of the same club; his son, Ed Walsh, Jr., star pitcher on last season’s Blue and Gold varsity, who immediately joined the White Sox after his graduation; Richard “Red” Smith, captain and catcher on the 1927 Notre Dame team, who is now with the Boston Braves; and Joe Sullivan, leader and stellar key-stone guardian of the 1928 nine.
Jachym, Rust, Donohoe, Bob Walsh, Dorwin, and “Lefty” Buckley of last years’ pitching staff have reported, -while Joe Lordi, John Law, and Lawrence Mason, 1928 catchers,

After long and profound research, the senior scientist announced, "Gentlemen, we might as well conclude this inquiry. I have just discovered that this is a duck’s egg!”
There’s another futile argument, too, that might as well be cut short. That is, whether mildness or taste comes first in the choice of a cigarette. The answer should be easy, for while merely mild cigarettes are as numerous (and as
undistinguished) as taxicabs, the cigarettes that can deliver richness, flavor and hearty relish are so few that you can count them on one finger.
Not that Chesterfields aren’tmild, too. Smooth tobaccos smoothly blended make them so. And these same tobaccos give up all their spice and mellowness to one full, perfect flavor. It is this, and this alone, that satisfies!

It is indeed a pity that one can’t find this good smoke in every place of the seven seas. While recently in Germany, my home-country, I tried in vain to come upon one of these little blue tins. I’m not saying too much in mentioning that I would outwalk that famous mile, hunting up dear Edgeworth. I dare say there is no other tobacco like it, and am convinced that Edgeworth cannot be improved.
Let me know when you contemplate ceasing to make Edgeworth so that I may lay in a goodly store'to last till I’m seventy.
May Edgeworth never change!
I’ll always remain

Generating Brain Power
BRAIN power, not horsepower, is the chief operating requirement of the
electrical industry.
You will see this monogram on the powerful motors of an electric locomotive and on the convenience outlet whereyou plug in a floor lamp— always and everywhere it is a safe guide to electrical quality and dependability.
This requirement must be continuously anticipated to provide leaders for the future. Accordingly, each year, more than 400 picked college graduates come to the General Electric Company for a post-graduate course in electrical science.
With a faculty including inventors and engineers of international distinction, something more than electrical knowledge is imparted to these young men. Here they also find inspiration which prepares them for leadership in this electrical age.

General view of the United States Military Academyt West Pointy N. 1.

ROBABLY no single spot in this country is more widely known ■^than West Point, where our future army commanders receive their education and training in the arts of war. t
As an army post in the Revolution, West Point’s fortifications were the works that Benedict Arnold attempted to deliver into the hands of the British. Later the United States Military Academy was established and is now composed of magnificent buildings, parade grounds and athletic fields.
It is a source of pride to the Otis organization that most of the famous buildings of the world are equipped with Otis Elevators and West Point is no exception to this rule; five Otis Elevators are installed in various buildings of the Academy.
Throughout the world, in far-off places and at home in familiar surroundings, we find that people everywhere depend upon Otis for safe, speedy Vertical Transportation.
