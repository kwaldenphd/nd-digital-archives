Gentlemen:
The tobacco samples you sent me have been received, and they are great.
If you can picture in your mind the lonesomeness of a traveling man in a small town on a rainy night, not a friend in a hundred miles, nothing to do and no place to go:
That was the position I was in when your samples of Edgeworth came. It was like a voice from above when I opened the package and got the old pipe steaming.
I have smoked various brands of tobacco for the past fifteen years, but never in my life have I found a tobacco at any price that will equal Edgeworth. It does not bite the tongue, and a beautiful aroma follows. With the good old friend pipe and a can of Edgeworth you can dream of the rainbow's end.
Please count me in the future as an Edgeworth booster.
Very truly,
(Signed) Al Stanley

Alfred Emanuel Smith 1929 Laetare Medallist
The University of Notre Dame announces the award of the Laetare Medal for the year 1929 to the Honorable Alfred E. Smith, former governor- of the state of New York. The award of this medal is made annually to some lay-Catholic of the United States, who has achieved such distinction in his field of special endeavor as reflects glory upon the Catholic Faith. Notable service to religion, philosophy, science, literature, art, or to any other worthy activity of life or division of knowledge, as well as distinguished service to our country in public life, are among the reasons determining the selection and bestowal of this honor. The long and honorable public career of former Governor Alfred E. Smith, as well as the fine example of his private family life, are known and admired by the entire American people. These public and private virtues are inseparable from the man’s sterling Catholicity. Therefore, in the choice of this latest recipient of the Laetare Medal, the University feels that the end for which this honor was established is fittingly served.
As the Democratic nominee for President of the United States in the recent presidential election, as Governor of the State of New York for eight years, and as a public servant who has given unstintingly of his best at all times for over twenty-five years, former GovernorSmith is a familiar figure to the American people. Born and reared in the so-called “slums” of New York, the Lower East Side, educated in parochial schools, but mostly in the “school of hard-knocks,” by force of ability and courage he fought himself up from an humble assistant truck driver to the highest gift within the power of the citizens
of tire State of New York to bestow, the governorship. And after- serving four times as governor, more terms than any other chief executive has ever served in New York State, and because of his record of constructive statesmanship, he was selected by one of the two major political parties to be its standard bearer in the last presidential campaign. He lost, but not until he had waged one of the most gallant fights in American political history against terrific odds.
This year’s Laetare Medallist has lived in New York City his whole life, except for the eight years he spent in the governor’s mansion at Albany. He was born December-30, 1873, the son of Alfred Emanuel Smith, senior, and Catherine Mulvihill Smith, both descendants of early Irish immigrants to this country. His father, an humble truck driver, died in 1887, when young Alfred was only thirteen years old. Two years later the lad was forced to withdraw from school and begin work as an assistant to a truck driver. Later-on he became an office boy, then a shipping clerk in an oil factory, until finally in 1892 he became a combination salesman and assistant bookkeeper in the Fulton Street Fish Market. After several years spent in this work Mr. Smith accepted employment as receiving clerk and laborer with a
HOX. ADFRED E. SMITH
steam pump company. From 1895 to 1903 he was a subpoenaserver in the office of the Commissioner of Jurors, until he was nominated and elected to the New York State Assembly in the latter year.
His rise in the Assembly was rapid. Early becoming a member of important committees, he rose to become the Democratic leader in 1911, and in 1915 was singularly honored by being elected Speaker in spite of the fact that he belonged to the minority party.
Mr. Smith was a delegate to the State Constitutional Convention in 1915, and later in the same year was elected Sheriff of New York County. After serving as president of the Board of Aidermen of New York City in 1917 he was nominated by the Democrats of the state the next year to be governor. He was elected and served as governor until 1920, when he was defeated for re-election in the wake of the Harding landslide which swept the country that year. Nathan L. Miller, who defeated Governor Smith in 1920, was his opponent again in the 1922 election, Mr. Smith winning out in the election by the largest margin of votes that a candidate for governor has ever received in New York. In spite of the state going Republican with President Coolidge in the national election of 1924, Governor Smith was popular- enough with his constituents to be again re-elected to the governor’s chair. The Governorwon for the fourth time in 1926 over Ogden L. Mills, Republican nominee, and served as the Chief Executive of the state until January 1st last, when he retired in favor of Franklin D. Roosevelt after refusing to run a fifth time for the
office. His nomination and participation in the last presidential campaign is still fresh in the mind of every citizen.
Perhaps former Governor Smith’s most notable single achievement while in office was his thorough reorganization of the New York State governmental machinery. During his first term he inaugurated policies of reorganization which put the state government in a highly efficient working order, infinitely more so than it had been before he assumed the reins. The furtherance of constructive legislation for the improvement of housing conditions, particularly those in the poorer sections of the larger cities of the state; for the improvement of child welfare and labor, and for the creation of an adequate state park system, were other high-lights of his four terms as governor—high-lights which reflect in a measure the great humanitarianism of the man.
The entire nation is familiar with former- GovernorSmith’s record as a statesman, a record that stands as an imperishable civic monument to a man whose every act reflected his honesty, his sincerity, and his fearlessness. But few Catholics are familiar with the sterling Catholicity of the man, however, a Catholicity that he has lived up to in every sense of the word.
The Notre Da
e During the last presidential campaign enemies of the A Church tried in vain to unearth some utterance of his, or • some act that he had committed which would detract from * his reputation as an upright and an outstanding Catholic citizen. They found his reputation so impeccable that at ’ every turn they struck their heads against the stone wall of his proven civic and moral righteousness. •
v	Former Governor Smith learned his religion at his moth-
■f er’s knee, and from the priests and teachers of the parochial schools he attended while a boy. He has faithfully lived up to his religion in word and deed, throughout his whole life. He is a frequent communicant, a member of several Catholic societies, and has always been a generous contributor to Catholic charities. The following quotation from his famous ' reply to Mr. Charles L. Marshall’s demand that he make >' himself clear on his position relative to the temporal powe'r of the Catholic Church, illustrates better than many paragraphs the profound Catholicity of Mr. Smith. He says, “I summarize my creed as an American Catholic. I believe in the worship of God according to the faith and practice of the Roman Catholic Church. I recognize no power in the
. institutions of my Church to interfere with the operations of the Constitution of the United States or the enforcement of the law of the land. I believe absolute freedom of conscience for all men and in equality of all churches, all sects u and all beliefs before the law as a matter of right and not as a matter of favor. I believe in the absolute separation
- of Church and State and in the strict enforcement of the provisions of the Constitution that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting
- the free exercise thereof. I believe that no tribunal of any church has any power to make any decree of force in the law of the land, other* than to establish the status of its own communicants within its own church. I believe in the 3 support of the public school as one of the corner stones of American liberty. I believe in the right of every parent to choose whether his child shall be educated in the public school or in a religious school supported by those of his own faith. I believe in the principle of non-interference by this country
me Scholastic	631
in the internal affairs of other nations and that we should stand steadfastly against any such interference by whomsoever it may be urged. And I believe in the common brotherhood of man under the common fatherhood of God.” There is nothing unusual in this statement of Mr. Smith’s. It is a pronouncement, the tenor of which would have been made by any other Catholic called upon in a similar way. But coming as it did from a man who was a candidate for the Presidency of the United States it was given a wide publicity. These few sentences better than any other that he has ever written or uttered express in a nut-shell just why he was honored by Notre Dame when the University conferred the Laetare Medal upon him for this year.
Former Governor Smith is the forty-seventh recipient of the Laetare Medal. Since 1883 the University has annually honored some outstanding member of the American laity by conferring the medal upon him in recognition of achievements as a reputable citizen and as a distinguished Catholic. The medal is called the Laetare Medal because it is awarded on Laetare Sunday, the fourth Sunday of Lent.
The Laetare Medallist was selected this year for the honor by a Laetare Medal committee appointed by the Reverend Charles L. O’Donnell, C.S.C., president of the University. The personnel of the committee was as follows: the Reverend Michael A. Mulcaire, C.S.C., vice-president of Notre Dame; the Reverend Matthew J. Walsh, C.S.C., former president of the University; the Reverend Patrick J. Carroll, C.S.C., former vice-president of the University; the Reverend Thomas A. Steiner, C.S.C., dean of the College of Engineering at Notre Dame; the Reverend J. Hugh O’Donnell, C.S.C., prefect of discipline at the University; Mr. Edward J. Maurus, professor of mathematics; Mr. Jose A. Caparo, professor* of electrical engineering; Mr. Henry B. Froning, professor of chemistry; Mr. Burton Confrey, associate professor of English; and Mr. Vincent F. Fagan, assistant professor of architecture.

BRAUTIGAN APPOINTED K. C. SPRING FORMAL CHAIRMAN
George Brautigan, a senior in the School of Liberal Arts" at the University, and prominent member of the Notre Damp K. of C. Council for the past two years, has been appointed
General Chairman of the Spring Formal of the local council, according to an official bulletin issued last Saturday, March 2, by Grand Knight Edward McKeown. Mr. Brautigan has long been prominently identified in all the activities of the Council, having held both the offices of Treasurer, and Deputy Grand Knight. It was because of his previous services that the Grand Knight selected him as the most capable and best fitted man for the chairmanship.
The dance has been one of
the outstanding events on the spring social calendar for- the last several years, as it has been an annual affair since the council was organized in 1910. This year it will be held on April 19th. The orchestra has not yet been selected, but several of the best known bands in the middle west are under consideration. The usual procedure will be followed in the distribution of tickets, each member of the council being-allowed two pasteboards.
Mr. Brautigan announces that the various committeemen to assist him in conducting the affair, will be selected in a" few days; and that only those who are active in the support of the Council in the initiation of the next class are eligible for appointment.

MUSIC AND DRAMA
1
The University Band played a program of ten numbers Monday night in Washington Hall. If the small audience is to be taken as a criterion of the quality of the music, the outlook would be discouraging; but the technique of the individual band men, however, as well as the effect of the whole ensemble was on a par with' the best musical organizations heard here this season.	.
Two marches opened the first part of the program, in a style for which the band is best noted—spirited, martial tempo. The numbers were “With the Colors” and “Senn Triumphal.” The “Intermezzo,”
virgil cline.	by DeLuca followed; in this
Vice-president of the Band	banc{ displayed a fine
tone associated generally with orchestras rather than bands. Gounod’s “Ave Maria” likewise showed delicate handling on the part of the entire personnel. “Dance of the Teddy Bears,” a lively number- by Weidt, and an overture by King, ‘•'Fountain of Youth,” concluded the first part of the concert. The popularity of the second part of the program is evident when the selections and composers are considered. “March of the Blues,” which blends the wierd strains of jazz melodies into military time and “Washington Post,” both arranged by Sousa, composed the first number. A group of favorites from the most popular American composer, Victor Herbert, included “Kiss Me Again,” “I’m Falling in Love With Someone,” “Gypsy Love Song,” “Italian Street Song,” and “March of the Toys.” The popular waltz, “King For a Day,” offered opportunity for an excellent rendition by the trumpets and horns. The overture, “Orpheus,” by Offenbach followed this, and three songs of the campus concluded the concert, “Hike, Notre Dame” and “Down the Line,” by Joseph Casasanta, and the “Victory March,” by Michael Shea.

§ § § UNIVERSAL NOTRE DAME NIGHT SET FOR APRIL 22
Universal Notre Dame night, with sixty Alumni clubs joining in the celebration, will be celebrated on April 22, according to James E. Armstrong, secretary of the alumni organization. A campus program is being arranged by the S. A. C. for .the same night, for the students of the University.	’
The event is the sixth annual observance of a universal Notre Dame night. Clubs will participate in every state of the union in Mexico, in South America, in Manilla and across the Atlantic, Notre Dame graduates in Paris will join with the others in celebrating.
- Each club will have a somewhat similar program with a banquet and speakers. In many cities, faculty members and officials of the University will be guests of the clubs.
The Notre Dame Alumni club, one of the first to be organized among American Catholic colleges, sponsors, in the universal Notre Dame night one of the most unique annual celebrations of any of the alumni groups in the country. Nearly 5,000 men will take part in this year’s event. f.e.d.
VARSITY DEBATERS DEFEAT DETROIT; LOSE TO DE PAUW
Notre Dame’s varsity debaters were heard for the first time on the campus when the negative and affirmative teams met Detroit University and DePauw University last Thursday and Friday evenings in Washington Hall. The decision of the first, determined by a ballot of the audience, went to Notre Dame; the second debate, which was judged by Professor Elwood Murray of Purdue University, was won by DePauw.	-
The question which was debated read as follows: “Resolved, that a criminal code similai- in procedure to the criminal code of Great Britain should be adopted throughout the United States.” Thomas Konop, Dean of the Law School, was chairman of the Detroit contest and Clarence Manion, professor of the Law School, acted in the same capacity at the second debate.
The negative team composed of James Walsh, Thomas Happer and Joseph McNamara, based their case Thursday night on the statement that the “agency,” not the “procedure” is to blame for the present condition of the judicial courts. Their delivery and argumentation was superior to that of the Detroiters; McNamara’s speech clinched the decision for the Notre Dame team.
The DePauw team Friday night declared that technicalities were not as rampant in the United States courts as the instances offered by their opponents would indicate. Selfcriticism of the English system by prominent British statesmen was also offered as proof that things that glitter from afar lose some of their value upon closer inspection. The Notre Dame team insisted that only the better parts of the English system need be adopted; in this respect there was considerable discussion of the exact meaning of the word “similar,” as used in the proposition. The winning team consisted of Franklin Cole, Robert. Small and Alvin Rockwell; Notre Dame’s team was made up of George Beamer, Charles Haskell and Francis McGreal.
§ § §
MONOGRAM “ABSURDITIES” PRODUCTION TO FEATURE SIX SKITS
The spirit and enthusiasm seen in the gym and on the athletic fields is being manifest each night as Notre Dame’s monogram men are put through their various acts by Director Thomas E. Mills in preparation for the three “Absurdities” performances in Washington hall, March 20, 21 and 23.
The show this year gives every indication of maintaining the traditional standard set by “Absurdities” of other years. Included in the cast are the most prominent athletes of the campus, for many of whom the production will be their last public appearance.

*	MEN YOU KNOW	♦
When one walks for the first time into the office of the president of the University, it is with no little anxiety that thoughts are hastily assembled in preparation for the inter-
PRESIDENT CHARLES L. O’DONNELL, C.S.C., PH.D.
view. A student does not know just what sort of a reception to expect. But those who have never enjoyed the experience of meeting our president can promise themselves a kind reception. As you enter the office Father O’Donnell will look at you, rather closely; you will look at him, rather doubtfully, and then he will smile in a way that is frankly reassuring. Father will surprise you with his interest in you and your affairs, for it is not every university president who has either the time or the desire to want to know his students intimately. His personality is likeable, and his interest is sincere. You will leave his office feeling that you would like to know him better.
Father Charles L. O’Donnell entered Holy Cross Seminary in the fall of 1899, and graduated with honors from the University in 1906. Even at that time he was influential through his pen, for he was the Editor-in-Chief of the first Dome. For the four years after his graduation from Notre Dame the Catholic University in Washington had him as a student, and in 1910 he there received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Upon his ordination he began his work as a Prefect and Professor of English. Corby Hall lost him when he accepted the Associate Editorship of the Ave Maria, and transferred his residence to the Presbytery. Until he was commissioned as one of the six faculty members to serve as chaplains in the World War the Department of English numbered him among its professors. The Forty-second Regiment of Engineers of the 117th Division learned to love Father O’Donnell during his five months’ service as their chaplain at the front in France. Later he was transfered to the 322nd Infantry, with whom he served for nine months in Italy. After the war his duties as Professor and
Associate Editor of the Ave Maria recalled him to Notre Dame. He had been back but a year when he was elected Provincial-Superior of the Congregation of Holy Cross in the United States, succeeding the Very Reverend Andrew Mor- r rissey, C.S.C., who was elevated to the position of CoadjutorSuperior General. In 1926, after six years as Provincial, , Father O’Donnell was elected First Assistant Superior General. He remained in this office until the thirteenth of last July, when he was announced as President of the University by the Provincial Chapter of the Congregation of Holy Cross as the successor of the Reverend Matthew Walsh, C. S. C. ‘
As a poet Father O’Donnell has won lasting recognition. -“The Dead Musician and Other Poems” was published by < him in 1916. In the succeeding year he was co-editor of “Notre Dame Verse.” “Cloister and Other Poems” followed in 1922. Literary critics were decidedly favorable in their reviews of these books. “The Rime of the Rood and Other Poems” appeared last spring.

NEW “DOME”	SUBSCRIPTION	CAMPAIGN TO	*
BE LAUNCHED	"
On Monday, March 11, a new subscription campaign for the Dome will be launched, according to the Reverend Patrick J. Carroll, C.S.C., Chairman of the Faculty Board of Publi- " cations. The campaign will last one week, and aside from securing- subscriptions, its primary purpose is to acquaint « the students with their year-book.
Printed notices containing an announcement of the campaign will be left in every student’s room, along with subscription blanks for students who have not yet signed up. The bill can be sent home.
Robert J. Kuhn, Business Manager of the Dome, appeals to the student body to cooperate with him. Only 500 more * subscriptions are needed to make the 1929 Dome the most successful in point of sales since the year-book was first published. The Dome does not make a profit; it is published expressly for students, giving them a complete record of the college year. In it are perpetuated memories of class mates and happenings at college—in short, it contains every activity \ of the school year. Freshmen especially are asked to support ' the Dome. This year’s book will contain a much larger freshman section than has usually been allotted to the first-year men. Every yearling activity will be featured in that section. ’
Kuhn also announces that the campus clubs are requested to pay the bills sent to them for* the insertion of club pictures. The club officers should take care of this matter, as it will ? be brought up before the next meeting of the Board of Publications. Clubs not paying their bill will not have their pictures in the Dome.

FAMOUS AUTHORS APPEAR IN “HOOSIER” NUMBER OF “JUGGLER”	,
Indiana’s authors, Indiana’s weather, Indiana’s politicians, ’ Indiana’s basketball, in fact almost anything you can imagine about Indiana was included in the “Hoosier” number of the Notre Dame Jziggler, which appeared on the campus last Monday evening.	’	,
Two of Indiana’s famous and native born authors, Kin Hubbard and Meredith Nicholson, contributed autographed £• articles which gave the Juggler a genuine Hoosier flavor.
Kin Hubbard (more widely known as Abe Martin) wrote in his usual style a short article which included cigarette testimonials, “Sailfish ketchin’,” Will Rogers, Eddie Cantor, Hollywood, famous politicians, and the new Ford. .
Meredith Nicholson was more serious. He made a sincere and interesting appeal for the youth of this country. a

PERSONAL REMINISCENCES FEATURE TALK BY DR. FRED BONINE
Dr. Fred Bonine, of Niles, Michigan, one of the world’s foremost eye specialists, and a beloved figure in American medical circles, spoke before the Notre Dame Academy of Science, members of the faculty and invited guests, last Tuesday evening in the University Library. The whitehaired gentleman, who is an ardent admirer and supporter of Notre Dame, spoke philosophically of his sacred tripod: “The Mental, the Moral, and the Physical in a Man.” A wealth of personal reminiscences added rigor and interest to his talk, which lasted over an hour and a half.
Phenomenal success in treating eye troubles have attracted the attention of thousands to Dr. Bonine, and today he has at least 300 patients in his consultation room every office day. Behind all his work one sees a career that is noble and pure. Dr. Bonine cherishes the friendships of many men in national and international circles who recognize him as one of the world’s leading eye specialists.
Beginning in grammar school at Niles, Michigan, Dr. Bonine extended his education to numerous American and continental universities, including those at Heidelberg, Baden, Michigan and London. In these places he established a foundation in medical knowledge which later proved invaluable in making him a nationally prominent member of the medical profession. Notre Dame, a short time ago, bestowed on him an honorary Bachelor of Laws degree.
Few know that in his college days at Ann Arbor, Dr. Bonine was a stai- track man, holding the world’s record for the hundred meter dash until Charlie Paddock broke it several years ago. He also won the I. C. A. A. A. A. national title in 1892. It has been said of this specialist: “Generosity he has, such as is possible to those who practice an art, ■*never to drive a trade, with a Herculean cheerfulness and courage. So it is that he brings air and cheer into the sick room, and often enough, though not so often as he wishes, brings healing.”
After the talk, Robert Schulze, president of the Academy, announced that a motion picture would be shown very shortly in Washington Hall for the benefit of the Academy. At the meeting which followed, the Reverend Charles McAllister, C.S.C., was made an honorary member of the Academy.

AN OPEN LETTER TO THE STUDENT BODY
Someone should enforce the Sherman Anti-Trust law against Sorin. It seems to have a monopoly; so far, no other halls have been discovered harboring campus personalities,
THOMAS A. RYAN
but there is yet hope. After all there are twelve more numbers of the Scholastic to be published. This week’s luminary is Thomas A. Ryan, who lives in 107 —just opposite the Editor-in-Chief. It is said of Tom that there isn’t a better bridge player in Sorin. For that reason alone he is entitled to membership in the elite circle,
whose members are featured in
this column; but he holds
other honors and distinctions.
In the first place, Tom is manager of the basketball team. His basketball honors come to him naturally since he is a native Hoosier. Rushville proudly claims the distinction of being his birth-place. He is a member in good standing of the Student Activities Council, being Senior Representative from the College of Arts and Letters. Not only is he a member of that organization—which is an honor in itself, but he is Chairman of the Dance Committee; and adroitly promotes the “bait dances” so necessary for the success of the more formal Cotillion, Prom and Ball.
Tom is also a “would-be” Shakesperean actor. Professor Kelly has cast him for a part for the University Theater’s attempt at “Julius Caesar.” Just what his part will be was not made clear to us by Ryan, but we do remember that he is supposed to carry a spear, or to be technical, a pilum.
Ryan’s past activities include a wide range. He first became prominent in a modest way, being content in his sophomore year with the office of vice-president of the class. He was also a member of the Blue Circle, which honor was carried over into his junior year. In that year he was Chairman of the Ticket Committee for the Junior Prom, and performed his duties so ably that the 1928 dance had the largest ticket sale “in the history of the University.”
Lastly, if anyone is curious (after reading the first campus personalities article) as to the identity of the other co-chairman of the student trip to Chicago, let him rest content—it was Tom Ryan.	—E. L. T.

PROMINENT SPEAKERS ADDRESS BOY GUIDANCE STUDENTS
During the past two weeks the Boy Guidance students were addressed by several outside speakers. Dr. Ray O. Wy-land, director of the Department of Education of the National Staff of the Boy Scouts of America, spoke on the training required by his organization and Miss Helen Dernbach outlined the vocational guidance work followed in the South Bend schools.
During March Mr. Eugene T. Lies of the Playground and Recreation Association of America, will address the Boy Guidance men and the physical education seniors. Dr. Herbert Williams, of the Big Brother Federation, is also listed to speak upon the work of that organization.
On the event of last year’s rally for the Varsity football team prior to their departure for New York, the proprietor of one of the theaters of South Bend extended to the student body the privilege of an afternoon’s entertainment as the guest of the management. The same afternoon the manager of another local theater opened his doors to the students for another gratuitous performance.
There was cause for rejoicing. Words of praise for these splendid business men were heard on the lips of everyone. The students were finally “getting a break.” And any one of us would have welcomed the opportunity of assisting these men in any manner possible. That was in November.
Last week, or rather for the last two weeks, the students have repaid the generosity of these gentlemen by conducting themselves in a manner more becoming to “hoodlums” than to university men. This conduct has been carried on to such an extent that the patronage of these theaters has been diminished considerably. Rowdyism has been particularly prevalent on Saturday afternoons.
These managers have proven themselves to be friends of the students. And we have repaid their favors with insults. Is this the attitude of the student body at large? Or merely that of a group of individuals who have no consideration for the feelings of others? In fairness we should respect the courtesy which they have extended to us by at least conducting themselves as gentlemen. —THE s. A. C.

SCRIBBLERS
Two new members were elected to the Scribblers club at the regular meeting held Monday evening, March 4, in the Organizations building. Jack Dempsey, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Letters, and T. J. Ryan, a junior in the College of Commerce, were the new members elected. Both m^n have been actively engaged with the various campus publications and have proved that they are deserving to be chosen to this select group.
The main business of the evening had to do with the Scribblers’ Poetry Contest, which was recently held. Over seventy manuscripts have been mailed to the judges of the contest and it is hoped that the results will be ready for publication by March 15.
At the completion of the business meeting a very interesting short story was read by Everett Michael. This was followed by a play read by John de Roulet.
NEW JERSEY CLUB
Approximately forty-five members attended a meeting of the New Jersey Club held Thursday evening, February 28, in the Lay Faculty dining hall. President Jack Reilly presided at the meeting which was the first held by the club during the new year.
The main topic of discussion proved to be the club banquet which is to be given immediately following Easter vacation. The various committees will be appointed at the next meeting of the club. In the meantime preliminary arrangements will be taken care of by the club officers.
The members of the club attended Mass and received Holy Communion in a body Wednesday morning for the repose of the soul of the father of Edward Pfeifer, a club) member, who died recently.
FOX RIVER VALLEY' CLUB
The Fox River Valley Club held its first meeting of the new year Friday evening, March 1, in the Badin Hall “Rec.” room. At this meeting the financial report of the Christmas dance was read by Willaim Chawgo, who acted as chairman. From the report it can be seen that the dance was very successful.
The main business of the meeting centered around the plans for the Easter dance which is to be held in the Joliet Country Club on Saturday night, March 31. President Jim Tobin announced that William S. Reaume would act as general chairman of the affair. The various committeemen who will work under his direction will be appointed in the near future.
DETROIT CLUB
A short informal meeting of the Detrot Club was held Tuesday evening, February 26, in Badin Hall “Rec.” room. The main purpose of the meeting was for the members to decide whether or not they were to hold an Easter dance. The Detroit Notre Dame Alumni Club is planning a dance to be held during the Easter holidays and it is not desirable that the clubs conflict in staging their affairs. After much
discussion James M. Carrol was appointed to communicate with the secretary of the Alumni Club to see if they would be willing for the local club to join them as co-sponsors of a dance. No further arrangements will be made until Mr. Carrol has his report ready.
The next meeting of the club will be held Tuesday evening, March 12, at 6:30 p. m. in Badin Hall “Rec.” room.
WRANGLERS CLUB
The Wranglers Club held their regular weekly meeting Sunday morning, March 3, in the Organization building. The guest of honor at this meeting was George O’Connel, who was a charter member of the club and the first man to hold the office of club secretary.
John T. Houlihan delivered the principal address at the meeting. He gave a well prepared speech on “Student Government.” In his talk he pointed out the many good features that would be introduced by such a system and he also discussed a few bad features that would be brought out. Following the talk a round table discussion was taken up with John McGinty, Walter Stanton, and William Brown leading the talk.
The Wranglers Club affirmative debating team will journey to North Manchester, Indiana, Saturday night, where they will compete against the Manchester College team.
A. I. E. E.
The Notre Dame Branch of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers held their regular semi-monthly meeting Monday evening, March 4, in Chemistry Hall. A financial report was given by Chairman .Jack Donahue. The report had to do in the main part with the dues, and it showed that the majority of the members have paid up for the last semester.
An interesting and instructive paper was given by Paul Hist of the junior class on the subject “Signaling, From the Beginning to the Present Day Methods.” Dr. Mahin of the Metallurgical department, which is connected with the Chemistry department of the University, gave a lecture, which was illustrated with slides, on the many phases of work in metallurgy with which an electrical engineer- has to deal.
Approximately forty-five members were served refreshments at the conclusion of the meeting.
CONNECTICUT VALLEY CLUB NOMINATIONS
A very important special meeting of the Connecticut Valley Club has been called by President Shea, who requests that members be present for quorum purposes. It will be held Monday evening, March 11, at 8:00 p. nr. in Badin “Rec.” room.

Add to your list of eccentrics William Cullen Bryant Kemp, who died recently at the age of 78 after having spent 60 years as a student at Columbia University. Kemp was a freshman at Columbia in 1868. He continued in college the rest of his life because a relative left him $2,500 for each year that he remained at the University. He received the degrees of A.B., A.M., M.D., LL.M., LL.B., Ph.D., C.E., E.E., Meeh. E.; E.M., Pharm. Chem., B.S., and one degree not listed in the catalogue, D.P.M.

Undoubtedly many new geniuses will spring into the poetic limelight.”

Ice cream, it seems, is the favorite dish of the co-eds at the University of Tennessee. This conclusion results from the following item in the Orange and White:
“Accurate calculators have figured that each co-ed eats one-fourth of a pint of ice cream every night at dinner. Figure it up for yourself. Thirty quarter pints a month. That is approximately a gallon. Think of it! A gallon of ice cream a month. And so it is that after thirty-two months of education, and thirty-two gallons of ice cream, seniors look forward to finishing up the thirty-sixth month of education, and the thirty-sixth gallon of ice cream, and the awarding of two degrees, a B.A. or what you will, and an M.I.C. (Master of Ice Cream), sung to the tune of the famous collegiate song written especially for U. of T. dormitory co-eds, ‘I scream, you scream, we all scream for Ice Cream.’ ”
The University of Chicago is planning the construction of residence halls to accommodate 400 men and 380 women students. The estimated cost is about $3,000,000. This step is being taken because of the difficulty of securing suitable rooms at reasonable rates for students. An important feature of the project is ample provision for recreation grounds for intramural sports adjacent to the new halls.

Visions of a beautiful girl he had never seen, but with whom friends had assured him they had arranged a date, recently lured a Georgetown University student to a ‘home in a fashionable residential section in Washington, D. C.
Unaware of the trouble into which the visions were leading him, the student summoned a sleepy citizen to the front door and asked to see his daughter.
“I have nd daughter,” declared the citizen when the student informed him of his quest.
“Yes, you have,” obstinately replied the student.
Thereupon a bitter argument ensued which culminated with the arrival of a police patrol and the immediate removal of the student to a police station. He was released, however, after he had told his sad, sad story to the officers.

The Influence of Notre Dame On My Life
By Judge M. M. Oshe, ’12
I will not write about what life has done for me, rather the influence of Notre Dame on my life.
I entered Notre Dame in 1907 shy and backward in the extreme. Five years of association with fellows from all parts of the country, surrounded by that democratic spirit of Notre Dame, which, regardless of oux- position in life, gradually and surely molds and brings us to the same level, gave me what I will always consider my greatest asset. I am not overlooking the fact that education develops personality, character and the courage of convictions. Perhaps I should not attempt to separate the benefits derived from association on the campus, and those of the class room, but I will always feel that the environment of Notre Dame gave me neiwe and courage and lastly, if not presumptuous, taught me to make friends.
Upon leaving Notre Dame, I opened a law office in my home town, Zanesville, Ohio. After holding various minor political positions, I was finally elected Municipal Judge.
While a student at Notre Dame, I was introduced by some South Bend friends to a Chicago girl. I met her again some years later through my Notre Dame roommate, Keene Fitzpatrick, of Chicago, and this time, aftei- a resumption of our acquaintance, she became my wife. \
For the obvious reason of acceding to the desires of my wife and the further expectation that Chicago presented a larger field of advancement, I was induced to seek a location there. Father Cavanaugh, then in Mercy Hospital, directed me to Byron Kanaley, and through him I made my connection with the Chicago Title and Trust Company. Byron Kanaley himself, perhaps, is the only one who actually knows how many Notre Dame men he has placed on the right road.
Title Insurance, or a Guarantee Policy, as we call it in Chicago, protects and frees the owner of real estate or mortgage broker from all loss or possible worry because of a defective title and from the expense of defending it.
My first experience with the title company was examining abstracts. Like all insurance, the risk is examined before the policy is issued. This work is highly interesting because every abstract tells a story, not only of the property but of the history and development of the community, and oftimes of the lives of the various parties involved in the chain of title. Wills, estates, tables of heirship, partition suits contained in an abstract show the character and family history of early pioneers for two and three generations. The execution of mortgages and their renewal from time to time, and the varying considerations mentioned in deeds reflect- the
course of periods of inflation and deflation in values and the rise and fall of family fortunes.
The work of the department with which I am connected as Chief Title Officer, is to pass on those questions of title and risks that the attorney and title officers of the company consider doubtful or hazardous. A title rejected means inconvenience to a customer and the loss of profitable business. Our one thought, therefore, is to solve the problem by discovering a legal principle or some practical reason fox- waiving the defect and guaranteeing the title. Space will not permit me to relate many interesting experiences in this work.
This position brings me in contact, either directly or indirectly, through my associates, with practically every large financial deal in the city where real estate is part of the picture. The restrictions and limitations placed on corporations in their ownership of real estate in Illinois, are such that in every involved and complicated financial transaction, the question of corporate authority and power must be constantly considered. In the past five years, the sky line of Chicago in the loop district and along- Michigan Boulevard has almost completely changed. In practically every one of these building projects, numberless questions have arisen, Corporate Capacity, Power of Trustees, Issuance of Land Trust Certificates, Authority of Lessees under long term leases, Constx-uction of Will, etc. Outside of the loop, the erection of buildings contrary to building line restrictions has presented many interesting problems, w-hich in many instances, have been overcome and buildings erected.
It is a delightful feeling in looking at these massive structures to know that in a small way one has played his part in their erection and made his contribution to the growth and development of a great city.
If the graduate of today were to ask me for advice, I would hesitate because I realize that each man must meet life in his own individual way and succeed according to the ability he possesses. I do believe, however, that the young man on the threshold of his business or professional career should not be misled by vivid and illusory stories of success and fame attained over night. One usually hears of ultimate Achievements and prizes won at the height or climax of a career and not of the difficult years of strenuous, persistent, effort- leading up to it. Ambition is commendable, but fanciful dreams of a glorious tomorrow should not cause us to neglect the work of today—because the work of today is the rock-bed foundation of the future upon which we build.
Editor’s Note: This is the second of a series of articles by prominent alumni. Judge Marcellus M. Oshe kindly consented to submit this article for publication, but modesty evidently forbade his mentioning some of the honors to which he has been heir. Judge Oshe was a prominent undergraduate while at Notre Dame, graduating with honors in the class of 1912. For three years he served as professor of real property law in the Kent College of Law in Chicago. He delivers annually a series of forty lectures to the Real Property Institute of the Cook County Real Estate Board, and by reason of his experience, speaks as an authority on
all questions pertaining to lands, titles, and other factors in real estate. Judge Oshe is considered an extremely entertaining after-dinner speaker, being called upon constantly by his associates to speak at various functions. The Chicago Title and Trust Company, with which Judge Oshe is connected, is the greatest organization of its kind in the word.
The next articles by prominent alumni will be from Hugh A. O’Donnell, assistant business manager of the New York Times, and George Shuster, associate editor of the Commonweal. These articles will be published in the near future.

The Notre Dame
Of Other Years
BY JOHN J. NANOVIC
(.CentiiiitLfl from last week.)
THERE ought to be in the different halls a .-ufficient number of oarsmen—or at least enough raw material from which to make them—to fill out four speedy crews, the members of which would not only get a deal of physical benefit out of their training and put up an interesting exhibition, but also add a new feature to the varied program of commencement entertainment.”
In the attempts to reorganize the Boat Club and put crew work in its place on the list of school activities, Father Patrick J. Carroll took the lead and gathered enough material to start the sport again in all its former glory. By arranging the teams according to classes, Father Carroll added an interest which was lacking in the previous crews, picked with no special regard to halls, colleges or classes. By June, 1911, the
new club had progressed so rapidly that the commencement regatta was bigger than it had ever been before, and included a race between the Freshman Engineers and Freshman Lawyers, in addition to the Freshman and Sophomores, and the Juniors and Seniors. The latter classes raced in the boats “Silver Jubilee” and “Golden Jubilee,” the Seniors, who rowed the latter craft, losing the race. Interest in the events was confined not alone to the school, but spread all about. Mrs. Thomas Marshall, wife of the late Governor Marshall, of Indiana, awarded the anchors to the winning crew one year.
Referring to Father Carroll for some added information, he gave us the following, not found in the records: “You may say, if you like, that Father Hugh O’Donnell was a lusty member of one of these crews and received an anchor. Father John O’Hara, who now gets out your religious bulletin, got out his crew suit, but did not win an anchor, his crew losing by a' foot.

certain. So was Father Lange, not so big in those days, but big enough. Father Moriarty, now of Wooster, Ohio, and Mr. K. K. Rockne, pulled oars, but I do not remember ever seeing them perspiring.
“I wish I had time to tell you how Mii. ‘Shorty’ Rush fell into the lake when trying to make good before his best girl. She’s married now, I think—to somebody else.
“I was referred to as ‘Commodore’ in irony, and the boats which I called ‘shells’ were referred to by the crews as ‘tubs.’ Bill Cotter, now in New York’s big business, rowed in two or three races, but he never exerted himself so he hasn’t any anchors to show for it. We spoke of the assembled boats as the ‘Lake Fleet,’ but Father Cavanaugh always called it the ‘Lake Fluke,’ which I consider more naughty than nautical. Yes, those were happy weeks, those weeks of precommencement rowing.”
However, conditions seemed to be unfavorable toward the club, despite all its efforts, and boating ended its history here with the crew of 1916, the ‘last and the best,’ about which the Dome of 1916 carries a very interesting story:
“The 1915 Dome printed a picture of “The
Last of the Crews,” and as the crew was made up of the men of 1915, many of the 1916 crew were sore, because they thought our own crew was the last. Men of 1916, you must apologize to the 191-5 men for they were right. Their crew was the last of the crews. But that was on a bright June day in 1913. That same bright June day our crew was first, and they have a perfect right to say that their bunch was the last; for it certainly was.
“We are running this picture with a different meaning to the word ‘last.’ The crew of 1916 was the last to be formed, and the passing of the sport was very impressive, for the men who represented our class on the lake that day not only defeated the Sophomores, but they pulled their heavy old boat over the course in better time than was ever made before. Thus the last of the crews was also the best of the crews, and to them we doff our hats. It is true the coxswain’s measured ‘row, row, row’ will never be heard again upon the old lake, but in the days to come when we visit the old haunts and look over the old course we can shut our eyes and proudly cheer the last, and also the record holding crew of 1916, as we see it in fancy speed like the wind on to victory again.”

THE LAETAKE HU AI !1ST
Alfred E. Smith is to be the recipient of the Laetare Medal award of 1929. For several terms governor of the state of New York and last year Democratic candidate for the presidency of the United States, Mr. Smith is therefore not an unknown figure to the people of this nation. In fact he is very well known; quite as well known as any man in public life today. He is well known and, among the normally minded, well loved. He has graciousness and ease of manner and those simpler modes of life that appeal to the plainer people. He is human and kindly and talks a language men understand. He has a country-wide reputation for fair dealing and plain speaking. His opponents who dislike him have argued against his theories of government, convinced that his personal life is unassailable. Men who could not find fault with his record in practical politics have attacked a purposely familiar style of speech as unsuited to exalted office. He has been shouted at and whispered about, but always he has kept his poise, smiling and unafraid. He has been mocked in conference by the vestry-minded, has been heckled by the scribes, and called a breaker of the law by the ancients, and always he has held his position without belligerency and with appealing courage.
The University, in conferring this medal award on former Governor Smith, is not concerned so much with his attainment of political office as with his rendition of service. Conspicuously weak men have sometimes gained high place only to emphasize incompetency by bad government. Governor Smith has been singularly honored many times and very notably once. But in him honor always found safe lodgment; the symbol of position had never to apologize for itself while in his hand. •
As a statesman of penetration and high courage Mr. Alfred E. Smith is altogether deserving of Notre Dame’s recognition, and she is joyous that she has this Happy Warrior above whose brave heart she can pin her highest award. His life has points of contact with her own. He has grown up from a plain lad of the sidewalks to become governor of a state and the leader of a party; crossed and questioned and heckled and penalized and hated, but always smiling and brave. He has won great honors but has never given up his Faith or his principles to secure them. He has been beaten, but there is no defeat when this man goes down. We are all proud to lose with him. The Scholastic congratulates the University for honoring the Great Gentleman of Greater New York.
TEE UMVEKJTfy TEEATEE
Culture which enables its possessor to obtain the best that life has to offer is inconceivable without <	an appreciation pf the drama. Plays are an integral part in one’s education. Realizing this fact the
’	University administration, working in conjunction with certain faculty members, decided in December
of 1926 to furnish an outlet for the students’ artistic impulse, whether this impulse took the form of playwriting, or of acting, or of producing. Thus, the University Theatre was bom and it has been thriving ever since.
This season, as their seventeenth production, the Theatre is striking a new note in the local revitali-£ zation of the drama by producing Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” — a momentous undertaking. Amateurs have always shied from this play as being too unwieldy for an effective presentation by other ... < than professional members of the theatrical profession. But Professor Charles Phillips, teacher of Playwriting, and Professor Frank Kelly, teacher of Play Production, collaborated to bring forth the . drama in a form suitable for use by non-professionals.
This work, like the others that have been presented by the Theatre, will take its place in the “Uni’ versity Theatre Library” whose purpose is to furnish, amateur producers, parochial, and school dramatic societies with a repertoire of plays suitable for their various purposes.
To the founders of this movement and the other men who have made the University. Theatre a living element in Notre Dame’s life the student body is grateful, deeply grateful. The organization not only introduces the student to the. best that there is in conemporary drama, clustered about a classical nucleus, but also insures the student playwright, the student actor, and the student produ-• cer an avenue for an effective visualization of his work.—D.

LITERARY
Rhapsody In Words
J. RAYMOND FOX
“And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by.”	“
’	—Masefield.
LIKE all good writers Mr. Masefield believes in using concrete expressons. In writing poetry he has no alternative: he must employ picturesque words, words that have strength, and register a definite, clear-cut impression on the reader. Undoubtedly he might have resorted to numerous abstractions, but, like the true artist, he prefers diction glowing and alive, as in this stanza from “Sea-Fever,” one of the best liked and most rhythmical of his poems:	'
“I must go down to the seas again to the vagrant gypsy life.
To the gull’s way and the whale’s way where the wind’s like a whetted knife;
And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover,
And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick’s over.
The first quality of writing, rhetoricians tell us, is clearness. One of the means of obtaining clearness is the use of simple words. But we can use simple words and still not be understood by our readers. This sometimes occurs when our words are too abstract. How our thoughts would be clarified in the mind of the reader if we would only present them in a striking picture! No one who has read “The Christmas Carol” will ever forget old Scrooge. Dickens painted an unforgettable picture in our minds when he so concretely and artistically wrote:
“Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.”
The abstract construction frequently comes naturally to a young writer but just as frequently it constitutes vague, mediocre, and uninteresting discourse. Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, in his book “On the Art of Writing,” while treating the concrete and abstract word, says:	.
“ ‘How excellent a thing is sleep,’ sighed Sancho Panza; ‘it wraps a man round like a cloak’—an excellent example of how to say a thing concretely; a Jargoneer would have said
that ‘among the beneficial qualities of sleep its capacity for withdrawing the human consciousness from the contemplation of immediate circumstances may perhaps be accounted not the least remarkable.’ How vile a thing—shall we say? —is the abstract noun! It wraps a man’s thoughts like cotton wool.”
Of course the abstract word is indispensable in formal discourse, as in the treatise and thesis, but the majority of present-day English students will deal more with other forms of writing. The modern trend is towards concrete expression of thought. Especially is this true in advertising. Captions that catch the eye and stimulate human appeal are at a premium. The young fellow on the billboard might say, “The Flavor of Camels Pleases Me.” But how much more convincing is he when he says, “I’d Walk a Mile for a Camel!” The makers of Old Golds might advertise in this way, “Our Cigarettes Do Not Irritate the Respiratory Tract.” But their message becomes much stronger when they say, “Not a Cough in a Carload.” The artist merely sketches the form of a Venus-like girl to convey to the reader the beauty of “Body by Fisher”; and the idea seems to work quite well. The Line Book of 1928 contains a fine little description of “The Old Home” by Honey. It is the very essence of concreteness and part of it, methinks, would be an excellent “ad” for Mason Fruit Jars. It runs:
“ ... It was there that our mother was alchemist—with fruit juice and sugar for fairy gold which she molded in globes of crystal . . . Jelly she brewed from the tart wild plum with a garnet flame in its depths and from apple and quince an exotic concoction with the shimmei- of frail gold fire . . . Great purple grapes she plunged in spun sugai’ and their bloom was a thick silver frost . . . While the clear honeyed pink of preserved watermelon and tawny pear pickles with cloves in their sides were favorites of ours as well . . . Suddenly I heard the breath of a whisper—the faint dulcet bubble of slow boiling jelly, and the air grew sweet, hot, and spicy ...”
Such a message would stimulate the imagination of almost any reader, whet his appetite, tickle his palate, and have his mouth watering in no time at all. By its very concreteness the reader is aroused and “gets” the significance of its content. That is the goal of advertising; that is the goal of writing.	-

A Defense of Pride
THOMAS CAREY
MANY, many long year's before Queen Isabella pawned the family jewels to stake Christopher' Columbus to a yacht trip, another queen was crowned, by a world reknowned theologian, St. Thomas of '• Aquin. She was a dual-natured queen and her name was ! “Pride.” Her realm was the land of “Vice,” and all mankind was her subjects. The better of her two natures, J though, has been almost completely lost in the universal condemnation merited by her ill behavior.
'	“ ‘Tis pride, rank pride and haughtiness of soul ;
»	I think the Romans call it Stoicism.”
' All of the history which I know (and I anr supposed, by ; my instructors, to know considerable) I link together with odd little incidents and anecdotes. With King Nero, late of Rome, I associate these few pertinent facts: pride fired his imagination; he fired the chief magistrate; then he fired the • city.
Pride and Theology simply could not be reconciled undei' Martin Luther’s apartment roof, so he closed the place and 4, got a building permit of his own.
Lest I forget to include it later, let me say here that . Queen Pride is not a rose pressed in the pages of history. /	No, she is very much with us today, ready to do or undo
»	our will, to amuse or amaze us. Her presence is not in all
cases evident, for her name is spelled variously. You have only to procure the latest Tabloid to learn of her where' abouts, at least her notable whereabouts, since the issue preceding. “MAN IS MURDERED,” as a headline, seems to attract no more attention than the weather forcast, and it is almost as regular. The facts following these awful words • do not, as a rule, vary to any great extent. The deceased one simply knew too much for the peace of mind of a business associate,—or a wife, or maybe only a “friend.”
Here, Michel de Montaigne, probably in a fit of despondency, ventures that:
“The best virtue I have, has in it
•	some tincture of vice?”
And I say, the worst vice I have has in it some tincture of , virtue. It is my purpose, by way of analogy and illustration, to show that Pride has much to recommend her.
To begin with, I insist that you admire Pride, not as a characteristic which you particularly like, but as a tremendous force within your being, but outside your control. While in your control you coddle her and stroke her fur, much as you would a murmuring Angora; but, out of your control,
you hide and cringe in terror as if, at a turn, she would completely annihilate you.
There is this difference though,—possession of a pet is a matter of choice, whereas your pride is an inseparable part of you, the same as flat feet and dandruff. Summon up your courage then,—recognize the latent Vesuvian mistress within you—call her to open combat. She can be subdued and that end, once accomplished, makes of her a very desirable companion.
Exactly one hundred and seventeen words in advance of this paragraph, there is to be found documentary evidence to the effect that my leading and only character proved herself too much for two of History’s favorite sons. For two others, (of our time and country), she has asserted her better nature. Abraham Lincoln, in one of his speeches, (not the one I know by heart), introduced himself to his listeners as, “Famous Humble Abe,” I don’t quite recall just how famous “Humble Abe” was about that time, but I venture that his school-girl modesty “cinched” at least one precinct in Chicago. Parenthetically, leave that sort of introduction to Lincoln and his kind, lest you be invited to inspect your shoe laces.
“I am dee-lighted” to produce now, (by permission of the Pepsodent Toothpaste Company), a further substantiation of my thesis. Theodore Roosevelt donned long trousers and a goodly measure of self-respect about the same time. Thus armed he set out to fight wild animals in Africa, Spaniards in Cuba, and Old Age Pension bills in the White House, emerging from it all “open countenanced” and pretty well satisfied with himself.
Mayhap, you have viewed yourself in the light of my conception of. pride, and, unless prejudice has warped your conclusion, you will admit with me, that pride can exert a positive, as well as a negative, influence. Nor is pride necessarily concerned with only the great. At least in one sense, she is in every act of every man. Try to conceive of yourself as performing one act wherein the result on your pride is neutral. Not only the things which we do, but even to the clothes which we wear, although commonly explaining their existence by the modesty which we profess as inherent, are primarily designed with attention to style and to the pride they will give the owner in wearing them.
The universal craving to achieve, to command, to be respected, and to be looked up to, finds its beginning in pride.
I am firmly convinced of one fact: namely, that pride, to be ethically useful, must be possessed in a small and closely measured quantity. The elements of carbon and sugar are precisely the same, but who wants carbon in his coffee?

doubt if there has ever been a member of the undergraduate | body at the University of Illinois who was a more imagin- | ative, vivid writer, a more pleasant talker, or a more thor- | oughly charming fellow.	t
( ("V" 'T’HEN I was a little girl I wanted a doll, but I 1/a / never could have one. Now that I’m a woman, V V I could have a hundred of them if I wanted them—but I don’t. That doll was only a baby idea, just a childhood dream that never came true, but it caused just a bit of heartache that will never quite heal up. It’s just too late to do anything about it.” I am quite sure that I have not given.this quotation in the exact words of the author. I am not even positive as to just which character uttered the lines, but I know that the idea is from Eleanor H. Porter’s otherwise “tripey” novel, “Pollyanna.”
Personally, as child, I was never greatly interested in dolls; but, if the figure of speech is permissable, I am going to put myself in the place of the Pollyanna character and consider the doll as a group of Fairy Tales. As I write this I am sitting at home near an unusually well stocked private library. On one shelf I see a row of Harvard Classics, they that were edited by Dr. Elliott. Volume number seventeen is entitled “Folk-Lore and Fable. Aesop, Grim and Anderson.” That book wasn’t there when I was a youngster. Many times, since the realm of gnomes and elfs and Santa Claus has slipped into the past, have I taken it up—trying always to become interested; but I couldn’t. It leaves me cold. Oh, to be sure, I appreciate the charm and simplicity that characterize the style of Grimm and Anderson. But the spirit cannot reach me now. How I would have reveled in these stories as a child! Now it’s too late.
Philosophy gives us the. axiom—“Ignoti nulla copido— no desire for the unknown.” And there, perhaps, is the reason that not until later life did I realize what I had missed as a child. In fact, it was not until I was a Freshman at college that I ever really had the privilege of coming in contact with the remarkable effect that Fairy Tales and Legends might have on the human imagination. Anderson and Grimm were my roommate’s heroes. He often confided in me that, as a child, he was utterly grief stricken over the sad fate of “The Steadfast Tin Soldier”; “Hansel and Grethel” had thrilled him beyond words, and he could actually quote line after line of Grimm or Anderson. Perhaps you ask, “What does that prove?” Maybe you are wondering if it be not just a trifle queer for a full grown college man to retain his childish enthusiasm in Fairy Tales. The answer is this: I
I do not mean to imply that this man became proficient	(
in the mechanics,, of writing, the art of talking, and the	>.
knack of charming, simply because he happened to have read j Fairy Tales. But these attributes can only be attained through wholesome reading and plenty of it. The reading	(
of Fairy Tales had furnished the inspirition for future read-	>
ing. The man was exceptionally well read for his age.	J
A few years ago Douglas Fairbanks brought out a fantastic, imaginative motion picture. It was called, “The Thief 7 of Bagdad.” Dramatically it was a flop. Artistically it was	|'
beautiful. The settings incorporated painting, sculpturing, and architecture. All these arts had to be portrayed in the	r
imaginative style since the picture was a thing of magic	j
flying carpets, good and evil genii and the like. The result	I
was a masterpiece of artistic creation. And the inspiration? Fairy Tales, if you please.
Walter Damrosch, of New York Philharmonic fame, gives	,
us the very charming little story of how Deems Taylor com-	;
pletely lost himself in the fairy lore of “Alice in Wonder-	.
land.” The reuslt of this pleasant little indulgence on the	4
part of Mr. Taylor is his lovely suite, “Through the Looking , Glass,” the third number of which is the colorful “Hunt of the Jabberwocky.” In this particular number we hear the clarinet, who is the mighty hunter, pursue the dreaded Jab- i berwocky through a forest of string accompaniment to finally overtake and slay it midst a veritable tirade of death snorts and groans from the hideous beast; interpreted in the grand ■ style by the basson, most adaptable of all the instruments r of the symphony to the conveyance of pathetic comedy. All is done with a mock grandeur and a humorous seriousness of style that would indicate that Taylor has thoroughly caught and inspired himself with the spirit of the fairy i characters. “In fact,” says Mr. Damrosch, in his inimitable and completely charming manner, “if each and every one of ? you, my friends, have not, at one time or another, been thoroughly terrified by the hideous Jabberwocky, then you are c; indeed luckless fellows.”

^Moods of Summer
I.	AUTUMN
Ah, censure not the bride, breathe not her name, She lies denuded, all her passion spent;
The curious world beholds her in her shame, Some russet hair her sole integument.
And yet not long ago those same dull eyes Mirrored a fire that burned with happy glow, And all reflected in a mild surprise
Her love of living that no man could know.
Where is the husband, Spring, that he might try To battle for her life against the chilling Blasts of Autumn—ansiver to that cry— Obtain revenge for such a brutal killing?
But wait, she breathes! And near her someone creeps And lays a blanket on her while she sleeps.
II.	WINTER
Silent she rests, half dead and half alive, Autumn, her paramour, has fled his curse.
Close bedside friends pray that she may revive Under the ministerings of her cold, white nurse.
Alas! the bride has lost all love of life, Dejection plainly marks her pallid face Till all remember that she is a wife And yearning for her husband’s cool embrace.
Now other prayers go up, and soon they hear A distant soughing, cis of someone bold
Riding the wind; and when the sound draws near Summer arises from her icy mould
And then with joyous voice she starts to sing “I want to live. Come, kiss me, gallant Spring.”
III.	SPRING
A white-winged chariot dressed in gold and green Comes from the south upon a soothing breath, And joyful Youth Eternal seeks his Queen Quite unaware how near she lay to death.
And then he sees her rising from her bed With eyes be-diamonded by hurrying tears.
He clasps her tightly; and she strokes his head And sobs her shame, her sorrow and her fears.
But lovers sin, repent, forgive and vow
New faith to live with never a sidelong glance; And thus it is with Spring and Summer now, Swaying unknowing in one brief, sweet dance.
Yet soon the fated soul of Spring has floivn And beauteous Summer dances on alone.
IV.	SUMMER
Summer has felt a dream of joy too dear: Arm locked in arm with Spring, she gayly goes Skipping and laughing to the happy pier
Where care sails out, and shoreward the sea-wind bloivs.
Thus lost in dreamy ecstacy of love
She glides resplendent over towns and farms.
Then sadder than the coo of mourning dove She learns that Spring has died within her arms.
Oh, chilling burden, heavy as the Cross, Borne with less patience by a youthful wife: Does Heaven know' the gain that was her loss?
Do angels chant her threnody of life?
And while in gray despair she dully lay Bare, shameless Autumn hurried her away.

Marquette Again Bows to Notre Dame, 16-19
Both Teams Play Tight Defensive Game;
Andrews High-Point Man
Memories of a previous lacing at the hands of Notre Dame failed to inspire the Marquette quintet to vengeance Saturday night in the Blue and Gold gym, and the Hilltoppers dropped their second court duel with Notre Dame by a 19 to 16 score. The contest was featured by close guarding; fast, but not especially clever floor work; and basketshooting of rather an ordinary variety. Having piled quite a substantial lead in the first half, the Keoganites were content to coast to victory, in spite of the spirited attack which the visitors launched in the closing minutes. The ball remained in the hands of the Notre Dame tossers most of the time, who, however, failed to capitalize most of their scoring opportunities.
During the opening minutes, the score zig-zagged back and forth with neither side enjoying a margin of more than one or two points. But then .the Blue and Gold’s scoring potentialities became realized and Colrick, Jachym, and Crowe let loose a barrage of tallies which placed them safely in the van of their opponents. Tire Marquette players fought doggedly to check the changing tide of battle, but their efforts were relatively ineffective during the initial period.
Assaying a come-back, however, in the second half, the Milwaukeeans more than once threatened to break up the game with a number of long shots. A few of these dropped through the net, but the majority of them bounded back off the board into the hands of the Notre Dame guards.
From the spectator’s point of view, perhaps the most interesting feature of the game was the scoring duel waged by the two rival centers, Colrick and Andrews. The rangy pivot man of the visitors emerged a shade the better when he ran his point total to nine after sinking four baskets, one more than Colrick. However, Colrick had the satisfaction of out-jumping his opponent on most occasions, in spite of Andrews’ six feet, three inches in height, and elongated reach.
Andrews, by the way, proved to be the main cog in the Hilltoppers’ offense. His all-around floor work was highly commendable and his habit of recovering the ball off his own backboard was particularly bothersome as far as Notre Dame was concerned. O’Donnell was the only other member of the Milwaukee team to penetrate the tight defense presented by Keogan’s men.
The most peculiar feature of the game was the notable absence of scoring in the second half. Half-time found Notre Dame ahead by a 16-11 score, and thereafter the sum total of the points registered by both quints amounted to exactly eight points. This may have been due to the uninspired brand of basketball displayed by the home team which probably saw fit to save its energies in preparation for the strenuous Butler affair Friday night, or more likely, it may have been caused by the stubborn defensive activities of both combinations.

NOTRE DAME “B” TEAM SUBDUES VALPARAISO UNIVERSITY; SCORE, 30 TO 19
A fighting Valparaiso University team invaded the Notre Dame gym last Saturday and managed to give the Blue and Gold “B” team some stiff competition before going down to defeat by a score of 30 to 19. The game was played as a preliminary to the Marquette-Notre Dame attraction the same evening.
The first half of the contest was fast and hotly contested. Both teams successfully employed air-tight defenses and both used tricky offenses. The second half found Notre Dame forging rapidly into the lead as Valparaiso slowed up. In the closing minutes of the game the visitors rallied and began to pepper the iron hoops from all angles. The final gun abruptly terminated their belated scoring efforts, however.
Gavin, flashy Notre Dame forward, opened the scoring with a two-pointer from under the basket. Valparaiso quickly retaliated wtih a basket and a free throw, and for the remainder of the half the lead constantly changed hands. The Blue'and Gold opened up in the second period with a rush.
Gavin, Teders, and Carideo were the main point-gatherers for Notre Dame, while Van Buskirk, Biease, and Doran starred for the visitors. Summary:

O’BRIEN BETTERS WORLD INDOOR | HURDLE RECORD AS TRACK TEAM |	LOSES TO WISCONSIN
i Wisconsin again proved to be a jinx in im-{ portant athletic contests with Notre Dame this year when the Badger track squad defeated Coach Nicholson’s proteges at Madison last Saturday, 57 to 29. The final score, however, is by no means a fair indication of the true margin of vic-t tory, as the summaries reveal. Indeed, it was y only in the high jump, pole vault, and relay that - the home team registered decisively. In all the other events Notre Dame waged a stiff battle for scoring honors, in spite of the fact that the Badgers captured first place in eight of the ten events.
The outstanding feat of the meet was achieved by Johnny O’Brien who topped the 40-yard high hurdles in bettei- than world record time. The flying Californian covered the distance in five and three-tenths—breaking the previous mark by onetenth of a second. There exists some doubt, however, as to whether this new record will be recog-nized, since the A. A. U. has adopted the policy \ of disregarding records broken by the' narrow - margin of tenths of seconds.
Captain Elder repeated his customary practice 7 of taking the dash event. The stocky Kentucky - flash was hard pressed in the 40 yard sprint by . the rival captain, Larson, of Wisconsin, who came J; within a foot of breasting the tape first. These S two events, the hurdles and the dash, were the only ones which the visitors annexed.
The Cardinal runners won both of the distance races, but were obliged to exert their greatest efforts in doing so, breaking the gym record in both instances. The Brown brothers, Bill and John, were the chief causes for all this expenditure of effort. Considering the condition of the Madison track, the marks of 4:29.5 for the mile, and 9:48.8 for the two-mile, achieved by Moe and Goldsworthy respectively, of the Badgers, were truly phenomenal performances.
The half-mile event proved to be rather a freak affair. At the beginning of the final lap, Starter Lightbody neglected to fire the gun. Therefore, “Joe” Quigley of Notre Dame, who held the lead, did not know just how far he had to go. So the Blue and Gold runner permitted Fink of Wisconsin to pass him without offering any opposition, and then proceeded to tear off an ? extra lap, which was quite unnecessary.
; “Bob” Walsh heaved the shot forty-five feet, two inches, but still fell a foot short of the best toss of Behr, Badger football star. Behr had
J deserted his basketball activities to take part in 5 this one event, accounting for five of his team’s | point total. Walsh’s performance was encour-| aging nevertheless, to Notre Dame supporters, as L it was his best effort so far this year, and an 5 effort which gave every indication of being re-; peated in future meets.

237 ATHLETES TO COMPETE IN CENTRAL CONFERENCE GAMES HERE
TOMORROW
World and American records may tumble to the ground here Saturday afternoon when 237 athletes representing 20 schools gather in the Notre Dame gym for the third annual indoor track and field championships of the Central Conference. A capacity crowd of 4,000 persons is expected to look on.
The following schools will send squads of from three to 25 men to the meet; Ohio Wesleyan, Western State Normal, Marquette University, Coe, DePauw, Lincoln University of Missouri, Butler, Bradley, City College of Detroit, DePaul, Drake, University of Detroit, Duquesne, Grinnell, Hillsdale, Kalamazoo College, Lombard, Michigan State, and Miami. Notre Dame has won the meet the past two years.
In addition to the fourteen events listed for college competition, a one mile relay will be staged for high school entrants. Dashes, hurdles, middle and long distance runs, relays and the standard field events, comprise the program. Medals will be awarded to the winners of places in the individual events, while trophies will go to the victorious squad and to the winning teams in the three relay races.
Confronted with strong rivals, all of whom have been dangerous contenders in the past two championships, the Notre Dame squad is expected to be pushed hard for team honors. Michigan State, Marquette, Butler, and Western State Normal boast strength this year and any one of them may wrest the title from the Fighting Irish.
A coterie of individual stars will lead the assault on the records. Many of them are out to repeat their winning performances of a year ago, while several new luminaries have come into their own during the present track season. Capt. Dwight Kane of Ohio Wesleyan, national college high hurdle champion, Capt. Jack Elder of Notre Dame, co-holder of various world records for the short sprints, Lewis of Detroit City College, a member of the 1928 Olympic team, and Joe Sivak, a Butler sophomore who has been running remarkably in the distance events all winter, lead the pack of individual stars.
Elder, and Walls of Lincoln University, the negro lad who trimmed Loren Murchinson a year ago in the 50 yard dash, are looked on as probable winners of the 60 yard event. Capt. Mike Trepps of Marquette and Hensen of Michigan State may upset the dope, however. Johnny O’Brien of Notre Dame, Loving of Western State and Lewis will seek to displace Kane as conference champion in the hurdles.
A classy field will go after the ribbons in all of the distance events. Grubb of Lombard and Bill Brown of Notre Dame should race it out for mile honors, while Sivak of Butler, Lauren Brown of Michigan State and Johnny Vaichulis of Notre Dame are favored in the two mile run. Earl McAtee of Michigan State is figured as the pole vault winner, and Bob Walsh of Notre Dame looks like the titlist in the shot put.
Preliminaries in the pole vault, middle distance runs, dashes and hurdles will be held Saturday morning, while the finals of all events are scheduled for the afternoon.—F.E.D.

BADIN AND MORRISSEY TIE FOR HEAVY TITLE; MORRISSEY “B” CAPTURES
LIGHTWEIGHT CROWN
Monday night’s games terminated the schedule for the heavyweight teams, while the lightweight discussion came to a close the following evening. Badin and Morrissey were deadlocked in their group, while Morrissey “B” won undisputed claim in the “little fellow’s” section. Last night Badin and Morrissey met to determine the supremacy of the heavies. The semi-finals of the Round-Robin, composed of the first four teams in the lightweight class, were also played last night; the semi-finals in the heavyweight Round-Robin series, composed of the first four teams, will be played on Saturday night. On Sunday afternoon at 2 p. m. the two survivors of‘the lightweight Round-Robin will clash to gain the cup and championship of the league. Following this game, at 3 p. m., the finalists in the heavyweight RoundRobin will strive for the “campus championship.”
BADIN 16—CARROLL 13
In a well played, hard fought game Carroll fell before the attack of Badin after the former bitterly contested every effort of the league leaders.
LYONS 22—HOWARD 19
Each team displayed a smoothness which was unusual for an inter-hall game,' and it wasn’t until the final period that Lyons showed its slight superiority.
WALSH 15—FRESHMAN 7	'
Little effort was extended by Walsh in winning over Freshman. The game was listless throughout, as neither team showed much power offensively.
OFF-CAMPUS 22—CORBY 16 „
Going into the second half trailing by nine points, Corby made a strong bid to overtake the Off-Campus group but the margin proved too great.
SOPHOMORE 16—OFF-CAMPUS 13
After dropping a game earlier in the week, Sophomore came back to subdue the fast-slipping Off-Campus team in a hotly contested match.
LYONS 25—BROWNSON 12	.
Displaying an offense which completely bewildered their opponents, Lyons flashed through to an overwhelming defeat of Brownson.
MORRISSEY 20—SOPHOMORE 9
Morrissey’s stalwart defense proved too much for Sophomore, though the latter fought stubbornly throughout. This win deadlocks Badin and Morrissey for the leadership.
CARROLL 26—SORIN 16
In an interesting game, much more than the score would indicate, Carroll came through with a victory after being headed for a short while.
CORBY 24—BROWNSON 17
By virtue of its victory over Brownson, Corby accomplished two things: they registered in the win column for the first time and stepped out of a tie for the cellar berth.
MORRISSEY 21—SORIN 18
The co-league leaders won their second game in four days by downing Sorin. The Seniors threw a scare into their opponents but Bloom’s accuracy kept Morrissey in front.

♦ SPLINTERS FROM THE PRESS BOX *
At the annual meeting of the I. C. A., held last week in New York, Notre Dame was denied admission on the grounds that hei* “scholastic eligibility rules were not considered in accord with the laws of the national college organization,” to quote the New York Herald-Tribune. It seems to us that a school which has no difficulty in booking contests with members of the Western Conference, which is possibly the strictest of all collegiate governing bodies, would be recognized as having at least an average standard of eligibility by an organization which includes in its membership
schools which are hot considered to be too strict in their eligibility requirements.

Consistency is always a true mark of greatness. Michigan’s victory over Wisconsin last week showed the Wolverines to be the better money team.

In a praiseworthy effort to develop distance men, H. J. Swartz, manager of the Penn Relays, has announced that the 3,000 meter steeplechase, usually run only during Olympic years, has been made a permanent feature of the games. Lawton Robertson, Penn’s Olympic track coach, was instrumental in having this event retained. If more organizations would show a similar interest in distance running, the United States would not make such a disgraceful showing in the distance events.

A
Not the least of the many outstanding performances turned in at the Intercollegiates last Saturday was that of Phil Edwards, N. Y. U.’s great negro runner. After placing second to his teammate Hickey in the mile-run, Edwards came back to run anchor on the winning two-mile relay team.
Vean Gregg, one of the older generation of lefthanded pitchers, once struck out 21 men, using almost exclusively a curve ball. This particular game was pitched against Pittsburgh while Gregg was playing for Cleveland. He is recognized as one of the greatest curved-ball pitchers of all time.
Cuba plans to have a Central American Olympics next year to prepare the Latin-America countries for the 1932 Olympics. We doubt, however, that these games will supplant the favorite national sport of these countries, that of throwing a revolution every now and then.
