The Parker Vaeumatie— Invented by a University Professor to replace pens that suddenly run dry in Classes and Exams
THE marvelous new Parker Vacu-matic is no more like the pens of yesterday than your 1935 car is like a ’25 model.
It’s the identical pen you’ve often said that someone ought to invent.
Scores of inventors tried to—fully 250 sacless pens were patented before this miracle writer was bom. But none found a way to surmount the mechanical faults of squirt-gun piston pumps, valves, etc.
Then a scientist at the University of Wisconsin conceived the Vacu-matic. And Geo. S. Parker, world’s leading pen maker, agreed to develop it because it contained no rubber sac or lever filler like sac-type pens—no piston pump as in ordinary sacless pens.
That’s why Parker can—and DOES—guarantee the Vaeumatie MECHANICALLY PERFECT!
Because there is nothing else like it, the United States and foreign countries have granted Parker; patents.

SUMMER DEATHS TAKE SEVEN FROM CAMPUS
SOLEMN HIGH MASS INAUGURATES NINETY - SECOND SCHOOL YEAR
During the summer, death deprived the campus of seven Notre Dame men. Familiar to many in the University theater and to those who frequented the music department was
Rev. William A. Molony, C.S.C. R. I. P.
Brother Cyprian, C.S.C., who, in recent years, lived in Washington Hall. He died on July 29’, a victim of a heart attack and partial paralysis. Brother Cyprian taught accounting and bookkeeping at Notre Dame for 36 years and was director of the backstage operations in the theater from 1895 until his death. As chairman of the executive committee of the Philopatrian club, Brother Cyprian came into close contact with many distinguished men. Among his personal friends were former President William Howard Taft, Alfred E. Smith, William Jennings Bryan, William Gibbs McAdoo, Eamon de Valera and a number of papal delegates. He spent his last four years in comparative retirement, remaining active, however, in the backstage operation of Washington Hall.
On July 2, the Rev. Wiljjam A. Molony, C.S.C., ended a life of service to Notre Dame. He served Notre Dame since his ordination in 1893, except for four years at St. Edward’s University and at St. Joseph’s College in Cincinnati. Father Molony worked in latter years as assistant to the Rev. John F. O’Hara, C.S.C., president of the University. He was at various times in his long career director of studies and secretary of the University.

COTILLION . . .
Although the present school year is scarcely a week old, sophomores are already preparing for their cotillion which will be held, according to present plans, either on the evening of Oct. 18 or Nov. 8.	.
Class sentiment is in favor of the dance being held on the October date, but a definite time will not be set until the S.A.C. selects the week-end for the student football trip. If the Wisconsin game is chosen as the student trip, the cotillion will be held in November, but in the event the Ohio State game is selected the dance will take place on Oct. 18. The reason for this, according to the class president, Thomas Mulligan, is that he does not wish the cotillion to be held on the week-end immediately following the student trip.
President Mulligan will not announce the chairman of the dance, until the selection has received the approval of the Rev. Francis Boland, C.S.C., prefect of discipline.
cis J. Powers who died Tuesday, Sept. 17. A Notre Dame man himself, he served for a quarter of a century as University physician, and was in active service at the student infirmary until his death.
Three classmates of the thousands at Notre Dame this year met death during the summer. Jack^Sweeney, a senior, was fatally injured in an automobile accident near Logansport, Ind. Joe Donahue, a junior and native of South Bend, was killed in Independence, Iowa, also by automobile accident, as he returned to Notre Dame from a vacation in Nebraska. Charley Hodierne, freshman last year in Dillon Hall, died of lingering typhoid fever in Paterson, N. J.
Another man closely associated with Notre Dame died during this month — John Mischker, tailor. He had worked in hfotre Dame’s tailor shop for many years, and died in St. Joseph’s hospital Sept. 16.
FACULTY ATTENDS SERVICES

The ninety-second academic school year of the University of Notre Dame opened with impressive ceremonies
Rev. John F. O’Hara, C.S.C.
Delivered Opening Sermon
last Sunday morning in the Church of the Sacred Heart. “Education founded upon true Christian principles is the only solution to the problem of Communism in the United States,” the very Reverend John F. O’Hara, C.S.C., President of the University, declared in his sermon.
Proceeding the Mass, members of the lay faculty in caps and gowns participated in a colorful procession from the Administration Building to the Church. The Solemn Mass of the Holy Ghost, or the Red Mass, tradi-itonal service for the opening of the academic year, was celebrated with all its inspiring liturgical color. Officiating as celebrant was the Rev. J. Hugh O’Donnell, C.S.C., Vice-President of the University. He was assisted by the Rev. J. Leonard Carrico, (Continued on Page 22)

S.A.C. BEGINS WORK FOR YEAR,-BLUE CIRCLE IS DISBANDED
NEW COURSES BRING FACULTY ADDITIONS
FROSH CONVOCATION HELD
By C. F. Brown
Under the direction of Thomas Murphy, president of the Student Activities Council, a complete representation of the freshman class gathered in Washington Hall Monday evening, September,23, to attend the Fi’eshman Convocation.
Thomas Murphy He welcomed Freshmen
The meeting was held primarily to acquaint the yearlings with the Notre Dame cheers and songs in anticipation of the first football game with Kansas University tomorrow. Last year’s cheer leaders directed the songs and cheers of the freshmen.
President Murphy, after tendering a few welcoming words to the freshmen, introduced Reverend Francis J. Boland, prefect of discipline, wlio emphasized the spirit of Notre Dame men at athletic contests. Following this Coach Elmer Layden gave his welcoming address, combining with it several interesting remarks about Notre Dame football.
The various activities and organization of the S. A. C. are gradually gaining form. This year the Blue ■ Circle, the mysterious body of pep promoters, has been abolished at the request of the Prefect of Discipline. In the past the Blue Circle was composed of. students appointed by the S. A. C. but not belonging to that organization. This year a precedent will be established whereby a chairman of pep meetings arid his committee of assistants will be selected from the S.-A. C.
The question of, cheerleaders for this; school year has also gained the Council’s attention. The cheers for the Notre Dame-Kansas game will be led by the veterans of last year. However, try-outs'for the squad of mega-

POLITICS ...
“Jim” Boyle who graduated from the Notre Dame Law School last June evidently believes in beginning his law career with a bang, for he ran for mayor of his home town this summer and lost the election by a scant nine votes. Almost immediately after he graduated, Boyle took the Ohio Bar examination and passed it with a mark that was among the highest. When he returned to Hubbard, his home town, he began his campaign for the office of mayor. In Youngs-town, nearby, Jim’s father is a prominent lawyer.
Election time gradually drew nearer. Boyle got around and secured more and more votes. In the finals 500 votes were cast; this had not occurred in Hubbard since the presidential election in which Alfred Smith ran against Herbert Hoover. When the count had been made it was discovered that Boyle had lost the election by only nine votes.
While he was here on the campus, Jim won the Breen Oratorical contest. He was very active in the University Theater. Students in the Law School recognized Jim’s cleverness in ‘court.’ He was also an important cog in the Wranglers as well as being active in the campus radio station.
ENGINEERS CLUB
The first meeting of the Engineers’ club for the present year is scheduled for next Wednesday evening, Oct. 9. Negotiations are under way to obtain Mr. G. W. Blair, vice-president of the Mishawaka Rubber and Woolen Goods Co., as speaker at the first meeting.
The annual initiation of freshmen engineers will be held on Wednesday, Oct. 16. According to President Tom Hines, the club will have a membership of over 150 after the freshmen have been initiated.
Club officers for the present school year, in addition to Hines are: Vice-President, John Loritsch; secretary, Joseph Kumler; treasurer, Mike O’Connor, and junior secretary, Louis Purcell.
phone wielders' will begin next Mon-. day, September 30, according to President Murphy. He hopes that .capable men from the freshman and . sophomore classes will respond to the
call. From this group of unseasoned men competing next week , and the returning veterans, a head cheerleader, will be chosen for the year.

Latest enrollment records from the College of Engineering for the course in aeronautical engineering conclusively prove that the keen interest displayed last yeai’ when the course was first proposed was not a temporary enthusiasm on the part of the
Professor Christopher Hollis New faculty member
engineering students of the University. This new course, instituted after a series of conferences with recognized authorities in all phases of the science, will offer primarily and almost exclusively those fundamentals necessary for the student’s complete understanding of the vital principles of this particular industry. The infant course has already received the hearty endorsement of such prominent airmen as Eddie Rickenbacker, Al Williams, Colonel Bishop of Canada, and high officials of the Bendix Aviation Corporation, all of whom were consulted about its formation.
Equally as . sincere enthusiasm has greeted the new courses in the Departments of Politics and Economics. These two new courses dealing with current political and financial problems come at a time when there is an accepted recognition of the necessity for trained leadership combined with a rich and mature background of experience.
The Honorable Desmond Fitzgerald, Irish philosopher, author and political writer will , teach a course in the “Philosophy of Politics” and will also give, one public lecture a week. Mr. Fitzgerald, who is generally recognized as one of the finest of Irish scholars, comes, to the University with a colorful and splendid European record. ’ He is the author of ’’The Saint,” produced by the Abbey Theatre in 1919, editor of the Irish Bulletin from 1919 to 1922; Minister of External Affairs i n the Irish Free State from 1922 to 1927; and from 1927 to 1932 Minister for Defense.

INFIRMARY AND WALKS UNDER CONSTRUCTION
SCHOLASTIC BEGINS 69TH YEAR;
NEW APPOINTMENTS ANNOUNCED
By Louis DaPra
The University’s 1935-36 construction, a continuation of the §4,000,000 building program instituted here since the beginning of the depression, moves along at a brisk pace with developments on the new Students’ Infirmly and the campus beautification project.
To the rear of the Administration Building, Thomas L. Hickey, South Bend general contractor, and Jerry McNally, the architects’ personal representative from Fall River, Massachusetts, are rushing the stone and masonry work on the three story, §250,000, Collegiate Gothic design Infirmary, scheduled to be completed around the first of February.
It is the first building of the projected north quadrangle facing St. Joseph’s lake, which ■will have a clear sweep of the campus from the Administration building to the lake. Plans were drawn by Maginnis and Walsh, architects of Boston, Mass. Construction was started May 28th, on the infirmary, which, when completed, will be one of the most up-to-date collegiate dispensaries.
The infirmary will contain living\ accommodations for 125 persons with guest rooms for parents and other visitors to the campus. A fully-equipped and modern clinic, operated by skilled personnel, will offer the best of medical and health attention to the students.
The new cement walks, an integral part of the campus beautification pro-ject, scheduled for fall construction are to be completed this week. Further plans regarding additions to the project await the return of Brother Augustine, C.S.C., to the University.
FERA workers are already at work under the direction of Mr. Moser, clearing the campus for early land-'" scaping. When completed this part of the campus will be another step in the expansion at the University, and another scenic attraction of Notre Dame.
The old post-office which served the needs of the Notre Dame man from*-. 1916 to 1934, has been placed behind the Chemistry building, and according to present plans — will house an augmented Chemistry library.
Workmen are putting the finishing touches on the Howard Hall chapel, an annex built in the Collegiate Gothic design in harmony with the many new buildings here, which will soon serve the religious needs of the senior hall. . .

FOOTBALL TICKETS
From the manner in which application for tickets have been pouring into ticket offices, Notre Dame is still the magic name in football. To date the advance sale for the four games to be played here in the stadium shows a 20 per cent increase over that of last year. Reports from opponents show that large crowds are expected on the home fields when the Irish are the invading team.
As usual one of the biggest crowds of the year is expected at the Army game in New York, while the contest at Columbus with Ohio State will draw a record breaking crowd. Because the caliber of such teams as Pitt, Northwestern and Southern California, extra large crowds will journey out to the stadium to witness these home contests.

Professor Hollis, who will teach the “History of Money” and a course, in “Mediaeval History” was last year Assistant Master of Stonyhurst College in England and is a former president of the Oxford Union.
His literary efforts include biographies of Dr. Johnson, St. Ignatius, Erasmus, and Dryden; histories of Europe and of Glastonbury and England. His latest effort which came off the press last December, “.The Breakdown of Money” has thus far been well received and is the subject of considerable discussion among students of finance.
CLEVELAND ASSEMBLY HEARS FATHER O'HARA
The Rev. John F. O’Hara, C.S.C., president of the University of Notre Dame, addressed the seventh National Eucharistic Congress at Cleveland on September 24. His subject was “The Eucharistic Priest and the Catholic Action of Young Men.”
Before an assemblage which included such prominent men as Patrick Cardinal Hayes, personal representative of Pope Pius XI, Archbishop Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, apostolic delegate of the United States, Bishop Joseph Schrems, host to the Congress, James Farley, postmaster general and personal representative of President Roosevelt, and Alfred E. Smith, Father O’Hara stressed the point that “Catholic action is the fruit of Catholic life.”
The need of Catholic action was shown by Father O’Hara when he pointed out that every Catholic young man has at his elbow four other young men whose course of life is dictated by principles alien to his own; this means that in his daily intercourse with men, in his reading, in his work, in his entertainment, he is constantly exposed to the philosophies and the examples that are shaped by and foi' eighty per cent of the population.”
It was the duty of the eucharistic priest to counteract this influence of corruption “with his heart full of faith and his arms loaded down with the mercies of God,” said Father O’Hara.
In conclusion Father O’Hara said that “the future of Catholic Action in this country lies in the hands of the aevout ministers of the Sacraments of Penance and the Holy Eucharist. These divinely-appointed agencies of the supernatural life work in the soul that fullness that overflows into action.”
75,000 See Campus
With the aid of a guide service arranged and directed by the Alumni Office, an estimated 75,090 persons, varying from college, administrators and statesmen to members of carnival troupes visited the Notre Dame campus during the Summer just past. In each of the previous two Summers it was estimated that upwards of 150,000 persons, mostly those going to or coming from the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago, had visited the University.
Visitors came this year from China, Hawaii, Canada and from every state in the Union. Nearly all of them expressed amazement at the size and development of the campus, according to Chief Guide John Lechner, ’3% and his assistants, Harold Goebel, ’35 and Frank Timney, ’35.

540 RECEIVE DEGREES IN CLOSING EXERCISES
INITIAL PEP MEETING TO BE HELD TONIGHT
By Lindsay B. Phoebus
Amid the colorful ceremonies attendant upon the close of their college careers, last June 2, a class of 540 Seniors was graduated from the University. They were privileged to hear an excellent baccalaureate sermon from the Most Rev. Francis J. Spellman, D.D., auxiliary Bishop of Boston, and a memorable address from Shane Leslie of Glasgow, Ireland, a professor of English at the University last semester.
While a light drizzle of rain fell outside of the gymnasium, the Most Rev. John F. Noll, D.D., Bishop of Fort Wayne, celebrated a solemn pontifical Mass within for the graduates and about 3,000 of their guests and relatives. During the afternoon more than 5,500 crowded into the flag draped building to watch the graduates receive their degrees from the Rev. John F. O’Hara, C. S. C., president of the University, and to hear his parting address to the class of ’35. Also present at the ceremony were eight men who were recipients of advanced degrees.
All but two of the states of the union were represented in the graduating class. Of those students whose homes are outside the United States, the one farthest from home was Aziz Saliba El-Araj, of Ramallah, Palestine. He received the degree of Bachelor of Laws. Martin J. Gillen, of Land O’Lakes, Wisconsin, Professor Leslie, and Bishop Spellman all received honorary degrees as Doctors of Laws.
Immediately after the celebration of the solemn pontifical Mass, the scholarly procession of the faculty and the graduates walked slowly and quietly to the spot at the east corner of the quadrangle in front of the Commerce Building where the flag pole stands. There they performed the traditional flag-raising ceremony.
Other degrees conferred were those of Doctor of Philosophy on George F." Henion, South Bend, in organic chemistry, and Joseph A. Toussaint, Utica, N. Y., in physical chemistry; Master of Arts on Francis H. Herron, El Paso, Texas, Rev. Theodore J. Mehling, C.S.C., Notre Dame, and Charles E. Spangenberg, Elmhurst, Ill.; and Master of Science ori Brother Columba Curran, C.S.C., and Rev. Joseph R. McAllister, C.S.C., both of Notre Dame, and on Harry L. Wun-derly, Pittsburg, Pa.
The conferring of the two degrees of Doctor of Philosophy, Sunday afternoon marked the end of the three days of Commencement exercises.

A new edition of Notre Dame Pep Meetings will make its bow in the gymnasium at 6:30 tonight, in preparation for the opening football game of the season with the Kansas Jayhawkers tomorrow afternoon.
The rally will be featured by the first public appearance of the enlarged marching band. According to Prof. Casasanta the band this year has grown to ninety pieces. They will meet the student body at the dining hall and parade across the campus to the gymnasium where the formal rally will be held.
Speakers for the first pep session, as announced by S.A.C. Chairman Thomas Murphy, will include Rev. John Cavanaugh, C;S.C.,.and Athletic Director, Elmer Layden. In addition to the regular speakers the team members will be introduced to give theii' views of the coming season.
“We will make every endeavor this year to make the Pep Meetings memorable,” Chairman Murphy said. “We hope to be able to present the students with interesting and inspiring speakers who will help Notre Dame students send their football team on the field with the same spirit that has made excellent teams and sportsmanship a tradition at Notre Dame.”
Plans for similar meetings to precede all the home games are under way and will be announced as soon as completed.
KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS
The Knights of Columbus opened their year’s activities with an initial meeting last Monday night. Plans for the ensuing year were discussed, and an altered program was adopted. The plans .call for a more rigid adherence to parliamentary procedure which will facilitate more rapid dispensing with business and will leave considerably more time for the lecturer’s hour. .
The foremost change which was decided upon was the method of selecting new members. Formerly, almost anyone desiring membership has been admitted to the council, but under the new arrangement, each applicant will be subjected to close investigation by a special committee appointed for this purpose alone.
The policy of holding meetings at bi-weekly intervals on Monday nights will be continued as before. Similarly the Knights will handle the ushering at the student masses on Sunday. Carl Senger, chairman of the usher’s committee issued a call for members interested in this duty.

IN 1860 VACATION LASTED THREE DAYS;
CHANGES IN FACULTY
CRICKET WAS THE PRINCIPAL SPORT
MADE DURING SUMMER
By John A. Gillespie
Those who have been at Notre Dame for a year or more know that certain periods of the two semesters are reserved exclusively for “griping” —a malady that invades the best of schools. We hear plaints about food, restrictions, lack of social life, early rising and retiring, the weather, inhuman instructors, and examinations. But, in reality, we do not know how singularly lucky we are. Take a look at the records.
In 1860 the Christmas vacation
Going to town in the sixties.
lasted for three days. Every collegian was compelled to sign in at twelve o’clock on New Year’s Eve. Can you picture the concerted mutiny if such a rule were passed tomorrow? The registration would probably drop to 50 or 60 in September, 1936. Each student could have an entire floor of a hall, with a dozen showers and a few hundred windows with southern exposure.	.
' Visiting in private rooms was strictly prohibited in the scrupulous sixties. If this were the rule today, no longer could Tom Zilch help Joe Doaks eat the food from home; bullsessions, the solace of hundreds, would cease; more and more students would turn to canaries and gold-fish for companionship; perhaps the need for prefectural patrols would end. Think of the broken friendships that would attend such a regulation!
Strict silence had to be preserved going to and from all classes. Maybe they could do it then, but have you ever been in the Main Building at the change of classes? If you have, then
you can appreciate the impossibility of such a law now (if this be treason, overlook it).
But the early Notre Darners frolicked at carefully regulated inteiwals. Bicyclgs were the rule rather than the exception. A bright Sunday brought out scores of dashing wheelmen on daring expeditions to Mishawaka and points north. They even packed lunches, the gay blades. How proudly they whipped down the street, wheels whirring, spokes glistening, and mus-
taches framing their noble faces!
Wednesday morning was a free period-and at ten o’clock the entire student body would storm the treas-surer’s office for their weekly allowances. The capitalists got as much as fifty cents, of which at least half ' went to the candy store for such delicacies as rock candy and. lemonade.
In those days football was a minor sport; All-Americans and subsidizing were unheard of. The athletes went to the wars on the cricket field, the only arena fit for gentlemen.
We fortunate residents, of halls with showers can laugh at this rule; “In -winter, on Saturday at four o’clock, p.m., the students must wash their feet. In. summer this regulation is rendered unnecessary by the rule which requires the students to bathe in common twice a week in "Saint Joseph’s Lake.” In 1860 8135 covered the tuition for the complete year. .
Going back to 1854, we find that (Continued on Page 20)
Changes of duties affecting many Holy Cross priests and brothers were announced by the Very Rev. James Burns, C.S.C., provincial, at a meeting in the Sacred Heart Church on July 2.
Heading the lists of new obediences read at this provincial council assemblage was the granting of a sabbatical leave of absence to the Rev. Charles C. Miltner, C.S.C., for the purpose of continuing special philosophical studies, at the University of Louvain, Belgium. For the past 13 years Father Miltner has been Dean of the College of Arts and Letters and head of the department of philosophy. ’	'
Another important campus change was the assignment of the Rev. Thomas A. McAvoy, C.S.C., university archivist, to special studies and the appointment of the Rev. Joseph Fiedler, C.S.C., as his successor.
The Rev. Frederick Gassensmith, C.S.C., was sent by the council to St. Edward’s University as professor of mathematics.
Brother Chrysostom, auditor at Notre Dame for several years, was moved by the council to St. Edward’s University where he will serve in the capacity of treasurer and instructor.
Changes in hall rectorships sent Rev. John Ryan, C.S.C., from Lyons to Corby. Rev. Edward Keller, C.S.C. was made rector of Howard Hall, the Rev. Henry Glueckert, C.S.C. was transferred to Alumni hall, while the Rev. Thomas Kelly, C.S.C. was appointed rector of Lyons hall.
The change in hall rectors involved , the retirement of the Rev. James ; Stack, C.S.C., as rector of Corby hall, i After several years of efficient duty i at 'this post, Father Stack has now : taken up residence in Alumni.

Notre Dame, in the throes of growing pains, presents its returning legions with a sight that is both pleasing and otherwise. The shambles that is the south campus is without doubt a terrible eyesore and is probably pretty much of a shock to those freshmen who have heard about the beauties of the University. On the other hand, because it represents progress, it is a very welcome sight.
Destruction is always necessary before construction. A newer, greater, and more beautiful Notre Dame is what is intended and is an end which most certainly will be attained.
Already order begins to resolve itself out of chaos. Those cement paths give some indication of what the Notre Dame of the future will look like. Excelsior!
Certain pun-loving upper classmen have just about convinced some of the more gullible members of our freshman group that the last army of seniors which moved on to the wars last June, in departing, left all that debris on the campus. Well, maybe the class of ’35 was one of the wildest, wooliest crowds of its kind ever to encamp on this quadrangle, but it certainly can’t be held responsible for the condition in which this oasis in the prairies now finds itself. When the commencement exercises were completed, the men of ’35 made no mad charge for the exits. Instead, with much delaying and looking back, the seniors slowly and solemnly made their departure. After viewing their plight, we somehow don’t fancy the prospect of having their advantage of being on the outside looking in." ~
•
Mention of graduation will always remind us of Shane Leslie. Unlike the seniors, the great Shakespearian scholar tarried only long enough after the exercises in June to hastily wring our prexy’s hand, and then he bustled off, on his way to Ireland, we suppose. Previous to forsaking our cloistered halls forever, he managed
to leave behind some physical remembrance of his one year stay with us. Being an alumnus of Cambridge in England, he acted according to an old tradition of that university which requires that all departing students leave a memento in their rooms. Well, Mr. Leslie, a very big man, evidently does things in a large way, because on the wall of his Dillon Hall room he painted in immense letters, colored with the red and black of his college, an original Latin poem. Though Mr. Leslie wasn’t telling half the story when he claimed that “The paint rah slightly,” still the effect of the illuminated initial of the word beginning each verse, the likes of which we’ve never seen outside, of some old Bible, was not entirely spoiled.

As long as we’re touching on tradition, we might as well get in a bit about Father Farley’s hand bell. No greater admirer of traditions than the “editorial we” dwells on the campus, but never did we dream that a tradition would rise up and heckle us. Yet that’s precisely what the ancient custom of rousing the sons of Sorin in the early morning by ringing the old hand bell in the corridors has done. We toss nervously in bed at night now anticipating the clangor and the clamor that without fail will rudely shatter the gentle quiet of these late autumn mornings. But we really don’t mind so much. We’d rather lose a little extra sleep than have Notre Dame do without one of its traditions.
It’s amusing to see among the crowds on the campus the faces of those seniors who were very positive in asserting that this year would find them at spots far remote from Notre Dame. We notice, however, that Tom Keenan changed his mind about going to Fordham, that Pete Kowaczek decided not to attend a Chicago morticians school, and that Bud Goldman didn’t go to a university closer to Smith College after all. Notre Dame must have a fascination and a charm all its own that it’s always able to draw back to her the wayward ones among us. How strong her appeal can be we don’t seem to realize until we’re in danger of losing her forever.
Among those faces which are still absent from the ranks we miss one in particular. Jack Sweeney will never come back. He’s gone on to a place that’s even better than Notre Dame.

Upperclassmen returning to the campus this fall were saddened by the news that seven of Notre Dame’s sons had met death in one form or another during the summer. Although not all seven had graduated from the University, they had all identified themselves with the ideals of Notre Dame and as such deserve to be ranked among her sons.
Brother Cyprian, C.S.C., who had become somewhat' of a tradition even during his lifetime, heads the list of Notre Dame’s dead. Students now at the University knew him as a genial old man whose greatest delight was to sit on his favorite bench in the shadow of Washington Hall and chat with ”his boys.”
Father William Molony, C.S.C., was another member of the faculty who answered the inevitable summons this summer. His death saddened the hearts of countless Notre Dame men who had studied and worked under him.
Dr. Francis J. Powers, University Physician for 25 years died suddenly at the beginning of the present semester. A Notre Dame man himself, he brought to his profession an heroic concept of service together with a gifted and highly trained mind. Jack Sweeney, of Indianapolis, freshman class president in 1932-33, and a member of the present senior class was killed on his way back to school when the car in which he was riding ran off the highway. Charley Hodierne, ’38, and Joe Donahue, ’37, two underclassmen also met death during the vacation
ANOTHER YEAR OF SERVICE
With this issue, the sixty-ninth editorial staff takes over the management of The Notre Dame Scholastic. Since its establishment in 1867, The Scholastic has been at various times a literary publication, a combination literary-news issue, a daily paper, and a news magazine. This year we present another Scholastic, which, while differing somewhat from its immediate predecessors, will still attempt to serve the student body as well as they did.
Physically, we emerge in this issue with a new cover, new headline type and a full page frontispiece. However, it is the printed contents that we hope to offer new interests for the student body. We again open our columns to the student body as a medium of expression. “The Voice of the Campus,” the letter column which flourished three years ago will be continued. We invite your contributions, merely requiring that they be in good taste. Anything from Hitler to home towns is fit subject matter.	' ■
Notre Dame traditions, both academic and athletic will be chronicled in a series of news and sports features which begin in this issue. An outlet for the Notre Dame brand of humor which raised the late Juggler to the heights of collegiate journalism is provided with the introduction of “In The Juggler Vein.”
As in the past, we shall strive to present all the campus news as you want it. University groups and societies are invited to use The Scholastic columns as a means toward a much-needed revival of campus organization activity. Notre Dame faces a year of unprecedented progress and advancement. The 1935-36 staff is proud to be in a position to chronicle these events for future generations of Notre Dame men.—J. S. M.
KANSAS WELCOME
Tomorrow afternoon in the Stadium, Notre Dame will open its 47th football season with all the pageantry of cheering, playing bands and cheerleading antics. Nine gruelling contests lie ahead for the team and the task of Elmer Layden is as difficult as faces any coach in the country. It is possible, but not probable, that Notre Dame will win every game—the task is too tremendous in the face of many unexpected and trying setbacks.
The Notre Dame student body has always supported and defended its team whether it be victorious or vanquished. Close to 3,000 students are backing Elmer Layden and his men tomorrow and as Notre Dame men they will still be wholeheartedly in support of their team even though the current “Fighting Irish” lose every game.
The Scholastic wishes to bestow upon Coach Layden and his aides the best of luck and welcome Kansas back to the Notre Dame schedule.—J. P. P.

JAYHAWKS PRIMED FOR SEASON’S OPENER
Both Squads Untested As They Engage .
In Initial Gridiron Contest Tomorrow
Injuries Hamper Contestants
By Jim McMullen
Notre Danie’s 1935 “problem” football team awaits the arrival of the Kansas Jayhawkers, their opening game opponent in the Stadium tomorrow afternoon. The western boys are scheduled to arrive shortly before noon and repair immediately to the University in preparation for the ■ conflict.	’
The eyes of the middle west will be on the Jayhawkers and they fully realize their opportunity. Two years ago, they opened with the Irish and startled the football world by holding Hunk Anderson’s eleven to a thrilling scoreless tie. This season they are to test the early results of Elmer Layden’s second edition of a Notre Dame team. It would be strangely ironical, if two members of the Jayhawk squad could aid again in shattering the hopes of a belated Irish comeback.
John Peterson of Wiffield, Kansas, and Dick Sklar of Monongahela, Pa., were the two thorns in the side of the ’33 eleven. Peterson, then a left half has been shifted to fullback, while Sklar remains at his right guard post. Along with these veterans come two senior linemen, Ed Phelps, at center, and Tom McCall at left guard. The backfield, a weakness out Kansas way last year, has been reenforced by the (Continued on Page 17)

VETERAN KANSAS TEAM HAS
STALWART DEFENSE SAYS LAYDEN
According to head football coach, Elmer Layden, Notre Dame is facing a powerful and seasoned team from Kansas tomorrow afternoon. “Notre Dame’s record against the Jayhawkers is far from impressive,” said the Irish mentor. “Two years ago we were lucky to get a scoreless tie and men like Peterson and Sklar are back to form a nucleus for the Kansas team we meet Saturday. This Kansas team is one of the best defensive clubs in college circles. Last year no one team scored more than 13 points against it in a game. A veteran backfield in back of a fast-charging line is going to give our boys a busy afternoon. Our work is cut out for us and it doesn’t appear easy.”
MANY VETERAN NETMEN
LISTED IN FALL EVENT
The annual fall tennis tournament is expected to get underway early next week. Pairings are to be listed the lattei' part of this week. The first . tournament is for upperclassmen only. A large list of entries is expected because of the added interest displayed by the student body last year. The entries this year will be shooting for the championship won last year by Frank Weldon. Competition will be very keen and the winner will come through victorious only after engaging in many hard battles.

STRESS FUNDAMENTALS IN GRIDIRON DRILLS
KANSAS SCRIBE PREDICTS CLOSE GAME WHEN IRISH MEET VISITORS
By Cy Stroker
The Notre Dame football squad, under the direction of Head Coach Elmer Layden and his assistants, Joe Boland, Chet Grant, and Tom Conley, has been working furiously since Sept. 10 in an effort to get in shape for tomorrow’s openei' with Kansas. The team has been under a great handicap in the short time allowed for practice this year.
The first week and, a half was devoted entirely to getting the men in condition aftei' the summer and to intensify the training in the fundamentals—blocking and tackling. Layden insists that all of the squad be well versed in these fundamentals before the working out of plays has begun.
During the last week attention was directed to the formulating of offensive plays and the working out of a defense against possible Kansas sallies. Because of the large number of minor injuries suffered by many of the squad, Coach Layden has not held any scrimmage for several days for he wants his team to be in the best condition for tomorrow’s contest. The Freshmen ran through the plays which Kansas is expected to use and in this way enabled the Varsity to better prepare itself for the invasion of the Jayhawkers.
FOOTBALL OFFICIALS
Notre Dame will play host to some of the outstanding football officials this fall. Such famous whistle toters as Thorpe, Lane, Friessell, Birch and others will assure the Irish of fair play.
Those who will officiate at home games here in the'stadium are: Kansas game, Referee, Magidschn, Michigan; Umpire, Haines, Yale; Field Judge, Cochrane, Kalamazoo; Head Linesman, Maxwell, Ohio State. Pittsburgh game: Referee, Lane, Cincin-

INJURIES JOLT KANSAS SQUAD
By Allen Merriam
(Editor, Kansas University Daily Kansan)
LAWRENCE, KAN., Sept. 27— (Special) —When the Kansas Jayhawker swoops down on Notre Dame tomorrow afternoon, the old bird from the plains will have its tail feathers ruffled, its beak sharpened, and the old battle gleam in its eye. Elmer Layden will do well to instruct his fighting Irishmen to prepare for a busy afternoon.
Notre Dame was once regarded in these parts as the invincible dictator of American football. But those days are gone forever. Since the Notre Dame game was scheduled for this fall, Kansas football players have recalled that scoreless tie at South Bend two years ago and looked forward to September 28 with a “We've done it once; we can do it again” spirit.
Even head-coach Adrian Lindsey, though a trifle downcast over minor inj'uries which have dogged the squad and the short time his stalwarts have had to get into condition this season, is taking an optimistic view of tomorrow’s season opener.	.
Kansas, the coaches admit, is an “if” team this year. That “if” rests on the most promising of the twentyseven sophomores on K.U.’s squad of forty-five. This may sound rather discouraging, but shouldn’t to any one who saw two picked squad teams compete in a scrimmage game last Saturday.	'
This year’s starting Jay hawker eleven will be lighter and will have less ’ experience than last season’s. Weight is lacking in the backfield and the center positions, while experience will be missed most by the tackles and ends. A backfield composed entirely of veterans will probably answer the opening -whistle, but only fullback (Continued on Page 23)

THREE TILTS PLAYED BETWEEN N.D.-KANSAS
One of Notre Dame’s chief back-field threats this year will be left half-back William Shakespeare. As a ball carrier, passer, and punter he has few equals and this triple threat power he possesses will make him an invaluable part of the Irish offensive. Playing in his last year for Notre Dame, Shakespeare dons the blue and gold this season as a man of wide
experience in intercollegiate football.
Bill was born on Staten Island 23 years ago and attended, some years after that date of course, Public School 30 in New York. During his high school days at Port Richmond High School he was a member of the football, baseball, basketball, and swimming teams. He was captain of the football team for two years and it was in this sport that he showed
Sixteen
the most promise. In one game he made an 80 yard run in the last minute of play to win the game by a one point margin.
Shakespeare’s first experience in collegiate football was in the Indiana game during the fateful season of 1933. In this game he scored a safety which enabled the Irish to win the contest, one of the three victories of
the season. During the rest of the season, Bill played at left half alternately with Nick Lukats.
It was not until last year that Bill hit his full stride in football. From the very beginning of the season, it was his long and accurate punts that brought Notre Dame out of the danger zone when an enemy score seemed imminent. In the comeback against (Continued on Page 19)
1904—Kansas 24, Notre Dame 5. 1932—Notre Dame 24, Kansas 6. 1933—Notre Dame 0, Kansas 0.
Of all the schools which Notre Dame has met in a modern football series, only two, Nebraska and Kansas, can boast of gaining an even break on the gridiron with the Irish.
The Notre Dame - Kansas series stands even tonight on the eve of the fourth battle with one victory to the credit of each school and one tie. Kansas won the first game, played at Lawrence in 1904, by the score of 24 to 5. Notre Dame had risen to national prominence when the two teams met again in 1932, but the Jayhawks put up a terrific struggle before they went down to a 24 to 6 defeat.
The Scholastic of November 13, 1904, gives an interesting account of the first game. Notre Dame had all the better of the fray during the first half. The Irish twice carried the ball by a series of rushes, to the ten yard line only to lose it there by “unlucky plays.” Guthrie, Fansler and Church did most of the ball carrying in Notre Dame’s sustained attack.
The fatigue caused by the long trip and visit to the World’s Fair in Saint Louis began, however, in the second half, to have its effect upon the Irish. First string players were now compelled to retire in favor of plucky but inexperienced and lighter men. Kansas backs tore through the weakened line and, although the Irish fought desperately, the Jayhawks scored four times.
In 1932, Kansas made a gallant effort to repeat its victory when it gave Notre Dame, still wobbling from the Pittsburgh disaster, a stubborn fight before succumbing 24 to 6. Kansas scored on the first five plays after the kickoff.
The Kansas stands were still celebrating the Jayhawk touchdown when Nick Lukats skirted left end, swung out into the clear and spirited fortyseven yards for the first Irish score. With only a few minutes of play remaining in the first half, Joe Sheeket-ski dashed through a hole off right tackle, fought his way into the clear and eluded the Kansas safety man to dash sixty yards for a touchdown. George Melinkovich, with a sixty yard touchdown jaunt around right end, and Koken who scored from the 12 yard line, put the game on ice for the Irish in the second half. Kansas fought Notre Dame to a scoreless tie in the famous 1933 opener.

DE GARMO TAKES FIRST IN SUMMER TENNIS MEET
FIRST GAMES ON NOTRE DAME SCHEDULES HAVE PROVIDED MANY THRILLING MOMENTS
The annual Summer session tennis tournament was conducted during the last part of July and drew an entry list of 32 players. The two finalists, Jack DeGarmo and Gonzales Valdes
John J. DeGarmo “ ‘Vasco'—He sails boats”
coursed through the early rounds without much difficulty, each winning their matches in straight sets.
The final match was a combat of the speed and power of DeGarmo against the steady, watchful play of Valdes. During the first two sets, DeGarmo was unable to control his bullet-like drives and lost, 1-6, 3-6. Valdes, in the final three sets, gradually cracked under the strain of DeGarmo’s onslaught, and the latter emerged victorious with the scores, 1-6, 3-6, 8-6, 6-4, 7-5.

experience of Ginnangelo, Harris and ^Stukey, to aid Peterson. The Irish must realize that they are facing the strongest defensive team in the Big Six, no slouch of a league.
)*
Coach Layden intends to start practically the same lineup that faced the Sophomores ■ last week. That will find Peters and Millner at the ends, Michuta and Pfefferle at the tackles, Becker and Lauter at guards, and Pojman, center. In the backfield, Fromhart will call the signals, with Wojcihovski and Shakespeare at the halves, and Fred Carideo at full.
A nation of synthetic alumni look again toward Notre Dame for an old time “Fighting Irish” eleven. The team, greatly urged on by the inspiration afforded them through the loss of their chosen leader Joe Sullivan, are raring to go. Kansas blacks the way tomorrow—what then? and then what?

On the eve of its forty-seventh opening football game Notre Dame is able to look back upon an enviable record of initial season tilts dating from a November day in 1887 when the Irish engaged in their first and only intercollegiate game of that year with the University of Michigan.
Opening game in 1009—Notre Dame 58, Olivet 0
The Irish have tumbled in defeat in opening games but for a long period of years from 1896 to 1934 they refused to bow to any opponent no matter how great its football record. Notre Dame teams have stepped right into high powered competition the first game of the year and have rarely met a so-called “set up” in the early fall days.
Notre Dame’s football history started inauspiciously when it met the mighty Michigan team of 1887. The Scholastic of that year tells us; “On account of time only a part of one inning was played and resulted in a score of 8-0 in favor of the visitors.” The following year, 1888, Michigan returned again and handed the Irish their worst beating ever experienced in an opening game, winning by a score of 26-6.
The next few years saw Irish football fortunes rise and fall. In 1896 the College of Physicians and Surgeons came to Notre Dame for the opening engagement of that season and handed 'the Irish a 4-0 beating, the last loss of a first game that Notre Dame was to suffer until 1934 when the unheralded Texas team, coached by a Notre Dame man, Jack Chevigny, came 'North and surprised the football world by defeating the Irish 7-6.
The team that Knute Rockne played on as end has the distinction of running up the largest score of any opening game in the history of Notre
Dame football. The year was 1912 and the victim St. Viator’s College. The final score was 116-7. The Scholastic of that year did not consider the contest a football game but “a competition of Notre Dame backs for the scoring honors.”
Probably the best battle given by
a smaller college, prior to 1933, took place in the opening game of 1928. Loyola College arrived at Notre Dame on a cold October day and immediately went to the field and donned their uniforms for the game. They surprised everyone by scoring first in the early moments of the game and holding that lead throughout the second and third periods. The.Irish finally tied the score in the last quarter but it was not until the last few minutes of the last quarter that John Niemic was able to score the final and winning touchdown of the game. The Irish of those days were surprised at being pushed to win an opening game. In 1911 Loyola had toppled under an 88-0 avalanche of Notre Dame touchdowns.
In 1932 saw the last Irish victory in an opening game. The plucky Haskell Indian College team were .the victims and succumbed easily by a score of 73-0. Then came a startling Kansas team in 1933 and held the Irish to a 0-0 tie. The football world was astounded at the result, but the Kansas game of that year was only a slight foreboding of what was to befall the Notre Dame team of 1933. The Irish were to experience its worst football season in the history of the game, that, year. •
Last year under a new coach and bolstered by a new spirit the team met Texas in its initial game. A fumble, early in the game allowed Texas to score the first touchdown.

VARSITY ELEVEN HUMBLES THE SOPHOMORES IN ANNUAL INITIAL FOOTBALL CONTEST
By Arch Gott
Displaying all the pep and fire of the traditional “Fighting Irish,” the football squads representing the Notre Dame varsity and the Sophomore varsity candidates squared off at each other last Saturday in the Stadium and the varsity featured a smashing second half rally to forge ahead to a 33-13 victory. An enthusiastic crowd of 10,000 saw four 30-minute quarters packed full of exciting football; ■what’s more they saw the eager Sophomore squad at the long end of a 13-6 score when the gun sounded to end the first 60-minute half.
The Sophomores elected to provide the main fireworks in the first half and they chose to attempt the sensational. Immediately following the opening kick-off, Pfefferle blocked a Sophomore punt and Millner scooped it up to dash 20 yards for a varsity touchdown. This seemed to spur the Sophs to action. A long pass from McKenna of the Sophomores bounced off the finger tips of two varsity men into the waiting arms of Borowski who fell over the goal line to score
Wally Fromhart “He’ll Ape Carideo”
for the. second year men. The score at 6-6, Pilney and Danbom took over matters for the varsity and ran the ball deep into Sophomore territory. Pilney’s hurried pass from his opponents 10-yard line was intercepted by the Sophs who began a vicious drive which netted them a score. Two flashy backs, Horan and Puplis ran and passed to midfield until Horan flipped a short toss to Puplis who darted skillfully along behind fine interference by Arboit for a 40 yard scamper to a touchdown. The Sophs converted the point and led at the half 13-6. Many penalties were incurred chiefly by holding and offsides. For the sophomores, Kuharich, starting right guard, played a great game making some brilliant tackles and (Continued on Page 21)

FIGHTING IRISH
The expression, “Fighting Irish,” is a sacred thing in the annals of Notre Dame’s sports history. It arose decades before the Michigan - Notre Dame game of 1909 as many would have it. It represents a spirit which cannot be placed in any one era or at any one place. The pages of the history of our nation have been seared with examples of that spirit.
The founding of a Catholic institution in these parts met strong opposition. The natural result was that the first athletic teams from .the University were not given what we would term sportsmanlike receptions. Advance reports referred to us as the “Notre Dame Catholics,” and the “Notre Dame Irish.”
Of course the terms were not inclusive of the men on the teams. As years passed by the true quality of these teams was slowly recognized and the synonym, “Irish,” with the modifier “Fighting” prefixed turned from a phrase of ill-favor to one of distinction—and so it has remained. In the early twenties of the present century, sports writers in their relentless search for slogans billed Notre Dame as the “Ramblers,” “Vikings,” and “Nomads.” All these terms sought their justification in the fact that Notre Dame traveled greatly. With the erection of the splendid Notre Dame stadium in 1930 the Irish football teams have played at least four tilts a season on their home field and in so doing have forever blotted out these unjust and unwanted slogans.
Notre Dame treasures and defends the “Fighting Irish.” It is a tradition, it grew out of the genius of a people, as such it is a sacred thing.

THE CURTAIN RISES
Notre Dame’s famed football machine opens its 47th season tomorrow afternoon against the untried Kansas outfit. The last time the Jayhawkers visited the Irishers’ football crater was in the fall of 1933 and the visiting Kansas combine held the highly favored Anderson eleven to a scoreless tie. It was the first time since 1901 that Notre Dame failed to win its football opener. The exhibition put on by the Irish team that day was very disheartening. Eleven fumbles marred Notre Dame’s attack coupled along with sorry attempts at passing all helped to thwart their serious

INTERHALL . . .
With the opening of the Varsity football season at hand the preparations, for the Interhall Football competition, breeder of many a varsity star, are gradually taking definite form.
Under the direction of Mr. Scannell, head of the department of Physical Education, the various Physical Education students appointed by him to act as coaches of the different halls have already issued their first call for •candidates.	’
Interhall football activities are under the direction of the Department of Physical Education with junior and senior students working as coaches of the teams and as officials of the games. As usual the Freshman Halls have shown the greatest interest in the proceedings, and as usual Brownson and Carroll appear to be the strongest contenders for the Interhall championship. It is reported that Corby, after several lean years in Interhall sports, is the dark horse in this year’s race.
Fine teams are expected to take the field this year under the direction of the following Physical Education students: Velcheck, Brownson; Ed Crotty, Carroll; Moore, Freshman; Paul Smith, Dillon; Kirk,...Lyons; Schulz, Morrissey; Palkovic, Howard; Hennessy, Badin; Salerno, Alumni; McKenna, Walsh; Hauser, Off-Campus; Brovelli, St. Edward’s; Wentworth, Sorin; H. Gallagher, Corby. Uniforms are being issued by Mark Sheil, custodian of equipment, daily in the Physical Education Building.
As an added incentive to Freshmen participating on Interhall teams, it will be remembered that Dominick Vairo, captain of last year’s varsity and candidate for All-American honors, was noticed by one of the coaches while playing end on an interhall team in his Freshman year and given his chance on the Varsity. '
The first games will be played a week from Sunday and take place each Sunday until the completion of the schedules. The Interhall schedules will be published in next week’s Scholastic and posted in all halls.
FIRST GAMES (Continued from Page 17)
Then, inspired by being able to draw first blood on Notre Dame, the Longhorns played great football and held the Irish to one touchdown. At the end of the day by virtue of the converted point after touchdown the Texans triumphed and had the honor of being the first college since 1896 to defeat Notre Dame in. an opening tilt.
GAUL AND WALDRON ELECTED SPORT CAPTS.
By Mike Crowe
Frank Gaul, a catcher, will captain Notre Dame’s baseball team next spring. A player of the Mickey Cochrane type, Gaul will make a bid for the quarterback post in football, having already earned two baseball monograms. Last year, Frank batted

over 400. He also has the distinction of making one of the longest home runs ever made at Cartier Field. This wallop, made in his sophomore year, came to earth near the far left center field fence. With Gaul as captain, the baseball team is destined to play a fighting, scrappy game next spring.
The tennis team will be captained this year by Joe Waldron, a senior. A varsity performer for two years, Joe promises to be a consistent winner in his last year of competition. Though not a sensational shot artist, Waldron manages to come through in crucial stages. Captain-elect Waldron gets particular delight in exhausting his opponent and then deliver a flurry of spectacular shots to win his matches.

the Carnegie Tech “jinx” Bill carried the ball 56 yards for a touchdown. His passing was another feature of the Irish play last year. In the Army game he hurled a -50-yard pass to Vairo who then went over for the first score of the game. In the Southern Cal game his long pass to Mike Layden gave the Irish their first score over the Trojans in two seasons. In this same game his punting ability again came into use when he kicked Notre Dame out of the danger zone twice in an exchange of punts with Wotkyns. '	.
Aside from his football activities, Bill is majoring in history and intends to go on into law. During the summer he keeps in condition by working on the New York waterfront (Continued on Page 22)

So, men of Notre Dame, should you feel on the verge of complaining of your lot, consider the plight of the ancients, and be revived. Their’s was no bed of roses; they had no newly laid and lighted cement paths in front of Alumni and Dillon; they
did without cabs—strike or no strike; WSBT did not broadcast a play-by-play description of the cricket games in 1860. These turtle-necked boys took things as they came and were happy. They thought themselves lucky to be the representatives of a great institution (93 students). Personally, we’ll take 1935.

ON DOWN THE LINE
DID YOU KNOW:
GEORGE MELINKOVICH, DANNY HANLEY and ROCCO SHIR-ALLI, played in the All-Star game at Chicago. JACK ROBINSON was the favorite for the center post, but an operation prevented his playing... There was a great deal of criticism voiced against the coaches of the AllStars. Men like COTTON WARBURTON who traveled long distances to play in the game were not used. . . . MAX MAREK, heavyweight champion of Notre Dame for the past two years, won his fourth professional fight the other night. Quite a coincidence that he should begin his professional career on the LOUIS-LEVINSKY card—Max is one of the few men to hold a decision over LOUIS. ... COACH FRANCIS SCHMIDT of Ohio State says that Notre Dame is one of the teams the Buckeyes fear this year. Everywhere but on the Irish campus, however, a two-touchdown advantage is conceded by mutual consent. . . . JOE HOCTOR, the former Iona Prep star, who showed up so well in spring practice, is now fighting for dear old North Carolina State under the guidance of HEARTLEY “HUNK” ANDERSON. . . The Newspapers are writing about “WHITEY” ROBINSON who was a mighty sweet halfback while a Freshman here, but he tried to set a new record in flunks. .. North Carolina State has taken up the task of teaching the classics to the cowboy.
LOCAL BOY MAKES GOOD:
JOE BEACH, southpaw pitcher of last year’s varsity baseball team who was signed by the White Sox is playing right field for Dallas where he was farmed out. In over a hundred games, JOE has a batting average touching .340.
BEHIND THE SCENES:
WILMER ALLISON facing FRED PERRY in the National Men’s Singles and PATSY HENRY playing in the finals of the National Girls sent each other good luck telegrams—both scored upsets.
INDIAN UPRISING:
CHIEF LONE STAR DEITZ, backfield coach at Temple, has orders from “POP" WARNER, the Owls head coach, to get EULACE PEACOCK out for football. The negro speedster won All-State honors in high school. If Eulace intends to keep in training for the 1936 Olympics, he should keep away from the gridiron.

scoring efforts. Peterson, elusive left halfback, for the visiting eleven caused the Irish many tense moments. This same spry young' fellow, now playing fullback, will be in the Jayhawker lineup again tomorrow. Head coach Elmer Layden has his boys ready, it ought to be a grand affair, and your a priori thinker expects to see Kansas on the shorter side of the score by two touchdowns.
GOOD STUFF
From the “Campus Canopy by Ralph Cannon in the Chicago Daily News: “Football around here has never been quite the same since Notre Dame quit playing at Soldier field. Games like Pitt and Southern California on the lake front would have stirred up the town for weeks. Nevertheless, Notre Dame will draw big crowds, for these games at South Bend and their Ohio game will run to 90,000.”
Thanks for the blow, Ralph.

Shortly after the beginning of the second half the varsity started to click as Shakespeare running towards right end, cut in sharply on two plays through right guard and right tackle . for runs of 48 and 50 yards to touchdowns. These two plays took place in less than, three minutes. Perfect blocking made these real Notre Dame plays; every Soph was taken out of the plays completely. Once again Shakespeare bolted into the open on what appeared to be another touchdown gallop but he was downed suddenly by Clifford, Sophomore left end who fought his way through two blockers to get his man. During the afternoon Clifford showed great prospects by piling up plenty of varsity plays.
Two more touchdowns were chalked up by the varsity against a tiring but stubborn Sophomore eleven to end the scoring. Wilke tossed a bullet pass to Peters who scored easily and Darcy hurled the overworked pigskin into the arms of Crotty who romped across the goal unmolested. A touch-down by Sullivan was called back in the fourth period.

In stressing the - need for sound education Father O’Hara said: “Notre Dame gives you the discipline that you need for true citizenship. By its adherence to fixed principles, it rejects the poisons of Communism and other philosophies that afflict so much of secular education today.
“Notre Dame does differ from many educational institutions in its conception of academic freedom. On the other hand, outside the field of faith and morals, outside the field of metaphysical principles, there is a proper field of speculation, and in this field Notre Dame encourages you to roam with the greatest freedom, and the most eager curiosity. It gives you rules for correct thinking and its tries to lay before you the accumulated knowledge of the past as a guide to your investigation. To the confusion of those who see warfare between science and religion, Notre •Dame has achieved distinction in several fields of scientific research, and without the scientific work of Catholics elsewhere, we would not be living in the comfort we enjoy today. We thank God that we see no lessening of scholarly zeal in search of such truth.” ‘
On Sunday evening the sonorous bells from the Sacred Heart Church rang out to announce the beginning of the Freshmen Mission. The Mission is Notre Dame’s unique method of orientating her Freshmen in the ways of Our Lady’s school and particularly in pointing out to them the real, true spirit of Notre Dame. Each morning at 6:30 the Freshmen and Sophomores of Badin and Lyons -Halls attended Mass and instruction. At 7:30 every evening they crowded the campus Church for a sermon followed by benediction. The Reverend Eugene Burke, C.S.C., head of the Department of English, conducted the Mission which will conclude Saturday morning with the Papal Blessing.
Sunday evening, September 29th, the Mission for the upperclassmen will begin.	’

KANSAS SCRIBE (Continued from Page 15)
John Peterson, who began his varsity career against Notre Dame two years ago, will tip the scales at more than 180.
The middle of the line will be just as strong as any from the Big Six this season. Little Ed Phelps, the scrappy passer-back, will be most
capably flanked by Dick Sklar and Tom McCall, two all - conference guards. The tackle berths will be filled by John Seigle, former end, and George Stapleton or Jack Vogel, sophomores, in the absence of Dean Nesmith, who is out of this game with infections.
The potential scorers at the wing positions and in the backfield will be Rutherford Hayes and Clarence Winslow or Robert Kruse as ends, with
Mano Stukey, Fred Harris, and Joe Giannangelo assisting Peterson in the back posts. George Hapgood, Forrest Hardache, Bill Decker, and Emil Weinecke are other ball-luggers likely to see action.
Holding down the Irish, who seem headed for the national spotlight once more, will be a plenty tough assignment for this band of Jayhawks, but there’s a fine spirit on the Kansas squad. So watch out, Notre Dame!
