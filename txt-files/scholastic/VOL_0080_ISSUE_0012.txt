THE LETDOWN	?
Scene: A crowded trolley car. A young lady is vainly groping for her purse to pay her fare. A young man is standing nearby with anguish written plainly on his handsome features.	x
Young Man: “Pardon me, miss, but may I pay your fare?”
Several seconds of groping.
Young Man: “I beg your pardon again, young lady, but won’t you let me pay your fare?”
Young Lady: “Why, I don’t even know you, and anyway 1’11 have this purse open in a minute.”	„
Continued groping.
Young Man: “I really must insist on paying your fare. You’ve unbuttoned my suspenders three times.”
TALK OF WAR BOND DRIVES
On February 1 the students of the University of Minnesota concluded their Fourth War Loan Drive which had continued since January 19. The original goal was set at $36,700 — this figure was reached on January 26. By February 1, the deadline, the grand total had mounted to $45,769.55. The money collected in the drive will be enough to purchase four duck trucks and four amphibious army jeeps. Now that’s what you really call going over the top.
THE HELPFUL SOUL	,
A wealthy Baltimore dowager was driving home from her first aid course in her shiny Cadillac when she spied a man lying flat on his face in the middle of the street. “Stop the car, Charles,” she cried to her chauffeur. “Here is my chance to practice what I learned in class today.”	•	•*
She piled out of the car, landed her full 180 pounds astride the prone figure and began pumping the man’s arms * violently up and down. The surprised victim finally managed to find his voice. “For the luva Mike, Lady,” he entreated, “leave me be, willya? I don’t know what you’re doing but $ I’m trying to locate a leak in this sewer.”	■

OUTDOOR LOVERS	*
University of Cincinnati coeds have invented a new method of staying awake for mid-term examination cram- , ming. Instead of drinking, black coffee, they spend their study time in the invigorating outside and find it too cold to sleep there.

First N.R.O.T.C. Class Will Receive Ensign Commissions at End of Month
BY H. D. USINA
The United States Navy and the University of Notre Dame will see the first real union of forces at the end of this month when a number of Notre Dame’s native sons will be commissioned Ensigns in the United States Naval Reserve. The First Classmen of the Notre Dame Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corps will leave the campus four months ahead of schedule to constitute the first graduating class of the Naval R.O.T.C. since its organization.
News of the scheduled commissioning was released late last week by Commander H. B. Butcher, USNR, executive officer of the unit, quite unexpectedly, since original plans called for another semester An? " university and naval work.
Some 80 men will comprise this first
graduating class since the NROTC was established on the campus on Sept. 10, 1941 under the direction of Captain H. P. Burnett, USN, with Commander M. T. Farrar, USN, as the first executive officer.
The Naval R.O.T.C. at Notre Dame ranks with the largest of the 26 similar training units which have been established throughout the country. Its purpose is the training of officers to supplement those graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. All of these units were placed on active duty status as of July 1, 1943 as a part of the Navy College Training Program.
In the two short weeks intervening between commissioning much remains to be accomplished by the future Ensigns.
Physical examinations were given last week and changes have been arranged in the naval schedule of studies so as to provide a brief refresher course in several naval subjects.
Uniforms have been another big task facing the graduates. South Bend tailors received and handled the orders for outfitting and in two weeks have promised to provide complete wardrobes of blue, slate-gray and white uniforms plus the many accessories.
In addition to completing arrangements within the few weeks left to them, the First Classmen must continue with their regular schedule of University work and face a stiff array of final ex7 aminations at the end of this month. The graduates are sprinkled in the Colleges of Science, Engineering, Arts and. Letters and Commerce. They , will possibly receive “war degrees” from their respective colleges prior to commissioning for they must complete a full seven semesters, according to the Navy directive.
N.R.O.T.C. Seniors to be Commissioned at End of Semester
3
The number of men enrolled in the course of Naval Science and Tactics in September, 1941 was 165. Since that time transfers, failures and numerous other causes have cut the class in half. Training- over the period of seven semesters has been given in seamanship, navigation, naval administration, ordnance, marine and electrical engineering, gunnery, communications, military law, naval history and customs and in a number of other subjects so as to equip completely the NROTC students for their duties as officers.
Preference slips have been made out by each graduate stating the type of duty as well as the theatre of operations which would be of his choice. These requests have been forwarded to the Bureau of Naval Personnel and will receive consideration when orders to active duty are being arranged. Requests for duty have ranged from aircraft carriers, destroyers and cruisers to battleships, submarines and the fleet air arm. Battleships, submarines and the navy air corps predominated. The Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean areas were among the theatres of operations favored with the Pacific area ranking highest.
Pour members of the unit—Jack P. Lawler, John C. O’Rourke, Thomas R. Shellworth and Charles M. Urruela— were previously scheduled to be commissioned at the end of this semester. Lawler will receive a “war degree” while the others will receive regular college degrees having completed a full eight semesters of college work.
A number of marriage plans went awry as a result of the shift in graduation dates. It is expected that the Naval Ball tonight will be the occasion for the announcement of engagements of several of the men.	■
Two summer cruises aboard naval training ships in the Great Lakes area have given the graduating members of the Naval R.O.T.C. practical work in the fundamentals of shipboard life. The course in Naval Science and Tactics which comprises their “minor” in the eyes of the University has furnished them with extensive knowledge of sciences of the Navy.
Members of the departing class all entered the University as civilians and were enrolled in the NROTC prior to Pearl Harbor and World War II. They have been active in all fields of extracurricular endeavor such as sports and the many campus organizations. In addition they have handled the officer posts within the NROTC battalion and played an important part in maintaining activities of varying natures within the unit itself.

"Ruddigore" is Well Received by Large Audiences; Closes Tomorrow Night
SIX SAVOYARDS
FROM THE GILBERT-
SULLIVAN-BIRDER PRODUCTION, "RUDDIGORE"
Washington Hall has already been filled to capacity twice this week. And “Ruddigore” has two more nights to go. The great popularity is due to the reputation the Savoyards have established with their past presentations. And this one has been well received. After more than a month of constant rehearsals, the local “company” gave its first performance Wednesday evening.
On the opening night this lesser-known Gilbert and Sullivan comedy operetta was presented to a full house. Anyone who cared to come was admitted without ticket or invitation. The result was a well-filled Washington Hall. Last night a packed audience was again present. At both performances the acclaim has been heartening, with spontaneous bursts of laughter and eager applause.
Tonight, Fi-iday, marks the third performance, and it will be given at 20:15 for the benefit of the V-12 contingent stationed on the campus,
The fourth and final performance will be given tomorrow for the Notre Dame alumni of St. Joseph Valley, and only those having invitations will be permitted entrance.
Mr. Cecil Birder is to be complimented on the production he has turned out. The ease with which the players go through their parts attests the amount of time, energy, and ability which has
been invested. Along with Mr. Birder, credit is due Mr. Lee Hope and his staff of musicians. Always dependable, Prof. Ingersoll lends his hand to complete the music section consisting- of about 15 men.
One of the show’s best features is the singing. That much work and more practice has gone into the production is quite evident. All performed well, with a few outshining the rest. Men like George Bastyr, Bernard Slater, Dick Ames and Bob O’Toole did more than their share to make the show a success. Gene Peciulis gave a fine performance in a part which seemed made for him. But the men are not the only outstanding members of the group. There are several comely girls, who with good voices and fine acting ability, nearly steal the show. Joan Michel, June Anderson, Agues Haney, and Dorothy Czarnecki do much for the general appeal of the operetta.
One thing that did not come up to par, and which had previously been publicized as being one of the outstandingfeatures of the operetta was the dancing. The steps were often lacking the expert touch which makes steps seem graceful. This one phase of the operetta could have been worked over more studiously. But in general it is a succes-ful production—Al Lesmez '

Midshipmen's School Indoctrinates New Class; Former V-12's, Fleet Men Among 1200
OBSERVATIONS
About 1200 navy men arrived on campus, Monday, to form the fifth class of the United States Naval Reserve Midshipmen’s School at Notre Dame. This class is composed largely of members of V-12 navy units who have completed training at other places.
Also in the new group are many “fleet” men who, because of particular aptitude, have been brought in from active duty for officer’s training.
Marine John Lynch Awarded Breen Medal in Annual Oratorical Contest Last Friday
Private John Lynch, USMCR, from Cavanaugh Hall won the annual Breen Medal Oratorical contest last Tuesday afternoon in Washington Hall when he emerged victorious from a field of seven finalists.
Choosing as the subject of his oration, “Post-War Rehabilitation,” Pvt. Lynch stressed the fact that, although the material and political aspects of European reconstruction must be considered by America, this nation’s most important contribution can be in the “psychological and cultural rehabilitation, upon which alone a worthy society can be built. Europe is old, and has gone through many experiences, ruination, starvation, death and torture, and neither idealistic formulas nor technological developments will mean much to her,” Lynch brought out. The abiding flame of revolt which will seethe within Europe must be turned from paths which will lead to self-destruction to “become the driving power toward a revived moral purpose and a new civilization.” This is where America can make its priceless contribution,
Formerly, most of the naval personnel attending the midshipmen’s school at Notre Dame came from ranks of the V-7 men; and this marks the first time that a large number of V-12 men have been enrolled. V-12 men, unlike most of the V-7 candidates, have already had some navy and military schooling, and will not find the situation as foreign as former V-7 men who generally came to the school fresh from civilian college life.
The trainees will spend about one week checking in, drawing clothing, equipment and books, being assigned to battalions and orientating themselves. They ■will remain as apprentice seamen for one month and then be classified as midshipmen. Those completing the four-month course will be commissioned ensigns in the naval reserve.
Included in this new group, navy officials said, are a large number of married men who will bring their wives to South Bend with them. In this they are being assisted by the Service Men’s Center which has requested readers of the Scholastic who know of apartments, or even sleeping rooms with kitchen facilities, to list them with Mrs. F. R. Spear at the Service Men’s Center, Telephone 2-3322.
teaching the precious lesson of the “worth and the dignity of the common man; the worth and the dignity of the common people.” “America knows__________,” Lynch went on, “that such a transformation of the human spirit requires for its perfect realization, love of neighbor, selfsacrifice, an incessant gift of self. Here heroism, equal to the heroism displayed on the battle field, is required. America means much to Europe, and must meet and accept the challenge which will result in the most glorious of all revolutions,” Pvt. Lynch stated in conclusion.
The Breen Medal competition this year was marked by the exceptional excellence of all the finalists, who gave evidence of a great deal of research and preparation. Besides Private Lynch, the finalists were : Richard Murphy, Eugene Diamond, Mark McGrath, C.S.C., John Walsh, C.S.C., John Van Wolvlear, C.S.C., and Richard Pearse.
This annual oratorical contest is the result of a foundation established by the late Hon. William Breen, an alumnus of Notre Dame.

ON ASSIGNMENTS FOR NEXT SEMESTER:
1.	All the supply corps candidates who are at present beyond their second semester in college and who are doing satisfactory work in their V-12 studies, will continue at Notre Dame next semester, unless they have completed their final semester of the number of semesters promised them when they entered V-12 with advanced standing. If they
have finished their final semester, they will stand by for orders as to their next duty, which will most likely be an assignment to a disbursing' or supply office at some shore station in the East, near one of the Navy supply corps schools, such as that at Harvard or the one at Wellesley. After a few weeks of duty at the shore station, they will be ordered to the Navy supply corps midshipmen’s school for four months.
2.	Of the trainees who first entered college and the V-12 program last July many will continue at Notre Dame next term, depending upon their classification orders which they will receive between now and 21 February — provided they are doing satisfactory work. The only men who are to receive classifying orders at this time are those men now in their second semester of college (i.e., the men who first entered college and V-12 on 1 July 1943, and the men who entered V-12 on 1 November 1943 with one semester of advanced standing). All upperclassmen continue for the number of semesters they lack of meeting Navy requirements for their- specialty (engineering, supply, deck, pre-medical). Men now classified in V-12a, aviation, who are now in their second semester, will receive orders at the end of this

Fourth Annual NROTC Ball at Palais
Tonight; Music by Buddy Franklin
Mary’s College and San Benito, Texas, will also receive the members of the Naval R.O.T.C. as they board the U.S.S. Notre Dame for the evening of dancing.
Tonight at the Palais Royale, members of the University of Notre Dame’s Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps and their guests will enjoy the unit’s Fourth Naval Ball. Within a week the Ball has changed from a farewell affair to a graduation dance for those members of the upper class.
The First Class with their dates, ap-proximately seventy couples, will be feted at their final dance prior to commissioning as Ensigns two weeks from now.
Buddy Franklin and his 13-piece orchestra featuring Harriet Collins as vocalist will come from the Chase Hotel in St. Louis to provide music for the evening. Franklin and another of his specialties the “Sweethearts of the Strings” — Yvonne, Hope and Sylvia — are expected to provide fine entertainment. Dancing is scheduled to get under way at 2100 and continue to 0100 with the spacious Palais and its environs exclusively at the disposal of the Naval R.O.T.C. and their guests.
Miss Ruthann Baker of Chicago, Ill., will be the Queen of the Ball being the guest of Chairman William W. Wicks. Chairman Wicks has devoted plenty of effort in handling the various details of the Ball and the efforts are expected to
Charles M. Urruela
be rewarded in a “never-to-be-forgot-ten” evening.
Captain J. Richard Barry, U.S.N., commanding officer of naval activities at Notre Dame, and his wife will head the receiving line. Commander H. B. Butcher, U.S.N.R., Chairman Wicks and Miss Baker, Battalion Commander Charles M. Urruela and Miss Jackie Buesing, Guest of Honor from St.
Decorations are under the expert care of Gene Moore and will follow a definitely nautical motif. Signal and semaphore flags plus a variety of seamanlike innovations will add a tang to the salty atmosphere. Chairman Moore will escort Miss Mary Tobin of South Bend.
John C. O’Rourke, bids and favors chairman, will have Miss Marijane Corbett of Chicago as his guest and the head of the orchestra committee, J. Richard Pedrotty will escort Miss Jeanne Reed of South Bend.
Since tonight’s ball will be the final one for the entire First Class it is expected that the event will be quite memorable. It was in April of 1942 that this same group of men started Naval R.O.T.C. tradition with the first Naval Ball at the Rockne Memorial. Two others have been staged and with the addition of another class of students have always proved highlights of the N.R.O.T.C. social calendar.
The Palais Royale, long the home for the traditional class dances held by University students in pre-war days, strangely enough was unknowingly chosen by the group of first classmen who remember the Notre Dame of before the war.
Invitations to the affair have been extended to the officer instructor staff of the Naval Reserve Officers Training-Corps as well as to South Bend friends of the unit.

B-X Reopens; Will Buy and Sell Used Texts
The “B-X,” non-profit Student Book Exchange operated by and for Notre Dame students, has reopened its doors in Room 10 of the Main Building. It will continue in operation from Monday through Friday from four until five P.M. until the end of the semester in order to accommodate all who wish to buy or sell used texts.
Sponsored by C.A.S., the “B-X” was originally planned and set up at the end of last semester to solve the used text-book problem on the campus. Using the retail catalogue of a large used book company as a price index, the service has abolished the.unfair price scale offered by professional book-buyers who formerly plagued the campus, and has protected incoming students against the depredations of. smooth-talking, high-pressuring upperclass book scalpers. Students wishing to sell textbooks in current use bring them to Room 10 and
are issued credit slips based on catalogue prices, which they may cash in or apply to the purchase of needed second-hand texts. If a student leaving for military service wishes to take advantage of this Exchange to sell his books for him, he may turn them in before he leaves and mail in his credit slips for cashing or have someone sash them for him. All books are accepted with the understanding that if for any reason they cannot be sold the student agrees to reclaim them by presenting the credit slip given him.
The work of the “B-X” is handled by students who are giving their time freely in order to insure a square deal for everyone. The service will again be opened for at least the first week of next semester.	■
N. D. Painting to Appear in New York Exhibit
By Edward H. Madden
Paul Byrne, university librarian, reports that the “Death of a Polish Exile,” a painting by Jacek Malczewski which belongs to Notre Dame’s Wightman Memorial Art Gallery, will appear in an art exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. This display will be conducted from February 16 to March 1.
The motif of the exhibit, as planned by the Metropolitan, is the exiled Polish government of the nineteenth century. All of the social, economic, and political upheaval have been recorded on canvas. It is the purpose of the Metropolitan Museum to collect these paintings and to group them for comprehensive observation and study as well as for public enjoyment.
“Death of a Polish Exile,” in a section of the Wightman Memorial Art Gallery, has heretofore been housed with the remaining part of the collection on the second and third floors of the university general library.
The art gallery is open coincidentally with the library, and it can be reached by using the stairway immediately to the left of the main entrance of the library.
NOTICE TO CANDIDATES FOR DEGREES
The convocation of the faculty of the University for the conferring of degrees at the end of this semester has been changed from the afternoon of Sunday, February 27, to the evening of Friday, February 25 — at eight o'clock, in Washington Hall.

Payday on Monday equals no hangover on Sunday. History repeats itself—
Little Moses who became a great leader in his day was found in reeds by a fair damsel, a princess, so we’re told. Today, on Saturday night marines are found in Reids by fair- (?) damsels. Could this be prophetic of our future leadership?
Things were plenty “fishy” around the third deck of Cavanaugh Hall last Friday night . . . fishy to the tune of eight cases of smoked whitefish and lake trout. Understand Pat Filly is still picking at the remains stowed under his bunk.
“Charge it.” -
“What name?”
“Czarobski.”
“Take it for nothing,” the druggist said languidly. “I wouldn’t write that name and potassium permanganate for a nickel.”
A y-12 and a Saint- Mary’s Rockette had been sitting out in the garden together for two hours. Finally he became desperate, leaned over, and kissed her. Immediately she began to shriek.
“Stop it, please,” he begged. “I’ll promise never to do it again.”
“You fool,” she answered, “I’m cheering.”

At the conclusion of a news broadcast late last Friday evening, the commentator said, and we quote: “Tonight at the Indiana Club 250 girls are reported to be dancing with civilians.” We hail the unknown radio reporter as the wit of the week.
Viewed at the K. C. Semi-formal were these same civilians togged in assorted apparel. Students dressed in subdued tuxedos, on down to those attired in brightly colored sport coats, were accepted or should we say “piesent.” The Freshman in the bright plaids must have thought that the dance was a continuation of their high school senior ball. Perhaps we’re mistaken. Was it?
One Glunk appeared about 9:30 wearing tails. He took one look at the saddle shoed underclassmen, did an about face, and hasn’t been seen since. Recent communiques have it that he has dropped out of school and has since enrolled at Harvard. He must have been awfully
disappointed. Especially after going to all that expense. The price tag was still on his suit. But the knockout blow of the whole affair was his date. Yep, you guessed it, skirt and sweater. She had a good excuse, we’re happy to relate. She’s a Soph, at Central, and had to remain after school for whispering in the Study Hall. The Glunk picked her up on the way to dance. She simply didn’t have time to change. To be perfectly frank, nothing to change to. The new enrolee at Harvard was a gentleman, however, he gave her a Four Roses Corsage. You could smell it all over the club. It blended very nicely with his gingerale-scented perfume.
Taking everything into consideration, we understand that the dance was a success. If we wanted to get corny, we might say that it was the best “one” of this year. Happily we add, that the disciplinary department and the chaperones were as pleased with the evening as
we were. We’re glad to say that everyone took our advice seriously; not a “T” shirt was seen all evening.
At this dance, an adopted, but loyal son of the Gold and Blue, was launched upon what promises to be a long and successful social career. Harry Berliner’s presence was conspicuous by his avid attentions to a lovely southern belle from St. Marys. You’re all romance, Harry, you’re all romance! 1
Barat College of Chicago was well represented on the campus over the past week-end by Mary Herlihy, and the Cummings sisters.... We thought that they made three charming envoys of good will.... A new record was set by St. Mary’s: Two girls entered the Freshman class on Wednesday, and Friday night were present at the K. C. Ball .... A new V-7 class was begun this week, and with its opening return many men who trod this campus as undergraduates. We are glad to see them back, and we wish them and their mates all the luck in the world.
WE WISH TO REPORT :

Eighty Seniors to Receive Degrees at Convocation on Friday, February 25th
Two More N.D. Grads are Decorated for Heroism
By Seaman Ed Mikkelson
BY SEAMAN ART WAGNER
Eighty Seniors of the University of Notre Dame will receive their bachelor degrees at a convention to be held Friday, Feb. 25, in Washington Hall on the University campus, according to an announcement by Rev. J. Leonard Cairico, C.S.C., director of studies.
The convocation ceremonies will be the first to be held at the University since the commencement last October, which was to be the last formal graduation for the duration of the war. The exercises scheduled for Feb. 25 will be streamlined, and will not be accompanied by class day exercises, baccalaureate ser

vices, or any other traditional ceremonies usually held in conjunction with commencement services.
Rev. Eugene P. Burke, C.S.C., Ph.D., professor of religion at Notre Dame, will deliver the convocation address. Father Burke, who celebrated his silver jubilee in the Congregation of Holy Cross in 1934, has been prominent in the University Theater and campus radio activities during recent years. He was editor-of The Ave Maria, national Catholic weekly magazine published at Notre Dame, from 1928-34 at which time he was succeeded by Rev. Patrick Carroll, C.S.C., who is currently editor of the magazine. After graduating from Notre Dame in 1906, Father Burke received graduate degrees from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. and taught in Holy Cross College in Washington from 1906-14. He served as president of Portland University, then known as Columbia University, from 1919-25 and served as a professor at the same institution until 1928, at which time he came to Notre Dame.
Two more Notre Dame graduates have been decorated in the past few weeks for their bravery in battle. George F. Meltzer, ’41, has received the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal with three oak-leaf clusters, and the Purple Heart award. Lieutenant Meltzer recently returned to his home in Chicago on sick leave; he was suffering from wounds sustained in air action over Europe. Meltzer has piloted his B-17 bomber, “Dearly Beloved,” on 23 combat missions over the continent, and has had a number of narrow escapes. On one occasion the two starboard engines were shot out while the plane was over the North Sea, and still 200 miles from home. “Dearly Beloved” just managed to limp back. Meltzer and his crew had another harrowing experience when some heavy anti-aircraft fire damaged the fuel tanks and caused considerable loss of the precious fluid. The long trip home was an anxious one and the motors died just as the wheels touched the home runway.
Ensign Charles J. Boyle, U.S.N.R., ’36, was awarded the Silver Star medal for “conspicuous gallantry during the invasion of Attu Island.” In the face of heavy enemy shelling, Boyle carried out his duties as assistant beachmaster for the unloading of a U.S. transport. After his own transport had withdrawn, Ensign Boyle remained to direct other unloadings. Later he was placed in charge of a reconaissance party in the bloody Chicago harbor area. Boyle was mentioned prominently in Howard Handleman’s well known book, “Bridge to Victory” which tells the story of the Aleutian invasion.
N. D. V-12 Unit Gives
to Paralysis Fund
The Notre Dame V-12 Unit contributed, in the recent national drive for funds in support of the Infantile Paralysis Foundation, $178.41, according to figures released by Lieutenant J. J. Collins. A breakdown of the total collected showed the Marine Detachment donating $46.75, the Ship’s Company, $3.20, with $1.02 coming from various sources. The rest came from Seamen.
Seamen of Company B led the others with a total of $31.01. Other companies above the ten dollar mark were Company A, with $10.16; Company C, $11.23; Company E, $11.11, and Company J with $11.36. Other companies contributing were D, with $9.47; F, $8.90; G, $9.10; H, $9.40; I, $8.00, and K, $8.70.

: Know Your Navy j
(This is the second of Lieut. Collin’s series of articles concerning history of the United States Nary.)
The little Navy of the U. S. was soon to he tested — in fact three wars came in rapid succession:
1.	The undeclared war with France (1798-1801).
2.	The war with the Barbary Pirates (1802-1805).
3.	The war of 1812 with Great Britain (1812-1815).
The war with France was fought chiefly in the Caribbean region. A total of 82 French armed vessels was captured by the Navy supplemented by more than 1,000 privately armed American merchant vessels. Thomas Truxton was undoubtedly the hero in this Avar.
In the War with the Pirates in the Mediterranean, Captain Somers, with Wadsworth and Israel, went to his death in a daring explosive boat attack. Their deeds are commemorated by the Tripoli Monument at the Naval Academy. A little earlier, Stephen Decatur had attacked and burned the Philadelphia, which was in the hands of Tripoli. This spectacular feat so impressed Nelson that he called it “the most daring act of the age.”
It has been said that the Navy is made up of four elements — ships, men, officers, and that fourth quality which binds and integrates the other three — TRADITION. Our Navy was rapidly building this fourth element!
10	'
In the War of 1812, the American Navy was so vastly outnumbered on the high seas that it could do little more than raid enemy commerce. The force we had, however, engaged in a series of frigate and sloop-of-war duels which resulted in astounding victories. These may be explained, in part, because our frigates were not only the best in the world, but because superiority in gunnery distinguished American seamen as well. Daring and enterprise also characterized our forces and brought forth numerous heroes. This was an era when fighting slogans were coined, such as “Fight her till she sinks and don’t give up the ship—.” “We have met the enemy and they are ours.” “Never strike the flag.” The successes of Thomas McDonough on Lake Champlain and Oliver Perry on Lake Erie were enthusiastically acclaimed by the American people. On the high seas, our overwhelmed Navy fought as if inspired and this period has been called America’s Naval Golden Age.
From 1815 until the Civil War, we enjoyed a long period of peace, interrupted only by the short-lived Mexican War. During this interval, the practice (Continued on page 20)

K. of C. Ball a Success;
200 Couples Attend Dance **

Whether his Colleen’s name was Elaine, Marie, or just plain Mary; or* whether she was from John Adams, St. Mary’s, or “imported,” every date at the K.-C. Semi-Formal gave proof that the eyes of the civies are still good. The Ball was held at the Indiana Club last Friday.

The spirit of 01’ Notre Dame came to life afresh, and a very successful K. of C. Ball was the result.
The rhythms of Will Bach furnished a varied program, with a definite accent of the sweet and sentimental. Eunice Clark, featured vocalist, bore a surprising resemblance to Ginny Simms, both in voice and appearance. Mauri e Jackson and Jerry Gabriel rounded out an unusually strong vocal group.	■
In sharp contrast to the usual K. of C. dance, very few “tuxes” were worn. The color, however, was supplied by the shiny new Freshmen, who, incidentally, showed great enthusiasm over the late permissions granted by Father Burke.
In spite of slow pre-dance ticket sales, a near sell-out crowd of 2C0 couples was present. The chairmen were gratified to see the Ball so well attended, for it shows that, given the chance, civilians can still show enough interest to produce successful dances.

EDITORIAL
DATES AT ST. MARY'S
Tomorrow night one hundred twenty-five Notre Dame men will attend the annual Saint Mary’s College Sophomore Cotillion and dance to the music of Chuck Eaton and his Orchestra. The participation of Notre Dame men in this important social event of the year on the neighboring college campus and the correspondingly large number of Saint Mary’s girls who were guests at the Knights of Columbus Semi-Formal indicate that there are no official bans on student contacts between the two colleges. This is contrary to widespread student opinion here.
Sunday afternoon dancing at S.M.C. is continuing to be enjoyed by students from here and girls from over there.
The first few Sunday afternoons of each semester are days when Notre Dame men move in on Saint Mary’s in large numbers. It has been customary, particularly for freshmen, to circulate in tight groups around the halls of the college exploring reception rooms, pounding pianos, wandering on the outside or plugging dance floor walls. These dates pass without the “explorer squads” making an attempt to be introduced to any girls and avoiding any situation where an introduction might take place. The visits of these groups were purposeless and fruitless. But one serious and unfortunate effect of such distant behavior of students from this side of the lakes has been the development of a skeptical attitude here, that there is little or no chance to have a pleasant Sunday afternoon at Saint Mary’s.
It is concerning this particular- situation that a statement released by the Prefect of Discipline cautioned Notre Dame men against date-less journeys to the campus across the way on Sunday afternoons. The warning jointly issued by disciplinary authorities of Saint Mary’s and Notre Dame was intended to eliminate the visits of those groups who wander over without purpose. But it was later misinterpreted in print as “seeing as how the ratio is now 20 V-12s for every Saint Mary’s girl, it will be necessary for every V-12 to have an invitation to gain admittance to said Saint Mary’s. Absolutely no one will be let in without an invitation.”
The truth is that there actually has been no official bans to impede a harmonious development of contacts between students of Notre Dame and Saint
Mary’s. Students here have been influenced to believe first that there were hundreds of V-12 men on the neighboring campus Sunday afternoons so that there was no use going over at all, and later that there is no chance for anyone to get an invitation at the Rock. 3-0567 and 3-0684 are still open channels for invitations to Saint Mary’s — and Saturday afternoons are free from one ’til ten.—Frank Carver
SHIPMATE WRITES TO NELSON
Combat Area, South Pacific.
Deal- Joe:
I never thought I would have the opportunity to write to a shipmate while he was studying in one of the finest colleges in the United States of America. It’s a wonderful opportunity that you have and we in the fleet sincerely hope that you will make the most of it. More than that, we expect you to make the most of it. More than offering you an opportunity, the government fully expects that you will be able to take your place in the post-war construction world.
Out here on the firing front we are going ahead inch by inch. Minute by minute our battle efforts are pushing our front line closer to the nucleus of the enemy—closer to the main hub that keeps their war machine going. We are gradually putting ourselves in the position from which with one gigantic smash we can completely destroy this terrible scare on the otherwise perfect face of humanity as a whole.
But with every foot that we push forward into enemy held territory, we pay to them and to the world a terrific price. Our payment for this land is made in the warm blood of American men and the bodies of Ameican men and the products of American ingenuity and industry. The fierce power of destruction which we are causing upon the enemy is leveling everything in its wake. The trail to victory is marked with ruined industry, ruined farms, financial systems shaken to their very roots, crumbled governments, broken and scattered families. Our forces of destruction and disintegration with which we are blasting more than a third of the earth’s surface must at the inception of peace be followed by equally perfect forces of construction and rehabilitation.
We must reconstruct this now war torn world with the acme of perfection. In order that this great catastrophe may not again grasp the world in its fiery
fingers of death, we must reconstruct the world into a Utopia for all men of good will.
This then is your responsibility. It is not merely a responsibility to the Navy or to the United States, it is rather your responsibility to the world and to the Eternal God. You must train yourself to understand the history and the causes of this war and of all wars in order that in your re-assembly of nations you may make up political and governmental systems that will work in harmony for all time to come. You must train yourself to know what people go through in a war that you will be able to properly treat and rehabilitate all the suppressed people which this war will free. These people look to you for delivery. You cannot disappoint them. They look to you with trusting eyes to point out to them a new way of life, a life of happiness. You must give their industry the spark ■ of life, you must set up their commerce and stabilize their money. These people look to you. I repeat—you cannot fail.
Summed up—it will be your full responsibility, my friend, to pick up the fine and minute pieces of the heart of humanity and fit them smoothly and perfectly together to form a smoothly working center from which will flow the lifeblood of happiness, charity, truth, modesty, and love and all the other important sterling qualities which can make this life so pleasant and good.
This is your job—you are on the road to success. Millions of people will be fed from the fruits grown from the seed which you will sow in this training period. I repeat—Do not fail!!
Your shipmate, “Mac” —H. M- Nelson
Students Select Boy Scouts for City Posts
Three students, Joseph Murnane, Dick Murphy, and Frank McManus, acted as judges at a speech contest sponsored by the general council of South Bend Boy Scout troops on Tuesday. The purpose was to select a mayor, comptroller, county clerk, and judge of the circuit court to preside over the city today, Feb. 11. This is an annual custom to commemorate national Boy Scout week.
The students judged’- the speeches on the basis of platform poise, enunciation, subject matter, and the applause of the -audience. Louis LaPierre was chosen to replace Mayor Pavey for today.
Murnane, Murphy, and McManus are members of the Commerce Forum. Murphy was chairman of the group.

has participated
Dick Ames
Dick Ames’ fame at Notre Dame has not been considerable. He sings a little, in a few interhall athletics, and is slightly above average in his studies. However, he can rest on past laurels. At St. Mark’s School and at St. Thomas Military Academy he was really a man about the campus. And it is on the strength of these, rather than his present glories, that he has been chosen the Scholastic’s student of the week.
Richard Jerome Ames (the name that appears on his birth and Boy Scout certificates) made his debut on the planet twenty-one years ago. He, or rather his parents, chose St. Paul as a site for the happy occasion: the birth of Minnesota’s first contribution to the Presidency. And subsequent events only strengthened their hopes of seeing young Richard in the White House.
Before any false conclusions are reached, let me make it clear that Ames is a modest lad. He never suggests that a friend read his scrap book. I just happened to pick it up from the seat of his easy chair (the only chair in the room), in order to sit down. The first item is a notice of his birth; the second announces his first birthday party; the third his second birthday party; and so on for other 19. But there are quite a number of clippings in addition to these.
In the second grade at St. Mark’s Dick was nominated for class president by Sister Mary Agnes. A secret ballot was taken, and Sister Mary Agnes counted the votes. Ames was elected. And his parents knew they had a little politician. Their vision of the White House grew.
In the fourth grade Ames became class secretary; in the fifth, class treasurer. The following year he went out for football, and dropped to a B in his schoolwork. But he made up for the deficiency by being selected all-sixth grade, an honor he retained for four years. Then he became all-seventh grade.
Now Ames graduated into the big time—high school. After his marvelous

Seaman Amundsen Has Thrilling Adventures on Sub
By Seaman Al Broten
Little did Ronald Amundsen, the famous Norse explorer of the Arctic, realize that some day his grand nephew would be a V-12 student at the University of Notre Dame. Nor did he realize that a descendant of his would seek undersea sailing in preference to surface sailing.
Hailing from the “town too tough to die,” Tombstone, Arizona, Palmer E. Amundsen, the descendant of the noted explorer, is now in his second semester of naval training at Notre Dame. He boasts three and one-half years of active service in the navy. Prior to entering the service, he attended the Arizona State College at Tempe.	•
The beginning of the most exciting portion of Amundsen’s Ifie as a sailor must be traced back to Japan’s attack upon Pearl Harbor in the closing days of 1941. The submarine, upon which he was stationed, had lain outside the harbor during the attack and entered the day following.
“As our ship made its way through the wreckage, the men had weak knees as a result of seeing the ruin caused by Jap planes. It was only natural, therefore, that when we left Pearl Harbor shortly afterward, the men formed the . most determined crew I have ever seen. They had blood in their eyes,” commented Amundsen.
Cmdr. Stanley P. Mosley was the commanding officer of the sub as it took off on its initial assignment of the war. -Shortly thereafter he was awarded the Navy Cross, and each member of the crew received citations for his success in the area.	-
“Our skipper was the fightingest man I ever saw,” said Amundsen. “He always won. When he fired a torpedo, you could gamble a month’s wages that it wouldn’t miss the target.”
A journey into Tokyo harbor would be exciting for even such an experienced adventurer as Frank Buck. To this sail- . or from Tombstone it was even more " thrilling.
While in the confines of the. harbor, this submarine ran up alongside a mine , cable. “It was a treacherous and nervewracking job to successfully move the ship away from this danger wtihout setting off one of . the mines,” said Amund- , sen. .	’	.	...

Notre Dame Sports
Navy Commissions Ed "Moose" Krause, Basketball Mentor, and Line Coach
BY SEAMAN ED MIKKELSON
Notre Dame’s athletic staff received a jolt from Uncle Sam last week when Edward W. Krause, coach of the basketball team and line coach of the football team, was sworn into the Navy as an ensign. “Moose” has been ordered to report for active duty on March 1 in Hollywood, Calif.
Certainly one of the University’s athletic greats, Krause is the only Notre Dame man to have been named All-American in both football and basketball. While a student here, he won no less than seven monograms—three in football, three in basketball, and one in track. Only an injury prevented him from winning an additional one in track. He ended his brilliant student athletic career in 1934 when he graduated from the College of Arts and Letters with a major- in journalism and a minor in physical education.
“Moose” began his coaching career shortly after leaving Notre Dame when at 21, he became head coach and athletic director at St. Mary’s college in Winona, Minn. Krause left the Minnesota school after five years to take a position as head basketball coach and assistant foot-
NROTC Rifle Team One of Nation's Best;
Victorious in 21 of 23 Collegiate Matches
BY JACK HOUGHTELING
Victorious in 21 out of 23 matches, the N.R.O.T.C. rifle team has established itself as one of the outstanding squads in the country. Competing against other-unit teams, the riflemen have dropped decisions only to Tufts, 937-920, and to Oklahoma, 959-949.
The Irish cadets scored their lowest total of the season in the match against Tufts,'while the easterners recorded just the opposite — their highest count. Against Oklahoma, the Notre Dame team pushed the score to 949, but the amazing marksmanship of the Sooners, 959, could not be equaled.
Sophomore Jim Lamb has been the
ball coach at Holy Cross college, Worcester, Mass. He held that position until a chance to return to his Alma Mater was offered him three years later. That chance came when his immediate predecessor on the football staff, Joe McArdle, was also sworn into the Navy as an ensign. Thus his job both opened and closed through the machinations of the Navy Department. He took the position of head basketball coach following the unfortunate death of George Keogan a year ago.
Coach Krause’s football efforts seem to have had excellent results, because the line on the ’43 team was generally conceded to be the best college line in the country. His present basketball team has an interesting record, if not a brilliant one. They have won every other game without exception, and have collected a long series of one-game winning strings. The fate of this team after March 1 is problematical.
Coach Krause has been living in South Bend since taking his present position, and has his own home there. His wife is the former Miss Elis Linden of Chicago, and they have one son, Edward, jr.
leading shooter of the team since the first match. Lamb set a new record for the NROTC unit when he racked up a 195 against the Sooners. Maintaining an average of 192.4 over the entire season, Lamb has fallen below 190 on only one occasion, the second match of the year, against North Carolina.
Alan Guard, captain of the team, has been Lamb’s most consistent competitor. Against Georgia Tech, the Coast Guard Academy, and West Virginia Military R.O.T.C., Captain Guard fired a 195 to tie Jim Lamb’s record. Guard boasts a season’s average of well over 190, and when teamed with Lamb, gives the unit a very dependable pair of high shooters.
John Zwicker, Bill Moore and Bud Seghers usually complete the first fiive shooters with Dave Cartwright, Bill and Al Wrape, and Peter Belmont breaking into the first five at various times. Zwicker potted a 183 count against Yale to tie with Lamb for the number one spot of that match.
The team has only one remaining match, and that is with the University of Washington Huskies. The Huskies copped the William Randolph Hearst Trophy last season, and are consistently rated as one of the top teams of the nation.
After the Washington match, the Irish cadets will fire in the Hearst meet and the Naval R.O.T.C. tournament. Last year the squad finished in the twentieth position of the Hearst meet, and sixth in the N.R.O.T.C. affair. Northwestern snatched the navy title last season, but the Notre Dame squad has defeated the Wildcats in a dual meet, and stands an excellent chance of taking both crowns this year.
Newspapers Rumor of Leahy Trip Overseas
It has been rumored in the South Bend Tribune that Coach Frank Leahy of the 1943 National Champion Notre Dame team will travel overseas under joint Army-Navy sponsorship to tour the American bases in the European theatre of war. The stories carried the news that he will show moving pictures of Notre Dame’s. 1943 season under the auspices of the War Department.
The film mentioned in the stories is no doubt the University’s “Gridiron Highlights of 1943,” that features the important plays of every game that lay in the path of the ‘Fighting Irish’ to a National crown. The program, as laid out by the newspapers, called for a three-month excursion that would reach many of our outlying AEF bases and camps. Coach Leahy is expected to give a running play-by-play commentary on the Highlights, air his general views on the American sports situation, football in particular, and then conduct a question and answer period.
As yet nothing, specific or general, has been announced on campus concerning the prospective trip mentioned several times in South Bend and Chicago newspapers.

Irish-Violets Meet in Top Intersectional Battle Monday at New York; Expect Sellout
BY JIM FENNELLY
Notre Danie’s varsity basketball team makes its annual pilgrimage to New York City, there to uphold the cause of “the wearing of the green” against New York University, next Monday night at Madison Square garden. This game has always been a sellout since the series began in 1934, and a crowd of 18,000 synthetic Irish alumni is expected to see the inconsistent consistent Krausemen try for their tenth win in 12 starts against the Violets. To date the Irish have won nine games, scoring 4-51 points, while limiting the lads from University Heights to two wins and a total of 364 points. All but one of these games have been played at the New York Garden, the exception being in 1939, when the Violets played a return game in the Irish fieldhouse, their only appearance on the Notre Dame campus.
Like many colleges that cannot boast a V-12 unit or naval trainee program, New York has been sorely pressed to field a five that would compare to past Violet teams. The present first team is composed entirely of freshmen, who before the season began had never engaged in varsity competition. However, Howard Cann, Violet mentor, always able to get the best out of a man, has done remarkably well with such an inexperienced team, and has guided New
Sorin Five Wins Title in Interhall Cage Loop
Creighton Miller’s basket with only seven seconds remaining in the three minute overtime enabled Sorin Hall to defeat Brownson 32 to 30 to capture the Interhall League championship Tuesday night. Sorin was forced to come from behind to tie the freshmen in the regulation game before going on to victory in the overtime session.
Entering the game a slight underdog, Brownson Hall gave a good account of itself and almost succeeded in upsetting Sorin. The freshmen jumped off to a 10 to 8 lead at the end of the first quarter. In the second canto, however, Sorin, rallied and took a 17 to 13 lead at halftime. Brownson came back fighting in ■the third period to again take the lead 22 to 20. At one tune in the last quarter Brownson led by four points with less than four minutes remaining, but could not hold the lead. Trailing 28 to 26 with only a half a minute to go. Sorin tied the game as Creighton Miller followed up a long shot to drop the ball through the hoop, making the score 28-all and
14
York to seven wins as against three losses. Up to now he has placed all the emphasis on offense, relying on the old axim that “the best defense is a good offense.”
Mickey O’Brien, whose name belies his Alma Mater, is the lad who makes the Violet club click. A firehorse type of player, his constant hustle and accurate shooting has pulled many a Violet win out of the fire. Against Connecticut State College, his three fieldgoals, one coming in the last minute of play, gave New York the win 46-45.
At present the Violets are ranked second to St. John’s University in New York court ratings, and a win over the Irish will surely bring them a bid to the National Invitation Tournament which is to be played in March. They have beaten St. Francis College and Brooklyn College, - which puts them well up in the race for the mythical championship of the Empire State city.
Coach Krause will be aiming to duplicate the 74-35 score of last year, when the Irish, led by Bob Rensberger and Frank Curran who scored 22 and 21 points respectfully, swamped the helpless Violets in a deluge of second half baskets, to hand them one of the worst defeats of the series.
to force the game into an overtime period.
With the overtime period about a minute old, it was Miller who sent Sorin into the lead with a basket from the side court. With only 23 seconds left to play, Canning of Brownson dented the basket to apparently necessitate another overtime period, but Miller scored his third basket of the game to give Sorin the championship.
Sorin Hall -will now play the winner of the Overflow League for the right to meet the Service League champion. The winners of both civilian leagues will receive bronze medals. The winner of the final game will receive gold medals, while the losers will be the recipients of silver awards.	.

Marquette Hands Irish
Track Team First Defeat
“Doc” Handy’s boys came within 12 laps of defeating the Marquette Hilltoppers last Saturday up in Milwaukee. The meet was tied 45% to 45% at the final event, the 12 lap relay. Marquette took the event and the meet, 48% to 45%. This was Notre Dame’s first dual track defeat in three years.
The meet was hotly contested, with the Irish taking six first places, and holding the Hilltoppers to only five. Marquette made up for its lack of first places by scoring high in seconds and thirds. The local track boys took both the low and high hurdles. The only event in which the Irish made a clean sweep was the mile run. All other events were split up.
Frank Martin', the Irish distance man, collected a first in the 880, the mile, and the two mile runs, a total of 15 points, to be the high scorer. Bob Steuber, former Missouri All-American, picked up 10 points to lead Coach Shimek’s speedsters.
Another All-American, big Johnny Yonaker, tossed the shot 48 feet, 11% inches to far exceed the old gymnasium record of 46 feet, 3% inches, established in 1937 by Johnny Levicki, another Notre Darner.

It was an appealing eye-opener to see Big John Yonakor peel off the grid togs and don the short trunks in. vanning the shot event in his first competition this season .... The new Marquette record of 48 feet, 11% inches that he contributed to the cause bettered the old mark of 46 feet, 3% inches held by John Levicki, an ex-ND man of ’37.
The Scholastic’s All-Campus Ping Pong Tournament completed its opening round yesterday.... The quarter - finals are to be completed by Feb. 13, Monday in the Novice and Intermediate divisions, and by Feb. 15 Tuesday in the Senior Division.... Semi-finals are scheduled for completion by the 18th with the champions being acclaimed before sunset, Sunday, Feb. 20.... Seventy-four men in all turned out for the classic, 32 in the Novice, section, 26 in the Intermediate class, and 16 in the Senior bracket.
Right after the final gun in the De-Paul-N. D. clash last Saturday, a veritable tumultuous chaos became apparent on the De Paul side of the floor as the ■players paraded around the court carrying their coach, Ray Meyer, on their shoulders and really whooping it up.... This series is but in its infancy, a mere two years old, but if last Saturday’s exhibition of post-game exhilaration is evidence of what is yet to continue in the future, then the Mid-West will again have to humble itself to Notre Dame in the cage world for being a participant in the , greatest series of mid-western history.... The crowd somewhat marvelled, only momentarily however, at the
way the Golden Dome lads kept a close guard on all the Blue Demon charges, Mikan especially, thus keeping the ball far from hoop range, but they finally set sail with the oversized pellet, getting it in to “Big George” who pivoted for the score.____Well, it was good while it lasted.... Leo “Crystal” Klier completed but one of eight free throws in the two games with Northwestern earlier in the season at the Stadium, but last Saturday’s effort saw Leo collect a total of ' 20 tallies, one more than his compiled average for the other two games, and he also connected with eight of his ten gift tosses._______ George Mikan’s 15 counters boosted his Stadium total to 110 in six encounters.... Otto Graham comes next with 68.... The Irish have won but one game away from home, that being at Purdue, and have lost all three Stadium contests....

The annual trip to New York to meet NYU in the Garden becomes reality for the Krausemen on Monday night.... Leo Klier will be trying to better the individual N. D. scoring record set by Bobby Faught in the Garden contest back in ’42.... He came close this season with 23 against Wisconsin_______ Bernie Rutledge, stellar Irish guard, had a total of 46 fouls out of a possible 56 when he was ejected from the De Paul fracas last Saturday.. -.

Jinx Holds as De Paul Downs Irish Cagers
By Jim Howard
Still plagued by their even game losing streak, the Irish of Notre Dame were smashed 61-45 by Jack Dean and the De Paul team in the Chicago Stadium last Saturday.
The Irish have yet to win an even game this season. It was hoped that their victory, in game 13 would break the hoo doo, but no such luck came for the Notre Dame squad.
Notre Dame got off to a strong start in the first half. The score was tied four times, and there was never more than six points separating the contestants. After the see-sawing first half, De Paul hit stride and held the edge for the rest of the game.
Outstanding performance of the evening was Mark Todordvich’s superb guarding of George Mikan, the Demon’s 6 foot, nine inch center. Todorovich Tim-ited Mikan to one basket the first half, and four the second. His guarding was • too close however, and he went out on fouls.
Leo Klier again supported the Irish with 20 markers. Todorovich and Bernie Rutledge contributed eight points each. Kelly helped with five points, arid Johnny Lu jack and Ernie Kivisto each, gave two.
High scorer of the evening was Jack Dean of DePaul with 21 points. Dean was one of the chief causes of the Irish defeat. .
At one time during the second half, the Demons were ahead by 20’.points. The Irish offensive was on a strike for the first part of the second period.

Great Lakes Breaks Irish Jinx in Odd-Game;
Defeat Krausemen, 84 to 48 Before 2,500
The Great Lakes Bluejackets handed the Irish a defeat, 84-48, Wednesday night. The loss ended Notre Dame’s peculiar streak of winning all the odd, and losing all the even games. 2,500 sailors saw their team get revenge for the only setback suffered at the station in three seasons, the Irish football victory there at the end of the 1942-43 campaign.
The Bluejackets were slow in getting their attack under way and trailed Notre Dame for the first 17 minutes of the game. Paul Armstrong finally put the Sailors in the lead, 20 to 19, when he scored a field goal and a free throw.
At this juncture Armstrong, Herman Schaefer, a former teammate at Indiana university, and Don Smith, ex-Min-nesota star, took charge of the proceedings and the Bluejackets were never headed. This trio divided scoring honors for the navy, each counting 17 points before retiring.
Starting the second half with a 50 to 28 lead, the Sailors widened the margin, 68 to 40. Lt. Hinkle sent in his substitutes with seven minutes of play remaining in the final period.
For- Schaefer, who already had established a new all-time scoring record at Great Lakes, last night’s 17 points sent his season’s total to 322. The former record, set in the 1941-’42 season by Bob Callihan, wa§ 308 points in 36 games.
The only member of the Notre Dame squad to pierce the Bluejacket defense was Leo Klier, who counted 15 points before being ejected with four personal fouls in the second half.

George Keogan Memorial
Trophy to NYU-lrish Victor
When Notre Dame meets New York University on Monday evening, the two teams will be battling for a leg on the George Keogan Memorial Trophy donated by friends of the late coach of the Irish.
The series between the two hardwood foes has, since 1934, been the most bitter intersectional battle in the nation. This thoughtful gesture will keep alive a name that deserves a prominent place in the Basketball Hall of Fame.
Complete First Round Play in Service League
Three Navy teams, two Marine fives, and one R.O.T.C. quintet advanced to the second round of the Service Men’s Basketball League as a result of games played last week. Two teams had received byes to complete the first round of eight at the start of the tournament.
Marine D and Navy F had an easy time reaching the second round as they scored forfeit wins over R.O.T.C. 2 and R.O.T.C. 1, respectively. Apparently all the R.O.T.C. basketball players are in R.O.T.C. 1, as that company looked very strong in defeating Marine B, 46 to 31. The Navy J defeated the Naxy X, 43 to 33, in the only game between two teams of the same unit. Navy I notched its first round win ov.er Marine C by a 31 to 24 count. Marine A is the other Marine five to reach the second round, by defeating Navy H, 30 to 24.
Many of the second round games in this tournament have already been played, but their results were received too late for publication.—Jim Regan

Great Lakes Cancels its Track Meet With Irish
The track meet between Notre Dame and Great Lakes Naval Training- Station scheduled for tomorrow in the Notre Dame fieldhouse has been cancelled, according to Coach Handy.
Announcements of the cancellation was made early this week when the Notre Dame track mentor received word that the Great Lakes Station was unable to send a team to the meet.
Coach Handy explained that although the sailors have a wealth of track mate. rial, the coaching staff has been depleted because of numerous transfers of the officers in charge. Recent transfer of Lientenant Rapport left the sailor thinclads without a coach, and resulted in the inability of Great Lakes to send a squad.	, -
No substitution for the Great Lakes meet was sought, Coach Handy said.

INTRODUCING
By John Power
BOB PURCELL
In the lofty portals of old Sorin Hall lives twenty year old Bob Purcell, a Junior in Civil Engineering. Holder* of a 2A deferment, ‘Ace’ is one of Doc Handy’s star quarter milers for the second year.
Prior to Notre Dame, Bob called Floral Park, Long Island, his home, and attended high school at Chaminade with “Bunks” Rutledge, of hardwood fame; Frank Martin, star Irish miler; and Hany Wright hardy ex-grid standout. In addition to an Honor Roll average of 90 for his four years at Chaminade, Purcell managed to garner three track letters and the 440 County Conference Championship with a flat .51 effort. In his Senior year Bob viewed an exhibition by Greg Rice, two mile record holder, in New York, and decided to come West, at least as far as South Bend.
Bob continued to run the quarter mile as an Irish campaigner, contributing vital points to victories of the 1943 Champs in both the Purdue and Michigan State Relays. Returning to the squad after a brief absence, Father Forrestal’s tenant announces his favorite hobby as climbing fire escapes, being very adept at said art up to and including January 1, 1944.	,
Along the line of entertainment he awards all honors in the motion picture industry to Bette Davis “with whom no other actress can compare” and at the same time gives solid musical support to Woody Herman, and in particular his rendition of ‘the Woodchopper’s Ball.’
The Purcell ambition at the present moment is to become sleuth enough to discover the culprit who pilfered his monogram sweater some time ago.
A bell rang; lights dimmed; doors opened and the interview ended as night prayer started in ‘Sorin City.’
MARK TODOROVICH
Next on the call list was a room on the fourth floor corridor of Cavanaugh. A knock on the door and Mark Todoro-vich answered.
Two songs, the ever popular “St. Louis Blues” and “I’m from Missouri” are a dead giveaway of the romping grounds of big Mark when on leave. He was a four sport man at Soldan High School in St. Louis, competing in basketball, baseball, football and track. Captain and All State in both football and basketball, Mark led Soldan to two con
secutive city championships, and second place in the state hoop rankings. Spring found him copping third place in the state meet high hurdles events and donning the mask and pads on the diamond.
From Soldan, Todorovich went to the outskirts of St. Louis and registered at Washington University where he majored in Commerce for three years and gained monograms in basketball and football.
At present a marine trainee he entered Notre Dame in July. In the fall he played some left end for Frank Leahy till the hardwood call was issued. He was, shortly after, the number one center on the Irish cage club. His pet gripe is the thought of those one point losses to Kentucky and Wisconsin.
Headed for Parris Island in March, he thinks, Mark still has an eye on a Commerce degree, the favorite subjects being accounting and psychology taught by Mr. Dincalo and Fr. Leahy respectively.
' This tall basketeer has a definite leaning for the hot licks of Cab Calloway and Sunny Dunham in the field of music, and as all ‘Smokey City’ Fans, the Cardinals on the ball field. “October 1944” Mark extolled, “will find the Cardinals not only three time pennant winners, but twice the victors in the Yankee Series.”
The strapping man from Missouri could think of no hobby, but said all his spare time was spent cleaning the room for inspection. His biggest athletic thrall came in 1941 when Soldan won the City Basketball Championship in two overtimes, the second one a tense sudden death affair.
Mile Relay Team is
Second in Millrose Games
Before a capacity crowd of 18,000 in the Madison Square Garden, New York, the Notre Dame one mile relay team pounded its way to a second place medal in the annual Millrose games. Running in a heat with New York University and the United States Military Academy, the cream of eastern opposition, the Irish finished behind the flying Violets and turned in the second fastest relay time recorded on the Garden saucer this campaign, 3.27. Army handicapped by poor baton passing finished a poor third.
Passing the stick for the Irish were Dave Murphy, Fred Jones, Bob “Ace” Purcell and anchorman Ralph Pohland. Pohland, Central Collegiate half mile champion, also was an entry in the special invitational 880 yard run. Forced to outside in a crowded heat, Ralph was boxed out of the lead from the start and never was able to make a healthy bid. His long gaited speed and tremendous staying power enabled him to plod all the way around the pack on the turns to
finish fourth. The winner, Midshipman Hall of Columbia was clocked in 1:57.1.
Accompanying Coach Elvin “Doc” Handy to Manhattan was Chief Petty Officer Tom Quinn, an entrant in the feature two mile run. The pre-meet favorite was another Notre Dame man Oliver Hunter III, at present an ensign in charge of the athletic program at Columbia University Midshipmen’s School.
A darkhorse, however, veteran Jim Rafferty, the national 1000 yard champion, broke the tape ahead of Hunter who. finished a strong second. Chief Quinn copped the third place medal.
Engineer All-Stars Beat Faculty Bowling Squad
By Jim Gormeley
Each Saturday, for the past semester, the teams in the Engineers’ Bowling League have put forth their best efforts, with two big objectives in mind: to win the championship, and to earn a place on the League All-Stars which was to oppose the Faculty. Last week, the big day arrived. The Faculty was ably represented by Dean Schubmehl, Professors Rohrbach, Schall, and Shilts, and one member of the student body, Bill Brezenski (it seems that the manpower shortage has hit the Faculty too). The All-Stars were composed of the five men with the highest averages during the season. These were Bob Martina of the Electricals, “Red” Showers of the Aeros, Mike McGlew of the Civils, Bob Murray and Jim Gormeley of the Mechanicals. Jack McAndrews of the Chemicals, who earned a spot on the team, was unable to roll because of a bad wrist.
The final scores showed that the AllStars had vanquished the members of the Faculty, two games to one. The Faculty, paced by Mr. Schall, who rolled a terrific 210, got off to a flying start, and won the first game handily. Then the All-Stars began to function and took the two remaining games by decisive margins. The last game was the highest series rolled during the season; and the three-game score was the highest of the season.
Honors went to “Red” Showers, who rolled the high game of the day, 220, and backed this up with a 160 and 164. Bob Martina turned in the highest three-game average, with games of 164, 187, and 205. The Faculty highlight was the 210 game rolled by Mr. Schall of the Mechanical Engineering Department.
The championship of the League is still to be decided, since the outcome of the series between the Electricals and the Chemicals next week will determine whether there is an undisputed champion or co-champs. If the Electri
17.
cals take all three games, they will be undisputed champs. However, if they drop one game they will become tied with the Mechanicals, and if they drop two games, the Mechanicals will take the crown.
Jap Atrocity Revelations
Bring Story of N. D. Star
Along with the story of the Japanese atrocities which filled the pages of America’s leading dailies last week, came the startling news that one of the prisoners in the vanguard bearing the brunt of such treatment was a'former Notre Dame athlete, an Army enlisted man.
According to the story told by Commander McCoy: “On a very dark night, two Army officers and a Navy officer were carrying out a plan to escape by attempting to crawl along a ditch and thereby get through the wire around the camp. They had almost 1'eached their objective when their progress was halted accidentally: an Army enlisted man, said to have been a former Notre Dame football star, stumbled into the three men in the dark.
“Whatever his reason, one of the officers sprang from the ditch and began to struggle with the enlisted man. Other Americans ran out of their barracks to stop this fray, with the result that it became quite noisy. After the actual fighting stopped, the first officer to spring out of the ditch was quite loud in his recriminations, taking the attitude that there had been a deliberate attempt to prevent his escape. The enlisted man denied this, and since he was not a member of the officer’s “shooting squad,” and so would not have suffered from the escape, he presumably was sincere in his denial.”
Since no names were revealed by the authors of the story, it is not known for certain at Notre Dame just who the former athlete was. An article in the South Bend Tribune indicated that the man was very likely Mario Tonelli, since Tonelli was reported to have been stationed on Bataan, and to have been captured.
Tonelli, it will be remembered, was. the star of the 1937 game with Southern California. .Date in the fourth quarter, . with the score 7-6 against them, the Irish were ending the season with an apparent defeat, when Tonelli, playing fullback, suddenly broke loose for 68 yards to the' Trojans 8-yard line. From there he took the ball over on the next play. ' > .	. .
Tonelli’s friends at Notre. Dame are hoping that the South Bend “authority” is ill informed. ■ .	. ...	.

Early Results of Three Tournaments Announced
Play in both the badminton and handball tournaments . started during the week, and several matches have been played to date. Since both events are moving along swiftly, the semi-finals and final rounds are expected to be completed next week. The preliminaries in the wrestling tournament will be held this afternoon with the finals slated for Monday.
Only a few handball games were completed in time for this issue of the Scholastic, but here are a few of the early results: Wittucki, R.O.T.C., one of the favorites because of his last year’s performance, defeated Dewey in the first round, and eliminated Clark of Sorin in the second round, to. become the first man to reach the semi-finals; Deiters defeated Furman; Debitteto beat Byrne; Tully defeated Carroll and Freeman, but then fell before Debitteto, who also gained the semi-finals.
—Jim Regan
Spring Practice to be
Held, Frank Leahy Says
Although rumors have been circulated that Notre Dame is going to forego spring football this year, Coach Frank Leahy stated during the week that spring training will definitely be held. The number of those who report and will not be here next fall is irrelevant, Coach Leahy said, for he feels that the training they receive will prove not only beneficial to the boys themselves, but also to the armed services by preparing the boys physically for combat.
The spring training sessions will last for a period of about four weeks. Although it is not known how many, entering freshmen will report for the team, it will provide any newcomers with an early opportunity of acquainting themselves with the system that- is now used at Notre Dame. Very few members of last year’s national champion squad will be back next fall. Not one of the 11 starters is expected back, while only a few of the second and third, teams will be available. Coach Leahy and his staff will face a herculean task in building up a team that can compare with the . 1943 eleven.	. .
In addition to a heavy loss in. player personnel, Coach Leahy has received the added loss of his able line coach, Ed “Moose” Krause, who was formally sworn into the Navy on Feb. 5. Whether a replacement for Krause will be secured for spring training has not been . announced.—Jim Regan . .

MARINE MURMURS
-	(Continued from Page 7)
out of his upper bunk as the metallic clamor of the automatic bugle sounded. The first few days Geezmo was wide awake and on the move at 0400 which was his rising time back home on the farm. Several cursing threats, larfie bellows, and the late hours he had to keep now soon induced him to sleep until 0605 and a few times later.
Geezmo was flabbergasted at the clean white napkins, only larger, called sheets within which they slept. He preferred the itchy sensation of a coarse wool blanket to the cold slippery feeling of the sheets. The making up of his bunk every morning was a terrific task for him... '
“What fer, anyway?” he questioned. “Mess ’em up in short order anyhow.” Every morning Mo’s roommate and he flipped to see who cleaned the room.
“Heads I win, tails you lose,” was the ' habitual statement of his roommate, a sharp former Notre Dame student — • sharp as a cracker and twice as crummy. Mo, of course, had the honors daily. /	.	.
He couldn’t figure out why they had to jump: around every morning at 0615 like chickens with their heads cut off. ’Beared to him they’d use their muscles for something more useful.
. Geezmo really; hooked the guys at
morning chow though. He’d swap them one of his hotties of milk or a pad of butter for a box of cereals. The city fellers weren’t so smart, figured Mo, at that.	.	.
But classes — “My gosh, what they expect of a body.” Back at Small Town Tech, much never was required of him because of his being a football man and too much study might be hard on his health. Only way he could hope to pass here, he decided, was to make the team. Physics especially, bothered him; he never took physics before — his mother always saw to it that he had plenty of roughage and stewed prunes every morning. The way he got his answer in the quizzes was to add up the numbers given in the quiz and divide by the square root of his laundry number. He had as good an average as most of the other fellows — 25.
One thing the fellows kept insisting at which he wasn’t, very good was — shining shoes. Boy! it sure was nice of them to let him practice on theirs.
He never could understand either why the good Father came into his room every night to see if he was snuggled safely away.
“Shucks, my mother stopped doing that when I started college. Wonder if they think maybe I’m homesick or something. But, then, I heard they treat the students like little children around here.”	.
Every night promptly at 2100, Mo treated himself to a slice of pickled herring out of a small keg stowed in the bottom of his locker, scrub his teeth with soap, clamber into his feedsack nightshirt, kiss the picture of Mary, his favorite cow, sweep out the rice krispies, bottles, rocks, and other debris found between the sheets of his sack.
He was glad today was Friday because he was looking forward to drinking a lot of tea at a tea-dance given by the cultured ladies across the way on Sunday.
(Conclusion next week)
THE SNOOPER
’ (Continued from Page 12) Company Commander of Company E. Remember the article about his conversation with an officer in which he mentioned his fragile gear? Well, on Tuesday last week, he received a letter from a St. Mary’s girl who invited him to a dance, and said in part, “I am not fragile!” The C.O. took her up on it and had a wonderful time (she’s a high school senior) at the Rock.
Last Wednesday, the incident everyone knew would occur- eventually, succeeded.; Mr. Raymond Kopituk (Co. B, 386 Dillon) last Wednesday dashed
madly to his room after class, changed into his sweat suit, and really exerted himself getting to the Rockne. When he arrived, he observed that he was the first one there — at least no one else was there. The tardy bell rang, still no one arrived. Ray then began to wander aimlessly about the gym looking for someone to talk with — he was getting lonesome (poor fellow). After about ten minutes fervent, but futile, searching the light dawned! It was Wednesday, and Mr. Raymond belonged in the Engineering Building gazing- at the movies.
Poor Mr. Duane Hunt (Co. J, 234 Zahm) is the unfortunate victim of circumstance. He has many friends — an empty bunk for them to lounge on — who visit him in the evenings. They are somewhat, shall I say . . . boisterous? At any rate, they create considerable ■ disturbance and plain noise in general for a few minutes, then they all scamper out — later, the Prefect comes into the room, and there sits Mr. Hunt unconcerned as can be! As a result, Hunt is observed cautiously and continually. But, he is purely a victim of circumstance, aren’t you Duane?
Fellows, when you have trouble with your math, be sure to dash up to Mr. Earl Wright (Co. F, 206 Alumni), and ask his assistance. You know he is a mathematical genius, of course. Last week in his math class, the instructor carefully explained — in detail — a theorem of Spherical Trigonometry. When he had completed his careful explanation, Mr. Wright blurted out, “You’re wrong.” After this outburst, a long and sparring discussion was carried on between the instructor and Mr. Wright. I was not informed of who won the discussion, but am sure Earl would be only too happy to tell you.

The various company bulletin boards were poorly planned. The person who planned them was very narrow-minded — naturally he would be, being a man himself. Such is the reasoning of one Mr. William Tompkins (Co. E, 346 Dillon). He was asked, one day last week, about a certain article which had ap-. peared in a Noon Muster announcement. Now this announcement was posted at the top’ of the bulletin board, and Mr. Tompkins, being six foot four ... my mistake, four foot six, or thereabouts, had not read the announcement. He said that when they moved the notices to a level which was within reasonable range of fellows of his height, he could then be responsible for notices posted. If -William has his way, the bulletin boards would be much longer and not nearly so high. Why don’t you put in a chit, Shorty?

found that another ship lay between them and the open sea. They, therefore, had to dive underneath this vessel in order to make their escape.
In addition to this jaunt to Tokyo, the destination of all fighting Americans in the South Pacific, Amundsen’s ship paid a visit to a Jap destroyer base in northern Japan. Both trips were extremely successful.
Aboard the sub, it was Amundsen’s job as RM2c to serve as maintenance man on the Radar equipment. He also stood radio and sound watches.
To “Slim” Amundsen, who is commander of the third battalion and excommander of Company B, the submarine is his type of: ship and the submariner, his type of sailor. If his opinion is of any importance, he “never wants to serve on anything else but an undersea raider.”
KNOW YOUR NAVY (Continued from page 10) of dividing the Navy’s cruising vessels into several squadrons assigned respectively to particular geographical areas in the Atlantic, Pacific, and elsewhere, was inaugurated. It served as a means of:
1.	Policing certain seas overrun by pirates.
2.	Suppressing the slave-trade.
3.	Protecting and promoting sea trade throughout the globe. Each ship was considered a potential solitary raider rather than a unit of a fighting fleet. Ships, even when in company, rarely engaged in maneuvers.
An outstanding weakness of the Service, at this period, was the lack of disciplinary training and naval indoctrination of its midshipmen. Until 1845, young officers received only rudimentary instruction under unfavorable conditions on- board receiving and cruising ships. An incident occurred at sea in 1842 which shocked the country and was to have far-reaching effect. In that year, Midshipman Philip Spencer and two seamen were hanged at the yard-arm of the United States brig, Somers, for attempting mutiny. The upshot of the Spencer incident, which showed clearly the demoralizing influence of taking undisciplined young rascals into the Service, was the founding of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1845. Regardless of many old timers who laughed at the idea of “teaching sailors on shore,” the institution was established, mainly through the efforts of George Bancroft, Secretary of the Navy. It was opened under the able direction of Commander Franklin Buchanan with fifty midshipmen and seven instructors. Time has proved this to have been an essential, step toward producing a thoroughly competent officer corps. Furthermore, the Academy has, as well, nurtured a high degree of unity, general efficiency, and morale within the Navy.
MAN ABOUT CAMPUS
(Continued from page 12) ' showing at St. Mark’s, every high school in Minneapolis vied for his services. But St. Thomas offered the highest salary. Hence he chose St. Thomas, and proved himself worth every cent.
In his freshman year Ames earned his numerals, and lettered in swimming. In his sophomore year he won a starting berth on the varsity squad, and the all-city breast stroke title. In his junioryear he was selected all-conference guard, and was elected grid captain for the following season. Naturally, with all
these honors, he maintained an unusually high average.
The White House dream of Mr. and Mrs. Ames faded. They now had visions of Dick the grid great. First he would win all-American acclaim at Notre Dame, and the Heisman trophy. Then, accepting the highest bid, he would earn a few hundred thousand in the pros.
But disaster in the form of arthritis struck the young gridder. Amidst much weeping on the part of the alumni, he had to withdraw from school. He surrendered the captaincy to his co-hero of the football field, Don O’Shaughnessy (also a Notre Darner). And Ames completed his senior year by means of home tutoring. But in spite of the handicap, he was not only named valedictorian of the graduating class, but also succeeded in earning two more merit badges.
During the fall of 1941 Ames entered the University. In his first year he did nearly as well as at St. Mark’s. He became president of the class, made the all-campus football team, and in the Bengal Bouts he wasn’t knocked out until the finals. However, he decided to give up athletics, and capitalize on his voice. And since he has sung with the Glee Club and with John Stehlin’s Victory Band; and he is one of the principals in the successful operetta, Rud-digore.
Now Mr. and Mrs. Ames have new ambitions. Dick can sing for a living. After all, they say, look at the success of that Sinatra boy.	, .
And Dick can also see an anology between himself and the Sinatra boy. But to him the similarity is more pronounced in the case of women than of voice.
Report Campus Scuttlebutt System Highly Developed
By Seaman Ray O'Rourke
“I don’t know what the guy’s name = was, but he said that everybody below eighty percent in their grades was going to be bilged out and those above made Ensigns of ter one semester!”	.
“Noooo. —” breathed the wide eyed young trainee.	,
“Yes sir, that is the way it’s going. And that isn’t all. The V-12 program is closing up next term! Absolutely no more entrants.”	.
“No kidding,” the open mouth of the trainee again takes in air as the eyes blink. ■ ■	'
“No kidding,” repeats our little genius, lightly stepping off. the bus.	.
“Gee,” reverently murmurs - our vic
tim, thus extending his vocabulary to u three words. “You, knoiv, I always thought.something like that ivould hap- *'• pen!”
Notre Dame has one of the most perfectly developed scuttlebut systems in the service. Its skill with such trivial scuttlebut as “no more calisthenics,” or “two bottles of milk in the morning,” is well <t known. However when it bites its teeth into more fertile items the results are sometimes amazing.

For example, Christmas vacations: Notre Dame’s own scuttlebutt gremlin, t Boris Breeze, CCS, (Chief in charge— scuttlebutt) created a triumph out of * this one. A week-end was extended all the way from six days (Rario Rubenelli) to 30 days (James Bates Nickel).	-
When professors soberly announced that all grades below 80 per- cent were being turned into the office at mid-semester, the scuttlebutt results varied from a list who had to study three extra hours each day (T. A. Gaines) to where train-

ees were actually packing for Great Lakes. (Karl Marshall).
Boris Breeze has no preference as to material. The smallest trivia becomes tremendous in his expert hands. When one trainee couldn’t get vanilla ice cream at the Cafeteria, he was commenting later concerning the “dashed British who were getting all the milk.”
Mr. Breeze has two favorites on the campus. The sucker who believes scuttlebutt, and the character who deliberately spreads it. Both types are easy to spot, yet in varied degrees of effectiveness continue to live in every hall in their own little world of 20 day vacations and steaks every Saturday.
The remedy for scuttlebutt is simple: don’t believe it! The next time a voice tells something, “not to be repeated,” don’t believe it. When the guy next door bursts in with something yet to be announced, don’t believe it. In short, don’t believe anything that doesn’t appear on the bulletin board.
But we did hear that pay is going to be increased next month to 75 dollars!
However, we don’t believe it.
OBSERVATIONS
(Continued from page 5) month, and will not be continuing at Notre Dame.
3.	Of the second-semester men in the prescribed curricula who are to receive their classifying orders this month, many will remain at Notre Dame, for further preparation in these specialties: electrical engineering (communications and pre-radar), aeronautical engineering, deck, pre-medical and pre-den tai, and N.R.O.T.C. (general).
4.	Those second-semester men in the prescribed curricula who may be ordered to other universities in the Navy program may be sent to Massachusetts Institute of Technology or to the University of California, Los Angeles, for aerology; to the Illinois Institute of Technology for electrical power engineering; to the University of Michigan for N.R.-O.T.C. engineers and for supply corps courses; to the Iowa State College for mechanical engineering; and to Denison University and to Oberlin College for some deck quotas.
ON THE LONGER FUTURE :
1. The Chief of Naval Personnel has just announced a veterans’ counseling service for the purpose of offering complete counseling service on employment, rehabilitation, and claims. Each of the seven Veterans’ Demonstration Centers for this important service will be staffed
by appropriate counselors, representatives of the Veterans’ Administration, and representatives of the American Red Cross. The seven centers, established through the War Manpower Commission and the United States Employment Service, will eventually be expanded so that similar services will be available throughout the United States within comparative easy reach of any veteran.
ON NEW ARRIVALS FOR
NEXT SEMESTER :	.
1. Well over three hundred new basic trainees will arrive at Notre Dame to begin their first semester in the V-12 Program 1 March;, and it is expected that a considerable number of students with advanced standing will also report for duty on that date, including some pre-medical trainees, engineering candidates, and V-12 aviation trainees.

But there is a strong lament currently eating at the social smugness of the campus. In short, a great many men on campus would like to meet more Saint Mary’s girls (so help us, it’s true), but there is little or no opportunity to meet them. At one time we used to have Sunday afternoon parties, at which parties everyone present wore dog tags, greeted everyone and occasionally came back to Notre Dame elated. We suggest that St. Mary’s Student Council look into the possibilities of a return to this practice. We haven’t any student council here; and few of us have anyone at St. Mary’s interested in us sufficiently to warrant inviting us over. Oh, ours is a sad lot, isn’t it!! Please, girls—we haven’t any brass buttons, or gay stripes, or service ribbons, but keep us in mind, won’t you?
And now, we’re off to Rosie’s, as usual.

Thirty American colleges have adopted the University of Cincinnati’s plan of cooperative education whereby the gap between trade practices as taught in the classrooms and the way they operate in the business world will be eliminated. The plan was designed not only to allow experienced personnel to show students how to apply business theories, but also to allow executives to evaluate their student-employees “book learning.”

The poll showed that the great majority of those asked believed that college women should definitely not join the armed forces before graduation, and would prefer that they did not join at all.

THE COMEBACK
A young lady walked cheerfully into the post office, stopped at the wicket and asked for a three-cent stamp. The clerk was not in a very good humor and he snarled: “This is the information window; can’t you read?”
The lady meekly proceeded to the proper place, purchased her stamp, and returned. “You say this is the information window?”
“Yup,” yapped the clerk.
“Well, if I mail this letter tonight, will it be in New York tomorrow?” she continued.
“Sure,” the clerk barked.
“That’s funny,” was the final squelch;
“it’s addressed to Indianapolis.”
