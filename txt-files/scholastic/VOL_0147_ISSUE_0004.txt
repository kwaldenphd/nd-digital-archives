When Chastity Is 
Not Enough 
Banning gay priests unfair to celibate homo­sexuals 
On September 22, 2005, The New York Times reported that the Vatican soon would issue a ruling to ban homosexuals, even celibate homosexuals, from entering the seminary. Rumors about the ruling had been circulating for months, and Cardinal Oscar A.. Jt.'-·-Jeff Samardzjia: ,Th.at hair? Andres Rodriguez Maradiaga, S.D.B., briefly discussed it at the Notre

hi "If someone has a fear of blood, they will never be a surgeon," he said. "The same is true for the ordained ministry[ ... ] The priesthood is not for people oriented in that [homosexual] direction." 
Homosexual tendencies should not be sufficient grounds for ban­ning candidates for the priesthood.

Furthermore, all the Church requires of its priests with regard to their sexuality is that they remain celibate. Ifa priest keeps that vow, it should not matter whether he is attracted to men or women because he will not

The anticipated ruling appears to be a response to the sex abuse scan­dals that have jolted the Church for the past several years. This reasoning, however, is misguided, as it equates homosexuality with pedophilia. A 2002 article in the Monitor on Psychology quotes Bill Mochon, Psy. D., a Los Angeles psychologist who holds group sessions for priests, who says, "We know that 
sexual orientation doesn't predict sex crimes against minors." The ruling could force homosexual seminarians' to live lives of secrecy or

All Fenced In 
Turtle Creek's newest renovation project
,! 
• Daric Snyder 
rtle Creek often is one of the first picks for students wanting to 

1ve off campus. With its close proximity to the university and stu­
ent-friendly atmosphere, many find the apartment complex the .ideal place to live. But the recent addition of a fence surrounding Turtle Creek's main entrance has raised concerns about whether the apartments will continue to be such a student-friendly locale. 
Installed last month, the new wooden fence spans the northern edge of Turtle Creek along Vaness Street, which runs perpendicular to the eastern -fringe of the Notre Dame campus. The fence limits entrance to the complex, allowing pedestrians to enter only at the same places as vehicles. Two lockable gates also are located on either side the fence. According to Turtle Creek tenant and Notre Dame junior Julie Rose, the fence went up with little notice to the residents. "We weren't told much; the management hasn't even sent us a letter," she says. Rose adds that she and the other residents are uneasy about the fence, especially in light of recent changes to the disorderly housing ordinance that enable the city to evict off-campus students for multiple noise and alcohol violations. 
Josh Lamore, community manager of Turtle Creek, says he understands the concern of those residents who worry that changes in the ordinance will lead to changes at Turtle Creek. "I'm from the area, so I know the tradition is huge. Students live here for a reason, and we don't want to change that," he says. 
Lamore says the fence is part ofa recent renovation by the management that aims to enhance the condition of the facility. "We know that we're a place students want to live," Lamore says. "It just hasn't been that nice around here the last few years, and we want to make it more enjoyable." 
Lamore says the purpose of the fence is to help cut down on visibility from the surrounding area. The gates in the fence are to meet city safety concerns in order to allow for a quick evacuation in the event of a fire or any other emergency. Lamore also hopes the fence will increase security and curb complaints about the complex. 
But while Turtle Creek must cooperate with city officials, Lamore says management has no intent to stop student events, such as Rally in the Alley or other parties. "We don't want to evict students or have the atmosphere destroyed," he says. @

students, who largely do not have any experience in' dealing with landlords or property managers. Student naivete,. coupled with a variety ofother factors, can cause off-campus life to regress into a supreme exercise in dissatisfaction; 
Such sentiments were present in the minds of up-and-coming entrepreneurs Jake Burns and Joe Condit when these two· ·business gradu'ates fr9111 Mianfr: University ·of Ohfo decided to launch their own Web site for off.::campus hous..,

After the registration process has been completed, a group may bid on as many properties as it pleases for as much money as it wishes to spend. Condit and Burns claim that they developed their Web site design with the mentality that online:bid.: · ding is the wave of the consumer future. "We are adapting to an environment where the appeal is the one-stop shop," Condit says. 
One of the shortcomings of ClH that Burns and Condit hope to improve is the lack of substantive communication be­tween students and property managers· who have their properties listed on the Web site. "One ofour primary goals is to make the connections between students and the landlords better;" Burns says. In · order to facilitate this type of contact, Burns hopes to introduce a slightly re­designed version of the ClH Web site within the next two to three weeks. He says it will provide information on the various property managers in the area and make it easier for the two parties to get in touch with one another. 
Communication with students is of paramount concern for Mark Kramer, the owner of Kramer Properties, whose properties are currently posted ··· on ClH. "I like to have contact with · the students and want to continue to .•show the houses to them,"Kramer

sk almost any politician if he or she is a Republican or a Democrat, and you'll get a 

g od idea of how that person will vote on most major issues, including taxes, the military, Social Security and abortion. However, during ChiefJusticeJohn Rob­erts' confirmation hearings in the Senate last month, he refused to elaborate on his personal opinions on political issues. Instead, he explained to the committee how he would interpret the Constitution, revealing much more about the future of the Supreme Court under Roberts than any political label ever could. This week marks not only a new term but also a riew era for the Supreme Court, prompting an examination ofthe various methods of reading the Constitution -methods that will shape the Supreme Court's decisions for the next generation. 
On Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2005, Cass R. Sunstein (pictured above), a noted po­litical writer and the Karl N. Llewellyn Distinguished Professor ofJurisprudence at the University ofChicago Law School, delivered a lecture at the Notre Dame Law School on his new book "Radicals in Robes: Why Extreme Right-Wing Courts Are Wrong for America." In his 1999 book "One Case at a Time," Sun­stein divides theories of interpretation into distinct categories. 
Those falling into the first category are originalists, who believe that every case should be decided on the basis ofthe lan­guage ofthe Constitution or by the origi­nal intentions of the Founding Fathers. Critics oppose this method because they 
Cf1nder ~view 
The Constitution and how the new Supreme Court could interpret it 
deem it impossible to know definitively the original intentions of those men who wrote the document over 215 years ago. According to Sunstein, "At its worst, it is a partisan agenda dressed as a consti­tutional interpretation, and at its best, it undermines the Constitution." On the Supreme Court today, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas are originalism's big­gest proponents. According to Thomas, "The role ofa judge is to find out what the law says, not what he wants it to say." 
An alternative theory, held faithfully by the late William Rehnquist, former chief justice of the United States, states that judges are obliged to uphold majority rule as expressed through the legislature as often as possible. Unless the law is absolutely outrageous or blatantly dis­criminatory, the Supreme Court should let democracy work without interference from unelected judges. This philosophy posed a problem for Rehnquist dur­ing his confirmation hearings, though. The Senate unearthed a memo arguing against school integration that Rehnquist wrote when he was a law clerk for former Justice Robert Jackson in 1954. In the memo, Rehnquist wrote, "I think Plessy 
v. Fer~son (1896), the legal foundation for mandatory racial segregation, was right and should be re-affirmed." 
The most contentious theory by far is judicial activism. Its proponents claim that it allows judges to make fair deci­sions based on common sense and prevail­ing attitudes in society. Its critics call it "legislating from the bench" and accuse activist judges ofusurping the lawmaking duties of Congress and the state legisla­tures. Brown v. Board ofEducation (1954) and Griswold v. Connecticut (1968) are two 
,examples oflandmark cases that changed the United States drastically, despite be­ing activist. In Brown v. Board ofEduca­tion, for example, the Supreme Court ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional and demanded their in­

•tegration. Griswold v. Connecticut invali­dated a Connecticut law that forbade the use of contraception by married couples, effectively making contraception legal. Although it is practically unthinkable to consider any Supreme Court reversing these decisions today, the reasoning that the Supreme Court used to reach these decisions was based more on statistics and sociology than on the Constitution. When initially presenting Brown v. Board of Education to his colleagues; former Chief Justice Earl Warren barely relied on the Constitution and instead said, "In deciding this case, either you believe in the inherent inferiority of blacks or you don't." 
However, judicial activism does not necessarily correspond with liberalism. Sunstein condemns right-wing judges who practice judicial activism while claiming to be originalists. Such liber­ties as the right to personal privacy or Congress' power to make environmental laws, for example, are not explicitly in the Constitution, and some radical conserva­tive judges argue that this justifies deny­ing these rights to the American people, no matter what the cost to society. 
Sunstein advocates a minimalist ap­proach to constitutional interpretation, focusing on solving particular cases as narrowly as possible and with strong -emphasis on previous decisions. This ap­proach seems to be in tune with Justice Roberts' remarks during his confirmation . hearings. "Judges are like umpires," Rob­erts says. "Umpires don't make the laws; they apply them." Now confirmation sea­son is over for Roberts, and it's time for him to play some judicial hardball. Only then can the American people know what theory of interpretation suits him best. 0

The necessityofscrounging up cashfor food typically is not a daily concern for most Notre Dame students. There are a variety of pay­mentoptions offered bythe university -such as Flex Points, DomerDollars, student account charges and dining hall board meals -all of which are accessible with the swipe ofa student ID card, and, according to Keith Leek, marketing manager ofFood Services, 
approximately6,500 on-campus.2 0 0 6 
and 800 off-campus students take advantage ofNotre Dame meal plans. Students living on campus have a choice between the Premium 21 meal plan, which of­fers three dining hall meals per day, or the Flex 14 meal plan, which allows 14 meals per week with $280 in Flex Points throughout the semester. 
Food Services provides different options for off-campus students so that they may purchase the number ofdininghallmeals thatf;.t theirneeds. Options include 25, 32, SO, 80 or 120 meals per semester, with $110 in Flex Points for each option. The prices vary from $340 for the Select 25 meal plan

However, because Food Services increases the amount ofFlex Points included with the meal plan option eachyear, on-campus students currently enjoy $280 in Flex Points a semester-the highestamount ofFlex Points allotted to students in univer­sity history. 
Despite the increasing amount of Flex Points given to them each year, students -who collectively spent $3.5 million in Flex Points during the 2004-2005 academic year -still find ways to run out before the semester ends. As on-campus senior Laura Trettel, whose Flex Point spending habits mirror those of many Notre Dame students, indicates, "I usually 
run out ofFlex Points around fall 
break each year." 
As Flex Points dwindle out of 
students' accounts, Domer Dol­
lars become many students' impor­tantmeans ofspending money. Domer Dollars, electronic funds which canbe deposited into students' accounts via credit card or check, make it easy for students to spend more oftheir ortheir parents' money with a swipe of their student ID card. According to Leek, during the 2004-2005 academic year, students spent a total of$1.25 million in Domer Dollar transactions. The most common use of Domer Dollars was for vending or laundry facilities 
$ 448.50 $ 4,320.00 $ 1,600.00 $ 1,256.50 $ 3,870.00 $ 2,235.00 $ 3,225.00 $ 625.00 
$17,580.00 
The Party Scene 
On the weekend, students' wallets oftenare drained by alcohol purchases. Inaddition to hostingparties, students pay covers at the bars, and the prices ofdrinks add up throughout the night, despite drinkspecials. Cab fares to acnd from parties and bars also increase student expenditures. 
When the weatheris warm, students will walk to parties at Turtle Creek 

and Clover Ridge or walk to 
bars close to campus, such as 
Bookmakers and the Line­
backer, making cab fares a 
seasonal expense. However, 
once the weather turns cold, cabs become an essential component ofweekend outings, and fares can add up quickly. 
Despite seem­ingly nominal f$costs o 2 to  I just can't go to the Notre Dame book- that I've been here at Notre Dame, I've seen students in counseling

fare alone ifthey go to a couple ofpar­ties, a bar and a late-night restaurant before heading home. 
After getting to the bars, students typically spend around $5 on cover, then $10 to $20 for drinks at the bar. In one night, the expense ofgoing out could add up to upwards of$30. 
The cost of hosting parties is even more substantial, with kegs amount­ing to around $60 each and 24-cases ofbeer costing on average $15. 
During football season, rather than staying in South Bend and spending theirmoneyonweekendentertainment in the surrounding communi-ty, many students instead opt to travel with the Notre Dame football team to away games. From a financial standpoint, road tripping to away games can be expensive due to the cost of gas alone. To combat the substantial cost of road tripping, some students try alternative means of traveling to and from close away games by rent­ing buses. Senior Melissa Saxer says thatfor the Notre Dame-University of Michigan football game, she and her friends rented a bus, which costaround $35 per person. While not an outra­

with the $60 face value price oftickets plus the costs oftailgating and alcohol, a day trip to a nearby away game could add up to well over $100. 
Trying ·to Fit In 
While a large majority of Notre Dame students come from affluent backgrounds, a sizeable population of students on campus come from fami­lies with lower incomes. This dispar­ity in wealth, while unavoidable, can cause frustration in students from lower socioeconomic brackets when they attempt to live the "Notre Dame college lifestyle." 
AccordingtoWendySettle, staffpsy­chologist at the University Counseling Center, "Over the years 
"Some felt left out in classes because other students talked about dinner conversations at home about their stocks and investments." 
During a Personal Growth Group counseling session, Settle says that the group discussed how students at NotreDamehaveaverynarrowdefini­tion of how one should look. ."There were peals oflaughter about having to wear the 'right clothes' and how guys had to wear a certain type ofbaseball cap with the bill curled 'just right,"' Settle says. 

features ofNotre Dame students' 
After the laughter died down, the group talked about the· pressure to confor,m to the Notre Dame "ac­cepted standard" of wearing certain name brand items to project a par­ticular image ofwealth and success. While Notre Dame has no dress code or uniform that students are required to wear, students typically use name-brand clothing or certain acceptable attire to try blend in with the campus community. "Most Notre Dame guys wear polo shirts and Ab­ercrombie shorts or nice jeans from Express or Abercrombie," junior Jeff Stephens says.Jeans from those stores costbetween$60and$200forwomen 
forming to Notre Dame's "accepted standard" can be costly for students. 
While jeans seem to be the standard issue for the typical college student, many business students recognize a certain acceptable attire within the Mendoza College of Business of the university. Business students are re­quired to dress up in business casual attire for frequent class presentations, and collared shirts and dress slacks increase clothing expenses. As senior Amanda Tedesco notes, "The transi­tion to business casual attire becomes a financial endeavor 
~·:•·l\~t, [for students]." Additionally, L'J;,:\ ·Y~t many students within the var-,i:· ·, ' ied colleges of the university feel the need to shell out money for expensive business suits and clothes 
for careerfairs and interviews for jobs and internships. 
Settle says students can be complicit in conformingto and thereby allowing a narrowly defined Notre Dameimage. She says students need to speakup and "have the courage to do our part to increase the acceptance ofall kinds of diversity on this campus." 
Shopping -In Per­
son or Online? 
Basic costs like furnishing a dorm room and purchasing textbooks can add up for anystudentatthe beginning of the school year. But some students choose to spend lavishly. Instead of sleepingon bunkbeds in a cinderblock residence hall, some students like to addpersonalityand spend extra money on their dorm rooms. Luxuries include such items as lofts, plush couches, satellite dishes and decorations. Ex­pensive electronics also are common 
dorm rooms. Sophomore Jor­
dan Lacy is no exception: "We 
have a projector hooked up to 
everything -a DV]) player, XBox, PlayStation and satellite with TiVo. The projector was $600, which ~ we all split, and the others we each ~ brought," Lacy says. ffi 
Some students, like juniorJulie Put­nam, indicated that they use shopping ~ as a way to de-stress from the pres-~ sures ofacademic life. "I go to the mall ~ once every three weeks usually afte~

I I take an exam," Putnam says. And •· Notre Dame students rely on their 20 hours per week at Bone:fish Grill 
while the shopping selection in South Bend is minimal compared to larger cities, students find ways to spend their money on clothing. 
Shopping online with the click of a button is a frequent way students avoid University Park Mall while still spending money on large purchases. "When I'm at school I shop online from Sephora,J. Crew and L.L. Bean about once or twice a month. Online shopping is a better option here be­cause there's only one mall in South Bend, and you can get everything you need online," sophomore Lindsay Wrightsays. Sophomore Lindsay Mey­er adds, "It's so easy to go online and just click, and you don't even realize thatyou're shopping." Seconding that notion is junior Larissa ZavalaMejia: "Ibuyshoes online about once a week because it's easier and delivers to my door -and I'm a shoe-aholic." 
Onlineshoppingcanextendto more thanjustclothes, cosmetics and shoes. "Ispend mymoneyonmusic thatI get from iTunes to putonmy iPod," senior Curtis Leightonsays. Leighton is just one of many Notre Dame students who· often use iPods when walking to and from class or while studying in the library. However, music down­loads from iTunes, in addition to the purchase o.fan iPod, can add up. With the combinationofiPods, whose costs range from $99 for a:512MB iPod shuffle to $399 for a 60GB iPod, and the •additional purchase of CDs or $0.99 downloads fromiTunes, the cost oflistening to music skyrockets. 
Another shopping venue that stu­dents often use is Chicago, whose close proximity to Notre Dame provides students with the generous shopping selection that only a large city can. Students travel to Chicago in groups onweekends, excited to take advantage ofthe scores ofdesigner lines available on Michigan Avenue. Buying expen­sive cosmetics, perfumes and clothes, however, quickly adds up, as some de­signers feature products that run for upwards of$700 for a single item.

cards and spend money as ifthey have it, goinginto huge debt," Settle says. "Many times this tan create prob..: lems at home because their parents feel obligated to help with the bills," she adds. 
According to Schmuhl, debit cards are a good alternative, as itis possible to use something more accesible than cash and more practical than checks to pay for purchases without the risk of going into debt. Debit cards are simply a substitute for checks and are frequently used by college students. 
Schmuhl also suggests that students balance their checkbooks frequently so as to keep track of the amount of cashleft in their accounts. A correctly balanced checkbook will prevent stu­dents from overdrawingandwill aid in checking against misstatements made by the bank, Schmuhl says. 
While most college students lack sufficient income for investing for the future, saving some money from summer jobs still may help students when they graduate and enter the real world. Investments in stocks, money markets and savings for retirement such as IRAs or Roth IRAs are im­portant options for students to learn aboutincollege. CarlAckermann, pro­fessor offinance, encourages students to become aware ofeconomic matters. "I feel strongly that students should be educated in personal finance and it shouldbe a fundamental partofcourse curriculum," he says. Ackermann will be teaching a personal finance.course next fall at Notre Dame, and thinks it is important for students to be edu­cated in personal finance and invest­ments during college so they can put their knowledge into practice after they graduate. He recommends that students read "Personal Finance for Dummies" cover to cover and use the suggestions it offers.

Forexample, withNotre Dame study abroad programs spanning the globe, many students wanting to visit friends living abroad over breaks must begin saving months before their travels. Sophomore KristinDeambrosio notes, "All my savings are going to a trip to London for fall break."

Although they're justpieces ofplas­tic, creditcards offer the temptation of endless spendingwithouthavingto see one physical dollar spent. And while credit cards may seem ideal for more costly items and for receiving promo­
tional. bene­fits, this is only true in­somuch as stu­dents are able to pay offtheir debts. 
AC ­cording to data from student 1 o an provid­er Nel­lie Mae, the na­tional average 0 U t ­stand­

The survey also indicated that students from the Northeast region had the lowest outstanding average balances, while students from the Midwest had the highest balances. 
"I think credit cards are fine as a substitute for cash, but they should never be used for borrowing. The in­terest rates on credit card debt are the highest rates," Bill Schmuhl, professor ofaccountancy, says. 
While students at Notre Dame may use credit cards to finance their ex­penses, "There are a few students who succumb to the temptation of credit

ecords were broken at The New York 
Times two weeks ago when an article 
by Louise Story became the second most e-mailed story in the newspaper's history. Itwould be nice to say that this ap­parently newsworthy article was a work of Pulitzer-caliber journalism that unveiled political tyranny, or even an in-depth in­vestigation of human rights violations. It wasn't. Rather, Story's popular front-page piece, "Many Women at Elite Colleges Set Career Path to Motherhood" (September 20, 2005), was an anecdote-filled feature devoid of any substantiated data. 
Although Story does not explicitly declare that there is a new trend among women ofelite colleges to forego work for family, the frequent-though unsubstan­tiated -use of the word "many" in her article implies such a movement. What's more, not only does the article suggest a trend without even a hint ofscientific evi­dence, the headline and content are eerily similar to an article from the December 28, 1980, edition of The New York Times, titled "Many Young Women Now Say They'd Pick Family Over Career." Ironi­cally, the 1980 article suggests the same trend that Story describes nearly 25 years later, also by using anecdotes and an excess of the word "many." 
The existence of two nearly identical stories separated by 2 5 years hints that the phenomenon oflvy League coeds eschew­ing high-powered careers for motherhood is not a recent national trend, as Story sug­gests. Rather, this so-called "new develop­ment" appears to be a historical constant among a few individuals of the generally economically prosperous Ivy League. 
Despite all of this, the article has man­aged to stimulate much discussion among women and men ofall ages in the past few weeks. However, it is questionable as to whether the content of these discussions has been packed with the same contro­versial phrasings of a media buzz story or more substantial examinations. It is true that a major goal ofthe third-wave feminist movement was to give women choices. In light ofthis, there is nothing anti-feminist

cessful career woman -as long as tlrnt is her choice. To really examine women and their career paths today, pe,rh,aps instead of bickering over an information­ally weightless article, people should be looking at both the traditional option ofmotherhood, as well as all of the choices available to women and the degree to which gender con­strains tl1ese choices. 
, Whilecol­leges across the board ac­cept roughly an equal amount ofmen and women each year, the proportion ofmen holding prestigious and well-paying jobs is much higher than the percentage ofwomen holding those jobs. According to the U.S. Department ofLa­bor, only 23 percent of CEOs and about a third of lawyers, directors, producers and physicians in the United States are female. In the political sphere, only 14 of 100 senators and 67 of435 representatives are female. So why are women being ac­cepted to college at a rate equal to men, but pursuing high-powered jobs at a much lower rate? 
For one thing, it is very difficult for women who do wish to have children to avoid the physical and emotional con­straints of pregnancy, as well as at least half of the enormous responsibilities of young children. It also is unlikely that any woman could pursue partnership at a law firm; work as a full-time surgeon in a hospital; or follow the tenure track as a professor during or immediately after her pregnancy. 
Moreover, if a smart, married woman with a young child does not have ambi­tions ofbeing a CEO or senator but would like to work part-time, few jobs, especially those in the career fields that many Ivy League or Notre Dame students would like to enter into after college, will offer such an option. Likewise, ifa woman and her husband both want to work, they must begin the search for quality childcare, or they both need to work part-time, a difficult task in a country 
< 
where one of the few ways to obtain health insurance is through full-time employ­ment. And some women would neverconsider asking their husbands to work part­time because of stigmas attached to deviations from tradi­tional gender roles. 
These obstacles to choice are the issue~ that truly indicate the state of the women's movement, and it is these issues, and not the individual lifestyles ofa few elite Ivy Leaguers, that should be appearing on page one of the country's most presti ­gious newspapers. @

The 
Room 
Three students inhabit a little-known room in the Pasquerilla Center 
• Ka-1:hleen Sullivan
If Carroll guys want to eat dinner at South Dining Hall, they have quite a 
hike ahead of them. But they are not the only ones. Head out past the library and across Juniper ·Road, and eventually you will stumble into the Pas­querilla Center, better known as the ROTC building. Hang a right inside the main doors, and you'll happen upon room 118, the unlikely and little-known home ofjuniors Dan Henebery andJohn-Paul "Pope" Grainey and sophomore Pat Adrian. These three roommates have the only student dorm room in the entire building. 
It used to be common uni­versity practice to have dorm rooms all over campus, ranging from residences in various aca ­demic buildings to Notre Dame Stadium. However, as current students know, that is a rare occurrence nowadays. "Myth has it," Henebery explains, "that our dorm room came into existence because ROTC wanted to hold M-16 missiles in the building, but could only do so ifsomeone resided in it at all times. Though ROTC now · ., stores all of its weapons in the Security Building, our room still exists before moving in to their new abode. so someone is always arourld to let cadets Last year, Henebery discovered that and shipmen into the building's 24-hour since the room's current residents would space." be graduating, it would be open for new

riors. Grainey applied for the second spot, and Adrian received the third when an­other candidate decided to move to Turtle Creek. 
The roommates have cer­tainly made the room their own. They have a lot of space to spread out, which is one of the first things you notice when you walk into the room. "It's three times as big as my old triple," says Adrian, a ROTC Marine. Adrian's signature piece in the room is a poster of him­self playing soccer that hangs by the door. "It's a conversa­tion piece," he says. 
Across the room is a huge collage photo ofthe Dome in black and white that covers the whole wall. "A friend of ours took the picture. We blew it up on a computer program and then used up a .print quota to print it. It was like putting together a puzzle," says Grainey, a member of the Air Force ROTC program. Another collage ofthe Four Horsemen graces the adjoining wall, and a picture of Knute Rockne is in the works. Also present on this side of the room is the abode of the boys' fourth roommate, a gecko named Bill. "One ofmy friends was doing a biol­

According to the•:guys,· the best part of living in the ROTC building is tell­ing people you live :there~ "I love seeing people's reactions when I tell them where I live," Grainey says. "People say, 'You re­ally live in the ROTC-building?' and are completely shocked. Then they say, 'I'll have to come check that out."' 
Living in a building where you take classes also has its perks, especiallywhen you're running late in the morning and

Nicole Dorner I 
Sports Editor ...............................•...........................j Notre Dame knows what it takes to dominate, I and the Irish are not about to let the Trojans 
walk into their stadium again and punish them, especially considering the way the Trojans have played recently. USC was able to win its last two games after play­ing only one good quarter of football. But on October 15, all the Trojans will be able to do is watch when the stu­dents storm the field after the Irish 
end their winning streak, 41-38........... Michael Kim 
Assistant Sports.Editor ··························' Notre Dame can stop the Tro­jans, but they'll have a difficult 
time stopping junior running back Reggie Bush. I see Charlie Weis growing out the grass at Notre Dame Stadium to negate some of the speed of USC, and a cold October day only helps. Weis will do everything he can to control the clock on offense to keep Bush off the field as long as possible. It's going to be dif­ficult, considering the clock stops on first downs in the college game. But Notre Dame will hold off an expected fourth-quarter push by 
USC and win this game 24-17 to end the Trojan Dynasty .

faces its biggest challenge yet

• Michael Kim 
J:!Jad Coach Charlie Weis (ND 78) and his Notre Dame foot­ball team. made a strong state­g nst Purdue. Scoring 49 points and racking up 621 yards in total offense, last Saturday's game marked the first time an Irish team broke the 600-yard barrier since the Lou Holtz days.Junior quarter­back Brady Quinn went 29 for 36 for an unprecedented 80.5 percent completion rate and threw for 440 yards, becoming the only quarterback in Notre Dame his­tory with three 400-yard games. Highly-touted Purdue Defensive Co­ordinator Brock Spack looked clueless all night, especially after sophomore running back Darius Walker ran into the end zone untouched on a cleverly-designed draw play. Even former Irish Head Coach Bob Davie, who was announcing the game for ESPN, officially stated he was joining the Weis bandwagon. Notre Dame quickly is becoming the feared powerhouse it used to be. However, like Luke Skywalker confronting the emperor, the Irish won't reach full circle until they confront the master, USC Head Coach Pete Carroll and his Trojans. Some say that an Irish victory against the mighty Trojans is impossible. USC has too much firepower, led by its junior quarterback, reigning Reisman Trophy­winnerMattLeinart, and junior running back Reggie Bush. Notre Dame has been beaten by 31 points in each of the last three meetings with their West Coast rival, and this meeting will be the fifth time Notre Dame plays USC when the Trojans are ranked No. l; the Trojans have wcin all four of those previous en­counters.

In terms of the show's in­fluence, suffice it to say that among "Sex and the City," "Desperate Housewives," stern cell research and the Second Com­ing, none would be possible without the cutting-edge comedy with which "The Golden Girls" revolutionized network television. 

My personal obsession aside, sources I just now fabricated tell me that the show is increasingly popular among the college­aged, as well as the 40-and-single-and­living-above-their-parents' -garage-aged. "The Golden Girls" is the third most frequently watched rerun on TV today and even got a shout out on "The O.C.," though I wouldn't know personally, see­ing as how nothing short of the threat of chemical castration could compel any rational human being to watch that show. 
The only entertaining aspect of "The O.C." is watching Mischa Barton spend 40 minutes each week struggling unsuc­cessfully to pretend that she is not in fact 
, a cyborg engineered by Neutrogena and sent back from the future to crush the human resistance. I'm on to you, Barton. 
I will say, however, that while I love 

"The Golden Girls," I· have in the past made some unhealthy life choices with regards to the show. Over the summer I would watch the show two, three, 12 times a day, growing more obsessed each day with the laughs, the love and the late­1980s fashion trends. Sometimes I'd for­get to lock the door, and more than a few 

times my parents walked in on me, clad in lavender stirrup pants and an oversized, geometric sweatshirt with pushed-up sleeves. My voice would be barely audi­ble as I croaked sarcastic barbs through parched lips, my eyes permanently rolled back into my head in exasperation after expressing hour after grueling hour of wry bemusement at Rose's St. Olaf stories, Blanche's sexual escapades and Sophia's crotchety sniping. 

Should college students be financially independent? 
/Financial (_{Jependence 
Cighteen credits ofclass work., undergraduate chemistry research, involvement in two Campus Mini~try orga­nizations, First Year of Studies chemistry tutoring, hall governinent, time to eat, time with friends to keep me human, and absolutely not enough time to sleep; financial independence does not fit into my schedule. All you science majors out there know exactly what I am talking about. Let's face it, many of us science buffs want to pursue careers in medicine, so acceptance into medical school can and will be one ofthe more decisive moments in our lives. We need good grades. It is that simple. Labs, homework assignments and class reaclings take an inordinate amountoftime, and the aspect ofour lives that suffers is quantity of sleep (that is, of course, only ifwe want to remain social creatures). I do not even need to discuss how much time we need to invest in extracurricular activities. Thirty-two-hour days would make life wonderful, but the as­tronomers have only given us 24. I have a goal in life. I will reach it. I am doing what needs to be done. I simply do not have time to work 20 or more hours a week and support myself financially. Some may think I have time to earn money over the summer. Wrong. No biologist is going to pay an under­graduate $5,000 a summer to aid in his life's work. Even ifI did make $5,000 a summer, would that be enough? However, :financial dependence does not imply that I am blind to :financial needs and careful watching of exp~nses. It does not work that way. For anyone whom it does, !"would like to take this opportunity to call you "spoiled." Myparents give me a sum ofmoney each semester, and it then becomes myresponsibility. I need to pay offcredit card expenses with it, balance my checkbook, and support my JimmyJohn's ad­diction all with that one shot of cash. I am not an account­ing major, but no one is g9ing to tell me because I am not :financially independent that I am going to be "lost" when I enter the "real world." In about seven short years, after medical school, my financial situation will still be the same: work and money. Only, at that time, my work will produce money and not cost it. 0
