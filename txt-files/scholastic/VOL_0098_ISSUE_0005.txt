CAMPUS PERSONALITIES OR SOMETHING
In accord with our past policy, ESCAPE this week presents another one of those interviews that should never have been made in the first place. This time meet Stanley Switchblade.
“I hear ya knockin’ man, ya don’t hafta wear a hole through the door.”
© “Are you the one with the Oklahoma tickets?”
“No, that’s Willy.”
“Is he around?”
“No, he scratched. Anyhow he sold the tickets. I’m Stanley Switchblade, Stan the Man to the boys. My pad’s across the hall.”
“Your pad?”
“My room.”
a “Oh. I guess you’ll do. Besides Granting tickets I’m also interviewing
some students. Would you mind answering a few questions?”
“Whadaya think, I’m a pigeon?”
“You look human to me, I guess.”
“Look chief, what’s your bit?”
“My bit?”
“Your angle. Whadaya selllin’? Wha-samatta, you don’t dig plain English?”
“I must have left my pocket Thesaur-€hs in my room. I can’t seem to find it.
But I’m not selling anything. I’m trying to do a few interviews with outstanding freshmen and you certainly seem to stand out. So I just want to ask you a few easy questions.”
“Sounds like an alright scene. Pass. . over the skins and then we’ll flap.” : “You mean you want money?” a “No, banana peels; whadaya kiddin’ ”me? You want I should talk for free, or something?”
. “Well Stan, I’m afraid my budget is .. not quite what it could be, so no skins, . I’nr afraid.”
“Well, Ace, no jack, no flap. But you - wanna know my personal opinion of this ■■place?”
® “That’s the idea.”
October 26, 1956
“Get this then. Quote: It’s a bad scene. It bugs me. Unquote.”
“A penetrating and incisive analysis, Stanley.”
“Don’t mention it. Now you tell me. What’s the chances of cutting in on the rackets around here?”
“I’m afraid I’m not too versed on the respective territories of the local mobs, Stan.”
“I don’t figure a square like yourself would know anyhow. Chief, your ol’ dad has got to scratch. I got a fish wants to shoot some stick for a few bills. Later, man.”
“Hold it a second, Stan. I just thought of a racket for you. Know where the main building is?”
“Yeah.”
. “You go over there to the back door into the basement, take the stairway to the light, go up to the second floor, go to the left, walk in the office there at the back and tell them you want to run the football pool this year. Got it?”
“Yeah, dad, and thanks.”
“Don’t mention it, Stan.”
MOVE OVER MISS AMERICA
Men, is there a cute little ketchup-smeared face over at the dining hall that makes your pulse beat faster? Does the lilting music of a fresh young voice saying: “Sorry, no more pork chops,” ring in your ears every night before you go to sleep? In short, do you have a favorite chow hall queen?
If so, here’s your big chance. With this issue ESCAPE announces its first (and in all probability, last) annual Jeanie the Queen of the Chotv Hall contest. The rules are simple, and the prizes are almost unbelievable.
Who is eligible? Any one of the whole mess of teen-age bobby-soxers (Female type girls of the opposite sex, naturally) who work over there. Who may nominate a contestant? Any
Domer in good standing. How do you know you’re in good standing? What’s the matter, a guilty conscience?
The contest will be judged on the basis of looks and talent. In the talent category will be such events as traypiling races, blind-folded chair-wiping, left and right handed gravy ladling, and the like.
When it come to the second part of the contest, particular attention will be paid to number of gravy spots on apron, best “hair-in-eyes” hairdo, biggest dimple, shapliest ankles, and most-unusual shoes, as well as the many many other things that go to make up a hue chow hall queen.
Among the prizes that the winner will receive are included a season’s pass to Kewpee’s, a pair of mink chukka boots with platinum zippers, two tickets to the “Tommy Dee Dinner-Winner Show,” and a chance to be promoted to table-wiper 1st class.
So hurry up and send those' nominations in today. This may be that little doll’s big chance. Don’t be responsible for her missing it. That address again is: Contest, General Delivery, Poznan, Poland.
A RETRACTION
Last week I mentioned that campus Mouseketeei- headquarters was located in 41 Sorin. It was called to my attention rather forcefully that this was an error. The address is 31, not 41. Mea culpa, mea culpa.
HAVE YOU NOTICED . . .
That your room-mate has been shaving every morning, and putting on his best Ivy League sport shirt and sweater and so forth. No, he hasn’t flipped; there’s a cameraman on campus, and they’re doing background film for a movie about ND. The Brando in the troops is showing. Pardon me, I’m late for my screen test.

SENATOR’S OPINION
Editor:
I would like to commend Charles McKendrick for his editorial of this Oct. 12 on the Student Senate. Although this may sound rather hackneyed coming from a defeated candidate for the office of Student Senate President, I do feel that the editorial hit the nail on the head when it stated that the Senate must prove itself to the students and not the other way around.
It is my humble opinion that the Senate should concern itself less with writing, re-writing, and again writing constitutions (which are often ignored by the Senate, anyway), and also realize that putting on bigger and better Victory Dances (which have existed at Notre Dame long before the Senate) are not the prime functions of the Senate.
I believe that the Senate members were elected by the students primarily to represent them before the Administration, a duty, up till now, which has been conveniently sidestepped.
It does not take a great deal of intelligence for any student at Notre Dame to realize that there are general ideas, opinions, and complaints held by the students that the Senate could try to alleviate or put through by intelligent negotiations with the University administration. If the Senate would stop playing government and realize that it is a supposed body representing the students, the students would look more kindly on the efforts of the Senate.
In noting the Letter to the Editor in last week’s Scholastic signed by Senators Pleus and Kiley I noticed that they made the statement that the Senate records are up to date as of Oct. 1. Unfortunately this is not completely true as shown in the Senate meeting of Oct. 17 when the Senate treasurer admitted that he was unable to ascertain the Senate’s net worth as of last June. Having served in the Senate prior to either of these gentlemen I was not surprised, but I was surprised that they could claim that all was well.

the spirit
Thermit an unbeliever to digest a little crow. When I went to the pep rally the night before the Michigan State ^game, I couldn’t help feeling that the spirit bubble was going
to burst horribly the following afternoon. In spite of the encouraging words of Father Joyce and Don Miller, it didn’t seem possible that spirit could do much in our favoi' against the powerhouse from East Lansing.
? As a matter of fact,’ the spirit in the Fieldhouse Friday night was not the greatest ever displayed. The crowd was certainly a huge one, and the yelling that was permitted was certainly loud enough. But I think most of the seniors will admit that they have seen better rallies and greater displays G>f spirit. Think back to our freshman year when, after being tied by Iowa on the previous Saturday, Capt. Don Penza stood before the student body and wept as he apologized for the team. The sustained demonstration that refused to acknowledge his apology lasted in excess of twenty minutes.
. And incidentally, that was the year we were “number one.” But it was a different story that year; the spirit was great but so was the team. They went out the next day and ran over their opponents. As it looked this year, our team didn’t
■ have a chance to stay in the game with Michigan State, 0pirit or not.
; As it turned out however, the spirit meant something after all. And I was glad to swallow that skeptical bird as I watched the Irish take everything the Spartans had to offer and shove it back down their throats. A few breaks in our favor might have broken their backs.
But why say this after we took such a walloping? I say /. it because, after finding that the spirit does mean something, I don’t want to see it sold short. The team that lost to Purdue two weeks aero didn’t have the right to be on the
I $ame field with Michigan State. But that wasn’t the same ■'learn that outplayed the Spartans in fundamentals in the game Saturday. And it was this latter team that displayed the real Notre Dame spirit; a thing which is hard to define, but might be outlined simply: ‘‘NOBODY is better than Notre Dame unless they can prove it!3'
• And though Michigan State did finally run away from . the Irish, they had a very tough time doing it. The faster J and more experienced Spartans backs had to prove they —were the best in the country; they weren’t given anything Wor nothing.
, The point here is that the Notre Dame spirit isn’t some । . miraculous power that will assure us victory in every game.
- But it is something that proves to every Notre Dame op- ’ ; j pdnent that it’s been in a ball game. And now that Terry | /^Brennan’s boys have finally realized they can be as tough = r as anybody they play, maybe they can concentrate on being > $ better.	•

rude exhibition
Adlai Stevenson visited our campus last Saturday to at-/A tend the Michigan State game. The Democratic Presidential nominee viewed the Irish-Spartan struggle as the guest of the President of the University, Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh C.S.C.	•
While most observers attached political significance to Mr. Stevenson’s appearance, the fact remains that he did not actively campaign while at Notre Dame. Granted that the main reason for Mr. Stevenson’s visit was to drum up publicity for his campaign, nevertheless he did not make a political speech, nor was he even introduced to the crowd at the game. . o
But Mr. Stevenson’s attendance was not overlooked by several members of the student body. These persons, whether good naturedly or not, committed an extremely rude gesture toward not only a distinguished American, but also the guest of the President of the University.
These several persons, performing at their juvenile best, held up a sign which proclaimed “We Like Ike” during halftime of the game. The banner, held aloft in the senior section, was waved about as its bearers exhorted the entire student body to pick up the familiar GOP chant.
There are several reasons why I believe this demonstration to be extremely rude and indicative of very poor taste on the part of not only those who held the sign, but also of those who joined in as the chorus.	.
First of all, Mr. Stevenson did not have the opportunity to retort to the Ike demonstration. He came here, I agree, probably to advance his political stature, but he did not attend the game to incite a political demonstration, nor did he cause one to ensue by making a grand and glorious entrance. I maintain that it was very7 tactless on the part of these same individuals to taunt Stevenson with political hoop-la when he had taken no part in any himself.
Secondly, these people did not merely tiy to show the entire crowd that Ike is the popular choice of Notre Dame students. From their every gesture one could easily deduce that the cheer was started in an effort to show the students’ disapproval of Mr. Stevenson’s candidacy.
Actually, the activities of these individuals could not help but be successful. Any local observer will tell you that the easiest thing at Notre Dame is to get the student body to make noise at the football games.
I hope that the next time a political figure visits the Notre Dame campus, be he Democrat or Republican, he will be treated with utmost respect, even by those who do not agree with his political sentiments.
Many people will claim that this writing is the statement of a Stevenson supporter who was disgruntled at his reception last Saturday. It is not intended as such, but is merely a comment on what I believe to be an unwarranted exhibition.	—C. McK.
P.S. At Vice-President Richard M. Nixon’s speech in . the Drill Hall Tuesday a similar incident occurred. The same observations as stated above hold true for these men also.

DWIGHT EISENHOWER
The students’ choice
Ike Tops Adlai, 3-1, In Campus Balloting
President Dwight D. Eisenhower scored an impressive election victory ^»ver former Governor Adlai Stevenson in last Tuesday’s Mock Election. The final tabulation of the balloting showed that Eisenhower had almost a three to one edge over his rival.
The Republican Presidential candidate received 543 votes, or 72 per cent of the 754 ballots cast, while the Democratic candidate Stevenson totaled 208 votes, or 28 per cent.
The Prohibition candidate, also on the ^Indiana ballot, received three votes, and the Socialist party received none.
Ike received 180 votes from the off-campus, Pangborn, vetville, and sophomore voters, while Stevenson pulled 74 votes. From the freshman, junior, and senior halls, Eisenhower received 363 votes to 138 votes for Stevenson.
This total is in step with the 1952 ^lock Election on campus when Eisenhower received 2,128, or 61 per cent of the total 3,465 votes cast, while Stevenson’s total was 1,337 votes, or 39 per cent. Thus, in 1952, the Eisenhower-Stevenson ratio on campus was six-to-‘ four.
Only 754 out of 1,636 registered voters - 4^ast their ballots. Tom Hawekotte, president of the Academy of Political
SOPHS LAUNCH ‘SHOWBOAT’ FOR CLASS WEEKEND TRIP

In addition to the Cotillion this evening, the couples will also attend the annual bonfire pep-rally. Tomorrow af-
Science, pointed out that the low turnout was due to publicity failures caused by many of the Mock Election posters being taken from their places on the bulletin boards.
A misunderstanding also occurred on the number of voting machines which were to be used. Originally, the Academy was supposed to receive five machines for the five precincts. On Tuesday, however, only two machines were in use.
ternoon, they will attend the Oklahoma-Notre Dame football game. Following the game is the Victory Dance in the Drill Hall at 8:30 p.m.

claim by newspapers and audiences throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe. In the latter part of 1955, the quartet spent four months on a European tour.

*Senate Announces First Semester Budget; Final Constitutional Amendments Approved
An estimated net income of $1,289 was announced by the Student Senate in the budget for the period of September 1, 1956 to January 31, 1957.
The fiscal report showed total ex-Vpenses for the first semester at $14,854 with total income of $16,143, leaving a net income of over $1,000. This carryover of income is necessary to offset financial loss primarily in social activities in the second semester.
Chief expenditure for this period will be the social commission with almost $9,000 and the class, hall and college funds totaling $1,750. The social cbnr-^mission, which will bring in over $10,000, and the first semester portion of the student activity fee of $5,183, form the main source of income.
During the meetings of the last two weeks, the revised constitution reached final form. One amendment, enumerating constitutional revision procedure was passed, and a second requesting a change in Freshman Senate voting rights, was defeated.
© Under the passed resolution, the constitution may be amended by either two-thirds vote of the full voting membership of the Senate or by a vote exceeding 50 per cent of the student enrollment.
A move to give freshman representatives immediate voting rights upon their elections wer defeated.
With the constitution completed by £\the old Senate, the meeting of Oct. 17 ’“'was opened to the recently elected senators. They participated officially in student government by voting approval of the Monogram Club’s request for joint operation with the Senate for the Victory Dance on Nov. 17. As in previous
years, the Monogram Club will receive 60 pei- cent of the profit and the Senate 40 per cent.
The debate on the Senate floor over passage of this motion rose from a misunderstood agreement between last year’s Senate and the Monogram Club. Because of this misunderstanding, the social commission had scheduled the annual dance without split of profit for the spring, while the club understood that the dance would be held in the fall. Chief opposition came from the refusal to allow any one club to receive benefits from the Victory Dances and the resulting deficit in the Senate budget.
Appointment of Bob Burns, from Clarksburg, W. Va., and A. Remy Fran-sen, English major from New Orleans, La., as associate justices completed the makeup of the Student Court.
HALLOWEEN PARTY
A “Barn Party” will be held next Thursday, Halloween night, from 8:30 to 11:30 p.m. in the Student Center. Any costume “in good taste” will be acceptable, and prizes will be awarded for the most original.
The student government sponsored “party” will feature Dick Miller's Sugarfoot Stampers, who will perform in the Rathskeller, and Bob Byrnes and his Combo who will perform in the Ball Room. Skits from St. Mary's and Notre Dame will highlight the intermission.
Decorations will follow the “Barn Party” motif. Buses will be provided and refreshments will be served. Tickets are $1 per couple.
Seniors Leave Friday For Trip to Baltimore
Thirty-five members of the Senior Class will leave next Friday afternoon on the annual Senior Trip to the Navy game at Baltimore.
The group will eat dinner in the Cafeteria at 4 p.m., after which they will board buses for La Faz, Ind. At La Paz they will catch a train, and arrive in Washington at 8:30 a.m. Saturday. After lunch, the seniors will leave by bus for Memorial Stadium in Baltimore for the game with the Middies. The seniors will wear the traditional green derbies.
After the game, they will return to Washington for dinner. Following dinner there will be a mixer at 7 p.m. with the students of Trinity College.
Saturday night and Sunday will be left open for the students to see Washington on their own. The return trip will begin at 5 p.m. Sunday from. Washington. The seniors will arrive at Notre Dame at 7 a.m. Monday morning.
“This will be the last time the seniors as a class will be able to show their support of the football team on the road,” said Mark Maley, trip chairman. “Being the first senior activity of the year of a major nature, we feel that the class will back this project sb that it will be one of the most successful Senior Trips ever made.”
Other members of the Senior Trip committee are: Joe Reich, business manager; Bob St. Clair, advei-tising; Tom Shehan, transpoi-tation. Through the work of these men, the cost of the annual trip was kept to a minimum in order to attract as many seniors as possible.
Also accompanying the seniors will be four Holy Cross priests from the University in addition to two of the varsity cheerleaders.
AB Ball Set for Nov. 16;
^Bid Sales Open Monday
Tickets for the 1956 AB Ball will go on sale this Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in the basement of the Student Center from 7:30 to 10:00 p.m.

Wallflowers ... Cigars
or Bird. Dogs Allowed
by TOM JUDGE
The words, “I’m sorry I can’t dance,” besides being a good brush off, have become almost extinct in our vocabulary. Young people as well as old have come to realize that dancing is a social must in our society.
Have you ever sat on the sidelines and actually watched the various antics that people perform while dancing? Well it’s not only disgusting, but ridiculously funny. Now I’m not advocating becoming a wallflower, but if some of you, and I should include myself, could actually see yourself on the floor, you would be very much surprised.
You will see everything from the painfully tense dancer, the poor fellow who stands stiff-kneed and counts 1-2-3-4, to the fearful doll who hangs heavily on her partner’s arm or neck and worries lest she crunch her partner’s foot.
One of these dance floor wonders is Cuddles Clyde. Now he’s in a world of his own, or a parked car, I don’t know which. What makes a good show is if Cuddles finds a girl who is similarly inclined.
Then there’s Casual Clem. This is the fellow with the “I don’t care” posture - and is jes’ shufflin’ along. Another popular male species is Muscles Milt. This red blooded lad takes a boaconstrictor grip and proceeds to wrestle her around the ring, I mean floor. This guy’s great in the Rock, but forgets to leave his strong arm tactics there when he leaves.
Oh, yes, and there’s old Sentimental Slim. This poor lad gets so carried
away with the music he begins to sing and to make things worse usually doesn’t know the words. This fellow is really good in the shower, but doesn’t compete too well with the orchestra.
Then there’s Show off Sidney. Sid is really smooth. Just ask him. Anyway his mother loves him. This type hold their elbows high, this shows arrogance and vanity, but watch out, he may knock your eye out.
So you girls think all this is pretty funny, well men what about Listless Liz, the type that dances like a lump of lead. She’s the kind that has to be held up for the evening. Next time bring your vitamins along, honey.
How about Lipstick Lil, who can
The Casual Type
always manage to get one of her three «. coats of lipstick on your lapel and your suit has a fragrant 'smell of “Corral at High Noon.” Then there’s Butterfly Betty, who goes to a dance and is continuously dragging her partner around to see iMabel and her date and waves yoo-hoo to every passing couple she might know.
The truth is anyone with two legs, real or wooden, can very easily learn to dance and dance well. The important J' thing to remember is to relax. Now that doesn’t mean sitting in a local cocktail lounge for two hours to get in the relaxed state.
The way to become a good dancer is by practice. Practice begins in your room alone. By practicing a step you will develop a surer sense of poise and balance than you would by having a partner draped on your arm. After you-jp have mastered a step alone then turn on the radio or record player and grab your nearest partner. Dance with your roommate, all West Point men learn to dance with each other.
If you have a yen to dance, you are responding to an urge as basic as sleeping, eating, or loving (not necessarily placed in order of importance). Your^ yen goes even beyond recorded history.^' The first jitterbug was probably danced around a tribal fire, or a celebration for slaying a saber toothed tiger and the drum beat probably resembled what we call progressive jazz today.
Modern dancing in our United States started with the birth of our country. The cultured folks daintily danced the®
14
The Scholastic
'^steps from France and England, the minuet, (which is derived from menusmall), the waltz, the polka, mazurka and shottische. The frontiersmen bounced their boots to the Virginia reel and the square dance.
Of today’s popular dances the waltz has the longest history. It was the first European dance in which members of Athe opposite sex danced with each othei’ wand together. This caused a furor. The Strausses made Vienna the waltz capitol of the world. It was a fast, whirling dance, not slowly executed as it is wrongly done today and it even showed the ladies’ ankles. In the seventeenth century nice ladies did not waltz. In the eighteenth century England gradually succumbed to the waltz, but _not before a tremendous protect over ©the stocking ankle display.
Actually the basic waltz step can be found in the dance of almost every nation, the Irish jig, the Scottish fling, the Spanish dance and many others. It is now the basis for all of our modern i dances and by changing the rhythm can be done to any music.
The true waltz is a swirling fast and constant flow of gliding steps and is not conversational dance. The rhythm is slow, quick, quick.
With the gay nineties America continued to waltz. She waltzed to, The Band Played On, Waltz Me Around Again Willie and Yip i Addy i ay, while favorites like the old Blue Danube Waltz and the newer Merry Widow Waltz, con-< tinued to top the sheet music sales.
With the twentieth century, people began desiring new dances to fit new music. A new music called ragtime brought a fad for dances that were less restrained. There came the heel and toe polka, the one step, the two step, the Flora Dora, cancan and Cakewalk.
Vernon and Irene Castle did much for ballroom dancing. They invented the Castle Walk, the Turkey Trot, Fox Trot and the Hesitation Waltz. They published a book, Modem Dancing in 1914, in which they aimed to bring respectability to the dance, showing that it was not immodest.
Rudolph Valentino, America’s first “swoon idol,” brought the tango and it became a rage.
The roaring twenties started with
Gilda Gray’s “shimmy.” She shimmied on San Francisco’s Barbary Coast and made a three million dollar- fortune until the police closed the hall. People began to sing, I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate.
Along with the twenties came Paul Whiteman, who became the “Jazz King,” the “It Girl,” F. Scott Fitzgerald, marathon dance contests and the Charleston, which became a national rage.
'Then came the dance band craze with such greats as Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Glenn Miller, Harry James, Eddie Duchin, Wayne King and with these swing bands developed our swing dance, first known as the Lindy Hop and then Jitterbug.
The Jitterbug is still with us. How-
ever, now, the jumping jive, over the shoulder type of swing dancing is passe, that is for most parts of the country. The latest steps change with the day, but mostly with the region.
In the last 10 years the Latin American dances that have gained enormously in popularity are the Rumba, Samba, Tango and Mambo.
The Rumba, which originated in Cuba is a smoothie. There is no movement above the waist and the hips move slightly and rhythmically by stepping with bent knees. The rhythm as in the waltz is a slow, quick, quick, done to the tempo of the music.
From Brazil comes the Samba. It is a fast, gay and light hearted dance. It has many steps and has become the most popular Latin American dance. The pendelum step is the basic one and has a swinging forward and swinging backward motion. The rhythm is one, two, one, two. The music is a catchy rhythm that makes everyone want to dance to it.
Let us not forget the Tango, which is one of the smoothest and prettiest dances but has somehow faded away. Perhaps, because it needs more practice to do the timing and turns gracefully. Professionals also make it appear difficult and therefore people have been reluctant to try it.
The Mambo is now the current rage and was introduced by Perez Prado. It caught on- with the hep set and is now being adopted by the more conservative. It is really a variation of the Rumba;
15
The Cuddly Couple
in fact it is jitterbugging the Rumba.
Two other Latin American dances that are gaining popularity with young crowds are the Cha Cha Cha and Merengue.
The Cha Cha Cha is a 1-2—1-2-3 movement, or a 1-2-3—1-2. You can march, hop, skip, jump, or run. to the 1-2—1-2-3 rhythm and you are sure doing the Cha Cha Cha. It is also a Rumba, rhythm, unless you can find a real Cha Cha Cha recording.
The Merengue (not pie) pronounced (Mer-ring-gay) is from Haiti. The choreography is always the same two steps to the left and two steps to the right, despite many variations. It is the newest on the dance scene. A top recording is Dance the Merengue with Killer Joe.
A new type of music brought two new dances to the younger set. These are the Rock and Roll and Bop. Rock and Roll, which is being done in every part of the country, is done as the name indicates, rock on your feet or roll over on your feet. Bound to develop a new crop of round shouldered natives, who look at their feet. Bop is a jived up Charleston or rather a Rock- and Roll Charleston.
So men if you don’t know how to dance, learn now. It will instill selfconfidence and teach common manners and courtesies, besides being relaxing and lots of fun.
And men here are some things to
16
remember next time you take that cute girl onto the floor. The man always leads and with the right hand, the woman follows, but to lead you must know where you are going. Reserve your muscles for your roommate, believe it or not the little woman doesn’t have to be pushed, pulled or hauled to make her go your way.
Sometimes when dancing with a brand new partner, who can follow, but is not yet familiar with your style of dancing you may have to do a bit of guiding. This is done with your right hand and arm. Always hold your right hand firmly just above your partner’s waist, and you will find that she will respond easily to a light pressure.
Most good dancers lead the same step at least twice in succession, it makes their dancing more flowing and it gives them time to plan a graceful sequence to their pattern of steps. It is far better to do the same step several times than rush into quick jerky changes.
Start out with simple uninvolved steps that are easy to lead and follow. They will give you and your partner ease and confidence in each other. There is plenty of time ahead for your more advanced intricate steps. The most important thing about leading is to know what you’re doing. If you know the steps and do them well, hold your partner firmly, especially with the right hand and arm, then your partner, if she
knows anything about dancing, 'will be^ I able to follow easily.	I
Another thing put some variety in your dancing. Don’t walk forward all of the time. Your girl friend will get mighty tired of backing up all evening. Try strolling backward for five minutes straight and you’ll get the idea.
Don’t be a floor hugger. Lift your feet off the floor and move through thej air. Air offers no resistance—therefore you can step lightly and effortlessly. A -flat-footed firm stance belongs to the ' golf course not on the dance floor. Keep your weight over the soles of youi’ feet, it will make you feel quicker and lighter as a partner.
There is such a thing as courtesy on the dance floor, which is very important. Holding a girl’s arm to and from the^ dance floor went out with the twenties. If you knock somebody down be sure and apologize, but don’t be continuously j. apologizing to youi- partner all night.
An acceptable custom at almost all dances is bird dogging. I mean cutting . in. Now this should be done tactfully. Wait till the girl of your choice is near the edge of the floor then use the words,	_
“IMay I?” To refuse to break is con-	,
sidered childish by all except the dancer.,j Never cut back in on the person who cut in on you; look for some other charming lass. Also avoid disturbing t mannerisms like chewing tobacco, or ’ smoking a cigar while dancing. Now Dance, Man, Dance!	!

1* STUDENT SENATE MATURITY
•	by PAT LOGAN
This year it is hoped that Student Government will reach maturity by shouldering increased responsibility in various areas of student life, and by representing and serving the students more A effectively. The present administration took office this past May, and following are some of the accomplishments since that time:
1.	Equitable Tax Collection. A new tax policy was initiated whereby the Student Activities Fee would be collected only once a year instead of twice. Out of the money collected, $300 goes to each class fund as before, and now the four colleges receive 12%% of the money collected, and the Hall Fund gets 10% The student body expressed a vote of confidence in Student Government when 99.3% of the students paid the Student Activities Fee. It is our firm desire to fulfill this confidence by doing an effective job in Student Government this year.
2.	Improved Summer Storage. The Summer Storage Service was completely _ reorganized, and the service rendered • was vastly improved.
HIGHER BAND BUDGETS
3.	Better Bands. The Dance Constitution was revised to raise the maximum price for the band at a College Ball from $850 to $1250.
4.	Office Efficiency. The Student Government office has been reorganized with the hiring of an Executive Secretary and a Senate Bookkeeper. They will provide continuity in the filing and accounting system, and more efficient office procedure. The Student Government officers are keeping regular office hours so that students may consult with them at any time.
5.	More Loans. The Student Loan Fund Policy was arranged so that deserving students may borrow up to $50 interest-free for a month. The Senate has been entrusted with the administration of the $25,000 John A. Morrissey Memorial Fund.
6.	What About NS A and NFCCS? At the summer congresses of NS A and NFCCS student leaders represented Notre Dame very effectively. Three Notre Dame students were elected to
Regional Offices of the Ohio-Indiana Region of NSA, with Bob Kiley being elected as Regional Chairman and a member of the National Executive Committee.
7.	Antiquated Constitution Modernized. The Student Government Constitution has been revised into a more workable, up to date version. Some of the major changes were: a. The student body can now vote on Constitutional Amendments, b. Student Organizations will have a non-voting Senator to represent all campus clubs, c. The Student
PAT LOGAN
Director of Maturity
Court is an independent organization, with definite areas- of jurisdiction and authority.
8.	About That $2 Fee. The budget for the first semester was planned and approved. This will provide for more careful, balanced expenditures of funds.
Plans are in full progress for the remainder of the school year. Some of the more important items on the Student Government agenda for the year are:
1.	Develop Leadership. A Leadership Training Program is being planned to help underclassmen understand and develop qualities necessary for a • leader.
The program will consist of talks by prominent leaders, and workshop type discussions by the students attending.
2.	An Honor System. The possibility of initiating an Academic Honor System at Notre Dame will be investigated and discussed. A joint panel with St. Mary’s College, having the theme “An Honoi- System ... To Be Or Not To Be,” is being arranged by the NSA Representatives of the two campuses.
3.	What’s Going On? The Public Relations aspect of Student Government is being strengthened. More effective publicity for student activities is planned through the medium of the Scholastic, WSND, and the bulletin boards. Use of bulletin boards will be systenifzed in an effort to keep the student body well informed.
4.	Chow With Chopin. Music in the Dining Hall may be a reality before Christmas. With the technical advice of Mr. Warren of the Audio-Visual Department, a turntable will be installed to provide relaxing music during the hectic dinner hour. Efforts are also being made to improve the P.A. system.
5.	Religion Not Neglected. The Spiritual Commission is going to coordinate closed student retreats, possibly using the new campus retreat' house and traveling to the Trappist Monastery at Gethsemane, Ky. Besides spiritual bouquets throughout the year, plans are underway for a Catholic magazine subscription drive, especially for graduat-. ing Seniors.
MORE INFORMAL PARTIES
6.	Girls, etc. In social events, the “New Look” at Victory Dances is a welcome change. Innovations such as decorations and pre-sale of tickets have improved the dances. All of the away games of the “Fighting Irish,” with the exception of Southern California, are being brought to the students on large screen TV. More informal parties are being planned this year, such as the “Gay Twenties Party” and the coming “Halloween Costume Ball.”
7.	Big name entertainment is being planned for the campus. Also a Senate movie series will be initiated to provide free comedy movies on Sunday after-, noons, and classics during the week are’ 25jf.	-
8.	Independence and Further Jurisdiction. The Student Court should develop into a strong branch of government this year. It is now set up as an independent organization, with its powers and authority clearly defined. The aim for the Court in coming years is to be able to handle minor disciplinary cases, once the. Court has been established and gained-the confidence of the students and the University.

The Case Against
Conformity
O N Friday I picked up the Scholastic and wandered aimlessly 4 through its variety until I reined up at J the picture of a rain-coated character < studying in front of that paragon of . styling: Gilbert's on the Campus Shoppe for Distinguished Men. Over his head was the title of the article: “The Ivy Look For This Fall” which was written
‘ ^.vith the help of “Esquire” Magazine • -	and Gilbert’s without whose help the
article would not have been possible, I £ was told. I mentally thanked the two ■contributors and went on.
• On the next page two others were j	frolicking in the leaves in the back of
:	Gilbert’s On the Campus Shoppe for Dis-
f tinguished Men. Now even the well-f.; rounded cop with the clock, a real Magoo ^of a man, could not have suspected those ■ *wo of playing football, particularly in velveteen loafers, button-down angola f tennis shoes and tear-away sweat socks. ' Meanwhile another fellow was looking classic while smoking a pipe full of ivy. I believe he had a patch over his right i eye, but I couldn’t see for sure. Another I boy, who was going upstairs, looked like ■ he was going to a Schmimoff ad.
, This may sound like I disapprove of f Whese Sorin subterraneans, but please I believe that I have a purpose. I feel that it is my duty as a devoted reader of Christian Virtues to enlighten these men with a little grandfatherly advice.
Men, look around you. Try to pick out the symbol of your age, a universal subject of admiration, the citadel of Americanism. Of course its none other ^than Elvis Presley, idol of hound dogs.
। Now I ask you, can you see the Pres’ ley knees palpitating through neutral, pleatless, whipcord, “Natural look” touch-of-leather trousers? Or the Elvis pelvis rotating around an expandable repp belt and back-of-the-pants strap? Or those Hornung shoulders being .^hrown around inside a reefer* neck sweater, soft shetland tweed sport coat
by JERRY BRADY
and Chesterfield topcoat with velvet collar? Gentlemen, in all seriousness, you must admit that you cannot.
Or can you picture Gene Vincent bebopping with LuLu while dressed in glen plaid cheviots, a challis tie and a poplin all weather trench coat with stripped
The Natural Look
lining? Such things would only get in the way of one’s guitar.
Upon closer examination you will see these, our leading citizens, are dressed in pegged pants, Italian shirts and motorcycle jackets. What about you?
And another thing, have you looked at your hair lately, J. Paul Sheedy? You might notice that these men have long, swept-back manes which glisten in the television spotlight. Does yours? Most assuredly not.
I am not imposing a new standard upon you, far from it. If you want something more functional, a switch to paratrooper style, somethings called the playboy attire, is in order as an alternative.
This style offers two-tone field boots, khaki combat pants and not much else; all very functional. Can you Ivy Leaguer’s hook a slide rule on the strap in the back of pleatless pants? Sheer nonsense, since youi* straps are as functional as an appendix. But the plowboy is sure to have a genuine slide rule strap as well as a pocket for hammers, collapsible measuring stick and nails. Look this man over closely next time he’s seen heading for the John F. Cushing building and try to adapt to his style. Trench coats may come and go, but corduroy and blue suede overalls are always in style.
Whichever style you choose be sure to add another touch that shows you’re modern: don’t act chipper and don’t dress meticulously. You will create a much better impression if you stammer a little, throw your head back and say; “Ah, I don’t know” real moody like. Keep your eyes cast down and only come to life when someone mentions sports cars because this is being Jimmy Deanish.
Hand in hand with your new dress, you must ungroom your speech. I’m not going to redefine such words as “cool” or a “square with ruffles” since this is old stuff in your dictionary by this time. However next time you’re standing around the coke machine you might practice a routine like this.
First voice: “Hey, let’s darink to ha fool, ‘cause ahm that fool thuhat tole mah baybuh goodby.”
Second voice: “Yewhew mean yewhew babyuh dungone an lef yewhew?”
First voice: “Yes. thuh wuhun that Ihe luhuhuhu huuv soho.”
Second voice: “I ihit yewhur prayah that thehe ahhansir she gives ahat thehe end of the day may stihil be thuh say-hame for as lunhong as yewhew lihiv?”
Third voice: “And haahuv yewhew ahulmost lahohst yewhur mind?”
Fourth voice: “And was she yewhur baybuh yeehew don’t mean maybe?”
First voice: “Yup.”
The trick of this technique is, as you can see, to hitch up a little right in the middle of a word. You might also try a few tremors and a fit or two since word reaches here that they’ve gone over big on the cahhohst, I mean coast.
Have you got everything straight now? Remember, no more Adlai Stevenson-Princeton talk because your dungaree doll is sure to disapprove as will all her rubber-soled friends at the sweet shop on Lonley Street. While you’re down there impress her by ordering a tutti-fruit-au-rooti (which is French for “at the rally.”)
Do you want to be stereotyped? No? Then join in the style revolution that is upon us! Students of the world unite! Yewhew have nothing to lose but your toggle toppers and pork pie hats!

Developing Administrators
by TERRY PLUNKETT
Change is inevitable. In every field or profession, standards, methods, and values are constantly changing. The College of Commerce, realizing this, has adopted a new educational program to meet and fill the gaps in the business world created by these changes. These needs have been interpreted in terms of a draught of competent administrators, and the College of Commerce has geared its new program to fill these basic needs by focusing attention directly on the skills and knowledge required by the administrator.
The program became effective with this year’s freshman class, however students who have completed one or more years in the Commerce school will continue with the former program.
THIRD MAJOR CHANGE
This marks the third major change in the schools and colleges of Notre Dame since 1953. Previously the Notre Dame Law School and the College of Arts and Letters were radically changed by the adoption of a new program.
Mr. Thomas T. Murphy will direct the unique Program for Administrators. A much smaller program, known by the same name, was initiated in January 1952. Its basic plan was similar to the new one. This old program was a separate unit inside the Commerce School, and thus far has graduated two classes. It is much too early to judge the success of these graduates. It would be wrong to assume that the success of this previous program, which was dropped for freshmen in view of the new program, motivated the complete changeover.
Increasing liberalism has been recently marked in all the colleges of the university, and although the Commerce School has long required many courses found in the liberal arts area, the new program tends to lump these courses in a solid block during the first two years. Two-thirds of all freshman and sophomore curricula will include studies of liberal arts courses. Approximately one-half of the new four-year program consists of liberal arts courses. One of the keystones of the program is to make full use of the revised Liberal Arts
24
program. This is one of the reasons the concentration of liberal courses is found in the first two years.
The business foundation, however, will not be neglected by the underclassmen. They must take courses in marketing, production, finance, and accounting.
Major subjects, in the sense of the word, will not be the same. Students will achieve a “depth of penetration” in some area. Based on the assumption that all general knowledge may produce superficiality, each student will pursue one field more consistently than others.
The so-called “50-50 split” between liberal and professional studies is advantageous. Dean James W. Culliton of the Commerce School prefers to think of the program, rather, as a “50-50 merger,” leading to an education with a sense of oneness in which a free flow of material, methods, objectives, and student interest moves between and unites them.
INCREASED SPECIALIZATION
Increasing specialization of jobs tends to deprive the worker of purpose, satisfaction, and responsibility. More and more people are working for larger and larger business units. Small businesses have definitely been on the decline. This has resulted in a loss of job satisfaction as many workers see and work on only a small part of the later-integrated whole.
The impact of these factors has created a growing gap in business which may only be spanned by the administrator. With such large organizations successfully functioning, men are needed to coordinate the work of others. Yet, not any man can be cast in this role and render a sound performance. Experience is needed, as well as a constantly changing body of scientific knowledge. The man must be able to manipulate people as well as possess a sound business background. This is where the Program for Administrators comes into the picture.
The College of Commerce, in adopting this new program, has certain objectives which guide their every move. Primary among these is to give the student as-
DEAN JAMES CULLITON	?
‘■I
sistance in gaining an appreciation of f the businessman in our' society, the in- ’
spiration to be that kind of man, the necessary knowledge, the skill needed to apply that knowledge, and the competence to get such a program of action?.' into effect.
The means presented to achieve these objectives are four. First, the new program is designed specifically to make full use of the revised Liberal Arts program. Secondly, implementation by the faculty and continued objective reviewing of the program itself is necessary. Use of the physical facilities and student manipulation complete the means. *
From all of this a definite philosophy ' of business has been formed. The indi
vidual enterprise is recognized as the unit of economic society, and also as a social organism, since it deals with people. The test of an enterprise’s right to survive is sales. Without sales, the business is useless. The reward, or profit, then is a barometer to indicate whether the free consumer is being vvell-^ served and also a check on the management of internal affairs.
PROFESSIONAL—LIBERAL PROGRAM
It is evident then that Notre Dame, ■ in attempting to meet the changes oc- , curring in the world, has adopted a 1 professional-liberal program in t he \ Commerce School, designed expressly to [ mold administrators to fill the growing^ 1 need. Administration is not a “do it , yourself” project, but the science of ' manipulation and coordination of people toward a certain end. Through a reexamination of all the educational facili- । ties, through experience, and through	}
experimentation the Commerce 'School	i
and Notre Dame will continue to keep* in step with the changing world.

The Opposite Sex. (B) June Allyson, Joan Collins, Dolores Grey, Ann Sheridan, Ann Miller, and others of the opposite sex. Clare Booth’s famous play about life among “The Women” was first made into a film in 1939. It was such a big hit on the late, late, late show that MGM remade it adding color, songs, dances, and men. The plot, such as it is, is composed of divorce and husband stealing, which explains why it is a B picture. However nobody will worry about the plot with, all those girls running across the screen.

CHARLES I. SMITH, JR., received his B.S. Ch.E. from V.P.I. in 1943, served in the Navy as an engineer officer, and joined Du Pont’s Engineering Department in 1946. Since then, he has advanced steadily through a number of interesting assignments at various Du Pont plants. He was recently promoted to manager of the Technical Section of Du Pont’s Pigments Department.

GEORGE M. LINCOLN, JR., expects to receive his B.S. in metallurgical engineering from Lehigh University in 1957. George was vice president of his junior class, is active in sports, and a participant in many other campus activities. He’s starting his employment investigations early, for he feels that the selection of an employer is one of the most important decisions in a man’s career.
Charlie Smith answers:
They have an almost endless variety of interesting problems to face, George. As a student of metallurgy, you know that about two-thirds of all known chemical elements are metals. Many of them are revealing valuable new applications, when highly purified on a commercial scale. Du Pont is greatly interested in several metallic and semi-metallic elements.
My own experience at Du Pont ranges from work on titanium pigments, to metallic titanium production, and to the ultra-pure silicon used in transistors. You can appreciate some of our metallurgical problems when I point out that impurities in transistor silicon have to be below one part in 100 million. That’s equivalent to one pound of impurities distributed through a train of ore cars twenty miles long!
Some of our metallurgists carry out fundamental research on new metals, and, in the development stage, they frequently operate pilot plants for producing them. Other metallurgists study problems relating to engineering materials used in construction, carry out research on intergranular corrosion, or investigate fatigue relationships encountered in dynamic, high-pressure operations.
You’ll find many challenging opportunities in every phase of metallurgy at Du Pont, George.

Witucki Reports on the Sooners
Notre Dame’s backfield coach indicates the power and speed of mighty Oklahoma
by COACH BERNIE WITUCKI as told to Bob McMahon
F I
Tomorrow we will see one of the most exciting teams ever to play in our stadium. Oklahoma is exciting because of its speed, daring, and reaction. If they beat us they "will hold the longest winning streak in modern times. That’s what they want and we are the only ones to stop them.
The speed of the Sooners, I sincerely believe, is much greater than that of Michigan State. Their line is big, and with their speed and reaction, they -will be difficult to cope with offensively as well as defensively.
No position is weak in the line. Probably their strongest man is Jerry Tubbs. He is truly a great center and
HARRIS (No. 15) pitches out to McDONALD (No. 25) breaking wide to either side. THOMAS (No. 35) and BELL (No. 83) shoot into the deep flat of the secondary. STILLER (No. 89) goes long on the other side. McDonald can throw to his first choice, Thomas, second choice, Bell, or his third choice, Stiller, across the field. The play works to either side.
works effectively on both offense and defense.
Their offensive attack is well balanced. They hit 'with equal ability anywhere in the line and to the outside.
The Sooner deception and trickery combine with daring to make them a constant threat. They have used the lateral in situations where a normal team would quickly shy away, and this has proved to be a successful weapon for them.
There is no doubt that they have two of the finest all-round backs in the country today in Tommy McDonald and Clen-don Thomas. Both are fast and shifty and both are excellent passers. Last
THE AUTHOR
week against Kansas State, McDonald threw a running pass (the same play as diagrammed) that traveled at least 50 yards in the air.
Their quarterbacks, Jim Harris and Jay O’Neal are also deadly with the forward pass. If the defense comes up to stop the running plays, they’ll throw,’ and if the defense lays back for the pass, they’ll run.
The Sooner quarterbacks like to hit the halfbacks on the passing, but they aren’t afraid to toss to the ends.
RUN FROM UNBALANCED LINE
Oklahoma is primarily a split-T team with the unbalanced line, but while watching them this season, they have used the single wing with the backs running to both the weak and strong sides of the line.
Coach Wilkinson has also been using some other formations. One in which the center, guard, end, quarterback and two backs line up in one spot and spread out about 15 yards fuither, are the remaining four linemen and the other back. They also use the occasional flanker like ourselves.
Their defense is exceptionally strong, again due to the speed. They do make mistakes, but with that speed and quick reaction, they cover up quickly. Kansas State scored on them twice last week, which, I think, shows they were looking past them and pointing for us, and not a sign of weakness.
The depth of the Sooners is exceptional. There is no difference between their first and second teams. With the exceptions of McDonald and Thomas, (Continued on page 30)

Oklahoma Brings 34-Game Streak to Stadium 1 In Tomorrow's Nationally Televised Contest
The University of Oklahoma sends their football team, ranked number two in the country, on its first invasion of the Midwest this season as they meet the Irish in the Stadium Saturday. The game, a sellout since early last summer is the NBC game of the day being televised on a nationwide hook-up.
The Sooners, undefeated and untied in their last 34 contests, have played the Irish twice before, losing in 1952 and again in 1953.
Oklahoma employs the split-T formation although coach Bud Wilkinson has added some single wing and spread formations in an attempt to give the Sooners a more explosive and wide open attack. This hardly seems necessary, however, for with the split-T, Oklahoma has consistently been among the countries offensive leaders. Not since 1946 has an opponent been able to hold the Sooner attack scoreless, this a national record. The last time the Sooners lost was the 1953 Notre Dame game.
Leading the Oklahoma fast break will be left half back Tommy McDonald, who has run the 100-yd dash in 9.7, with the ability to go the distance oh every play. McDonald is also the club’s top passer, completing 17 for 24 last year, which was the nation’s best percentage. He blends this passing and running ability into the Wilkinson attack chiefly through the pitch-out option play, in which he can either pass to his end up field or keep it himself. McDonald scored at least one TD in every game last year and has been held scoreless only once this season.

back is Clendon Thomas, a piledriving type runner who, although he played on O.U.’s “alternate eleven” last year, scored nine touchdowns and amassed 487 yards for a 6.9 yards per carry average. Thomas, is also a fair passer and a fine punter.
Jimmy Harris directs the Sooner attack from his quarterback slot. Harris is a fine runner and moves "well on the option, the bread and butter play of the split-T. Jay O’Neal, alternate team quarterback from last year should see

lots of action. O’Neal, an excellent defensive back, is also an adept signal caller and adequate passer.
Two year letterman, Billy Pricer, rounds out the O.U. backfield. Pricer is a tremendous blocker and a vicious linebacker in addition to being a fine ball carrier. He averaged 6.4 yards per carry last season. Pricer also kicks extra points for the Sooners.
Co-captain of the Sooners and a strong contender for All-American honors is rangy center, Jerry Tubbs. A crushing blocker and superb linebacker, Tubbs teams with Billy Pricer to give the Sooners the best linebacking combination in the country. An example of his fine defense was the Texas game last year, in which he intercepted three Longhorn passes, leading O.U. to a 20-0 victory.
Ed Gray is the other co-captain and has started every Oklahoma game since 1954. His uncanny ability to get the jump on opposing linemen, gives Gray an excellent chance of earning All-Amer-

Two-year letterman John Bell will open the game at right end for the Soon-era. In addition to catching seven passes for 109 yards last year, Bell proved himself to be the best downfield blocker on the unbeaten Sooner team.
Don Stiller, a junior, ■will start at left end for the Sooners. Stiller staited several games for O.U. last year and w proved himself a very capable performer?
Up from the alternate squad, Ken Northcut earned himself a starting berth at left guard as a result of his tremendous play during spring practice.
Right guard Bill Krisher is another man up from last year’s alternate eleven. A 210-ponud junior, Krisher showed excellent speed and aggressiveness in the first three games this season.
Two-year letterman Tom Emerson null •' start at right tackle for the Sooners. Emerson is extremely agile for a big man and is a very good downfield blocker and tackler.

END OF SOONER DRIVE
Lattner upends Leake in '52 classic
Notre Dame’s Fighting Irish were victorious in their two previous football encounters with Oklahoma, winning out four touchdowns to three in tense and ^superlatively played contests.
“ At Notre Dame, midway in the 1952 season, the Irish, although 14-point underdogs, ground out a 27-21 victory. The following year, in the season opener at Norman, Okla., the Irish subdued O.U., 28-21. In both contests, second half Notre Dame spurts overcame early Oklahoma leads for the final margin.
In 1952 the Sooners led, 7-0, 14-7, and 21-14, but a thirteen point Notre Dame ^■.effort in the final period iced the win.
The 1953 tilt saw the Sooners hold leads of 7-0 and 14-7 previous to a fourteen point outburst by Notre Dame in the third period.
LATTNER, WORDEN SPARK OFFENSE
Johnny Lattner and Neil Worden sparked the Irish offense in both games with Worden and Joe Heap the top ^point-getters, scoring three times in the two games. Lattner and Dan Shannon were the defensive heroes for their particular heroics on two different occasions.
It was Shannon, on the kickoff after the Irish had tied the score 21-21 in 1952, who smashed into Larry Grigg, causing him to fumble and setting up the ^final Notre Dame tally.
Lattner, late in the final quarter of the 1953 game with ND leading 28-21, made one of the finest defensive maneuvers in Irish history.
Sooner quarterback Buddy Leake threw a screen pass to end Carl Allison and a perfect cordon of blockers A formed. Lattner was the only man be-“ tween three O.U. blockers, Allison, and

the goal line. He fought off all three and made the tackle on the ND 43. Two plays later, he intercepted a Leake pass to kill the final Sooner effort.
In the 1952 game, the strong Notre Dame defense had to contain the Oklahoma “foui- finessers” backfield of Eddie Crowder, Billy Vessels, Buddy Leake and Buck McPhail for any chance of victory. They ran up the .amazing total of 313 yards on the ground with Vessels contributing 195 on 17 carries for an 11.4 average.
Vessels was the lone Sooner TD representative, scoring each of the three touchdowns.
In the first period, he took a 17-yard pass from Crowder and dashed 10 more for the score. In the second period, he broke over his own right tackle on a quick opener, cut back to the left and went 62 yards for the tally.
In the third period, on almost the same identical play as his second scoring run, Vessels scampered 44 yards for his third score of the day.
CAREY SCORES FOR ND
The Irish were never in the lead until Tom Carey carried over for the touchdown following Shannon’s tackle of Grigg.
Heap scored following a Ralph Gugli-elmi pass to tie the score 7-7 in the second quarter.
Midway in the third period following a Lattner pass interception, Worden plunged over to tie the score at 14-14.
Another Worden touchdown, on a three yard plunge, tied the score for the final time, 21-21, early in the fourth quarter.
It was a story of Irish power and alertness blotting out the great effort by Vessels.
The following year, a poised Ralph Guglielmi tossed two touchdown passes to Joe Heap and directed the Irish flawlessly, while an alert ND line, led by Capt. Don Penza turned four Sooner mistakes into Irish scores.
The game was the first one for both clubs under the limited substitution rule and was played in 94° weather at Norman, Okla.
The first Sooner error came midway in the first period when Max Boydston
fumbled and Jim Schrader recovered on the O.U. 42. Four plays later Guglielmi passed to Heap and the score was tied, 7-7.
Late in the second period, Boydston attempted a quick kick, but Penza blocked it and recovered the ball on the O.U. nine. Guglielmi carried over from the two and Mavraides converted for the second time.
The Irish went ahead for the fii-st time in the third quarter. Guglielmi intercepted a Leake pass and returned to the Sooner 36.
On the first play from scrimmage he passed to Heap for the TD. Mavraides’ conversion was again good.
IRISH CLINCH GAME
The final Irish score of the game came with 3:31 left in the third quarter after Penza recovered a fumble on the Sooner 38.
Heap, Lattner, Guglielmi, and Worden earned to the nine, and Worden carried over for the score.
The Sooners scored in the final period, and the issue was not settled until Lattner intercepted a Sooner pass with less than two minutes remaining in the game.

TIME OUT
Many years ago when I was first becoming indoctrinated in what Notre Dame was really like, I happened to pick up Francis Wallace’s THE NOTRE DAME STORY. I was just a freshman in high school but the story about Rockne, Gipp and, as Wallace put it, “the rest of Our Lady’s Tough Guys,” has been one that has stood out in my mind ever since.
Last Friday night, another aspect of “Our Lady’s Tough Guys” came to the front, an aspect which may have been present in Rockne’s time but was one that I hadn’t seen around here in three years.

16 Right; 4 Wrong.
SEASON:
61 Right; 18 Wrong; 1 Tie. Pct. .772.

The student body turned out as a student body and not as a group of individual halls as had been the case in previous weeks. The program prepared by the Blue Circle’s Jack Doyle and Paul Underkofler was to be superb. People who couldn’t get in the jammed Fieldhouse stood outside to listen. The roar from the students as the team appeared was deafening and you could tell by the expressions on the players faces, that this was something that they were totally unprepared for. They knew now that their effort against State would have to be superhuman. As they listened to Don Miller’s stirring speech, there were tears in some of their eyes. You knew right then and there that whatever they did the next day would be something that everyone would be proud of, win, lose or draw.
For the first half, our Irish played like the number one team in the country but in the second half, they were just outmanned by the best in the nation. The Spartans weren’t as superior as the score might indicate. In fact, the locals were still in the ball game in the fourth quarter. A few desperation plays backfired and that was the story. Our Lady’s Tough Guys played valiantly, more than even the most loyal Irish rooters expected. They gave it all they had and the students stayed right with them to the end. You couldn’t ask for much more.
When I left the Stadium, the stands were empty. I walked by the dressing room and a large portion of the students were waiting there, cheering each player as he left. In between times, they would give out with a “Go Irish, Beat Sooners.” Last Saturday, there were many joyous Spartan rooters but I was proud to be a Notre Dame man.
Tonight, it starts all over again. I think that every one of us can make it even better than last week. We don’t do things around here any other way.
Tomorrow, the nation’s TV eyes will be focused on the band of green-shirted Irish. This is the one to win for the subway alumni and all those little old ladies who bum the candles every Saturday afternoon. The situation is ripe for an upset and there are millions pulling for our kids, hoping they’ll do it. Veterans like Hornung and Morse right down to the sophomores, who only four games ago were playing in front of only five or six thousand, . will have to play the game of their lives. It can be done and I think they are going to do it. If ever there was a time for Our Lady’s Tough Guys to come through, this is it.
Witucki Reports	:
(Continued from page 27)	।
the second unit is every bit as good as the first. In the movies, their third team looked to be not much short of the starting team.
The reason for the depth is the number of freshman scholarships they get each year. Figuring on about one-third of their boys developing, they average-^ about 30 top-notch players per season.
From the report here it seems as though they will be very tough. But we stand an excellent chance of knocking them off. Our boys, I think, gained real confidence from the way they handled Michigan State in the first half last week. I only hope that their confidence was not shattered in the second half.
Although I was not here for the game, I know what the student spirit was. I A thought that their cheering outside the dressing room was a tremendous tribute to the way the boys played. I’m sure we have the material and ability to pre- I vent Oklahoma from securing the new i record tomorrow.	J

Wiornung Leads Irish Four-Game Statistics In Rushing, Passing, Punting, Kickoffs, Scoring
Harriers Home Today After Indiana Defeat
Paul Hornung, Notre Dame’s stellar quarterback, still holds a monopoly on the statistics for the first four games. Hornung tops the Irish in five departments, and has compiled a total offense ^nark of 807 yards, gained mostly by passing.
Hornung tops the Irish in rushing, passing, kickoffs returned, punting, and scoring.
Hornung has amassed a total of 219 yards rushing in 34 tries for an average of 6.4 yards per carry. He has attempted 62 passes and completed 33 for •588 yards and three touchdowns for a ^percentage of .532.
LEADS SCORING
In the scoring department he has scored two touchdowns and kicked seven extra points for a total of 19 points to lead the team. He has punted eight times for 329 yards and an average of 41 yards.
Captain Jim Morse is the leading pass ^catcher, snaring nine passes for 230 ~ yards and one touchdown. He is third in rushing with 97 yards in 35 carries and second in passing by completing three passes in three attempts for 54 yards.
Aubrey Lewis, speedy left halfback, is second in rushing although he didn’t appear in the Michigan State game. He
has totaled 147 yards in 19 carries for an average of 7.7 yards per carry, which is the highest on the team, and scored one touchdown. He also caught four passes for 33 yards, one for a touchdown.
The Irish as a team have amassed a total offense of 1381 yards to their opponents’ 1559 yards. Notre Dame has gained 779 yards by rushing to their opponents’ 1171. By passing the Irish have gained 602 yards to their opponents’ 388 yards.
President's Cup Trophy To Be Presented Saturday
New tradition will be made Saturday immediately after the Oklahoma game. The President’s Cup trophy, a gift of Mr. and Mrs. Leo Linbeck of Houston, Texas, and symbolic of Inter-Hall athletic supremacy, will be presented to Badin Hall.
The two foot high, gold trophy, will be presented by Father James Norton, C.S.C., to Gerald Weldon Hayes, last year’s Badin Hall president.
The presentation will be made in the LaFortune Student Center, and will be short and informal. The public is invited.
This afternoon, at 4 p.m., the Notre Dame cross country team will host Loyola, Central Michigan, and Bowling Green on the Burke Course, in the first quadrangular meet of the season. Although it will be the first time the Irish have faced these teams, their records to date have been good and Coach Wilson feels that they will provide his harriers with stiff competition in their effort to resume vanning ways.
Last Friday afternoon, across the Cascade Golf Course at Bloomington, the Notre Dame cross-country squad had theii- string of eight consecutive victories snapped by a highly-rated, sophomore studded Indiana team, 23-32. Besides running into such a potent squad, the Wilsonmen were at a decided disadvantage running on a relatively hilly 3% mile course, being accustomed to the flat four mile layout of the Burke Course.
Captain John Michno of the Irish again led his teammates, taking third place behind Indiana’s Ron Long and Max Fiscus. Sophomore Mike Haverty continued to show winning form in placing fourth, two seconds behind Michno, and only 15 seconds behind Long, who ran the course in 18:10. Dale Vandenberg, John Burns, Ed Monnelly, Neil Wallace, and Stan Wegizymowicz placed sixth, ninth, tenth, twelfth, and seventeenth in that order.

Zahm Upsets Off-Campus; Dillon, Howard Win in West
Zahm paced the interhall football action last week by upsetting a highly regarded Off-Campus eleven 19-12. Tex Lostetter, the freshmen’s quarterback, threw two touchdown passes, one good for -50 yards to Jack Eatinger on the final play of the first half. Norbie Shew got Zahm’s first score in the second quarter running 80 yards from a statue of liberty play.
Other games in the East League were Cavanaugh over Breen Phillips 6-0 in a duel which saw Tom. Hirons flip an eight yard pass to Tony Shelloup for the first period score, and St. Ed’s over Farley by the same margin. St. Ed’s TD also came in the first quarter when a bad pass from center was recovered by the victors on Farley’s two yard line.
In the West League Frank Leahy passed Dillon to a 25-0 rout of Morrissey, and Howard rolled over Badin, 20-0. The’ Sorin-Lyons game was postponed.

Repercussion
(Continued from page 8)
Perhaps better student government at Notre Dame could be accomplished if the members were less impressed with their position and were more impressed with why they are in the Senate. Also, I may add, it is erroneous to say that a senator is the subject of “a vote of confidence” merely because he has been elected to the Senate. Unfortunately elections at Notre Dame are often decided as a choice between the better of two evils. This, though, is the fault of the students because if more of the many good potential student leaders would run for office student government would improve. There are many students who could make something out of student government who will not “get into campus politics.” Perhaps here is where the ultimate blame lies if our student government is deficient.
John Cusack Alumni Hall Senator
Editor:
My policy has always been to welcome criticism when it was well-meant and well-founded, but I must take exception to Mr. Thompson’s editorial in your Oct. 19 issue which was conspicuous for its flagrant presentation of gross misinformation.
True, most dance chairmen are absolved of responsibility when their dance is over, and their future is not dependent upon the success of their dance . • . but, a chairman must answer for any negligence to his committee, his college senator or class president, and, most important of all, to himself. No dance chairman willingly and wantonly leaves a debt to his successors; he leaves a report on his dance and lists whatever recommendations he deems important. The Notre Dame dance chairman is definitely accountable for his “stewardship.”
Ten days before the dance we were 75 couples short of our quota; three days prior to the dance we were not 100 bids shy, as Mr. Thompson indicated, but we had surpassed our quota. The net result of the dance was a profit of approximately $100. All Notre Dame dances budget to break even.
It is a grave injustice that some Scholastic writers take it upon themselves to malign the good intentions and the good work of numerous people and groups on campus, not only dance chairmen. The Scholastic is an effective means of communication with the student body, but it should not debase itself by reporting hearsay evidence for its articles.

Sorin Run-Off Election Gives Hall Post in Senate to Meyer
In a run-off election Oct. 17, Sorin Hall elected Dick Meyer as its representative to the Student ‘Senate. Meyer beat his two opponents for the office, Bernard McGowan and John Hough, on a preferential ballot. The Sorin senatorial race had ended in a tie in the general elections, making the runoff necessary.
Jerry Slater of Pangbom, who supervised the count, reported Meyer ahead by 36 votes on the first count. Hough dropped out on this count, and Meyer won by 48 votes when the second-choice votes on Hough’s ballots were tabulated.

Architects Display Creations On Home Football Weekends
At every home football game the architects put on display their latest creations in the Architect’s Building.
The first two displays this year were experiments with color, forms, shapes, and lights. By using shadows, cast by odd shaped objects, branches and paper designs, they created a three dimensional effect.
Other sections of the displays exhibited book covers designed by students, various sculptured objects, and statues. Model homes, schools, and other structures were also on display.

visits Chicago
This week the Scholastic introduces a new contributor to The Back Page. Hal Blakeslee is a senior journalism major from the Windy City. While this particular thesis deviates somewhat from the normal Back Page format, we feel that it still bears a thought-provoking conclusion.
Got to thinking the other day about Indians—not just Indians in general, but a particular imaginary one. His tribe isn’t important. Even his name doesn’t matter. Let’s say he lived in the seventeenth century and spent most of his life hunting and fishing around what is now Michiana.
For the sake of amusement, let’s see what would happen if we could bring that Indian back to life—let him spend a little time with us and give him a taste of twentieth century living. Perhaps the best way to go about it would be to take him into Chicago for a weekend.
Starting out from the circle in a car, our imaginary Indian is introduced to an incredible way of life. The very automobile in which he rides is a constant source of wonder. Smoothly and quietly it races over the same countryside that he carefully stalked on foot. Grain now grows where forests used to be, and concrete highways have taken the place of twisting trails. Massive buildings leap up from the ground everywhere he looks.
Faster moves the car. The land he knew so well flashes past him. The brooks, the wild eyed animals, the smell of the woods .in the fall—all this is lost to him. Terrified at the speed and bewildered by the landscape, his eyes are fastened on the endless road ahead.

Then suddenly a cluster of Gary’s buildings come into view. Closer and closer speeds the car till all at once the Indian finds himself surrounded not only by buildings, but by cars, busses, signs —everything. Just at the peak of the madness, at the very climax of the nightmare, the Indian notices that the car is moving faster again and the cluster of buildings is behind him.
He relaxes a little now as traffic is snarled by a change of shifts at a steel mill. Curiously he watches the tired faces of the workers as they drive past. But his observations are short lived, for once more the car is moving rapidly, speeding through the refineries and across the draw bridge, racing recklessly on to the Outer Drive. Then, without warning, looms Chicago.
Lake to the right, fear to the left, the Indian squirms in his seat, dodging the rush of cars about him. A slam on the brakes here, a quick shift of lanes, and on sprints the car. Gary is forgotten; the delirium of Chicago is supreme.
Down Randolph now. Two short blocks and the great city swallows the traffic. Insanity is everywhere. El trains pass overhead. Horns blare on the streets. Buildings come alive. People . . . people hurrying.
The Indian shuts his eyes in disbelief, but to no avail. The sounds of the city, the noise of 100,000 people going home is overwhelming. Above everything else he hears the shrill blast of a policeman’s whistle announcing a change in lights. He hears the clicking of high heels beating a rhythm on the sidewalk —and voices—he hears all types of voices blended crazily into one ominous chant.
Out of the car at last he stares at a revolving door in front of a hotel. He watches stupified as the spinning door
snatches people from the sidewalks andi; belches others out in one continuous motion. Moments later, he finds him- ; self standing in the lobby.
Once in his hotel room, the Indian is ; pleased. He is far above the streets j which terrified him before. Still he is V not entirely removed from the city. ThM sounds of slow moving traffic filter • through the walls in his room. Neon £ signs insanely blink on and off outside f. his window. Theater marquees jet out over the sidewalks and flash their strange messages.
Darkness closes in on the city and -the Indian rests upon his bed. He thinks . of the life he lived, unhurried, simple ’ but not without adventure. He pictures^ ; the sunsets that were his alone to enjoj^ and the evenings he shared with only f the eyes of the forest. He thinks of ' stars, of rippling waters, and a fire to keep him warm. He remembers Lake Michigan playfully slapping the beach, its shoreline unmarred by greyish monsters.
He thinks of all this and compares it to carpeted floors and soft mattresse^ to speed and crowds. Beaches oppos" hotel rooms and woods oppose the city.
His mind struggles to understand our way of life. Its complexities and purposes. Why are you all bunched up in this concrete area he might ask. Why do you always rush to go anywhere and how do you ever get a chance to be alone? What is the power of this mone^ you have and why is it so important? j Do you like to spend your days bottled ? up behind four walls?
These and other questions he would want to ask. Perhaps the answers might satisfy him, but I think that just before he goes to sleep he’ll be lonesome for the life he led 300 years ago.
