Woman of the Year .in Politics and 
fifteen times on the Gallup Poll list 
of the Ten Most Admired Women. 
For a look at her lighter side, one 
of Mrs. Smith's familiar trademarks 
is a rose. She is so equated with it, 
that it is a rare occasion when she is 
seen without one. President Ken­
nedy's f~neral ·was one of these oc­
casions. Senator Smith "didn't think 
it was the day for roses." Yet at Sen­
ator Mike Mansfield's suggestion she 
left one on t_he President's desk in­
stead. 
She has even gone so far as to push· the rose as national flower. She and "Ev" Dirksen fre_quently argued over this issue, she of course boosting the rose and he the mari­gold. Yet upon his death, when asked to put a rose on his desk, too, she ·must• have · remembered . those • argu~ 
ments for she leftsome marigolds. 
Gen. William C. -Lewis, Jr., has

Where Is 
/ 
.., 


In the secret. places of Our Lady's canipus, there are artists at:work. Hidden away;in the catacomb-like studios. beneath . O'Shaughnessy, tlley are .working. In · mysterious :rooms .throughout the aging Field House, they are working. Last Sunday, April 21, they "~ame out,'' for .a .while at least; .to offer. the fruits of their labor. The: 2:J_st Annual Student. Art Show opened and will continue through May.19 ..· . 
· "Clowns on Fire''. is. the theme chosen by the seniors for the show which is open to all. undergraduate and graduate art majors at Notre bame as well as almost 
400. other students from .various. departments who are enrolled, iri art classes. . The show is juried, which means that a,work'sacceptance for display depends on the decision of ::(panel. The panel ·this year consists of . two_ art teachers, two graduate staudents and. t~o un­dergraduate art.majors. . . . . , 
. The diversity of works exhiqited reflects Jhe na~ ture of Notre Dame's Art Depar.tinent which is one that encourages the freedom of the individual artist: The .. ·• 
Arf Program is based upon the unit system. The . 
student-teacher ratio is .1:1 and each· student has an 
advisor. with whom he meets . regularly to. evaluate his· 
own work' andprogress; . . . . . . . . . . 
. There exists. no_ identifiable' ''school style" and fac~ 
ulty members encourage students to find their own mode of expression: On.display in the Notre Dame ;Art Gal­·1ery this month_· will 'be many· paintings_:_oHs·. and acrylics~water'·colors, drawings; etchings; silk. screens, · black. and white, and color photographs, .metal;sculp­
tures and other. light sculptures. 
: . Notre Dame'•s•juried exhibi.fion is an example of a 
kind of vehicle through which artists can' make .their 
work . public.' . Hundreds of national ~nd regional .·ex~ 
hibitions'. occur each' year; Thro'ugh. these exhibitions 
the artist not only reaches the· public but also recei\ies 
affirmation from fellow artists. And, of course, ·for 
every artist there is.the hope of· aone-man show some-· 
day. . . .. . . . . 
The ~ork of Notre Dame ·artists corresponds with 
national trends to some exterit. A few of the students 
are leaning ·towards New ReaUsm,: the duplication of 
photographic scenes. This inovernerit began a· few years 
ago as an outgrowthofpop ai:t:' .Working from a photo­
graph, the New Realist duplicates on canvas what he. 
finds in 'the photo. One might ask .where is the self~: 
expression .in such a'.: process..·The. steps· taken• in the 
translation -· fro in photo to -·.canvas· became very impor-. 
tant.. The outcome -resembles a• photograph ,but: with 
a drastic cha'nge in scale and thus in ·feeling.· . ...Modern artists are also moving towards a revival of. the 1940's · trend of·abstract expressionism., Today'.s ex­. pressionism, however, it without the extreme dripping 
arid splashing of the t0's. 
There is also a modern movement, originating in Chicago, called the Harry Who. Artists of this group create works which resemble gross comic book scenes. The paintings are drawn with outlines and very flat colors and the artist manipulatively distorts the figures 
· · . to portray obscene events. . . . There are no ·Harry Who's at Notre Dame, but there is at least one conceptual artist. Conceptual art is• one of the most unique and most important of the new movements. The idea behind an art object is ·the essential and most.significant factor for the conceptual artist. This type of artist might perform an event and document it with a story or a videotape. An idea would be communicated ~ithout necessarily being represented by an object. In general,.Du Lac's students lean towards the traditional. They ·are striving to produce an im­proved art object. · The work .of artists .is.not to be thought.of as self­indulgent. Somehow most artists, consciously or un­consciously, try to affect the thinking of the persons who view their work. Good art influences people's lives in subtle ways-the tasteful decoration of a room may be the result of an artist's inspired color arrangements. Come to see "Clowns on Fire" and open yourself to the effects that color, form and thought may have on you. Katy Sullivan

Dame, can you guess which one it

GILA volunteers Bonnie Israel, Sharon McAuliffe, Jerry McCarthy, Mike McKarry, Kristin Meyer, Nap .. Partin, and Mike Smith taught high school in Clarksdale, Mississippi last summer. Jerry McCarthy reports ·· here. 
I did not realize how difficult it . 
would be to chroniclii our seven : 
weeks of work in Clarksda.le, 
MississippL This report is incom-· 
plete in many ways; we cannot say 
"This ·is what we did, and this is 
what we lea.med," One reason for 
this is that we are riot yet, arid p_er-· . haps will not'be, sure of exactly · · what we have learned: We have not drawn any concrete conclusions; arid maybe that is best, because con-• · clusions are easily stored away and forgotten. Please excuse the ...... . report's. lack of organization; I · couldn't "package" it any. better. ·. 
'. Much of what we experienced will 
remain known oniy to the seven of· . us; I do not know how to put it in ·.·. words. :Thus, I have not mentioned 
some of the people who were closest to us; we will not forget them, but in a reports such as this they would not have the meaning that they have for us. 
It is presumptuous of me to speak for the group, but the feelings I describe were, I'm quite sure, shared by all of us. If rm·wrong, I apologize. We all came off the proj­ect feeling that we had somehow: "missed the boat"; but exactly how is difficult to determine. I have tried to describe some of this frustration and much of the joy we knew, yet as I read this through, I realize that I've only captured a fragment of it. 
· We're still puzzled at the sense of it all. . 
Last spring, all prospective candi-· dates for th_e CILA project in Mis-· sissippi were interviewed. We were asked why we wanted to·goto Clarksdale, and what we hoped to accomplish there. In retrospect, I believe the answers were probably somewhat predictable as well as somewhat vague. We were all drawn to CILA in the first place by a de­sire to "help others" _in some way; we were seeking perhaps "expe-,· · rience.'' Fortunately we were not· pushed too hard by the· interviewers, for had we been, our answers would be shown to be hollow. To "help others in some way"-in what way? Just what did and do we have to 
· offer? Just what did we want to ex­perience, and, more importantly, · how did we plan to use this freshly gained "experience"? Now, two· months after the completion of our seven~week stay in Clarksdale, we still find it difficult to answer these questions. Yet we are plagued by 
·even more questions regarding not 
·only our motives and accomplish­ments, but the concept of serving others·in general. 
. The consideration of meaning be-; hind what we were doing was that time overshadowed by seem-· ingly "pressing" problems: finances,' 
transportation, lodging and the · work which we would be assigned . in Clarksdale,· Not once did we sit down together and really discuss our reasons for goi_ng. :Each of us as­sumed that the others had valid . reasons. Later; during the seven weeks in Clarksdale, the problems we encountered each day hindered . us from perceiving the overall pie-. 
ture; during our meetings, when the question was raised as to what our. goals were, answers were hard to come by. 
The two Mikes and I decided to · drive down in Baby Mike's vw Bus, while the rest of. the group would fly in. We left1~ashington on May 31; and .head~d-'fhiough; Virginia arid the!'Sheriind6ili ';·lJ!:. . Valleytoward'Terine~seJ, ;nd 'scfiri~ of the most beautiful scenery th'afl

The rest of the group were left to -· 
their own devices in trying to teach 
subjects which they perhaps remem­
bered from high school or from a 
few Notre Dame courses. 
We were supplied with textbooks, and there was an ample supply of· · audiovisual material on'hand, for example, filmstrips and records. However, to our chagrin,'the plan-·~ ning for the curriculum was entirely our responsibility; Thus, those· moments we didn't spend in· the ," classroom were spenfeither prepar­ing for a class or lying around' worrying about how to getthrough five hours of Class every day: three. in the morning and two-in the eve-· ning.

I learned as I asked them to write 
what they would do as Mayor of 
Clarksdale.. Vera Jassell wrote: "If I was the mayor ...I would improve· the poverty in _Clarksdale. I would --: build better roads and open up fac-:. tories so _thatthe people would have , jobs.

Sharon asked them what they hoped for in the course, and was informed by Melvin -Stokes, the ­ninth-grade basketball star, that he·. hoped for a date with the beautiful, white teacher, who· herself he ven­tured might enjoy going out with that debonair; black man..When Sharori would 'watch· the basketball., games, Melvin always attempted to put on a spectacular show. · ·. 
The first few days\vere difficuit ·· . in many ways; None of us had ever· faced a class before, and we were .. ' naturally apprehensive arid self-· conscious;: particularly in· trying to· teach our own· age group. in the weeks before coming• to Mississippi, I had feared that bitterness would· arise against· us,' that we would be _.. viewed as liberal -college kids who . had descended Jroni the North' for six or seven weeks ·of "slumming."· I often woridered,,and occasionally still woii'der, .if that description does :. 
not fit us. · -· -· · · · · ·

Yet such bitterness never arose. ::· Otir-attempts at teaching were in-·... ,. deed frustrating, but not due fo:any ·; bitterness from the students. Grant-,_ ed, we were challe~ged, but in the-,---: same way we too often challenge · , . our own teachers---:.by our seeming·. indifference,· by our reluctance to · so much concerned with their.learn~ . ing as-with the wheels rolling · smoothly in class, with passing the time, with keeping them above all occupied. It was the silence and the • stares which we couldn't endure. In my evening class I felt at first as a total stranger-nine students clearly enjoying -themselves, involved in · · conversation about who's going out 
with whom_;,_and one phantom 
--"teacher." It was as though I weren't 
in the room-I was almost afraid·.•: 
to introduce myself. We a:11 went through this period of abject terror, ­but then every teacher does. It -­passed. What was most important 
was that we should not barricade 
ourselves behind the textbook, sur­
render to the protection of a routine,_ 
seeing·a "class" but not students, as we were often tempted to do. .. ­Once again, the question arises, as. 
to just what we hoped to accomplish 
for these students. In our darker moments our greatest hope was to · see the minute hand on the c~ock-· · begin to move like a second hand.-·: 
· .They challenged· us at first as · ­teachers but not as people, not as ·

The­question .that really bothers me, and which I think will bother me all summer, is: Are we down here just to please ourselves, to placate our consciences in a six-week stint?

My outburst in class would seem to indicate so, for me, at least; ·However, between lesson plans, · _classes, odd jobs around the school, · 
,, and our "breaks" with the students at some local nightspots, we didn't often pause to consider our motives, at least with each other. The heat oppressed· us-when we were not moving, we wanted more .than any­thing to sleep, not to think. We were drained much of the time: we often counted the hours and days. In our weekly meetings to prepare our re­ports, we never could agree on exactly why we had come. In th.e face of day-to-day pressures, annoy­ances, and pleasures that. consider­ation seemed of secondary impor-. tance: we were there, that's all that mattered. Now.the question of our motives, of our concept of service which is the theme of CILA, loom_s, large. 
CILA stresses not only service, but also comiminity. '!feel that the University of Notre Dame is a warm place. Perhaps I don't bother to see much of the loneliness which people suffer here ..Yet when people speak of what matters to them most here, what they will take with them, it is almost invariably the friendships they have formed, the people thei have come·to love. Our seven weeks in Clarksdale gave us the oppor­tunity to experience friendship as we had not before. When we were selected, we hardly knew each other. At the end of the project, we could .·· hardly get along without each other. This sounds terribly sentimentai, but. it is true. , Bonnie and I had had somewhat similar experiences, as we both participated in the Sopho~ more Year Abroad Program, in An­gers and Innsbruck. A small group · is cut off from the University and placed in· strange surroundings­Angers, Innsbruck, Mississippi, · 
14 
North Dakota, Mexico, or St. Lucia.• These people spend all of their time together-there is no escape to a carrel in the library-there is no occasionally comfortable feeling of anonymity, of being lost in a crowd. The people in such a group have a common interest-be it service or foreign. study-'-and they must de-_.· pend on each other, and only on each other, for support. Such groups be­come, for better or for.worse, 
· families. We were fortunate-ours was a "happy family." The experi-· ence in Clarksdale was more intense than that of sophomore year, be-­cause the pressures surrounding us 
. were greater, and we had nowhere to turn but to each other and, if one felt so inclined, to prayer. We were literally fused together by the pres­sure-which took the form of frus­tration with one day's class, anxiety in planning for the next day, dis-• comfort at the heat or general anger at the world. I don't mean to imply that we were always in a negative frame of mind .. Of course. we celebrated together, celebrated the good times, those moments when all went wen: For us, a day without a Frisbee or basketball game was practically sacrilegious. We clearly. enjoyed each other's company; I · really. think we came to love each other. 
I don't believe that these ties would have been possible were it not for the pressures we faced. The strongest friendships are formed under duress. A friend is not loved only for being himself, he is loved for the support he provides. We , needed each other more than people· in a"normal" situation (if there is ,. such a thing) need each other. So we used each other. Someone always felt like bitching, and, fortunately, someone always felt like listening. At one o'clock every day we would . trudge in from the battlefield and . sit down to lunch which Janelle had ably prepared. Sharon would crack• a joke, and everyone would groan. Regardless of how poor it was, it was necessary. We would compare : notes: "Melvin wouldn't shut up, today"-"Well that's all right be-· cause Veriee wouldn't wake up to­day." We would laugh at our situa­tion-we needed.to.· And we would came more and more conscious not of the support which we provided each other, but of the .act of sup­porting, and the care which thatim­plied. 
On Wednesday, June 20, we had a huge dinner at a local Greek restau­rant. Everyone seemed in unusually high spirits. That.night Sharon received a phone call that her · mother had suffered asevere heart attack. The next day Sharon had to prepare to leave. It was at this point that we realized what a family we had become, and what a loss we would suffer. Nobody could say-·· anything-but she knew how we felt. From Bonnie's-journal: "On the surface, we all tried to keep smiling and laugh at our own ter­rible jokes, but the surface was just a transparent film through which we could see that each of us was aching inside; I was amazed how Sharon smiled so easily an·d handled all of.her class business so well. As we were waiting for Sharon's plane 
-to take off in Memphis, I never felt so badly f<Jr anyone as I did for Sharon that day ... I felt guilty that I couldn't have helped her more, but it was hard to ·know what.to · say or do to comfort her~veryone ~as sad and depressed and I didn't want our project to end that way .•. I felt that I was needed as a mem­ber of the group, · and if I could just make everyone feel a little bit hap~ pier, I'd feel important." ·Sharon's ·., departure was our darkest hour, yet we all shared Bonnie's resolve. 
I am not a sociologist, nor do I' feel that it is proper to generalize about classes of people .. Yet' we all saw that i~ the black community at large, and particularly in the stu­dents with whom we dealt,'there was this resolve to support each'' . 
. other-a real openness and warmth which we often talk about out -. seldom witness. Call it "soul" if·· you wi!Hjut I feel it has little to do with being black. It has to do with a feeling of oppression or duress-a small "group feeling" in an alien or hostHe,society.:.Jt is the same feeling which we seven shared for:. · each other-a willingness to "come .• through" for one another when,the· chips are.down-a need for each other. •In my days '.I have not wit-.

THE SCHOLASTIC 

. ,"'I 

next year whatever they learned will be unlearned, their confidence and pride swept away, destroyed ... four years ago I got tired of the motions and let the kids relax." I could be severely criticized on the basis that after only seven weeks of teaching or trying to teach, !have given up on education. It could be said that we were indeed "slum-• ming," treating "commitments" as a fad, and giving up in the face of the adversary. That may be a valid criticism. I would just like to pose the question: where does the edu-. .cation lead? · 
For most, as I have said, it will 
.not lead to a job. They. do need jobs. Thus, we didn't help them ma­terially. What about "learning for learning's sake"? I think that as far as the state of Mississippi is con-· cerned, these students could have played pinochle for three hours a . day and received their credit, as long as they were in the classroom. And is learning for its own sake even possiblein a situation like this? I sometimes felt slightly. ridiculous lecturing on "how a bill becomes a law" to girls who have two or three babies at the age of 18. Besides, isn't the point of education to in some way. teach one how to live, to attain happiness? Then.one must ask if our learned men are happy, if our society as a whole is happy .. If by educating these people we are attempting fo raise them to our owii. "standard of living," then.I could. not waste the effort, because I be~ lieve they. are· closer than we are to realizing the true values of life. 
. I believe that Nap, Sharon, and Bonnie would disagree with ine on this view of education. They do not give up as easily as L I have not "givenup".on education, though:· . after all, I _am still a student.Never­theless, I have not been able to an~. swer, nor has anyorie provided me the answerto the. question "What did we.hope to accomplish by teach­ing these kids?" ;, 
To return to the question posed at the beginning ofthisreport-why did we go to Clarksdale? This _too we leave UJ?answered. We wanted somehow to hel!)-'-'-and I think we did-in particular. I think of Greg Nimock, one of ·(again)_ Kris's stu­dents whom we were able. t'o bring out of his self-imposed seclusion. We'll never forget the night he brought us a roast that he had cooked. !twas smothered with pep­per and we were in agony, but we had to keep up the compliments as Kris shoveled more onto our plates. As I stated before, our teaching was frustrating, but I think that in the overall context of the project, that is of little consequence. 
Were we motivated by Christian. ideals? I don't know: I think most of us are driven by a sense of obli-· 
· gation: we should help, and this. plugs at our consciences until we do. But does appeasement of conscience constitute adherence to the com­mandment "Love thy neighbor"? I doubt it. It is more neurosis _than love-we help not because we really want to, but because we are literally driven to. We cannot live with our­
.• selves.if we· don't. :Here I speak only for myself and for Mike Smith, who shares this view. In this sense, perhaps we are "do-gooders." 
In looking back,on the summer, I have a sense of having fulfilledan obligation more so than having shown love.for my brother. What happens to the Billies, Gregs, Ver­lees, Brendas, Dianes and others now concerns me, of course, but not, I think, as much as it would if I truly loved them. Here at Notre Dame I · sense newClobligations" which must, in turn, be fulfilled. Is this the spirit of service to which CILA dedi­cates itself? I know,it is not. But

Belcourt 
T?i,e Chi'f)'Pewa Indian Reservation at Belcourt, North Dakota, was the 
.work site for GILA volunteers Bob Allen, Rick Allen; Rick Baltz, Maggie Dunleavy, Greg Hunckler, . John Hunckler, Paul Karas; Gay Kaschewski and Gretchen .Werner. Here is their report of Summer, 
1973. 

The North Dakota project was a new experience for the.entire group, exceptfor Greg Hunckler, who had .· .. been with the CILA gro_up in Bel­court the previous summer. For the. rest of us, Bob Allen, RickAllen, Rick Baltz,Maggie Dunleavy, John· Hunckler, Paul Karas; Gay , · Kaschewski, and Gretchen Werner, ~t was our first CILA pl'oject. · 
-.. Preparation, on the whole, was quite poor. We had little information about Belcourt·~ the people, the camp, or the climate from CILA kids who had been there on earlier projects. We did, however, receive: .. · some information from John Hunck­ler who had been in Belcourt a few times visiting his sister and brother-in-law. . . 1 . .• 
. The town of Belcourt isn't at all what we had imagineclUwciuld be, and it's rather hard to describe. ·. Basically, .the town.is··comprised of small, usually· old and beaten-looking houses· and trailers, a large, modern school complex, post office, )aundr~­

i\.P.IUL 26, 1974 
Seven of us arrived in Belcourt on June 11 in three cars after driving leisurely cross-country for 24 hours. After a minimal amount of time and effort, we found two education department trailers and a tiny bungalow to serve as home for the· length of our stay. The two trailers were set rightbehind the police de­partment and jail; the house was several blocks away. The girls' trailer was the central meeting, living and eating place, as the cook­ing was done there and it was always so clean. Although the house and the girls' trailer had a number of points against them, we really were very pleased .with our living accommodations. 
The day camp. where we worked was about two and a half miles north of Belcourt on a small bay of Fish Lake. The grounds belong to the Lutheran mission which gives per­mission to the· education department to use the camp facilities; Four buses brought the kids to camp from all over the reservation. Attendance · ranged from a high in the eighties · at the start of the season to a low ·. in the thirties at the end. The age of the campers ranged from.sixto about fourteen. ­
Although there were few close contacts with the.parents, there were several opportunities to talk with them. Most were pleased with the day camp and were happy that· their kids were enjoying it so much. In many homes, the parents would be away at work during the day and .. the camp took care of their children. during these times. It was suggested that a baby-sitting service was needed, but we didn't have a chance: to set one up. 
We were lucky_ to find such good living quarters. We rented two ... trailers through the education de­partment and subleased a house . from Sister J,udith, the principal of St. Ann's Grade School. The difficulty_ we did have. in. getting settled in • · Belcourt lay mostly in the fact that CILA had no reliable contacts there. 
.Our group· was fortunate in having three cars. We could.have . gotten along with two, but a large group goes out in all directions, and:: cars are a necessity in getting :> .• around on the reservation~--.. ·.,··.' 
Our summerJn Belcourt was a · , give-and-take .experience. We gave· what we had to offer, but we feel · we were given a lot more in return. Community living, a new place, a· new environment, the affection of the little campers, the different things they taught us, and the many bits and pieces of Indian history and heritage are a few of the many parts of a total, rewarding and truly happy, sharing experience.

government which never material-· ized, and consequently they were very disenchanted. 
Even our arrival wasn't enough to change the p'revailing attitudes. The head of the second household en­scribed "Hecho por gringos" (made 

. by foreigners) and pressed a 20­centavo piece (lowest Mexican de-· nomination) into the soft, just · finished floor. Yes, we were gringos, 
. and would always remain as such.. But we shared what we could-· ourselves-and the indistinguishable mixture of pain and joy and the · triumphs and failures we expe­
'rienced, and.they reciprocated. We began to appreciate the simple things that gave us so much pleasure. I still vividly remember . Paul's look of satisfaction when we made the last sweep of the trowel on the first two floors. I enjoyed climbing into the cab of the Sem~ . inary pickup, waving good-bye, "Adios, amigos'' to the people as we wound our way.out of the ejidiJ on the !Oad · back to town. The people would· smile and wave back, and this would stick in my memory for a long time.· Sometimes it was hard to shake the materialistic breeding of my culture. I would look at the condi­tions existing at my place of wor.k and the blood would freeze and the tears would well in my eyes. · Many a time the ejidiJ house owners would purchase Cokes for us to quench, theJhirst created by the blistering sun, never buying any for themselves or their children. Most days I would come home exhausted : and find my father and my baby sister out in front of the shop chat­ting away with neighbors. I never could walk past my uncle's pl_ace without a bit, ''halloooo, Richard" (he knew some English) coming from the doo·r. · · · I am not saying that the people are well in their present state. They suffer tremendously and lack the · · bare essentials of life: food, clothing, shelter, and medical care. But I do think that they uphold the dignity of the human being. Despite differ­ences in status, these differences are only minimal at best. · At times we felt very awkward abciut·all the things that were being done for us by our hosts.and friends; Our parents received nothing for providing us with bed ·and board

and the love that surrounded our · 

. homes. Li.tis; our foreman, and Guero,. his friend and helper, did the lion's share of the work so that we could catch our breaths and not have to toil so hard. _They did all this for ridiculously low salaries ($5 a dayfor 10-11-hour days). We sought to increase their pay by in­augurating 5 peso a day ($.60) pay raises to cover Luis's purchases of Cokes and fruit (he always smil­ingly waved away our attempts to pay for our shares) and.to supple­ment Guero's support of his sister. Even then we thought we were "robber barons," but I guess that providing them with summer.jobs­construction of the Seminary had stopped due to· 1ack of funds-was the best repayment we could muster~ 
Luis taughtme a few things about education. He, a short, swarthy, mustachioed Mexican who married at 20 and has a 15°year­old daughter, is formally uneducated . as we envision it. When he was 21 he decided to learn to read and write or he felt he had been missing some­thing. Slowly and painfully with the aid of his wife he began to learn. Many a time when we would be talk­ing during a break in the work I . would mispronounce·words. 
Luis would pull out the red mark­ing pencil he had tucked behind his ear and tear off a piece of an empty cement sack. jjBurrito," he'd say, rolling his r's ashe wrote the . word forjjsmall donkey." "Esso burrito." The thought then hit me; who is educating whoin? A man who has never seen the inside of a class­room is instructing a guy with ·a college degree. I had to examine the emphasis that I placed i::m de­grees and diplomas from the so~ called "good schools." Education is a fine thing to have, but ifit is not put to work in helping solve prob­
. lems of life or in opening doors to future learning and involvement,. it_: is of little use tothe individual or to others.· .. 
Whenever I return to the·ejido of . Los Terones. or the peoples of Alta-· mirano and Huetamo, whether in person or in my thoughts, I will not shed the tears that I did when I left. I won't remember or see the excruciating denial· of Roosevelt's Four·Freedoms.. No, I will be smil­ing, rejoicing in that I was able to love and share with people in a 
culture that was far_ different from 
my own and to learn so much from 
them. 
The cement floors that Paul, 
Amaury, and I left behind (as well 
as the nursing care given by Cathy, 
Colleen, and Mary) will represent 
the life sharing and building we col­
lectively accomplished. They will 
be significant only to the people 
that helped to lay them but they do 
serve as. a symbol of our commit­
ment to God and each other. 

·st. Lucia. 
Mary Beckman, -Vickyann Chro­bak, Marty Dineen, Camilla Kutch and Joe Marino spent last summer working at St. Jude Hospital, St. Lucia; West Indies. Joe Marino ­wrote their story. 
StJude Hospital is a inost unique 
institution· situated four miles ins 
lanci from Vieux ·Fort, a coastal 
town on the southern end cif St. 
Lucia. The establishment of the hos~ 
pital from its origins is a remarkable 
achievement. 
During World War II the U.S. built 
an Army Air Force base at Vieux 
Fort to protect the Panama Canal. 
Shortly after the war the American 
Air Force left St. Lucia, turning over 
the entire installation to the St. 
Lucian government. All of the pre-· 
fab barracks and office buildings ­
were removed and sold except for 
the hospital, solidly constructed of 
reinforced concrete, which was ­
stripped of everything removable 
leaving just a sturdy shell, empty 
and open.· 
It was not until1965 that a small 
group of American sisters discovere_d 
and leased the stripped overgrown 
shell and imagined its possibilities. __ 
For months these Sisters of the . 
Sorrowful Mothertoiled, refitting the hospital with plumbing,· electricity, hot water, beds and whatever hos-. pital and medical equipment and supplies they could obtain; Through­out the reconstruction the sisters were fo drive old cumbersome trucks filled with supplies over five hours of tortuous .roads to and from the . capital city of Castries forty miles to the·north. To the immense credit 

'of these fine sisters and .to the im­measurable benefit of the St.Lucian n_atives the hospital was officially opened for patients in October 1966. The sisters entitled their accomplish­ment, St. Jude Hospital, after the patron who inspired them through a -"hopeless task". 
· Ever open to fulfill needs in new sites,· CILA was introduced to St. Jude Hospital by the Dr. WHliam Sisson family whose son Tom and daughters Teresa, Diana, Donnaand. Linda have studied or are studying in the ND-SMC community. Seeking a place to provide some medical and 
· other services to people in a foreign country the Sissons had come acros_s St. Jude in 1967 and since have traveled;to St. Lucia four times to.• volunteer their services.. 
•·In the summer of 1970:CILA sent three members, Tom Sisson, Vicky-· ann Chrobak, and Debra Dishinger . to St. Jude for a four-week volunteer term. Being CILA's first involve­ment in hospital service, the project was unique and rewarding as CILA's three volunteers would attest. 
·After three years and renewed contacts with St. Jude's·administra­tor; Mother Irma, CILA decided to relaunch a program to St. Lucia.

ticipation·and preparation.· We · corresponded with Mother Irma, had · inoculations, worked out travel 
arrangements, planned our budget, . held several group meetings and · even had a pep talk.with Mrs. Mamie 
Sisson. Each of us had our o.wn thoughts,· motives, and expectations but! feelwe all shared a prime goal, as stated·in our preliminary project

"We hope. to be of whatever as­. sistance and aid, physical or other-. wise, to Mother Irma, St. Jude 
· Hospital, and the people of Vieux Fort. We realize that we are working within their system and as such will be directed according to their. regulations, customs, needs, and capabilities. . 
"We see this project as a great experience, and hope to learn by it. What? We can only determine• , once there or even months later. ;: We have something to give,.they have something to give; we need to learn from our experience, they need help in their ex­

St. Lucia is one of the least known of Britain's possessions; situated south of Martinique and.north of St. Vincent in the Windward Island · chain. A tropical paradise of vol~ canic origin about fourteen miles . •. wide and twenty-eight miles long, St. Lucia has approximately 100,000 

inhabitants. One'third of its people 
live in the port of Castries on the 
northwest side of the island with 
the remainder being scattered 
around in small villages. The second 
largest town is Vieux Fort at ,the . 
southern tip with about 5,000 · · 
inhabitants. ·' :·. 
The dark,.richly colored black. and Indian people lead lives with. · the barestof material possessions; . 
and are remarkably warm and gen­
erous. The prevalent language is Patois,' a spoken language made up of Carib. and African words with a French base. Most of the native~ have learned English in-school or from experience and so ~language is· not a strong barrier. The economy of the island is based on the banana crop, all of which is sold to England, although new developing industries are taking a foothold. By our standards the islandis very_.under­developed and illiteracy is prevalent, though decreasing. I>eace _Corps workers are active in helping the native teachers raise the educational standards. 
St. Lucia is without a doubt a• most beautiful island. It is very-,· mountainous, a pair of tall peaks on the southwest coast called the Petons capping the picturesque island. The · hillsides and valleys·are densely forested with tropical trees such as palm, coconut, mango; papaya,· • breadfruit,'cocoa and cashew;·as well as huge groves of .cultivated banana trees. Numerous untended ·. cows, goats, and horses and' sheep : roam the small fields, rutted roads, and streets of the towns. Embracing 
.the island is a twisting coastline of beautiful beaches, coral reefs, and smaller islands.

Even after weeks of preparation ·and anticipa.:' · tiori I· don't think we fully kriew · · · what to expect-ahead of us, but froin'the beginning we came:upon.. surprises;'new perspectives; 'frustra~ tions, :realizations, good times, re~·· grets and satisfactions. The ·first · couple weeks we found ourselves adjusting to. and learning to appre­ciate St. Jude HospitaljSt. Lucia '· and the st: Lucian way of doing '••·.• things.· Because of this ·and some unclarity in our specific responsi,; · bilities it, was several days before,:, we ·reaily got-down to the nitty-: : < gritty of our assigned tasks and ·,... responsibilities; . · 
Our responsibilities: carried the • five· of tis throughout St. Jude Hos~ ­pital: Though Mary and.Cami had originally expected to split time be-.· tween organizing the library and·:·;.• helping in pediatrics, it did not.work otlttliat way due to_ several circum­stances. Assignments for volunteers at St.· jude, we discovered, tend to· be quite flexible and dependent on . the immediate needs. • And so, ai~ . · though pediatrics always ,was in -·.: 
--nee~ of ·more hands fo~. the children, _the arrangement of the library ·was nota pressing necessity. . • 
·In' additiori; both .. Mary_·~nd:Cami· • ran· into annoying health difficuities in the first days. In Mary's 'case she literally ran into difficulty un-· .: . expectantly stepping into· a· drainage. ditch ·and hurting her foot. Just as Mary found herself laid :up in bed . Cami was bothered by lier· first bad : attackofnausea and diafrhea.<·As 
we ·found out, sometimes un--. ·.: · · pleasantly, the local bacterials did ' not tofally agree witli-o·ur systems. 
After two frustrating days in bed and much hobbling around Mary· soon-found herself at jobs such as· filing cards in the library, working in the office, spending time with kids in Peds,'collecting fees from out­patients and filling out forms for new admissions. But when Sister Candida, the chief lab technician, went home to Wisconsin for a month, leaving Keifer Vitalis alone and overworked in the lab, Mary sur-· prisingly enough found herself work­ing in the laboratory. At first she ; 
· spent most of her time washirig test tubes, pipettes and various other . ·glassware, collecting order slips, and· ·recording and sending out results . As she confessed, her background hadn't exposed her to much biochem­istry or lab-work'but she began to develop an· interest; One daY: she· excitedly exclaimed · to us at the lunch fable that she had just learned how· to do-a hemogiobin-then a · glucose. Before the summer ended she had successfully learned.how to draw blood from several patients upstairs on the ward. · Not bad-for a Theology major! ­
-. Mary nia"e other contributions in the lab which ·were really immeasur, able. Outpatients frequently came . fo the lab to have various tests done and-whilerriost are not too concerned there are some who become nervous about having their blood drawn ..· Nervous or not, Mary.was invariably there to greet them and talk with· them. Though the St. Lucian's · friendliness•.rriade it .easy for Mary . to get along very well.with them, they nevertheless seemed apprecia-. tive of her interest and concern. 
ReJovering from her initial sto~-. ach distress Canii, like Mary, soon became involved in tasks all around the hospital._ She moved about, not , because there· was no· full-time need · fo·r her anywhere, but becaus·e there were so.many areas where some· help.was needed. Cami,helped:record and• flle ·rec9rds: in .the office,· took • • 
. histories for. outpatients, arranged. and catalogued books in the library and spent a:lot of time helping the children in pediatrics, washing them and taking them.outside for walks 
. anci recreation. . 
._ A particular ·accompiish~erit ·fo~ • Cami and Mary was their Sunday catechism· dasses for the children of the village of-Augier,·near St;: ·..-. 
Jude Hospital. . They became very enthusiastic when Sister DeLourdes asked if they wanted to accompany her to Augier one Sunday to her catechism class. They returned rather excited about the wild respon­siveness of the children and the challenge they saw instructing them. in religion. When Sister DeLourdes left for a ten-day retreat the girls 
'jumped at the chance to hold a couple classes themselves. It · seemed obvious that Cami and Mary 
. recognized the children as a clear reflection of St. Lucia's· character and values and their involvement with them both solved and stimu­lated some awareness and reflections about the St. Lucian. perspective and their own. 
Contributing and experiencing· 

· service in the way of clinical treat-. ment and patient involvement was a strong motivation for both Marty· and me and we were pleased to be assigned to the government ward, 
--St. Anthony's.· Our responsibilities ­
.were very similar, chiefly involving nursing/orderly work, although we were to spend time in other areas as well. 
In the beginning Marty and I were assigned six to ten patients to· shower or bed bathe and whose beds we would make or change.. After a few weeks, as we became familiar with things one or both of us were assigned to treatments. With about. a third qf those.patients in St. An-· thony's being admitted because of bad leg and body ulcers or infections, most of the treatments we did in­volved soaking, cleaning, applying wet packs and dressing wounds. 
In.addition we shared with the nurses such tasks as vital signs, observing patients in bad condition, giving enemas, chasing down supplies in the Central Supply Room-and laundry, fetching wheelchairs and stretchers, wheeling patients to and· from the operating room, elevating beds, doing preps for surgical cases, serving lunches, running errands to the lab and office and any-other tasks Mrs. Skeete, our supervisor, might declare suitable just for us guys; ·' •·· 
We discovered that running a . government ward in St. Lucia had many problems.··Theywere always .short of such obvious necessities as 
· -clean linen, bandages, dressing sets.•· _and oxygen tanks. The showers and toilets were too few and too . dirty. And the nurses, though not really bad, could not match the. trained nurses we have in the • States.· . . 
· The absence of Sister Candida left a few additional tasks open to us, as it did for Mary. I became the resident electrocariograph tech-· nician, running about one or two.a day .on anybody from_ an eighty-six­year-old man to one uncooperative seven-month~old baby. Admittedly, I myself did not know· exactly how . the instrument worked or what the tracings indicated (though I learned a lot). But it was a sharp reminder of our huge differences in tech-. nology. to. see the looks of amaze­ment. and puzzlement_w_hich many patients expressed as I strapped those strange wires to their ·arms and legs and fiddled with knobs for . several minutes to produce a long · · · sheet with funny-looking scribbles .. 
Meanwhile. Marty, had become fairly_ adept at drawing blood and doing several lab tests. .on a few occasions he was called upon to run sugars or hemoglobins on emer­gencies at late hours of the night. 
Vicky,. of course, had the unique .advantage of volunteering at St. ':, . Jude for the second time and for 
having a specific role to fulfill. She 
explains: 
"The reason I went to St. Lucia this summer was to teach Math, English and Basic Science to the· first-year student nurses at the . hospital. I also ended up teaching Math to the second-year students I had· fourteen first year students and nine second-year girls.·· 
''I knew exactly what I was going to be doing and had a schedule to . 
· follow so in that respect perhaps my job was a bit easier than for the rest of our group. But itwas far from easy, especially at first. I felt strange at the beginning with them and they didn't quite know exactly how to • react to ~heir 'American' teacher.. 
"Having been used toteaching .• _ high school and college students, it 
.. was a change for me to be teaching elementary English,writing, frac-· tions and decimals. And having vir­tually no or yery few books didn't help the situation. Even though the girls that are accepted as student nurses probably have more education. than most of th~ girls on the island they•are still far below being at the 
same level one would expect a 
student nurse back home to be. 
"English is a second language for 
them so it's really not surprising 
that many of them had. problems in 

writing. And certainly Math and 
Science aren't the simplest subjects 
to learn either. So it was frustrating 
at first. There were times when I · . 

felt that I was getting nothing 
across and very little accomplished. 
"But we kept on going and as time 

went byit got better and better. 
I learned what I could and should 
expect from· them and they in hirri. 
learned about me too. It became a 
very satisfying feeling for me when 
my students would come up at the 
end of the day to ask questions 
about what they had learned, or 
questions about oth~r things, or per­
haps just to talk. My girls used to 
bring me mangoes, coconuts, bread­
fruit and all sorts of other little 
things that at times just made all 
th~ frustrations seem worthwhile." 
-These then are the tasks, whether 

assigned or assumed, that the five of 
us engaged i~. But to look only at 
them is to miss a very great part of 
what our summer project involved. · 
Perhaps it could be headed under the 
subtler aspect of our experiences, 
and it is something better seen than 
read· about. 
I have outlined our working ac­

tivities in a fairly objective manner 
but they don't reflect the more per­
sonal experiences and relationships 
we all came to share with St. Lu­
cians and English, Americans· and 
Canadians as well. We met and 
worked with an incredible number 
of people with different backgrounds, 
perspectives, values and .needs; 
Just the variation alone made it 
stimulating;. revealing· and learning 
experience for everyone to varying . 
extents. Whether it was with· the 
patients or the people we worked 
with we contributed, had good 
times, shared ideas, argued; taught. 
and learned. 
For Mary and Cami this meant . · 

talking to the vario:1:1s outpatients 
and asking where they .were from, what they did, were they feeling . . better, etc.; or discussing problems··· 
in the office with Boniface and Sister 
DeLourdes, or spending hours trying

A Study -of the Thit•d World 
We at Notre Dame seem to be continually referring to ourselves as a "Christia·n Commtinity"-or :vigor­ously disclaiming that appellation. And· pernaps this issue bears the marks of l.ieing beaten to death. · Yet there seems 'to be.a definite sense at times tha(ma~y of us have no real grasp of 'the meaning of the terms "Christian" and "Community" -they have. become hollow words. through endless_ repetition or intangi­ble theorization. Religion and. World Injustice, a course offered by the theology department this semester, attempted. through a mixture of' ·the concrete and theoretical to bring students to a clearer understanding of these terms and an awareness of actual and possible 
. efforts toward the alleviation .of world injustice.. . 
The courseis one step in a· long evolution of thought .. on the problem of Christian commitment in the world. · Father Don McNeil( an assistant rector in Grace Hall 
-and CILA advisor, was one of the main forcesOin its development. For him it is aresult of much practical experience, theory, arid just pure dream, which in turn became a part.of new ideas. It began in 1972. While visiting the Mexico project, Father McNeill sa.w a need for developing awareness of other cultures and a re­
ligion and World Injustice. Those in.err.A felt that the organization should increase its role as educator and awareness "catalyst,,, .thus this c·ourse. The students in it were not drawn from those who, had participated . in summer projects-they were anjntentionally -wide, range of majors, interests _and ages. East coast, west coast, midwest, . freshman, senior, theology, ' geology, marketing· majors-some forty students and facuUy wives were involved. The course was interdisciplinary and· intercultural, including the specific with the gen­eral. Lectures laid theory, while case. studies of the three areas, Africa, Latin Arrierica: and the Philippines, films, a symposium of international scholars and indi­
, . vfdual interviews with people affected by the issue of world injustic~sharecroppers, farmers, social work­. ers brought a niore concrete nature to ,the course. _ rhe underlying feeling motivating the course, iri fact, motivating CILA's evolution, is a sense that we· really do not have any actual, concrete experience of a' "Christian community." Much of our contact with or­. ganized Christianity comes ·from the parish-parish . act~vities, ·parish priests, the ·sisters in· the .parish school__::_and many of these contacts are far from favor~ 
sponse to the human needs of these people.· This grow-.. '. able. Father McNeill hopes to· bring people into contact 
ing realization led to a. feeling that CILA. shouldserve _..· a more educational function in conjunction with the basic experience it _offers. . 
.. By_the spring'of 1973,-_this idea· had emerged as a• 
course: . Religion .and Human Developm~nt. _· Students 
participated in :summer CILA projects, keeping de­
tailed logs of their experien.ces ·and: perceptions. Then 
in the fall, they. could g~ther together and reexamine 
and reevaluate their summers in light of others' expe~ 
riences and with the help ,·of various professors. The 
approach was interdisciplinary, enabling the students · 
to view their experiences from· all angles~religious, 
sociological, economical -,-and help.them to relate 
their summer activities to their present lives at Notre 
Danie. The course also stressed: contact with people 
outside the university, particillarly: people ·'. involved 
in CCUM·{Catholic Committee on _Urbim~Ministry), a 
national: group active particularly in urban areas. 
From. meetirig _with CCUM ·members,: 'and other 
groups, Father McNeil!and the people of CILA began 
to see a necessity for expanding the focus.of CILA; mak­
ing it more than international, niaking it intercultural. · 
In order to become involved in the social and pomical': 
aspects of other cultures in our' own country, theyini~. tiated programsin Appalachia and New Orleans.. , . ·. · Profiting from these·.meetings and the successes and failures of the first-semester course, Father: McNeill, . Father Horan, Mary. Beckman, and :others .interested in CILAand its goals, shaped the present course, Re-
with other active groups-for example CCUM.:_opening . up new· possibilities. for experience. . , . .. CILA. is not out to save· the world~rchange. it 
~adically. Many of the ·summer projects make little 
. real headway in changing or improving the lives of the people with' _whom they are working. There is actually little poss_ibility that they could,:.___;_programs-usually last only seven weeks and the students participating are not frain~d social workers. Nor will the course answer all­or perhaps any-of the problems· of world injustice. The first concern of the course, and the CILA projects, is to expose students to_ different cultures· and then··give them a forum in which to· examine and learn from their experiences and each other. . . . 
Ouf of the spring course came ·new· ideas for de­veloping other__kinds' of educational experiences: -A. freshman, colloquium, · based , in :the,, halls, is being planried for second semester of next year:·Through this 
. one-credit program, Father McNeill'also hopes to enlist the aid of international students in the halls and people from the South Bend community~ He also envisions some way. of helping students to become mq,1:e active in their

·The punt hung nearly motionless-; suspended; for a . long moment, against a crystal November sky. 
In the· stands below, 60,000 pairs of eyes turned upward as the ball, its laces white in the afternoon sunlight, began its· down_ward flight. And· on thefield, as the moment of suspended animation was broken, 23 uniformed figures began a frantic rush toward the north end zone of•Notre Dame Stadium; 
Twenty-two of those· figures were athletes: 11 dressed in Notre Dame's navy and gold, 11 clad in ·Louisiana State's blue, canary, and white: The twenty-third figure was•Tom Lech­ner, Notre Dame's costumed lepre­chaun, and as 'the punt plummeted towards the LSU goal line, Lechner outdistanced ND's coverage team as he raced to the spot:·where he thought the ball would hit. · 
.The ball landed on the LSU eight, caromed, quickly. to the four, and then· hop-ped out of bounds on the one-half yard line. And leprechaun Tom Lechner was . right there. Dancing •his Irish jig· with a flair never again duplicated, he whipped his' rumpled hat from his head· and tossed• it on· the spot where the. punt had· left ,the playing field. Moments later, a referee's marker joined the leprechaun's hat, making the play official, and moments after that the stadium crowd :was · roaring with delight.·• 
Among those standing and shout­ing was Danny O'Hara, then a small~ ish, auburn-haired · freshman. : So impressed was O'Hara by the things Tom Lechner did on the sidelines that day_;.._ and on.several other oc: casions during the .'70-'71 football season ..:...._that, during the spring of

The difference was ing session on Wednesday night -_ that the girls also had to perform a. session -which included learning a a routine they'd made up .to the fight complex routine to Santana's "Evil sorig, so they were beingjudged both Ways". -and then were put through 
. on learning and creativity. an extensive all-phases examination on Thursday. Then, after watching, brooding, and deliberating for near­ly six hours, the judges made their decisions. 
"We had an outline of our cri­teria," said Anne Cisle, one of last year's co-captains, "and as far as the girls were concerned, we based it on how well they caught on to what we'd taught them, how ·they looked, and 
, how they performed in their dance routines and gymnastics.· .But we were also looking for naturalness and spontaneity. That · was very im­portant." 
, "And the guys," added Sue Picton, "we judged them ·on' their mounts, their gyniriastics, a'nd their appear­ance. And after all that, we· had per­sonal interviews with each of the finalists." 
. The interviews, agreed both girls, were a critical part of the judging process. "Something like that is good," admitted Sue. "It can affect -for better or worse -·your whole outlook on a pernon: we· asked them some serious questions (such as 'Why do you want to be a cheer}eader?'), and then some funny' ones ('What do you like to drink?'), and then, after that, we talked about. each in­dividual, and then we voted: I think we did it very maturely; and'r think we're ·going to have a·. dynamite squadnext year because of it." ·. 
Conducting the personalinterviews and making the . final decision .were by far, the toughest portion .of the process .as far as the judges were concerned. But.· while the final . yeas and . nays were being . cast, .the . 20 surv1vmg • aspirants ·were ..going through their owri periods of stress. St. Mary's . sophomore Amy Mac­
. Donald _was' one oithe girls selected for next year's 'team, but actually making the squad is not. what she remembers most about that ·final night. 
. . . . . 

"After we had our. interviews," she said, laughing, "I didn't think I had much of a chance. :But I was proud; though, that I was o~e of the final 12 girls, _and I was relieved after the interviews because we 
. knew, then, that it _was all over. 
. . 

"We had a. two and one-half hour wait until we found·out who'd made . it and who hadn't, and· during that time . everyone waited together. Everyone stayed close. When -next year's team was finally announced, 
they did it alphabetically. They started with the guys, and then with the girls. Rebecca Bracken was the first girl to be announced, and then . they called Mary Ami Grabavoy. I knew that if I'd made it; then, I'd be the next one called, and all I can remember after that is just hearing my name: After that, everything is blurred. ·But you know, the whole thing was very. sincere, and everyone stayed around, together, after it was over. Even the· kids: who hadn't made it."-. 
Then she laughed again. "But it didn't hit me until two or three days later that I'd really made the team. And even now, well,. it still doesn't . seem like it.. I guess it won't until we first get back to· school in Sep­tember;'' 
. Amy MacDonald wasn't the. only girl to earn a spot ·on the team for the first time. Becky Bracken .and Mary Ann Grabavoy were also first­time choices, and they joined Sue Picton, and veterans Mary Short and Shelly Muller to make up the . fe­male contingent. Dennis Buchanan, Al· Koch, Jim Ignaut, Andy Fim­shauser, and two-year veteran· Mike Corey. joined captain Pat Heffernan _to make up the men's group .. 
. . . : ') 

And like Amy MacDonald; each of the successful candidates had reasons for personal · elation . upon ·making the squad: Shelly Muller did. So did Denny Buchanan. And so did Mike Corey. · 
···"Once I'd made the team for the first time," said Corey, ''I knew it was going to be hard, to go ·back to the stands; because when you're a cheerleader you're so close to. the action. 
"Lguess, basically, it's a ·way of releasing energy for me, an outlet. I've always been ·athletic-minded, and if I·couldn't actually participate in athletics, I figured this was about as close as I was going to come. But there are other aspects I enjoy, too. I Hke being an official representative of the University, and I like, especial­ly;, representing the students in the stands_;_ the kids. who can't get-. as close to the action as maybe they'd like. 
''You know,'' he. continued, "that's one thing .about this . system. of. try­outs. It assures that every year we're going to ·have· fresh, • enthusiastic people. _The new kids will be excited­because it's their first time around,· 
and others of us will be excited be­
cause it's our senior year. I know 
that I, personally, may not show en­
thusiasm all' the time, but it's there. 
Believe me, it's ther~." 
Enthusiasm is one factor which 
seems to pervade the entire program. 
From those who tried ·but didn't 
quite make it, to those who made it 
for the third time, to those whose 
cheerleading stints are over, and who 
found themselves not trying out last 
month, but judging. 
. "It was great," 'said senior Liz 
Sowada.-"It was the greatest experi­
ence. And not because· of the uni­
form, not so much putting the skirt 
on, but because of the· people who 
were· involved. I appreciated it ·be­
cause I knew what it was like to sit 
in; the stands :;-and I c~n say now 
that I've probably never laughed so 
much, or had so many good . times, 
as I did this year -,-and it's all .be­
cause of: the people. who were 
involved. 
"Trying out is an experience. It 
gets you · so . worked tip, and so 
nervous. And I know what it's like 
to go through it and not make it. 
But you get over that, you really do. 
But judging, for me, is a different 
story. I just don't like to judge any­
one. 
· "Tryouts, though, are:a good idea. 

They give more kids a .· chance to 
make the team, .they give more kids 
a chance to experience the fun.of it; 
and they're good for ,the squad be­

cause they keep everyone on • their 
toes all year long." 

. ~ix newly selected ·· guys, and as many newly selected girls made up 12,members of the 13-member cheer­. leading team. The selection of the 
13th member -· the. leprechaun ­
was left to the Un-iversity's only re­
maining authority on the subject: 
Danny O'Hara. And O'Hara's selec­
tion, predictably, was a good one. 
He pie:ked Pat'Murphy, a sophomore,· 
out of a field.of 20 hopefuls, and be-:

The old priest then walks to St. Mary's Lake where the hungry ducks anx­iously await his daily arrival. ·. Though some might choose to be­lieve the viciou·s rumor that Fr.

Each year the old ones continue and the new ones begin to care for the lake residents. For countless years the ducks have been depending on the voluntary generosity of these campus ministers and, though the ducks are often · rude, obstreperous, and highly ungrateful, these people continue to give. 
On April 6 of this year, while the ducks were · fooling around in · the lake, Mike Mccafferty was ordained a priest in Sacred Heart Church. In 
·, an absolutely breathtaking cere­mony, Mike officially told the com­munity that he was "ready and wil­ling" to take on the tremendous task of the priesthood. The· handsome young lawyer formally proclaimed his desire to give of himself for the benefit of the community. No one forced him, or the·other six men or~ dained that day, to take on the re­sponsibility. He chose it freely and lovingly. At Communion the ceremony was delayed about five minutes· because of the long line of boys, from the floor on which Mike is a resident as­sistant,• who would receive Commu­nion ·from · no one but Mike. These people have a need for him· and he is willing to fill it. " At one point during the ceremony, all the priests of the Congregation of Holy Cross on campus laid their hands on• Mike's head. From the oldest to the youngest,. these priests were a symbol of.-the selfless love and devotion which so many have manifest since the University's · in­ception. Though over the years many of-them have made glaring blunders, as seems to be so ·characteristic of the human animal, they still have been willing to give of themselves to fill the needs of the community they serve.
