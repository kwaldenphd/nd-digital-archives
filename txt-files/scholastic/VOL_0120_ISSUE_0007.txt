The First. Word 
by Mike Kenahan 
"A Collector's Item."· That's what a friend told me this year's Football Review was going to be. I had just expressed doubts over,whether anyone .would want tci· read a Notre Dame Football:Review in which the Irish .lost the first two games. I· was mortified when we lost our first game-selfishly T thought of how bad it · would look to start off the_ first page with a losing game. I then looked forward to a win'over Michigan, one that 
,.would help salvage the first part of the Review: It was after the loss to Bo and his gang, and before 
:the Purdue game, that my:friend was trying to console me. He told me not to worry about anyone reading or wanting the Review because .this yeru:'s _e?i_t_i?~ _~ould 
FEBRUARY 2, 1979 
be more prized than many before it. "It'll be a collector's item," he said with a trace of sarcasm appearing along with his good nature. His reasoning, I must admit, had some merit to it. "No other Notre Dame football team in history has lost its first three games, never mind the fact that they're all home games at that. ·If we con­~-tinue to play Hke we have been, after losing to Purdue, 
· we'll be the first team in Notre Dame history to lose its first three games. And then everyone will want a copy to save." . . . 
A quick check through the all-time Notre Dame records confirmed my friend's statement. The closest the Irish came to dropping their first three games in 
. ,the modern era was back in 1963, a year before A:ra's 
· arrival, when they · lost to Wisconsiri and Purdue in their first two games. The '63 team pulled out a 17-14 victory over USC to break the skid but finished up the year with a dismal 2-7 record. 
The 1888 _and 1896 teams also came close to losing 
· their first three games. Both lost their first two, but that was back when touchdowns counted for four points and field goals were worth five points. The two losses by the 1888 team; only Notre Dame's second year of football action, were both to Michigan at home. The games were played ori two consecutive days in. April. That's right, April. ·That team had to wait until De­
"cember to secure its· first win .(the first win in ND foot­ball history, by the way, not to mention the ·first shutout)' when it blanked Harvard· School of Chicago 20~0 at home. The win salvaged their season at 1-2 as that was the last game of the year. 
Fortunately, the 1978 version of Fighting Irish foot­ball did riot have to wait eight months for· its first win. It came against Purdue, thus seemingly ruining ···'my friend's theory. But on second thought, it occurred to me while browsing through the Irish football records 
•.:.....:. and even before the USC game and the great Houston 
·. comeback-that successful season or not the Football Review would always be a collector's item. My early nightmares of going 0-11 and begging students to read the Review were unfounded. · I realized thaf aNotre Dame football team·;could go 0-100 and still people would want a gam~by-game review of the: season: If 
they'll siffor three hours in freezing~cold_ temperatures .· and watch a· game that appears to be a· lost cause, like . at the Cotton Bowl, thenthey'll do anything. That is one 
reason,:_loyalty and ·dedication. But there is another reason. And that is that most 
··_·-. people have·a collecting nature about them, especially concerning so-called "pieces of history." It is a basic part of hum,m nature. People are fond of collecting . mementos a_nd whatnots in order to help preserve some period oFtime or occasion that has passed. People collect things, either _to store away for future refer­ence or recollection, or just. to lock away and secure a part of life that was special. and in some ways sacred . 
· The Notre Dame Football Review. affords many . . . people this opportunity to capture a special part of the past.. The number of requests that I , receive d_uring 
--~-the year for back issues of the Review· helps to· confirm my belief that, in a way, my friend was right. This Review, like. all the others before, and. an the ones to come, will truly be a collector's item; I sincerely hope you enjoy this little "piece of histor~." D

Keeping Legends Alive 
by Walt Madden 

The lifeblood of legends· is publicity. , 
INSPORT, Notre Danie's International Sports and 
Games Research Collection; established in 1966 and housed in the Memorial Library; is_generally conceded to be the broadest, mosf comprehensive concentration of sport and physical education research data -to be found anywhere. It operates from a :basic commitment to provide :resources of serious and·. scholarly research in sports and sport~related dis:ciplines. Although interna­tionally-oriented (it is· unUmited in scope either geo-. . graphically or categorically), special emphasis has al­ways been placed on the.history, mythology and evolu­tion of Notre Dame sports,· not the least of which' is 
football. · · 
A bibliography of Notre Dame football literature re­
cently pt1blished and researched 'in INSPORT -would be 
impressive, indeed, and would include such authors and· 
writers as Roger Kahn, John Underwood, Coles Phinizy, 
Jerry Brondfield, Francis Wallac·e; Wells Twombly, John 
McCallurri, Ken Rappoport, William Gildea, Chet Grant 
and many others. If Hollywood General Studios should 
move forward with its contemplated feature-length film 
about Notre· Dame's legendary -George Gipp, another 
notable author could be added to that list. According to 
INSPORT's curator, -~erl:i Juliano, who has been ·in 
communication with the_ studio,_ Pulitzer Prize winner 
Jason Miller (That Championship Season) would be 
tapped to write the screenplay. · ··

mayappear in two installments. It promises to be a rare, 
in~depth look at Rockne's Notre Dame career from his 
matriculation as a student-until his death "in a· plane 
crash in 1931. . ;• . . . INSPORT's holdings include· Irish football memo­rabilia that dates back to the very beginning. A broad­side that served ··as a program for .the very first "intro­ductory"· game ·with Michigan in 1887 lists a· "Center Rusher" an·d six "Rushers" on each team; ·as well as a "Goal"1 (Goal Tender); four points for a touchdown and five points for a field goal. Football caught on imme­diately, and it wasn't long before Notre Dame football ­promoters were thinking in terms of nothing less than winning football. In 1892 an instructor at the Univer­sity, James H. Kivlari; ·wrote· a letter to Yale Univer­sity's great 'football coa"ch and 'innovator, Walter Camp, asking for "some points ori the' best way to develop a-­good football team." Recentiy the ·Yale University li­brary presented INSPORT with· a facsimile reproduc­tion of that letter. . .. . . Anders von Tangen Buraas, a native Norwegian who now lives in Switzerland, recently spent a week _in INSPO~T researching Knute Rockne. Commissioned by _ the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation· to do a drama~· tization of· Rockne. for ·airing in Europe,. Buraas was amazed at 'the wealth of materials with which to work, including an impressive leather-bound scrapbook of oversize dimensions commemorating -the production­and world premiere showing of the Warner Bros. movie ..

"Knute Rockne, All American" released in 1940; an 
original script for a stage play. called ."Knute. Rockne 
and All That Jazz"; booklets entitled "Rockne's ,Foot­

INSPORT's film library, though not confined to one­
sport, is understandably rich in film footage of Notre 
Dame football games going back to the early thirties7 
Often this film is loaned to major television networks 
to help in. promoting national telecasts involving the 
Irish and past opponents. This past season, film was 
provided of the 1943 Michigan game and several past 
games· with Southern California. In another recent de­
velopment, Newsweek Broadcasting, a subsidiary of . 
Newsweek magazine, informed curator Juliano that it 
plans a TV tribute to former Irish All American and 
Reisman -Trophy-winning quarterback Angelo Bertelli 
and wants to borrow film of-Bertelli from 1943. 
A recent issue of Notre Dame Magazine featuring 
Irish legends and history was ·researched for -the· most 
part in INSPORT and used many of its photos. IN­
SPORT also played a part in the development of Ameri­
can football in Japan which received some attention re­
cently when Notre ,Dame accepted an invitation to play_ 
Miami in Tokyo next December. Promoters of football ·

and his Wolverines were putting a 
streak on the line. Michigan ha·d. not lost aregular s·eason nonconference .game since Bo's first year. That loss

Bo-wing.to Bo .was to Missouri by a score of 40-17, the ~1ead coach of the Tigers then 
It was billed as ·the renewal of a grand college football rivalry, · as Bo Scheinbechler vs. Dan. Devine, "Hail to the Victors" vs. "The Notre Dame Victory March," the running of Ricky Leach ·vs. the· passing of Joe Montana, the kings of the Big Ten vs.. the defending. national cham­pions. Actually, it was simply Notre Dame vs. Michigan. · 
Some may argue that when two teams· so steeped in football tradi­tion meet, it has to be a classic. But it must be noted that the two tradi­tions are SEPARATE ones. The two teams had met oniy twice in the last seventy years and those two con­frontations came in 1942 and '43 Maybe by 1990, when the series has developed, a game·like this could be considered a classic. ·

Thus it was this lack of previous battles that prevented this one from-being· a biggie. The intensity and an,~_icipation that preclude a South­ern Cal game were not there. The famed Notre Dame spirit was sub-. duedthe week before the game. Fan interest was ei_ther on the baseball pennant races or the remarkable Indiana weather, but it was not on the game. . 
The Irish came into the game hop-· ing to avenge themselves after a 3-0 ._ embarrassment by the Missouri Tigers two weeks before. Notre Dame had not lost its first· two games of the season since 1963; that team was coached by. Joe Kuharich 
and finished 2~7. Michigan was com-.. to victory. Perhaps. this .season,

. Dan Devine presently has two vahiable me~ ori his team. Paul Harvey _is 5'11" and weighs 275 pounds, while Cullen Walton stands at 6'2" and. weighs. 205. Walton asserts that "Devine knows· he· can depend on us-when he needs us." These men are not linebackers, but members of the South Bend Police Department. Having the position of Head Coach of 'Notre. Dame's football team, Devine.:receives much attention. Some­times during a game, though, he may receive a harmful type of attention that may place himself or team mem­bersin danger. It is in these rare cases that Harvey and Walton are helpful as the coach's uniformed escorts, as . they provide a sense of security for the Fighting Irish coa_ches and-players. They do not do this for employ­ment, because itis not a paid position; rather, they do· it-out, of, the friendship· they have established for Devine. '.'It's-not a job, .but something we could do to 
working with athletes. My wife and I _would have ~ome players over for Thanksgiving dinner, for instance, be­.· cause they could not go home. because of practices, and

. I think it's really nic_e.oflhern to do it,llhe says. There have been some threats on the Irish coach wheri he has traveled, and fortunately:n<> serious consequences have resulted; Harvey feels that the closest call occurred at .the Clemson game. "Some· fellow wearing an orange. jumpsuit. and .a cat's paw got through 120 ··policemen arid a fenced-in area, soni~how,'-'. he says, "arid lie went after the coach yelling, 'Lwantthat ···.······················~'.,!' We controlled him in a hurry/' Devine is grateful his escorts came to the Georgia Tech game this year: · "Since the· kickoff,· the players were bombarded with fish, ·rotten eggs; ice cubes; and potatoes: They ·showed remarkable restraint, but when the bottles started coin­ing, I got upset, so Paul1md Cully took the team to midfield. They added some stability to the situation." This year, Devine andorie of bis players have done . wrap-ups for•MutualR.adio Network right on the field .,. after the games, and.the services.of Harvey and Walton 
contribute to the University,''. Harvey explains. "It's a· . psychological advantage to the team to have us· appear at the games, because anyone with crazy ideas would not want to tangle with us.". 
Devine came to know the two men when he· first arrived as Notre Dame coach. Harvey had become as-·· sociated with Irish athletic :teams in the early 1970's ·.: by-entertaining players on holidays and their families· while they stayed in South Bend, and through the con-: tinuance of this practice he built a, reputation among · team members. Devine heard about him iri conversation, so he looked him up because he admired the Detective were put to good use walking.themto·t_he·locker room afterwards.: "The wrap-ups took only five mimites .to

-· Sharing many moments of.emotion during games· has· strengthened the friendships between the men. .

It has been a long time since a Notre Dame football team was 0-3. In fact, it has been forever.

" . and Featuring the Irish Guard.'' 
Sixty thousand fans· are watching two teams warm up on the field below them. Adrenaline flows through all who are present. The two teams now depart through the tunnel at the north end of the stadium. Suddenly a tremendous rise in intensity comes from the stands as eight figures exit· from the tunnel. They stand motion-. less, eight abreast and face the south end of the field. They wear doublets, kilts, spats and sporrans, and starid . over eight feet tall while wearing their bearskin shakos. · They are members of the University of Notre Dame's famous Irish Guard, symbols of the "Fighting Irish" and, collectively; a precision color unit for the band. 
Band Announcer Frank Amussen grasps the PA mike in the press box: . "Good afternoon; ladies and gentlemen . . . The U~iversity of Notre Dame proudly presents its marching band, in its one hundred and thirty-third year and its ninety-first football season (a. slight pause as the tension builds) ... America's first university band ... and here it is ... the band of the Fighting Irish!'' . 
The Irish Guard instantly comes to life.-The crowd yells, screams, and claps as the Guardsmen do their 
by Tim Griffin 

famous high-step trot to mid-field, Another performance is underway for the Guard and the band. 
The Irish Guard is the all-important right arm of the Notre Dame Band. These colorfully .kilted giants help clear the path for the band and act as an impressive vanguard for the band during rallies, parades, and foot­ball shows. The formidable appearan~e created by the Guard immediately conjures up thoughts of tradition in the minds of Irish football fans; Anyone who has ever seen a Notre Dame football game has surely noticed them high-stepping down the field in front of the Uni­versity band. 
The Irish Guard first performed in the fall of 1951. Six of the members played bagpipes. and . two played drums. Because of South Bend's inclement weather, the use of the bagpipes lasted only two years. Problems arose when reeds froze in the cold weather allowing only uncontrolled sound. Lewis Sneddon' from· Scotland was _the first Irish Guard advisor. He. taught the mem­bers how to dress and play the bagpipes. Later, John Fyfe, a.native of Glasgow, Scotland, and a. member. of the Scottish military, became the Guard's advisor. Fyfe retired in 1977 after fifteen years of service, and George Spoher became this year's advisor. Spoher graduated from Notre Dame in 1978 and was . a member of the Guard throughout his four years. 
The Guard is comprised of ten men: eight of whom march during official appearances by the band. The uniform•o{ the Irish Guard is patterned after the tradi­tional Irish kilt. The uniform has changed gradually over the years and the present version, designed spe­cifically for the Guard, has been used since 1974. It con­sists of a large piece of plaid cloth worn over the left shoulder, a red doublet, kilt, black shoes with white spats and white gloves. The large bearskin hats are called shakos, and each member towers over eight feet tall when wearing one. A horsehair sporran is worn in front of the kilt. The sporran was originally used as a pouch to. keep money and ammunition in. The flasher, shoulder and waist belts, ·a small ornament worn on the sock, and plume on the hat complete the uniform. 
The uniqueness of the uniform lies in its design and the one:-of-a-kind plaid material. The cloth is officially the "Notre Dame plaid," first conceived by band director, Robert F. O'Brien, in 1966, and made exclusively for Notre Dame. The·design is registered in Scotland and is copyrighted so that no one but the University may use it. 
The Guard was the first to utilize the Notre Dame plaid, which denotes colors that are representative of the University. Blue and gold are used to symbolize the s·chool's colors. They are interwoven with green and white, the traditional colors of the Irish, along with black used to delineate the pattern. The doublets are of papal red, honoring the Catholic Church and the Holy Cross Fathers who founded the University. 
O'Brien explained the seemingly all-Scottish tradi­tions of the Guard by saying that·"the Scotus . ( or Scots) _ were originally an early Irish tribe that left Ireland and settled in Scotland about the beginning of the 6th cen­tury." In spite of the many particular differences that exist today, the early Irish and Scots were closely united by family and cultural ties. It is a point of interest to note that Scottish and Irish Gaelic were identical until after the 10th century. 
Irish Guard members audition with the band prior to . the beginning of each fall semester. Guard: members : must I?e 6'2" or ·taller and wear theh' hair cropped above their ears. During final ·auditions, candidates are chosen on their marching abilities, enthusiasm and stature. They arejudged by·the band directors and as--· sistants, the Irish Guard advisor, and the Guard Captain. Because there are only nine chosen (excluding the Cap-· tain who does not have to audition), competition is · keen and a very good unit can be chosen. · 
•:. -Members practice with the band and march· in pep rallies, all home games,bowl·games, and one away game a year. Originally, the Guard marched through the. con­course in the stadium before each home .game, but the practice.was discontinued several years ago, because it--· was too unorganized. . . 
· The Guard members consider their group somewhat of a fraternity and pride themselves on keeping many of the group traditions secret.cRookie initiations, involv-· ing a modified scavenger hunt, pre:.game ceremonies and certain aspects.of their attire:are known only to group 
FEBRUARY 2, 1979 
members. Perhaps the r.iost frequently discussed topic on the Irish Guard is the question of what they wear under their kilts. Two years ago, Notre Dame played Penn State in the Gator Bowl. During the game, ABC announcer Jim Lampley interviewed former Irish Guard member, Mike Ploszek, on national television. In that interview, Lampley's final question to the Guard Cap­tain was: "What do you people wear under your kilts?" "The Ploz" quickly replied, "I'll never tell." 
The group, no matter what their image, functions as a color unit and make the Notre Danie Band unique and recognizable wherever they go. Their strict inspections before games and clean-cut, unsmiling appearance make them an imposing and highly impressive group. Anyone who sees even the last minute of a Notre Dame football game will know that the Fighting Irish have won again by the appearance of the Guard doing the traditional damsha bua, translated from Gaelic as "the victory dance," or better known on campus as "the victory clog."

Quarterback Greg Knafelc surprised 
the Spartan defense as he passed to 
a wide open Nick Vehr for a two­
point conversion fo give N.D. a 15-6 
advantage. 
After the kickoff, M.S.U. began to 

drive upfield. But on a 1-10 from 
their own 41 Jim Browner ·single­
handedly turned the game aro.und. 
Smith passed in the flat to fullback 
Andy Schramm who was spun·around 
by Browner. The senior safetyman 
then proceeded to strip the ball from 
Schramm and run an unmolested -45 
yards for ·a touchdown. The play was 
called a fumble recovery, · although 
the return·was listed as an intercep­
tion runback; · More ·importantly, it 
enabled the Irish to take a 22-6 lead 
into the locker room at halftime. 
The Irish appeared ready to· turn 

the game into a rout after inter­mission as they came out and moved 54 yards down to the M.S.U. 23. But the drive· stalled and Chuck Male missed a 40-yard three:pointer, turn­ing the ball over to the Spartans. After an exchange of punts, Ed Smith ·started the Spartan second­. half rally as he connected on 5 passes for .. 63 yards. Smith's 10­yarder to Samson Howard and An­'derson's extra point cut the lead to 
22-13. 
It was then N.D.'s turn to score in

touched for 11 yards and the score. The Irish lead appeared to be a safe one with only 12 minutes left in the game. 
But the Ed Smith and Company show was just getting warmed up, With the Irish defense geared to preventing the long gainer, Smith was patiently connecting for 10 and 15 yards per pass, steadily moving Michigan State downfield. On the first Spartan drive, Smith completed 6 of 7 tosses for 65 yards. The touch­down play covered 6 yards as Kirk Gibson got position on Dave Waymer in _the end.zone and hauled in the scoring pass. Steve Heinikreiter in­tercepted .the two-point conversion pass and the Irish lead was 29-19. 
The· M.S.U. defense then forced an Irish punt and Smith took over in poor field position at his own 2-yard line. Smith coolly marched the Spar­tans downfield with pinpoint passing as he hit 7 of 9 passes for 71 yards. On fourth and goal from the four, Smith .found-Gene Byrd at the end 
. line for his third T.D. pass of the game. Once again. the Irish defense stopped the two-point try as Bobby Leopold forced Smith to throw the ball up for grabs and Jim Browner picked it off. The Spartans had one last chance and attempted an onside kick, but freshman Dean Masztak fell on the ball and the Irish had at last sewn up their second victory of the year, 29-25. 
Although the Irish defensive let­down appeared to take some of the luster away from the victory, the game· offered several rays of. opti­mism for Notre Dame fans, espe­cially _on offense._ The line· worked well as a unit, freeing Ferguson who rushed for 140 yards and Heavens who added 89. Joe Montana also added to the offensive effort despite the fact that he only put the ball up 12 times. Montana completed 6 passes for 149 yards and finally be­gan to connect with Kris Haines who caught 3 passes for 90 yards'. _AH things considered, it seemed to be a more impressive win than. the four­p_oin~ margin indicated. : .[] -­

It was the Wednesday before the Pittsburgh game. I was just leaving the Observer. office, and the phone rang. 
"Hello, is the Sports Editor there?" the voice at the other end of the line queried. 
"No, he's not but maybe I can help you," I responded. 
The voice identified himself as Gene Conlin, a sportsw:riter with the·Philadelphia Journal. 
· "Every week we run a preview on the college game which is going to be nationally televised, ·and since. Pittsburgh versus Notre Dame is the game of the week,· I'm looking for information." Conlin said he had a Chicago-based source who said both the Notre Dame students and the team were very apathetic; 
· "Is there apathy among the mem­bers of the team and the students?" Conlin asked. . , 
"No, I don't think so," I responded. "Anyone who had any interest in the team was disappointed, of course, by the consecutive loss·es to Missouri and Michigan which opened the sea­son, but the team has beaten Purdue and Michigan State in the past two weeks' and they seem to have turned things around.0 
"How do you think · they'll do 
against Pitt and during ·the rest of 
the season?" Conlin inquired. 

"Well, this is obviously a key 
game. If we beat Pitt, and I think 
we· can, ·we shouldn't lose another 
game up till Southern Cal." 

"Thanks for the information. I'm going to call Dan Devine to see what he thinks of the apathy comments and what you had to say."

14. Mixing passes to Dennis Grin­dinger and Kris Haines, with six . Jerome Heavens runs and a scramble of his own, Montana quickly moved the offense to the Pitt eight-yard Urie. The offensive line, led by center Dave Huffman, had been fired up by an injury to Huffman's brpther and

~~ 11111 

when Montana hit Grindinger for 13 yards and a first and goal situation at the eight. Three running plays moved the ball to the three, and on fourth down Devine again· shunned the field goal. · 
Montana took the snap from cen-· ter and dropped straight back to pass. He had plenty of time but his receivers were shadowed by the Pitt defenders. As the pass blocking col­lapsed, Montana rolled to his right and spotted Ferguson releasing from his block. Montana lofted the ball in Fergµson's direction and the Irish had six more points. 
Devine's gambling had paid off as 

Notre Dame had an eight-soon to · be nine-point lead with just over two minutes remaining to be played. Unis did make the conversion to send 
the score to 26-17 Notre Dame. 
Pitt's last gasp was choked off by a Dave Waymer interception and the Irish had an impressive come-from­behind victory. · 
Notre Dame did open the scoring in.the contest. After a Tom Gibbons interception had given the · offense the ball atthe Pitt 39, Montana used a 22-yard pass to Pete Pallas and seven running plays, the last of which was a two-yard scoring plunge by Jerome Heavens, to put the first "6" on the board. Unis' placement gave the Irish their last point until the final stage. 
Pitt tallied two second-period scores. Trocano ran 3 yards to cap a 79-yard, 14-play drive to knot the score at seven, and Mark Schubert booted a 33-yard field goal after a Jim Stone fumble had set up the Panthers-deep in Notre Dame terri­tory.• 
That was. all the scoring until Trocano's · fourth-period run opened the offensive fireworks. 
LJ~'1E'~ The game was a milestone. for Heavens who passed George Gipp's all-time rushing mark of 2341 early in the fourth quarter. Heavens fin­ished the day with 120 yards in 30 carries. Montana, who was a dismal 4 of 10 at halftime, finished with 15 of 25 including seven completions in a row for 218 yards and two touch­downs. . . After the game, Heavens was sub­dued about his record-breaking per~ formance. "I am glad to have the record," said the senior co-captain, "but I am happier with the win. To­day's comeback should send this team.on its way." Heavens came to N.D. after a fine scholastic career in East St. Louis, Illinois. As a freshman he led the Irish in rushing with 756 yards, al­though he was not promoted to a starting role ·until several games into the seasori. A knee injury short~ned Heavens' sophomore campaign and he picked up only 204 yards in three _games. Once .(ully recovered, Heavens re­sponded with a fine junior year. His total net yardage is listed as 994, but at one point in the season's finale against Miami• he .had 1000. yards, only .to be thrown for a 6-yard loss later in.the game. · · · Coming into the 1978 season, the fullback needed only 387 yards to break Gipp's record. His 120-yard 
•game pushed him 22 yards past that record. 
Devine, meanwhile, was relieved to finally .see his charges have a winning record. 
In his post-game press conference, Devine also made reference to the apathy statements made to the Ph:iladelphia Journal reporter. "I think this . game shows you how much some Chicago reporters know about Notre Dame football.'' D

Bards of College Football 
Way back in 1599, William Shakespeare quilled the_ famous lines: ­
.All the world's a stage .And all the men and women merely players. 
No Shakespeare was not forecasting television's fu­tu;e impact on humanity, but it sure sounds like it. And· nowhere could those lines be more aptly applied than to· the impact of television on sports. And this is especially true concerning college football coverage. 
Today, college gridiron battles are "acted out" for vast television audiences. · Broadcasters, often when introducing a game, _even go asfar to say that "the stage is set." Moreover, the men on the field are "players" in more than one sense of the · word. They are athletic players to begin with, but; with the arrival of the TV cameras, they become theatrical-type players too-playing their positions· and "roles" for the tele­vision viewers. The women,_ as-cheerleaders and · pom­pom girls, play their parts in the production as well. _­
. However, there's a lot more to the production of a football game than there is to a Shakespearean play, especially in· terms of equipment and financing. The Notre Dame-Pitt game provided an excellent example of what goes into the makings of a nationally televised college football game. 
by Mike Kenahan 

On the Wednesday "afternoon before the Saturday game, two large trailer trucks pull up to the west side of Notre Dame Stadium. "Network of the Olym­-pies" is written on the side of each.truck-the tip-off that ABC-TV is in town once _again. ABC-three -letters -that are synonymous-_with international sports and; -more importantly _on this occasion, with college 
· :football. The network that brought you the Olympics and -college football for as _long as . you can remember (but not as far back as Shakespeare's time) certainly has the knack for turning the world into a stage of.some sort or · another. And college campuses seem to be ABC's favorite stage of them all. In fact, the 1978 college football season was the thirteenth consecutive year that the American Broadcasting Company has carried-college football,-and like most, years, Notre Dame got more than its share of exposure. 
A Notre Dame · football ·game has always been a popular attraction with television: sports viewers­Nielsen and his computer-rating service -will attest to that. So, it's no great wonder why · ABC seems to · al­ways be knocking on the doors of The House That Rockne Built. The -University doesn't mind though. ABC more than compensates them for all the trouble. 
-Notre Dame and-Pittsburgh split $533;633.33 -of ABC money for the rights to .televise the October 14 game. 
Donn -Bernstein, ABC Sports' Media Director, puts the figure in big business perspective· by·simply calling it "a half.million and change." _ABC, by the way, -sends the check in the full amount,to tliehome,team, which in turn is supposed to send halfto the visiting team. 
· Thus,_· these are the · d~ys _of big-time television. Bernstein says;-_ "It's become -too .big._ Everything has -: been blowri -otit of proportion in terms of money. 
-, : Sports now rely· ontelevision like people do oxygen. They place'a lot of emphasis on._the contracts. And the figures nowadays are so big-that it's ridiculous. But that's the.way things are." Television rights are not cheap themselves, especially for programs that sell. College football is one of those programs., In 1978 ABC signed a four-year contract with the NCAA for the rights to bring college football into the homes around _the nation. The price for securing such an honor-$118 million-is no small change by any stretch of the imagination. _ _ At first look, it may appear that ABC is being overly generous and perhaps on the· verge of bank­ruptcy. Have no fear, for at best guess ABC makes more than its share for carrying college football, thanks _in large part to the sponsors who buy advertising -time on the air. Commercials, alias "TV time-outs,'' are the · breqd and butter for ABC as with all television networks. An average of 21 commercial breaks appear

Bernstein: "Television. sports coverage has become 
too big/' 
in. coll;ge f~otball games. As an aside, Bernstein stresses that, contrary' to popular. belief, commercials for. coHege football games are· only run at <'natural stops"; during the . game, at s~called. breaks in the actions. such as ,.after a touchdown . or. a change of possession. .For-.. nationally televised . games, .. ABC charges its spo~sors $70,000 for 60 seconds of air time. Thus, the "Network of-the Olympics'' can wen, afford to be generous with the schools from which it is malting 
big money. .. · ,· ,.: . · ·.·.;· · ,.._ . · · · · 
. However; broken down structu~aliy,: it can be seen that · everyone concerned gains in some way.. ,The viewer gets what he wants~ football game brought into his home to enjoy. The advertiser gets what he 
wants--;-publicity and 'promotion for· his product. -The University,. including its athletic· department, players · and coaches gain also. ,They receive.. useful: financial support and valuable exposure. The University likes the· exposure in order to attract interested students. The athletic department and coaches like it because it helps ;attract p~mising high· school_ athletes.' And· the players :uke t~e exposure because· it attracts pro· scouts. ABC gains too. Having the rights to broadcast a ·popular program ~ttracts ·advertising: revenue· and : big' profits, thus· completing the _circle of influence. Bernstein calls th.e process "a two-way street.". The former ~ports Information Director at the University of Washington explains that "Notre ·Dame benefits from the exposure and money, and ABC benefits too .. : ND has provided ABC with some of the best college football and some of the highest ratings ever." For the ND-Pitt game Bernstein expected 40 ·million viewers. to tune in. He says that ABC tries.to reach.an~average of 10-15 million homes for each nation·auy televised game. · But it :an starts with the scheduling.· And· for a · 
.. game to even get onABC's schedule is a task in itself. 'Bernstein admits that ·"scheduling is :the most intricate,. complex, and time-consuming ·aspect of the college football package." One of the things that makes it so ·complex is· NCAA appearance regulations. In the. regular season; schools are. allowed to appear oniy five . times every two years. In each of those two years a school can.· be shown once regionally arid once na-· tionally.. The fifth ·occasion· _is part. of ·an option clause that ABC has built 'into:its contract with the 
NCAA. . ·' 
FEBRUARY 2, 1979 
'­
According to the ~ontract, a team can be shown a: third ti~e, regionally -or nationally, . only if iri one of the two years the school plays on one of five "ex­cep_tion .dates'.' or if it is ABC's ''.wild card" game. The except_ion dates-for. this.past sea,son were: i) Labor Day, 2) the first regular season Saturday,·3) Thanks~ giving D~y,. ~) rhanksgiving Friday and 5) December 2 .. The so-ca_lled ~'wild card" game ls another protective <:1ause in ABC's contract. The NCAA will. allow ABC to pick one ganie a· year and have it be a team's third appearance. _·This ganie 'is one that falls on a "charged" ·or regular playing. date· and can't be moved to one ofthe five •iexceptio_n';'datei:L 'The Notre Dame­use game was ABC's wild·card game for the '78 season; Notre Dame, which .started the first .year of ·its . two­year cycle in 1978, had already been ·featured regionally agains_t, Michigan and nationally again~t. Pittsburgh. And smce the Southern .Cal game did not fall on one of the exception dates, ABC ·pulled its ace out of its sleeve-the wild card opUon-in order.to abide by the cont~act_ with the NCAA and still feature.the traditional int_ersectional battle. Thus·, next year Notre Dame will only be seen once regionally and once nationally. dur­ing the regular season; . · · · · -· . 
Picking which 'teams will .be . shown each w~k is a chore. ABC .broadcasts 45 games. each year 17 of which are. na~ionally televised.. Also, .by'its c~ntract, ABC must broadcast fo1:1r Divi_sioil n games and· three Division ill. games a year. The decision of which teams to fea~ure each week restidn the laps _of three men. They are: Jim Spense, senior vice president of.sports; Chuck Howard, vice president for production and Berri'­stein. The teams are us~ally'selected..on th~ day afte~ the Saturday games. Bernstein explains that in the -· selection process, "We look at the big picture. We try'to protect ourselves, yet we have.to gamble. The variables are. many so _we_ do _whaes· best for the 'package." In oth_er words; they try to pick the teams that will draw 
. the largest audiences and highest ratings, so the sponsors will be happy. The sponsors themselves, however, are not involved in any way. with the scheduling. . 
The Notre Dame-Pitt game was an excellentexample of ABC's decision~making . process. ABC would not 
•·commit-itself to nationally televisin·g the· game.unless Notre Dame beat Michigan State~ ABC figured that most vi~\Vers aren't in the habit 'of watching a team that is 1-3, even if it· is Notre Dame.. Once Spense, How:ard and Bernstein choose the. teams, the selections . are. giv~n to Roone-Arledge, .president of ABC Sports and ·News, for his final OK. Bernstein says Arledge's ·· decision is the'"bottom line." The NCAA's Committee on Radio and· Television -,then usually rubber~stainps Arledge's approval. The process occurs for every game that ABC plans to telecast. . . . . 
Once the scheduling is set.then it's up to production, eventually ending in the final . telecast. The numbers are big here, too .. The.two large trailers .that serve as · ABC's home away from home-a complete mini-studio on .wheels~ontain more than $2.5 miiiion worth of 
. equipment. Upon their arrival on Wednesday, around­. the-clock security is ~stablished; Nothing ·is· left to chance.· On Thursday, the_ men arid women who work be­hind· the scenes arrive.· ·Bernstein is one ·of these 
people. He accompanies the crew and works as a liaison between the local press and ABC. Although a native Californian, four years in the Big Apple have made their impression on him. Bernstein in some ways resembles the characteristic New Yorker: his pace is fast, his delivery quick and his talk is straight and to the point. But unlike the typical big city man, Bern­stein is far from impersonal. After being with him for two minutes, he makes you feel as if you've known him for twenty years. And even a sports editor of a small college student magazine is treated by him as if he were a celebrity writer for a national publication. · 
The man in charge on the scene· at the stadium is the producer. For the Notre Dame-Pittsbu.rgh game this was Chuck . Howard, who as mentioned before also holds the position of senior vice president of ABC Sports. Howard is responsible for what goes into the overall production-its content and. format. He over­sees the work of the nearly 1000 personnel that it takes to produce a game: He is . also in _charge of the pro­gram's tempo and is_ thus in constant contact with the announcers. Howard's right-hand man is.the director, who on this occasion was Andy Sidaris. (Bernstein claims that Sidaris hold~ the distinction of being the inventor of the "honey shot.") The director is really the man · in the hot seat:· He is in charge of what goes out over the air-the picture and the sound. 
Both Howard and Sidaris work out of the master control room, lo_cated on the right end of the trailer truck closest to the stadium. They sit at a console which contains all the switching and control devices, facing the monitor wall. Sidaris · spends most of his time looking at· the monitor wall, which containes over a dozen screens and selecting· one particular pic­ture to go on the air. He has eight stadium camera shots, the one blimpshot and three videotape replay pictures from which to choose.. The choice, needless to say, is difficult. It's a split-second decision, one made_ 
, ' , . ., ,, 
through experience and oftentimes intuition. Bernstein compares the jobs of the producer and director to that of surgeons. "It's a critical operation, there's a lot of pressure. The production end involves a lot of decision­making in a very short period of time; things can sometimes heat up." 
Each of the two trailer trucks is divided into three separate compartments or mini-studios, each with three· small step-ladders leading up to three large metal door entrances. Each room has a specific function, all of which is eventually connected to the master. control room. To the left of the control room,· occupying the middle of the truck, is where the audio equipment is housed. The sound from the field and the announcers goes through this room for adjustments before it is sent into the control· room. The compartment on the far left end of the first truck is the visual room. The pictures that the cameras t~ke are first sent through this room where, like the sound, technical adjustments are made to ensure the best quality before being sent on to the monitors in the control room. 
From the outside, the second truck,· which is parked on .the other side of the first one, looks like a carbon copy. But in reality its contents are quite different. The left end of the trailer contains the graphics room. A million-dollar IBM computer, called a Chryon, ~tores all the titles that will be used over the pictures on disc tapes, which can be recalled in an· instant. To the right of the graphics equipment is the slow-motion room. Two slow-motion machines highlight the inass of machinery stored in -this part of the truck. On the far right-hand end of the truck is. the ,taping studio. All prerecorded material is stored here, such as the Fireman's Fund Flashback film..The tape room is also in constant contact with the New York base studio where all the commercials are run from during the game. 
Sensitive tim~ devices are located all over the tape room. As . Bernstein explains, "Everything is figured in microseconds. We have to be exact. If we blow a commercial we have to refund $70,000 to tl.le sponsor. That's a lot of. money. to give up." Com­mercials are the only parts of the football broadcast that don't emanate directly .tronithe game site. The commercials are coordinated with the breaks down on the field by a man who stands _on the sidelines to let the officials know that the network is away from the action. You can always tell when a commercial is in progress by locating a man standing out on the field on the press box side, just off the sidelines ·at about ·. the thirty-yard line. He is usually dressed in a white official's uniform without the zebra stripes.· It is his job to get the field officials' .attention to make them· aware.of the TV timeout.

Sinking the Fleet 
Sure, Navy 'is 7-0, but can they really be that good? Notre Dame coach Dan Devine had to assume that the Middies, indeed, were that good. He couldn't ignore the stark reality of the statistics that topped his desk: 
• 
Navy, number one in the na­tion in total defense while allowing only 158.1 yards per game. 

• 
Navy, number one in the nation in scoring defense while allowing only 5.0 points per game. ­

• 
Navy, number two in the nation in rushing defense while. allowing · only 57.0 yards per. game on -the ground. 


Now, Navy opponents like Con­necticut and William & Mary don't quite stack up with the Michigans and Southern Cals. But a 7-0 record is a 7-0 record-and only Oklahoma; 
·Penn State and Maryland could match it at this point in the season. Remember that unbeaten Pitts­.burgh team that Notre Dame came from behind to beat 26-17? Well, _Navy beat those same Panthers 
22 

21-11. Maybe those Middies are for 
real, huh? 

Well, then again, maybe they aren't. Notre Dame·1aid some num­bers on Navy like the Midshipmen hadn't seen all season: 
• 27 points (Navy had given up only 35 total points all year long, in seven games). · 
• 530 yards of total offense (Navy 
·had given up only 1,107 yards all year long). 
• 375 rushing yards (Navy had given up only 399 rushing yards all year long). 
Admittedly, it was a day on which nothing went right for the Middies and everything worked for the Irish in their 27-7 _victory before 63,780 _fans in Cleveland Municipal Stadium. 
And among the things that worked for the Irish, none · worked better than the rushing attempts of Vagas Ferguson. Notre Dame's junior half­back scooted over, under, around and through that vaunted_Middie defense for 219 yards, a Notre Dame indi­vidual single-game record. Navy 
by John Heisler 
hadn't given up 219 rushing yards to a whole TEAM in 1978. . 
And whose record did Ferguson break? It was Jerome Heavens, Fer_. guson's' backfield mate who eclipsed the Notre Dame career rushing stan­dard earlier in the season. 
"I looked up_ at the scoreboard when they flashed the note about the record, and a certain kind of feeling ran through me," Heavens said. "I knew exactly how he felt; and I went right over to congratulate him. There can be a whole lot of love involved when records like, this are broken, and I can't think of a more deserving individual than Vagas." 
Notre Dame wasted no time in 
taking the wind out-of Navy's sails. ,The Middies fumbled on• the -second play from scrimmage-wasting an impressive 36-yard scamper around left end,by Steve, Callahan on first down-and the Irish took quick ad­

by Mark Ladd 

To Irish football fans, Johnny Majors is no stranger. The mere mention of his name brings back ­memories of his Pitt Panthers' vie-. tories over the blue and gold in 1975 and 1976. But on this early Novem­ber Saturday he was found on the opposite sidelines as the head coach of his alma mater, the University of Tennessee, in hopes of leading his squad to a victory in this first-time battle between the schools. 
The Volunteers were coming into the game with a 2-4-1 slate· but th~ Irish were, nevertheless, leery as head coach Dan Devine stated prior to the game, "Tennessee hasn't been out of a single football game it-has played this season, and that worries a coach more than anything;·Elimi­nate a couple of turnovers at inop­portune times, and you could re­verse their record.

Four plays later, freshman full­back Pete Buchanan plunged in from the 2-yard line for his first TD in a Notre Dame uniform. Montana then passed to Pete Holohan for the two point conversion. That made the score ND 14, Tenn. 7.

• GEORGIA .TECH 
.T1111.

·.· The Georgia Tech-Notre Dame clash had become ·an especially bit­ter rivalry since Dan Devine took over :the· controls of the Fighting_ Irish. So the fact that both teams entered this game with· seven game winning streaks and bowl bids on their minds,only heightened the in­tensity that would be found "even if these teams were playing on a prac­tice field in the middle of nowhere," as the Irish head coach put it. 
The revenge factor was played up all week as Yellowjacket fans in­sisted on getting even for the em­barrassment they suffered at the h~ds ·of Notre Dame when their _ 
team returned from South Bend with a 69-14 loss one year ago. 
But Vagas Ferguson proved that talk really is cheap as he turned the right corner or{ the second play of the game and scrambled 68 yards to Tech's 6-yard line. While the Irish could only muster a Charles Male field goal, the tone.. for this game was set. 
Notre Dame never did score that first touchdown until they got• the ball with 11:16 remaining i_n the half. Once again it was Ferguson who did most of the damage as the junior halfback was on his way to 188 yards on the half and finished the afternoon with a record breaking 255-yard performance. Montana made tlie score 10-0 when he con~

"Now we have to get ready for an extremely talented USC team,'' :con.: eluded Devine. "We have come a long way since those first two games and that's a tribute to. these players. A win against the -Trojans would be. a nice ending,", 
Notre Dame had indeed come a long way, long enough to earn a re~ turn trip ·to· the': Cotton Bowl in Dallas. Upon their ·return from At­lanta the Irish found that they would be shooting .for a: · "nice ending" on,New Year's Day'against the Houston Cougars; the Southwest Conference Champs; . D 

·In the. stadium parking lot, as early as 10 a.m. on 
Saturday, the fans open their tailgate lunches, · ice 
chests, and start their pregame parties.. This, too, was 
the scene on November 18 in· Atlanta, right outside 
Grant Field. The event was the Notre Dame-Georgia 
Tech football game, and the mood was set. These parties 
are a kind of preparation by the fans for the upcoming 
ball game. The preparation begins quite a bit earlier for 
the players, especially the visitors. 
At 10:30 Friday morning, the Notre Dame football 
team, clad in green sweat suits symbolic of Irish luck, 
trot onto_ CarUer Field (behind the ACC) for their last 
workout before Saturday's kickoff. 
The players form lines for stretching exercises with 
the captains .out front as leaders. "C'mon, let's go," 
"Look alive,", are the words heard as the squad gets "in 
the mood." Merv Johnson, the assistant head coach, 
and team captains, Joe Montana, Jerome Heavens, and 
Bob Golie, lead the team in stretching. These exercises 
are 'especially important on the day before the game 
because a muscle pul! this late in the week is deadly. 
After stretching adequately, the players go to the side­
line for special team call-outs. Each special team, such 
as kickoff, punt, kickoff return, and punt return, are 
called out to see that everyone knows his place on 
these units. . . 
Next, the defense goes to one end of the field and 
the offense to the other for "time up." In this drill, the 
offense runs through plays against "air," that is, with­
out a defense. The defense, meanwhile, goes over as­
signments and keys it will use on the.next day. · 
This ·whole process. rarely exceeds twenty minutes 
and by 11,.the players are in the locker room getting 
ready for lunch. Steak' and baked potatoes are served 
in the North Dining Hall, and then .the players are free 
uritii' 1 p.m. when the bus leaves the A.CC for the air­
port. in this ·free time, the players pack their bags and 
dress for the trip. :·' · · . , · . 
"Notre Dame Is .Class and Class Is Notre Dame." At 
the school ~f Our Lady, a major stress'is put on sports­
manship, and actions to the contrary are in no way 
condoned. This class is further portrayed in the attire 
anif groon1ing of·the team members. The men are ex­
pected to be well~groomed at all times, and a "dress 
code" Is installed for all away games: Coat and tie, 
preferably a three-piece suit; are required for road trips. 
This attire. is worn on. the bus to .the airport, on the 
plane, and: on .the bus to the· hotei iii the opposing team's 
city. Most players look better ·than usual in their suits, 
but a few are a lot better-looking with their helmets on. 
·· The team is usually flown by a chaz:ter, and the en­
tire entourage consists of about 100 people. The players, 
who number between sixty to seventy, a squad of about 
twelve-cheerleaders, roughly ten coaches, and an official 
party .of about fifteen all board :the plane. The official 
party is usually headed by Father Edmund Joyce, and 
includes Athletic Director "Moose" Krause, ·other as­
sistants, •th_e team doctors, and the team trainer; The 
party is rounded out by the often-overlooked but ex­
tremely important student managers and trainers..

main course. Friday's meal is a pleasant change of pace from the dining hall food which is served to the team during the week. Contrary to popular belief, the train­ing table enjoyed by the players is the same food eaten by the students in the North Dining hall. 
.After dinner, team members usually have a choice of.seeing·a current-running movie or staying in their rooms to study or watch TV. However, in Atlanta, a heavy.rainstorm cancelled any plans of going out to a theater, so the players stayed in their rooms for a quiet night of books and television. Visitors are not permitted in the players' rooms on Friday night because there should be no distractions.. It is time to "put on your game face," as the players call it. This rule includes family; the· players' minds should stay on. the game. There is a curfew which usually begins 15 minutes after the buses arrive back from the movie; in Atlanta, it was 
10:30. ·This ·curfew is _serious and not just "in name only." . There have been occasions where curfew was broken and the player or players suffered the conse­quences,· which could be getting benched or being dis~ missed ·from the team. The coaches are dead serious about the players being in bed at the prescribed· hour, an~ the managers take bed checks to see that the rules have been complied with. 
. For a 1:30 kickoff, as in Atlanta, wake-up is usually at 8:30, where again the managers go around getting the players up.-Pregame Mass is at 9, and is said by the team chaplain for that particular trip. For Georgia Tech,·the -Mass was said in the Tara Room II by Father Conyers; It is a regular Catholic Mass with a sermon from the priest and Holy Communion distributed. Dur­ing Mass, the celebrant asks that all players (on both teams) stay free of injury, and that they all play to the best of their ability. He does not pray for Notre Dame to murder its opponent. Many times the players are told that God doesn't look down to see how ''His" school is doing, and then send a lightning bolt in the form of a Montana to Haines bomb. The men are reminded that God does not help them in the "time of need" (Well, maybe in the really big games). From Mass, the players go to pregame meal; again, the. Plantation · Room at Atlanta's Marriott. Steak, eggs, orange juice, skim milk and cereal, toast, and coffee are served for this meal. 

Next, the players attend.meetings in nearby rooms, where last-minute details are covered. The offense met in Tara IV and the defense jn Tara V for the Georgia Tech game. These meetings are short and just a wrap-up of the week's work. By now, the ,team is mentally, physically, and emotionally ready for the ball game, and the players are reminded again by the coaches that it is time to "put on your game face." · 
The players then get their ankles taped and retreat to their respective rooms for relaxation. Usually, tele­vision is the outlet used by the men to escape the tension that is building inside. 
At about 11:15, it is time to start getting back into the suit and pack for the return trip home, which directly follows the game. The players head down to the awaiting buses and load their bags, for they will not be returning . to the hotel. The buses travel with· police 
. -escort, which helps to avoid traffic jams, that·. could take away from warm-up time; Usual arrival at the stadium is. noon. 
There are quite a few fans already at. the stadium upon the team's arrival; and as was the case at Grant Field, their sentiments are made known loud and clear. The reception at Georgia Tech was unfriendly, to say the least. But, the players should and did behave prop­erly in the midst of this, . which is to just keep your game face on and continue walking into the dressing room. 
All the players have their own lockers in the locker room, with their gear hu·ng up and ready. The managers were there earlier and took·care of that. A·program of the upcoming game is placed in each player's· locker and he thumbs through it to relax. The team is· anxious to get on the field and get down to business. The waiting is the worst part for most. Butterflies, apprehension, and a certain feeling of urgency are all felt by the people in that locker rooin. The preparation· is over, the stage is set, and the players want to get on with it. · 
Finally, 12:45 arrives. That is the time for the Spe­
cialists to take the field for warm-up. Quarterbacks, re­
ceivers, snappers, kickers, holders, and kick return men 
stretch and practice their jobs until about 1, when the 
rest of the team joins them. At this time,· the entire 
team lines up for stretching as they did the day before. 
They go through their repertoire of exercises and then 
break off into their respective groups; such as receivers,. 
defensive backs, . defensive line, linebackers, offensive 
backs, and offensive Une. Here again, each group goes 
through its specific skills for about ten minutes. 
Thereupon, the whole team joins together at the ten­
yard line and the offense runs plays at the defense for 
timing, that is, without any contact. This lasts a couple 
of minutes, after which the players retire to the dress­
ing room. 
The team has ~bout twenty minutes. befo;e ki~koff. 
The players use this time. to "get psyched." Dave 
Waymer and Jeff Weston usually start off the verbal 
inspiration, and Jimmy Browner and Jerome Heavens 
can be counted ori. to chime in with supportive ·words. 
Most players prefer to remain silent' as away of prepar­
ing while·· Dave spurs the team . on with; "Let's· show 
them who's the best, and go home." Abouf five· minutes 
before kickoff Coach Dan Devine rounds tiie team up 
for a last-second talk, which emphasizes the elimination 
of dumb mistakes like fumbles, penalties, and busted as~ 
signrpents. He acts as the steadying . force for. the 
anxious men he is about to· lead into battle. The captains 
then go out for the 'toss of the coin and-'tbe' teain· is 
not far behind. · · · · 
The crowd cheers as the Irish take the field, at least 
they usually do. It was a somewhat different story ·at 
Grant Field. The jeering and booing seemed to act as an 
inspiring 'force rather than a discouraging one; ,though. 
At this point, it doesn't really matter, anyway; the team 
has worked hard all · week. and now :has • a chance 
to prove itself. The players huddle ; up around 
Coach Devine for· the prayer, then they.,are ready. for 
the kickoff. All eyes are on the football·set·on the tee 
as the kicker approaches. Those involved are poised. and 
set to do what they came to do, that is, give their best 
effort. It is a rigorous schedule the players. go through, 
but when .the game is over, they find that it.is usually . well worth it. D

The Whistle of Misfortune 
It was the 50th clash between the 
two great intersectional rivals. Going 
into. the game, the Irish were look­ing for their ninth straight win.• If victorious~ it would have· been only the second time since the '65-'66 
seasons that Notre Dame won·back­
to~back games. On the other hand, USC was .looking · for its sixth straight victory. Even: more appar­ent, hqwever, was: the Trojans' de­termi~ation ,to avenge last· year's embarrassment in South Bend. 
A.gigantic "49-19" in· large green 
numbers,· hung on the wall behind 
the receptionist's':'desk of Coach John 
Robinson's. office. · The USC Sports 
Information Office was a little. more 
imaginative. They literally cooked up. a recipe on how their· players could "stew" the Irish. The formula was · written on a poster that was placed in the front office so that all Trojans could see-and take heed. It 
read: 
Recipe: Don't mess around-can't have any fumbles,. no. spiking, no grabbing the face mask, but remem­ber to·cOVER'the holes: PROTECT the Quarterback, take the ball into 
the·end:zone·and SCORE!!! HOLD 
the offense and CHOP through the DEFENSE. Use · plenty of running speed._ . 
·Underneath:, the .recipe was pie.; tured a, kelly green kettle with the words \'Irish Stewed" on:.the front. Flames of cardinal and gold, USC's school colors, engulfed the kettle. 
On Saturday, for nearly.: three quarters, it seemed that the USC 
football team must have been major­
ing.in the culinary arts. John Robin­. son and his player-chefsfollowed the recipe to the last pinch of salt, and 
wound· up cooking a· hearty. Irish 
·"stew.Needless to say; the stew had a 
bitter taste to Dan Devine and his 
. . . 

crew. 
:But three· quarters a ball game does not make,, according·, to the rules of football. And no one is more aware of,that than Irish quarterback Joe.Montana. He has proven it'time and time again. In 1975; he . pulled out a 31-30 win over Air Force after

McDonald went to the air early and often. 


being down 20 points in the -fourth quarter. Just last year, he directed two come-from-behind thrillers over Purdue and Clemson; So being be­hind in the last quarter is nothing new · to Notre Dame's so-called "Comeback Kid." · · 
· This . time, •however, the deficit seemed · insurmountable. Entering the fourth quarter, -Southern Cal had a 24-6 lead and possession of the ball. After three quarters of play, all Notre Dame could manage were two field goals by their second-string kicker, Joe Unis. USC, however, seemed as though they could score at 57-yard bomb · to · split end Kris Haines. Haines, who had. his de~ fender clearly beaten; streaked down the left side, caught up with:the ball at the 15 and ran it in for Notre Dame's first touchdown of the day. Devine then called for a two-point conversion attempt, but •· Montana missed an outstretched Dave Con­deni -in the end· zone. Still, with the TD, the Irish had narrowed the lead to .24-12 with only 2:34 elapsed in. the last period. 
. The Trojans then drove all the way to the Notre Dame 38 but a fourth-and-16 situation, thanks to a 

will. In fact, the Irish were lucky · 15-yard clipping penalty,· stalled the that they were down by only 18. . drive. Robinson . reasoned· that he As if by instinct, though, Montana_ . was out of Jordan's field goal·range, 
onceagain rose to the occasion. With only two minutes gone in· the fourth quarter, USC's Frank Jordan had just missed. a 20-yard field goal at the culmination of a 96-yard drive that had carried over from the third quarter, After Jordan's miscue, the Irish took over with first and 10 at their own 20. 
Montana immediately went to the air and found his freshman tight end, Dean Masztak, for _a 23-yard gain. The · senior quarterback then let all the stops out as he cranked a. 
so he opted to punt. Marty King pro­ceeded to nail the Irish in with a 36-yard coffin corner punt which the USC specialists downed at the 2-yard line. The ·Trojans were prevented from scoring on that drive but they· had eaten up valuable time: 
Notre Dame was now: faced with a flrst-and-10 at their own 2, trailing by 12 points, with only 6:56 remain­ing in the game.. Montana had been there before, and just. like before, he came out firing. The senior from Monongahela, · Pa., completed passes 
31 



of 7; 18, 19 and 20 yards to Haines and a 17-yarder to Masztak as he drove his team to six fir.st downs and. another score. ·Montana made the last first down himself on a 15-yard run, taking the ball to the ··sc 3. Two . plays later, Pete Buchanan bulled over right guard for Notre Dame's secorid· touchdown. Unis made the PAT and .the Irish were now only down by five, 24-19, with 
3:01 still left in the game. 

The Notre Dame defense also rose 
to the task as they · proceeded to 
stop the Tropans cold; USC, after 
taking the kickoff, managed to gain 

only 5 yards in their first three 
plays. So, with fourth and 5 at their 
own 25, King was called in to punt. 

The Trojan punter then shanked. one 
out of bounds at the ND 43. 

The Irish now had good field posi­
tion but only 1 :35 remaining on the 

clock. To Montana, however, this 
was an eternity. The_ Irish quickly 
drove to the SC 12, aided by two 
Montana rushes, two receptions by 
Ferguson -one that went for 24 
yards and a first down~nd · an 

interference call against cornerback 
Carter Hartwig on a pass intended 
for Holohan over .the middle at the 
12-yarc;l line. 

With. first and 10 at the SC 12, 
. Montana missed Haines at the 3 with 
a pass that sailed out-of bounds but 
then connected -with -Masztak, .who 
· carried to the SCi2-yard line. Next,. on first ·and •goal· with 48 seconds . left in the game, Montana hit flanker Pete Holohan in the end zone for the go-ahead score, making it ND 25, 
SC 24. 

· The Irish ·oii.ce again'attempted a two-point conversion, reasoning that if they succeeded, a Trojan field goal could only ·force a tie. On the con­version attempt, Montana dropped back to pass but his receivers were · all covered' so he threw the ball in­complete. Still, with only 46 seconds left, it looked as though the Irish . were safe and the victory was in hand. But fate, an official's contro­versial decision, and the foot-. of Frank Jordan deemed it not to be. 
After. the Irish shook down. the thunder in the Coliseum, Paul Dilulo returned Steve Cichy's squib kick to the Trojan 30. Quarterback Paul Mc­Donald, on the first play, found tight end Vic Rakhshani along the side­lines -for a 10.:yard gain :and a first down. So, with first and 10 at his own 40, McDonald tried to go to the 
_air again. But". this , time Notre Dame's Jeff Weston broke through the SC pass protection and con­fronted McDonald head:on. The Ju­
. nior southpaw· pump-faked a-pass to try to el~de Weston, then tried to tuck the ball urider his arm to secur'! it from the eventuaL·contact. The ball, however, popped loose and Weston promptly fell on it. 
The -whole· Notre · Dame team ran onto.the field in celebz:ation of their 
. apparent victory; but joy quickly turned ·into confusion and even more· quickly turned into .disbelief, as the official, ruled that McDonald vyas at­temptingto pass and.thus it was not 
. Haines hauled in a 57-yard TD bomb. · 
a fumble but an incomplete pass. 
The disbelief turned into anxiety 
when McDonald threw a · 35~yard 
strike to split end Calvin Sweeney. 
USC now had the ball at the ND 
25 with 12 seconds left in the game. 
The Trojans had time for one more 
play before they attempted a field 
goal. So they gave the ball to -sure­
handed Charles White,· who ·ran the 
ball 5 yards to the extreme left hash­
mark of the· ND 20. Robinson then 
called a time out with six ;seconds 
showing on the clock and sent in his 
senior field goal kicker.. The Scot­
land bo~ Jor~an then drilled a-per­
fect three-pointed from 37 yards out 
to give Southern -Cal a 27-25 lead 
with only 2 seconds left The anxiety 
of the Notre Dame team had turned 
into agony and grief. 
Jordan kicked off to Tony.Belden 
who returned it 11-yards to the 43 
as time ran out. The Coliseum's-hex 
against the Irish survived the, chal~ 
lenge and remained· ··intact. · Yet, 
through :the ·first three,; quarters 
there seemed to be no doubt what­
soever that. the hex: would · work. · 
USC was in total control.· They were 
literally beating up on· the Irish; per­
haps grounding them . up · for the 
stew. · 
The Notre Dame defense had 
geared -itself: to _stopping. SC's all­
time career-rushing· leader,· tailback 
Charles White. In the first half, how­
ever, it was the passing of McDonald 
that took its toll on the Irish. The 
junior QB completed 10 of 18 passes 
for-163 yar.ds in the flrst·two quar.; 
ters alone as he shredded the Irish 
pass defense. McDonald finished the 
day. with 17 · completions on:29 at-· · tempts, good for 281 yards and 2·TDs~ It was not until the second.half that .the Trojans went to _the ground·game in order. to eat up the clock. They were successful with that game plan too as White wound up . with . · a career-high 205 yards on the . day, -averaging 5;5 yards over 37 ·carries . 
. With a 17-3 lead at the end of 
30: minutes of piay, ·it seemed as though the Trojans were'.. on. the verge of. blowing ·-the· Irish right out of the Coliseum. SC had '.:ac­cumulated 247 total yards' and 16 first downs to ND's . mere· 59 : yards and 3 first downs;-. First · downs-are ­usually a good iridicatioi1 of ·how · good or bad-things are.

of the game. It took Notre Dame till, their first play on their fourth pos­session·. of the game· to gain a first down. 
The Trojans struck first as Mc­Donald hit flanker. Kevin Williams with a 30-yard sc;oring pass. that split the Irish secondary. Jordan's PAT went wide right, but SC had the lead, 6-0. The Irish cut that in half, two possessions. and four min­utes later, when little Joe Unis sur­prised the 84,256 fans in attendance ' and a nationwide television audience as he booted a 47-yard field goal with only 43 seconds left in the first period of play. Unis' three-pointer would be Notre Dame's only first­half score.
s'c; on the other hand, kept piling on the points. With only 2 :04 gone in the second :period, McDonald hit flanker Dan Garcia on the left side with a 35-yanl touchdown pass. Mc~ Buchanan's score put the Irish within 5. Donald then made up for Jordan's

I've noticed that sportswriters often get caught up in an "ask me, I'm an· expert'' syndrome when, in actuality, their perspective on what in fact happens on the field is fairly limited. 
I mean, if you were to ask me who I thought was the "toughest player" to face the Irish this year, I suppose I'd have to go with Bob Leszczynski, because his name is so "tough" to spell-it's got two ."z's" and every~ thing. By what other criteria am I to go except by what other pseudo­experts have written? 
That's why I asked some key mem­bers of the 1978 Irish to let me in on who they thought were the besc players they faced this year. The results were not unexpected in some areas, quite unexpected in others. 
For instance, it didn't take too much insight to foresee that two­time All-American Hugh Green would be a shoo-in for one of the defensive · end spots. And, true to form, not a discouraging word was heard from any of the Irish offensive linemen. 
On the other hand, some of the other. results were enlightening and surprising. After all that has been said and written about Charlie White, one would think that he would not only make the Irish all-opponent 
-team, but that he might be on some pro team's all-opponent-of-the-future team; and, · indeed, · he collected enough votes to place· him among the top three running backs. But, surprisingly, the overwhelming choice at running back was. Miami's Ottis Anderson. · Out . of the-de­fensive players polled, Anderson was selected as being best by six. players, and as second best by the remaining
four.. _ _ · . ·· . My methodology was quite simple, really. On th·e line, I. let the guards; tackles, and ends select. whom they line .up against. No ~ne· is more qualified to pick , his own all~oppo­rient than. Jhe guy. who -actually got bruised ·up while playing him .. Receivers· .and t~ght ends were se­lected ·by · cornerbacks and· safeties ; ,linebackers, by quarterbacks, run~ . ning backs and tight' ends, and vice versa. In essence, the players most· qualified to judge an all-opponent at a certain position were ·asked to cast a vote. .

"He wasn~t that big, but ·cleaned house in· the· guard.. slots, he was strong and experien·ced • . i being mentioned by, · among others; he really knew what he was doing." Mike· Calhoun and Bob Golie • . • . 
For Irish defensive tackle Jeff neither of whom survived the South­Weston, it was "up for grabs" be­ern Cal game against.them; · tween Purdue's John LeFeber and '·'They're very --quick .· and very Pitt's Matt Carroll. "Both had un­physical;" ·commented·...· linebacker canny quickness for big men," he Golie, still wearing a'. brace from his explained; "but LeFeber will only be run-in. with Budde. "They know how 
a. junior next year, and• his experi-to come out on sweeps and blocks. 

They know how to c~t linebackers. 
They have good technique. Most 
linemen you can avoid easily, but 
not these guys." 
Middle linebac;kers Golie and Pete 
Johnson went with Tennessee's Rob­
ert Shaw as the outstanding center 
they faced this season. -... 
The top three running backs were 
chosen by a host of Irish players of 
varied positions. · Anderson and 
White dominated the first~ and sec-
ond-place slots, while mention was 

given to both Georgia Tech's Eddi~ 
Lee Ivery and Michigan's Harlan 
Huckleby. _ 
Golie listed Anderson as "the 

tougliest running back to tackle." · Cornerback Dave Waymer also com­mented that, "Ottis is just not in the right place to get the ink. If he were at USC; he'd be one of the best of 
all time.'' 

Irish fre~ safety Joe Restic dit­
toed.that, but cast a dissenting.vote 
for White; '.'If you took the line away 
from them an,·rd have to go with 
Anderson," -he ·said, "but judging 
from what White did against us, I'd 
have to ·go with him." 
·The'coveted·quarterback spot was 

dominated by Purdue's Mark Herr-: 
mann and Michigan's Rick ·Leach, 
with Eddie Smith of Michigan State 
receiving strong support, particu­larly from the linebackers. Herrmann ended up with a slight edge in the voting. "He's going to be · a ·superstar," prophesied Jay Case. 
Kellen Winslow _ (notably · Mis­souri's· only representative) had the slight edge over a slew of other tight ends mentioned by one. de­fensive player or . another.-Line­backer Mike Whittington and others also liked USC's James Hunter. 
· At wide receiver, Gordon Jones of ·Pitt and Calvin Sweeney of USC · were sure bets to run one and two' in the polls,_ as_ they did. Mo~t con­curred with cornerback Tom Gib­hons on the reason to give Jones the edge: "They both run good patterns, but Jones is a better blocker-that's the key." Dave Waymer selected the best quarterback/receiver . combinations. He went with; as he put it, "guys that have been working together for a long time," such as Navy's Bob Leszczynski to Phil Mcconkey combo and Michigan State's Eddie Smith to Kirk Gibson tandem.· · . 
. THE DEFENSE 
<Just, as the ·running backs were. chosen by -defensive consensus, the 
linebackers were picked by a num­ 
ber of offensive players. Michigan's  
Ron Simpkins was the · top vote­ 
getter, not unsurprisingly. South  
Bend native Kevin Motts of Purdue  
ranked second in this poll, just above  
Pitt's Jeff Pelusi. Pitt's Dave Logan  
and USC's Jeff Houghton were also  
mentioned by some players. ,  
Cornerbacks Larry Braziel of USC  
and Mike Jolly of Michigan topped  
a long list of cornerbacks mentioned.  
"Jolly's on you all the time," said  
flanker Pete Holohan.llYou justcan't  
shake him in the least."  
There were also a myriad of safe­ 
ties listed,· but _on top at free safety  
was Pitt's Jeff Delaney, and at  
strong safety, Michigan State's Tim  
Graves.  
"Graves was probably the hardest  
hitter of them all," remembered Joe  
Montana reluctantly. "I recall at-the  
toss of coin, I spotted him and  
thought he was a lineman; .Then I  
saw that he was wearing a 10 .and  
I thought, . 'Oh,· no! Here's a safety  
I've got to face that's 6-3 and 220!'"  
. Kris Haines .was in agreement for  
the most part, but pointed a warning  
finger toward USC's Dennis Smith.  
"He's young and kind. of inexperi­ 
enced-,-but ­he. still may . be one of  
the best SC's had for a long time.  
He hits harder, gets over to the ball  
quicker, and he has the best 'tools'  
of all of.them."  
Dennis Grindinger and Jim Haut~  
man insisted on Hugh Green as one  
of the linemen. No one disagreed.  
"He's one of the quickest guys· to  
get· away from ­the blockers," th·e  
Texan tight_ end Grindinger. com­ 
mented: "You can go•straight at him  
and he can avoid you. And when he  
drops back with you, he can run.with  
anyone."  
Tim Foley had the greatest re'spect  
for Purdue's Keena Turner: "He  
had the strength and the' 'quickness.  
You see a lot of them that ha:ve' orie  
or the other. He had both;"' ·  
Lineman 'Rob 'Martinovich picked  
Miami's Don Smith as· being the

One Fan'S Diary 
I got the idea while tramping through crumpled J:?eer 
cans outside Notre Dame stadium after the Missouri 
game. It.was an inauspicious beginning, but even in 
the pervasive melancholia of that losing Saturday, I 
thought it might turn out to be an unusual season. 
The sportswriters would, of course, devote thousands 
of words to it, no matter how it came out, but I thought 
it might be an interesting time to chronicle the periph­
ery, to take notes on how football in South Bend, Ind., 
impinges upon life on the planet. Joe Montana and Dan 
Devine might struggle within the crucible_ of big-time 
college 'football, but meanwhile popes would live and 
die, the dollar would rise and fall, Middle East peace 
would. fade in and out of hope, mothers-in-law would 
make their annual local visits, and storm windows 
would. beckon. 
,. ·1 resolved to keep _a diary that eschewed weighty 
commentary on the game itself and concentrated in­
stead on the personal footnotes that document the ex­
perience of football in South Bend. It is one fan's diary 
about one team's season. 
. September 9 _:__ Mi.ssouri 3,. Notre Dame O . 
The season begins too early. It seems to· sneak up on 
everyone, as though a smelt run had ·caught us asleep, 
with flashlights and nets still packed away. It appar­
ently came as a surprise, . too, ·for an •US magazine 
photographer who, called late Friday to make arrange­
ments to do a photo feature for The New York Times­
owned magazine on the campus football weekend .. "Is 
there an'y problem?". he asks. "Where are you?" I reply. 
"In Louisville," says he. "That's your first problem," I 
comment, "getting here... it turns out to b_e hot, very 
hot. Traffic ,moves smoothly as my wife and I head to 
the Ramada Inn and. WSBT Radio's Bob Lux pregame 
interview show. I~asked if football determines giving; 
and I eagerly answer, contrary to popular wisdom,. no. 
Notre Dame successfully completed the first of its mas­
sive _capital gifts campaigns in .the teeth of its worst 
football-times, ·and surveys 'show alumni give to endorse 
the school's Catholic.character and academic excellence 
rather than ·us athletic achievement. (After they give, 
they do, however, want tickets.) Later in the afternoon, 
I am glad.to own that historical perspective. On a field where the/ temperatures reached 100 degrees, Missouri ' beat the' Irish,. ?-0. I recall the Mizzou upset on this same field in 1972, when Father Edmund Joyce, Notre Dame's executive yice . president, had been gracious ·. enough .to do. a · class thing-;-visit the victors' dressing room and congratulate them.on a stunning triumph. I look for SO!l}eon_e _from Missouri to whom to be gracious, but none is around; I am left sweaty in Section 10, frus­trated i,n v'irtue: At the University. Club, after the game, everyor1e _is drinking beer in thirst. and vacant disbelief. Later, _at _Father Rober:t _Griffin's _5:15 -Mass in Sacred 
by Richard W. Conklin 

Heart Church, he gives heart to the uninitiated in the overflowing crow:d, wilting underneath Gothic arches, by saying he is skipping the homily. Veterans .in the congregation know "Griff" will make up the time in his catechesis of the children whom he invites to join him at the altar. But it is good on this day to be reminded by liturgy that there are_ traditions older than Rockne, that quarterbacks and cornerbacks will. die· and worms will eat them while the Word is preached to yet another group of sinners, despondent in defeat. 
September 23-Michigan 28, Notre Dame 14 
This is a game made in accountants' ledgers as well as in sportswriters' hype. Two natural rivals, two teams reaching for the golden ring _of national supremacy, two great universities with substantial gates in sold-out stadia, now back in contention before regional television~ The opening loss to Missouri, however, mutes the media buildup; in Chicago, the Bears' opening victories have distracted the sports buff. At home, disappoint~ent is assuaged by memories· of 1977; one loss does not a season destroy. Indeed, Notre Dame gets a one-point spread on the bettors' line, presumably for home. field advantage. Tickets, once going for outrageous sums, are now closer to face value ... and more plentiful. Notre Dame stumbles in the second half and loses, 28-14. The Michigan fans in the stadium _are happy but not ob­noxious. This is a game between neighbors down the bloc~, not next door, Michigan State is next door. Be­sides, . these ~ichigan fans have been there. and .back; they, too, have tasted great victory and sour defeat and · can afford magnanimity. At the University Club, a pro­fessor remarks. wryly on the campus'. "earliest return to academics in several years." ·ABC-TV will send a film crew to campus to interview Notre Dame students on the season's shocking beginning. ''What do you think of two opening losses at. home?!'~ one will be asked. jjI 
hadn't noticed," he will respond'. Beautiful. 
September 30---, Purdue 6, Notre Dame 10 .. 
My wife has been given a ticket to the Chicago Lyric Opera's "Salome," and I pass our Purdue seats on tc:> two of_our children. They normally inherit this largesse only in the wake of a N~vember snowfall and are incredulous as they clutch their prized tickets on a fair-to-middling f~ll day. Iwatch from a box high above the field on the 50-yard line. It is the one place in the stadium where plays unfold with the clarity with which they are cre­ated on coaches' blackboards. The "X's" and the "O's" are without identity, ebbing and flowing with a move~ ment that cannot be seen from field or stands. At half­time, I munch barbecued chicken and begin to think my wife might have.chosen the better part-"Salome," after all, has that dance of the seven veils, while I am watch­ing down linemen from afar. Notre Dame eventually wins, 10-6. It is not an artistic victory but is certainly better than losing. The press-box elevator is stuck, send­ing me scurrying down the stairs to a parking lot tree where I rejoin two happy children. Not everyone will share the mood. A Houston alumnus sends a letter the following week about our stadium · commemoration of the death of a pope. "I sat," he writes, "in the northeast corner of the stadium, and my view of the playing field was greatly limited by the American and National Championship flags at half-mast. I am sure that Pope John Paul I would not have wanted his death to cause a football fan to enjoy less a game the fan can -afford to see only every few years." 
October 7-Notre Dame 29, Michigan State 25 
I never travel to away games. I explain to hardy chartered bus riders that my liver is barely able to take the home games. There is no television for this game, and if Notre Dame does not win it, there may not be television for next Saturday's game against Pittsburgh. ABC-TV is not eager to feature a 1-3 team, and it has held up confirmation of the scheduled telecast of Notre Dame-Pitt until after the Michigan State game. The autumn color is late, due to a warmer-than-normal September, but the weather fronts, spun off from a Canadian high over the Upper Midwest, move rapidly across the weekend sky. Interest in the game is so-so, and many South Benders react to the hint of winter by reluctantly plunging into belated yard work. I catch the last 44 seconds as we head with friends for that great Michigan winery, Tabor Hill. We have scheduled a tast­ing, something to put down against the coming cold, as it were. Later that evening I sip Baco Noir and indulge in a favorite pastime-watching a tape-delay telecast of a precarious Notre Dame football game, secure in the kn_owledge that, however bleak the situation might ap­pear at .any given moment, the score is irreversible. In this case, Notre Dame 29, the Spartans 25. The win_e is good for my liver ... and the score for my disposition. 
October 14 -Pittsburgh 17, Notre Dame 26 
· The day arrives sullen, washed by a light rain. We confront the dawn because ABC, unwilling to go head­to-head" with the-fourth game of the World Series, has set an 11:40 a.m. kickoff, alocal record. I think of the kids in California, turning on television about 9:45 in the morning and finding that Spiderman has been pre­empted by Frank Broyles. We have a number of guests for the game, who_ drive in from Chicago to have a Bloody Mary at 9:30 a.m., too early even for that brunch concoction. The whole day is eerie. At the sta­dium, the public address announcer is giving those ­meaningless Bucknell and New Hampshire first-quarter scores from the East during a third quarter here in the Midwest. Somnolent for much of the game, Notre Dame hears some sort of alarm clock, scores three times in the third quarter and wins,· 26-17, awakening the crowd in the process. We feed our guests, who turn westward on the _toll road about the time we are gratefully abed -at 8:30 p.m., another local record. The South Bend Tribune driver, who drops off iny son's Sunday papers, awakens me (as usual). by slamming his van doors. But there is something different-he is whistling. Ah, sweet 
victory! -· 
October 21-Notre Dame 38, Air Force 15 
The long-awaited color has now washed over North­ern Indiana in waves of gold and .red and brown. This russet day had long been marked on my calendar as "storm window Saturday," and it thankfully arrives in Indian summer warmth. Perfect for my task, I gather the wooden ladders, the soap bucket, the glass cleaner, the paper towels, the screwdriver, putty, trim paint, weather-stripping and portable radio. My father, who throughout most of his life changed storm windows on our family house, always told me never "to work up two sweats where one will do," and that is why I come prepared for any eventuality. (Some future archeologist, in a time when the very words, "storm window," have slipped from the language, will dig up these artifacts, my tools, and write a definitive monograph on a fall ritual of an older, declining civilization.) I ani wrestling with a window marked in crayon, "Ricky's BDRM. over Den," when Notre Dame first scores on 'my radio. I scramble down in time to peer through the den· window and see. the replay on television. During most of the second half, due to careful scheduling, I ·am cleaning these very den windows arid visually follow the· action, seeing the Irish win decisively, 38-15. On Sunday, the tape-delay of this game will pre-empt the tape-delay of Pope John Paul II's Inaugural Mass; Our priorities are in order again. 
October 28-Miami o, Notre Dame; 20 

This is a must game. Not for the opposing coaches, but for me. My in-laws· are in town, and a · loss will mean an extraordinarily long weekend. The first hurdle is cleared Thursday night, when the Minnesota Vikings upset Dallas on national television. (The Twin Cities are home to us all. My family has kept its Vikings bumper sticker in place despite quizzical looks_ by passersby in Scottsdale's parking lot. As for my father-in-law, he ·not only comes to town in deep depression about Fran Tarkenton, but also is suffering from a case ofshingles only slightly less painful than the Vikings' rushing aver-' age.) ·Our neighborhood is alive with the brilliance of a soft autumn that refuses to relinquish its hold on our psyches. My in-laws rise early on Saturday and wander down to the Farmer's Market to buy coffee cake ·and apples; their suburb has no such place· arid is the less for it. On this day, their experience at the Farmer's Market might well in retrospect have overshadowed the footbal_l game, which does not create much interest where we are sitting. We are amidst hard-to-please Irish fans who know a clear victory when they see one, but are as dis­
·-cerning about style as a baseball crowd in Fenway Park. At one-point in the fourth quarter, when Notre Dame has picked up its second obscure penalty for illegal of­fensive use of hands and everyone is w<mdering why the official-is walking the yards off,_one wag yells,· ''Fifteeri yards for being .dull." Notre Dame wins, 20-0: 'Next year's game will be moved from a sparsely populated Miami Orange Bowl to Tokyo, Japan. Reflecting on the recent news that the-dollar against the yen_ is worth about half what it was 30 years ago, I mentally hope both teams have stipulated the payoff be in local cur~ rency. And I also hope someday a sociologist will ex­plan why, after years of kidding· my wife about her 

• 1 

mother's compulsive cleanliness in the anticipation of company, it is I ·who cleans the top of the refrigerator before our in-laws' visit. ·

November 4 ....:_Notre Dame 21, Navy 7 
Navy is -undefeated in the East and ahead of Notre Dame in the polls as both clash in Cleveland. But the talk in .South Bend bars and barbershops is still about the glorious weather, the fall that lingers deliciously,. giving us a deservedly gentle reprieve from the memo­ries of a brutal winter. The 400-mile rule has prohibited broadcast television,.but closed circuit is set up in the ACC. I haul out the lawn sweeper. and attac_k the_ leav­ings from three maples, three Chinese elms, a Russian mulberry, a pear tree, a ponderosa pine and shrubs too various to detail. I burn leaves once a year-mainly_ for the odor and .the memories-and this is the day. But I 
.am worried about this game and afraid to listen to it on the radio: I stoke the leaf burn and tune in Purdue 
. versus· Northwestern. Down the alley a crewinstalling a new fence has Mutual Radio on very loud, and the voices of Al Wester and Ralph Guglielmi cascade over the neighborhood. The Irish win handily, 27-7. Also this weekend, ~y daughter-makes her concert debut playing cello for the South Bend Youth Symphony, and Anwar Sadat rejects a $15 million _bribe from Arab states and continues to pursue peace with Israel. 
November 11-Tenneessee -14, Notre Dame 31 
He is an anesthesiologist from Newport Beach, Calif., whose malpractice insurance premium is more than my yearly income. He has a continuing education seminar in Chicago and has dropped down to South Bend to take in his first Notre Dame game. We met two dozen years ago at a melting pot Christian Brothers high school into which Minneapolis funneled all its Catholic elementary youngsters. Our group came to re­fer to itself as the "Big Ten," and to recall us now is to count three physicians (an internist and a radiologist, in addition to my visitor); two attorneys (one tax, one corporate); two graduate-trained physicists (one in in­dustry, one retired from the Navy), two residents of academe (one professor of English and one publicist), and a bank examiner. My friend and I have not seen each other for 13 years, but he looks not much different than the tuxedo-clad person in my wedding party pho­tograph. We wander through the pregame· ca}Ilpus, listening to the Marching Band's concert and watch­ing the inspection of the Irish Guard. It is a reflective time; two 42-year-old men walking in the fallen leaves of their youth and recalling innocence in tranquility. Later, the dammy hand of winter arrives in the stadium just as the home season ends in an Irish victory over Tennessee, 31-14. We are driving home when I see the Corby Corners trail of litter from Friday's "Death March," a last act of deviant immaturity by which Notre Dame seniors acknowledge, by getting drunk, that growing up is· a sobering experience. Well, let them have their curious rite of passage, I think. They will soon enough be taking quiet walks in dead leaves.

lam on the road and gnawingly aware that I do not khow_what is really going on in the world; The New York Times, only recently back into print, has not yet reached the distant hotels and airports on my schedule, and "Good Morning, America" shows me Cheryl Tiegs learning disco dancing. Interesting kinetics, but not ·exactly a substitute for understanding the linkage prob­lem besetting Israeli-Egyptian negotiations. The local . newspapers' sports pages are devoted to figuring out the bowl picture arid are befuddled. The only thing I learn is that Notre Dame will not play anyone on Christmas; this is about equal to the level of insight gleaned from Cheryl Tiegs'. disco dancing. I finally reach Dallas where the father of a close friend, called to ascertain the best local Mexican restaurant, assures me his concern will be doing the Notr~. Dame team's laundry for the fourth time. (he has had the concession every time the Irish have been in the Cotton Bowl), and alumnus Joe Haggar (of the slacks firm) talks expectantly of another Irish appearance..! believe.neither. Later in the week, I.watch Notre Dame beat Georgia Tech 38-21 and then incredu­lously hear the Orange Bowl pair Oklahoma and Ne­braska for a rematch. Nothing comes through on the Cotton Bowl, and I finally call a friend to learn what a Dallas launderer and a Dallas clothier have already told me. And an airport bus driver, who said, "Buddy, if the Southwest Conference champion is Houston, they'd better match 'em with someone who'll turn TV dials."

"Classic," and for the 43rd annual event which featured Notre Dame's thrilling 35-34 comeback victory over Houston, that label more than fit the bill. Cotton Bowl officials went so far as to say that the '79 Classic .. was the greatest in the history of 
One

the event. If not that, then it was certainly the most bizarre. How else . would you describe a game in which:

39,500 people decided not to show. tip for a game they had paid $12.50 ·each to.attend; the first six scores by Mike Kenahan came as the result of turnovers, and the winning point was · scored with . four goose eggs on the scoreboard where the time used to be displayed? 

The weather deserved much of the credit for making the 1979 . Cotton Bowl Classic one to remember.· Tem­peratures during the game hovered around 20 degrees above, with a windchill factor of minus six de­grees. Cotton Bowl historians quick­ly proclaimed that the wind, cold, and ice combined to form the worst weather conditions in the history of the Classic. 
Moreover, the weather's effect on the play was more than significant. Icy patches on the artificial surface made it tough to negotiate cuts and slants on the run. Near frostbitten fingers made it. difficult, if not im­possible, to throw the ball accurate­ly, to catch the passes that were on target, or to grip the ball with any assurance once in· possession of it. Thus fumbles and interceptions marked the style of play through­out most of the game. 
If there was· any hint, outside· of the weather, as to how different this game was to be, it was the coin toss at the start of the game. Notre Dame won the toss and elected to go with the wind. This left the op­tion of kicking or receiving up to Houston. When-they chose to kick off into the wind this confused every­one. So much so that after several specialty team changes and field position changes, the Irish and Cougar kickoff units would up fac­
. ing each other on the field. Houston Coach Bill Yeoman explained that, "We wanted to kick all along. And after they took the wind and we said kick, it confused them." 
. Soon things were finally .squared away and Houston kicked offto the Irish to start the 43rd annual Cotton Bowl Classic. Randy Harrison made things happen right away as he re­turned the kickoff 56 yards to the Houston 34-yard line.• After three running plays Notre Damewas faced with a fourth-and-one · situation.'

holding that meeting was a big mistake and I should 
have bee_n smart enough to know that. The sharpness 
that we had wore off· by the time ·we met a Dorsett­
led Pittsburgh team in Pittsburgh. · 
After the Panthers got off to a big lead, mostly be­cause of Dorsett's brilliant individual performance, the Irish again rallied. Rick Slager marched the team the length of the field against the wind, scoring on the last play of the third period by hitting Ken MacAfee in the ·corner ofthe end zone. It looked like another great rally but on our. next possession a screen pass that was set up beautifully, and would have resulted in a score, failed to· materialize because the back catching the screen slipped on the wet surface and forced us to go for a: field goal. The field goal was missed and Dorsett followed with a long run to put the game out of reach. Even. after this defeat the team was under bowl consi~eration, but on Sunday the players indicated they were nrit interested. Had the vote been taken the next day Jt would haye · been a unanimous vote to accept. 
However,-the team did go on to finish with a fine 32-9 · victory at Miami: ·· The '75 season had its up and downs and so did '76. Joe Montana sat out the '76 season because of a shoul­der separation ·and major surgery. The highlight~ of the '76 season were the 23-0 vic­tory over Purdue, the 24-6 win over Michigan State and a great victory over:Alabama when Rusty Lisch came off the bench in the last few minutes to preserve a hard­earned 21-18 .win over Bear Bryant's Crimson Tide. 
Again, the Southern California game was a bitter dis­
appointment ·when the Fighting_ Irish rallied in the 
second haif to outplay_ and outscore their opponent. 
With Montana out for the season wlth a shoulder sepa­
ration, Lisch .replaced an injured Rick Slager and did 
a splendid job. The defense played well; however, a 
number of' critical d_ecisions went against the young 
Irish. 
The season ended with a 20-9 win over Penn State 
in the Gator Bowl, agame which helped considerably 
the drive for the National Championship in 1977.·Play­ing in the Gator Bowl was a new experience for Notre Dame, although in the past a Gator Bowl bid had been . accepted by the coaches and then voted down by the 
· players. All in all it was a 'very profitable and beneficial experience. There was no interference with classroom work or exams because all the practice was conducted after exams were completed. 
The story of the 1977 season is one of love and to­getherness. A very close football team rebounded from a second-game loss to Mississippi in Jackson and_ reeled off 10 straight wins and won the National Champion­·ship. Along the way was the comeback at Purdue, and the birth of the "green_ machinf: ·in one of the most spirited games ever, a 49-19 win over _Southern Califor­nia. Then came the invasion of "death valley" at Clem­son, and the raily in the fourth period to win. 
Notre Danie, indeed, was fortunate to be· matched with undefeated and nationally ranked Texas in the Cotton Bowl.

Prognosis.· '79 
. . As the .1978 football season began to wind down Irish football fans cast a. gazing eye on who would be coming back for Notre Dame in 1979. A surface glance might be cause for undue panic, but when the entire situation is examined, a carbon copy of the 1978 squad niay be returning.. It will be a squad with question marks. in several key areas and prove.:i performers· in 
others.,_· . · . The high-powered positions will be manned by per­sonnel who have been backup players so· far in their careers. It ,vill be along time before a quarterback with the talent and. leadership qualities of Joe Montana will lead the green andgold. It now seems that RustyLi~ch and Tim Koegel will battle it out in spring practice for 
the right to face Michigan· in the 1979 opener. . ·off-season practices will be crucial to find a replace­ment for Kris Haines at wide receiver. Dave Condeni, 
Tim Tripp and possibly Pete Holohan will inherit tliis job~ . . . . . . ..·.. . . -: ' . , . The .offensive backfield will sorely IIJiss the often 
. overlooked talents of Jerome Heavens: The quiet and methodical way Heavens <lid his job was sometimes lost on ·1:he 59,075 unless No. 30 was able to break afew long runs during. the. afternoon. But.the backfield has talent 'to work with for '79. Vagas._Fergtison will be getting All~America notices. even before he carries'for the. first time next season. Pete Buchanan and Dave Mitchell will be able to provide the piledrivirig fullback that a successful ·''I" offense has to have. When Fer­guson tires, look for Jim Stone to pick up right whe're Vegas stops. The junior-to-be from Seattle should come 
· into his own with more carries. 

Tom Domin should be back for another year. His · experience will be· invaluable at the flanker back spot, · which was ably filled by Pete Holohan in 1978. If Holo­.han moves to wide receiver, Domin will be the man to .beat out for the flanker. Other backfield hopefuls in­. elude Tony Belden, Ty Barber, Steve Dover and Mike 
Courey. 

. Up front the Irish will miss the All-American blocks of Dave Huffman, but that niay be about it. The of­fensive line will be the most experienced group of re­turnees; Tim Foley should be making All-Everything teams at tackle, while Rob Martinovich will be much ·better·with another spring practice session. The guards . 
will be solid with Ted Horansky returning for his extra ;year along with talented Tim Huffman. Ron Mishler, Jeff Crippin and maybe John Leon will battle in the ·spring to succeed the guy with the red elbow pads at 
'center. · 

Going into Jast season a replacement for Ken Mac­Afee was a top priority. It turned_into a gold. mine when Dennis Grindinger, Kevin Hart and Dean Masztak

. Defense was to' have. b~n a sore spot ori the '78 
team, but orice again foes found· it difficult to run 
against the Irish. You can't go out'a.n'd pick a Golie:' arid 
Heimkreiter off the linebacker bush each recruiting 
season, but the defense for ·next year will'have talent. 
Jay Case,· John Hankerd, Scott ·zettek, Tom Wro­
blewski and Hardy Rayam all have game experience, but 
where to play them on the front wall will take most of 
the spring to find out. A healthy Zettek will do a lot to 
help the matter. Look for Joe Gramke,' Pat Kramer 
and Ken Muncy to press for starting jobs.'· 
· The shoes of Golie and Heimkrefrer are awfully. 
large for any player to filL But linebacker coach George 
Kelly has a knack for finding ·the right mari for the 
right job. Mike Whittington and Bobby Leopold·. both 
have starting experience and wiil be looked to for 
leadership on the ·•79 defense. As a freshman, Bob 
Crable was a top-notch special teams performer. He -should get his shot 'at regular duty next 'season. . During the National Championship season of 1977,

A divine_ly inspired Waymer returns with. experience. 
the defensive backfield became .the top unit in the coun~ try. Once again .the •importance of a cohesive group behind the linebackers will be important in 1979. Tom Gibbons and Dave Waymer are.the returning starters and the experience they gained in '78 will be all-im­portant to the success of the secondary. Replacements for Joe Restic and Jim Browner must be found. On the surface it a.ppears that Steve Cichy, Dick Boushka, 
· Rick Buehner and Angelo Fasano are the probables. ·. 
Irish fans found out how important the kicking ganie_is in 1978. Chuck Male sat ,out a year in his transfer process from'··western Michigan and could 
· come back. Male's consistency during last year is a definite plus for 1979 preseason prognostications. The schedule is once again tough, but nowhere near the meat grinder the. '78.squad had to endure: .

When Joe Lazzara moved fron:i across the street, selling his home to his daughter. _and· son-in-law, our ritual of football television watching together d'Yindled drastically. But· we .renewed it for the Southern Cali­fornia game. I have mellowed a lo~ since·the New Year's Day in 1971 when, cheering Notre Dame en route to a 24-11 Cotton Bowl upset of Texas, I leapt from my seat in Joe's old living room, stabbed my finger painfully against his ceiling and _came down in a bowl of popcorn. Joe, however, is still the excitable Italian. Bythe end of the first quarter,. he has fired Dan Devine· five. times and lost $50 in his office pool because of a 47-yard Joe Unis field goal. The furious Irish comeback in the fourth period caught us unawares, but I had adepressing feel~ ing in my craw, even with only 46 seconds remaining and Notre Dame ahead_ by one poirit. The endingis too painful to recall even now, but I did not have to be saved by the higher ceiling in . Joe's new television den. I swallowed a scotch hard as· the game ended 27-25 in favor of the Trojans. At least we could go to the Cotton Bowl with our heads up. O ·· ·

There are mariy thrills from the 1977 season that I will never forget. The students and the team liked the green jerseys, so green ·was worn the rest· of the year, straight through to the winning of the National Cham­pionship. That spring;a great pep rally was held honor­ing the team and a National Championship banque_t was given for the squad later on. Both affairs were first class and typica~ly Notre Dame. I would be remiss if I didn't mention_ that the loss of four offensive starters during the summer had both a physical and mental effect on our team.-The loss of Al Hunter, who at that time was the only back in Notre Dame history to gain 1,000 yards in one season, was particularly traumatic to our. ball 
club. · · · To me, the 1978-·squad is truly remarkable in its ability to overcome adversity; The Irish played: the toughest schedule of any university in the United :· States, a schedule which included seven bowl teams and Michigan State, a te~ of bowl caliber unable to play because of:probation. Struck by a series of injuries, they· showed steady improvement· throughout the_year even though these injuries prevented the continuity that normally is needed todisplay_ improvement. . This team demonstrated qualities of raw coura"ge, character, dignity, poise and manliness, particularly iri bearing up well under the painand anguish o{the dis~ appointment at Southern California. With anumber of key players either sidelined or operating at less than peak efficiency, the offense led by Joe Montana put ·on a dazzling and heroic display in the fourth periocl. Just when it seemed the darkest, the Irish dug down deep and came up with oneof the finest efforts ever seen on a football field. The defense stiffened and the special teams played with reckless abandon. Many of u~ will

Huffman: Rich Dimler of USC. "Dur­. ing the game, he will try to knock your head into·the ground, ~ut when 
. you walk off that field, you know that's where it's going to stop," he remarked.. "He's really a class guy -a super guy," Huffman further ex­pounded. "I've played· against him for three or four years now, and he's the best. He always does just what he has to do." Younger brother Tim Huffman agreed, and outlined his rivalry with _ ·Ron· Simpkins, another linebacker selected. "He's very strong and tough to get under. He's quick and he's difficult to block.· And he can really deliver a blow," added Huff­man. "We never had any words on the field-he just knocked me on my butt a few times." · You can argue with the reasoning ·of_ a · sportswriter, but··· you can't argue with that. . Nor can you argue with Head Coach Dan Devine when he gives the all-opponent honors to Coach War­ren Powers of Missouri: "He came into a new situation, -. and although· he inherited excell_ent material, in-., · eluding several All-Americans, . he welded them into a ballclub that had to play teamsJike Notre Dame, Ala~ bama, Nebraska; Oklahoma-and_still

Another .huge factor contributing greatly to the success of the '78 team.was the fact that no one got -· down oil the ball club 'after losses to two firie football teams, Missouri and Michigan, in .our two opening ball games.
