My foray into politics was short-lived. As a newly headgear-less 13-year-old, I, like most of the students in my class, ran for 8th grade student council. I wanted to be sports and activities commissioner. Sports have never been my forte and to this day I have no idea what sorts of activities grade school students were supposed to be planning, funding or commissioning, but I did know that everyone elected got a special pin and mumbled an oath in front of the entire school. I would be running unopposed, so my lack of athletic ability shouldn't have been an obstacle, either. 
I was well-prepared and gave what I'm sure was a moving speech in the "debates," but at the last minute Lexi threw her hat into the ring, as well. Sure, as a starter on the basketball team she may have been more qualified and her mom may have been the one who always brought the orange slices to soccer games -well-enjoyed by those of us who spent most of the time on the sidelines -but we all know what student elections really came down to: the posters. 
I had drawn my own (it should be noted that there is a reason I didn't run for art commissioner), but she got her artistic high school-aged sister to make hers, and they had glitter. I never stood a chance. 
Elections should be about more than the posters and, with that in mind, Scholastic brings you its annual election issue. Turn to pages 15-21 for candidate profiles and Scholastic's endorsement. May you be better informed than my former classmates were.

T eSoci two 

An Essay by Chris Milazzo 
My life before Facebook was sad. I had fewer than 20 friends, my relationship options were limited to dating and not dating, and only my classmates knew where I went to school. 
Now, I have over 300 "friends" -still a paltry number, I know, since some of my "friends" have over 1000. Everyone knows where I go to school, my major, interests, favorite bands, relationship status and so on. 
I am not a social butterfly, so itis wonderful­to have an outlet to learn about someone without having to ask questions. Now, I can simply press a button and whomever I want, with their permission, is my friend. 
Thankyou, Facebook-I am finally social. 
Dramatic? Perhaps. But honestly, Face book is a brilliant piece oftechnology that perfectly accomplishes its goal:· keeping you in touch with your social network. 
For the most part, you probably met your friends before adding them on Facebook. That, in fact, is what distinguished it from other social networks when it first appeared online. You had to know the people to find them on Facebook, and they had to acknowledge that they knew you as well. 
It was and is exclusive, and, in this way, theoretically mirrors your real-life social network. Your friends on Facebook should be your friends in class, in the dorm and at home. 
Yet as the social network grows older, I cannot help but think that the mirror has faded. Look at your friends list. Ask yourself, "How many of these people have I only met once?" or "How many of these people do I only see now and then?" If you are honest 
with yourself, I suspect the number is in the 
hundreds. It is for me, at least. 
You might say that some are long-lost friends and Facebook lets you keep in touch with them. I agree; I have those friends, too. I will, however, venture to guess that · the majority of communication you do on Facebook is with friends you see everyday. I bet that sometimes they are in the room with you when you post on their walls or comment 
on their statuses. 
None of these things are inherently bad. 
As I see it, Facebook is supposed to be a 
supplement to a "normal" relationship, 
whatever "normal" mi°ght be for you and 
your friend. Yet, the more avenues we have to 
connect with Facebook-apps, texts, online 
-the less of a supplement it becomes. 
Facebook has become a full-blown social 
avenue -a social animal in and of itself. 
When you can access your page from 
anywhere in the world with almost any device, 
it is hard to distinguish where Facebook ends 
and real life.begins, particularly when how 
you define yourself, in Face book's very limited 
terms, is public. 
This might be insignificant for your close 
friends, but for people who have just met 
you, the image they have ofyou on Facebook 
could be very different from how you actually 
are. Without the personal aspect, your 
comments on Facebook can give your friends 
a very different perception of you. Was that 
comment sarcastic? Does he or she like me 
if they post on my wall a lot? Why was I not 
invited to this event, but all my friends were? 

Who you are becomes a game of favorite movies and TV shows, comments and likes, events and groups. While these things are all pertinent, are they the totality ofyou? Ifthey aren't, do your Facebook friends know that? 
· If, for example, you saw that someone you recently befriended on Facebook listed "liberal" as his or her political affiliation, and you were a conservative, or vice versa, would you be more likely tojudge him or her negatively? Perhaps I'm cold, but I think I would. 
Even with the friends I see regularly, I have had countless conversations where the subject is something that happened on Facebook. I find it hard to believe that I am alone in this. (No one has tl1e relationships status talk? "Did you see so and so is single now?" Been there.) 
You might say that no one takes Facebook that seriously, but how true is that these days? 
Perhaps the best example of the simplification of you, however, comes in the form ofan employer. Ifyour future or current employer saw your Facebook page, ,would their perception ofyou match what they saw in your interview? 
I realize this is not true for everyone-and that you might disagree, but, thankfully, no one can comment on this.

How to Spend Valentine's Day Alone 
Rachel Kalinoski
Yes, it is that time again. With Valentine's Day just around the corner, many want to have someone special to share it with. But if you start daydreaming about that boy from economics, or if that girl from NDH starts to look like a desirable date -stop! There are plenty of ways to make your Valentine's Day alone ... not that awful. In fact, these alternatives are so appealing, some ofyou committed ladies and gents might want to get in on the single life. (See: "How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days.") 
vl7·.·••·••···•·· 
Go Shopping Guess what, girls? Being single means you didn't just LJ spend $60 buying your boyfriend that epic new video game that he loves more than you. And guys, you didn't just waste your paycheck buying those expensive chocolates that will add a little cushion to your girlfriend's hips. This means enough money to pay for those new kicks! (Or 
0.1 percent of this year's tuition.) o:)') Buy Yourself Flowers People who see you oh-so-casually walking to L6 every class with them held above your head will assume you have Mr. 
'""7 Right wrapped around your finger. In fact, you may get so used to the jealous stares from other girls that you start to believe y~m actually do have a secret admirer. 
'3) Avoid Twitter and Facebook Unless you liJse reading how many years, :/;!) months, days and hours your acquaintances have been dating, steer clear of the constant, emotion-loaded status updates about the best presents 
ever or the fancy restaurants where they will be dining. #singlesunite 
117 Go to a Dorm Party Let's be real: The single greatest self-esteem /Z'.J J boost is walking into a crowded, sweaty dorm room and knowing that --U at least 10 people there are desperate, drunk and about to become your "best friend." Who cares if they are wrongly convinced those spastic dance moves are seductive? (Hint: Zahm) 
~ Go See a Priest Looking for other singles on campus? You can find at ;J} least one in each of the dorms who's willing to swap absolution for some 
great stories about the single life. Just look up service times -Mass is held 124 times per week across campus, so you'll never have to be alone. Not only is church a great place to pray and find peace, but a priest will always be willing to listen to you sob about being alone. It's OK. Jesus was single, too. 


Too Big for St. Mary's 
Keenan Revue comes to Stepan Center 
Meghan Thomassen
Getting a hold of junior marketing and psychology major Grayson Duren and junior finance and classics major Chase Riddle, director and producer of the Keenan Revue 2011, is difficult to do. The students, who were chosen to put on the Revue last spring and have been working on it since the fall, say the show sold out even though more tickets were printed this year. For the 4,300 peopfe wh~ did get tickets, the Revue will run in the Stepan Center from Febr.uary 10-12. Duren and Riddle say that the jokes will to be cleaner this year, despite the show's removal from St. Mary's O'Laughlin Auditorium last year and its title, "Too Big for St. Mary's." They say that Father Dan Nolan, Keenan's rector, helped by suggesting subtler, smarter ways of executing the same jokes that each skit wanted to make. "He's been very forgiving. He knows that in order for 20-year old men to get up and entertain. a college campus, they have to ~alk about what they think about most -homework," Riddle says. Duren and Riddle did not reveal much about the skits, but they say the show will feature the traditional stripping scenes and Keenan Revue News. Senior marketing major George Pinchock, a Keenan Hall resident and Revue participant, describes the Revue News as a '"Saturday Night Live version' of Notre Dame news and culture. "The goal is basically to annually entertain campus enough to brighten up the permacloud," Pinchock says. Due to the number ofauditions this year, the Revue selection team had over 49 skits to choose from for the approximately JO-skit show. Other than the two staples, each Revue skit is completely original. Pinchock says that some writers were rumored to have sent their drafts to '09 alumnus John Siegel. Known by many as "the godfather of the Revue," Siegel helped shape the show into what it is today. • "It's a tradition," Duren says of the nearly 40-year-old Revue. For those who missed the sale date, Duren and Riddle say that there are still some Keenan men looking to give away their extra tickets. 0

The South Bend Music Scene's . 


. 
Julia Steiner Top-ranked academics, a beautiful · campus or a true sense of community -all reasons students might choose to go to ND. Perhaps never has the reason been a thriving South Bend music scene. Whether the aggressive coilcertgoer or i:he casual "pay for my ticket, and I'll i:hink about going" type, many Notre Dame students seem to be removed from a common coilege pastime: going to concerts. Various groups on campus are attempting to change this state of affairs, including the on-campus nightclub Legends. The club's general manager, Aaron Perri, says the club is advertising its "best lineup ever," including Dan Deacon, Super Mash Bros. and comedian John Mulaney. In addition, students have frequent opportunities to hear live music at the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center (DPAC). The performances at DPAC, however, generally do not fit into the indie or alt/rock genres that many college students tend to favor. Despite signs of a growing music scene on campus, many students say they are disappointed by tlj.e opportunities, or lack t?ereof, to see condFrts off campus. ~ubkirke aims to reach out i1 students and improve i:he South Bend musi scene. Freshman Program f Liberal major Chris Collum says tha 

Potential Saving Grace 
and Outreach David Banga and Pastor Mark Roeda, Subkirke (a play on the acronym for The South Bend Christian Reformed Church, or SBCRC) is a concert venue in a church. At Subkirke, indie artists perform in what freshman science-business major Alex J aniw remembers as an intimate and special setting. 
"The audience sits in the pews of the sanctuary, and the performers play where. I would assume the altar is normally," she says. 
Transforming SBCRC into a an indie music v~nue arose from the "motivation to provide outreach to college students," Banga says. "Despite the number of colleges near South Bend and the city's strategic location midway between other Midwestern cities and college towns, Subkirke remains one of only two .venues that hosts [indie bands] on a regular basis, the other being Legends at Notre Dame." Banga says that he hopes "to attract a lot of students and demonstrate that our church is a great place to hear bands. 
"There have been around a dozen concerts so far, the first in October 2009 with Samantha Crain and the latest in November 2010 with Damien Jurado and· Sh~~rwater," Banga says. Beth Tocular ofthe band\BowerBirds says i:hat she "loved playing Subkir e, and we especially enjoyed utilizing the gian chu~ch organ in i:he back." The group's frof , ·an, Phil Moore, says, "This 
music scene "doesn't seem to be·i:hatgg:iiree:1ti'rr---vem:re,'l'nnt,rz-ii'~>ll.!ldd_please come back to· all

i:hat the most effective ~ritreach is found in ·· meaningful relationships, whether they be with God, other people, a place, or a certain song or sound." He says that most of the bands that play the venue are not Christian. 
Graduate student and philosophy TA Chris Porter is a member of the church that .. houses Subkirke and an usher at the concerts. 
. . 
He says. i:hat Banga's vision has come together. Porter says the S. Carey show in September 2010 "was really amazing because of the way that album is. It's filled with so much space and ambiance, so imagine you're in the sanctuary and the. music just starts to fill that space ... We all kind oflooked at each other and though, 'This is really happening, and it's happening here."' 
Students can experience live music in this unique setting with a concert lineup including The Low Anthem;" who provide "gorgeous chamber-folk," according to Paste Magazine. A mere 1.1 miles from campus on North Hickory Road, Banga says he hopes that Notre Dame students and· those from other local schools will come to shows and make Subkirke a standard in South Bend for its concerts and low price. 
"People should · feel cared for," Banga says. "Whether they're performing or in the audience; we want people to enjoy themselves." 0

DEPARTMENT OF DROP IT LIKE IT'S HOT 

I never expected to see Snoop Dogg and Club Fever on the same 
flyer. Let's be honest ­ there are a few shocking things about this  
announcement.  
First,  no one comes  to South Bend. Ever. There are  the few  

occasional headliners that are convinced to come to Notre Dame, but even those usually aren't that exciting. Sister Hazel or Ryan Cabrera, anyone? Regardless of what's happening at Notre Dame, in the actual city of South Bend, there is no music scene. 
Second, the idea ofa concert at Fever is mind boggling for anyone who has frequented the blackout box that is Fever on Thursday nights. Fever makes me think of drunk girls, high heels, dollar shots and cage dancing. It does not make me think of Snoop Dogg, though on second thought, I can see how he could fit into this picture. 
Third, I didn't know that Fever existed on Wednesdays. Some tradition that started before I was at Notre Dame dictates that Fever should be frequented on Thursdays and Thursdays only. All other days at Fever belong to some sort of twilight zone not to be entered by the Notre Dame crowd. 
So you can imagine my surprise when, during the last week of winter break, I heard via a slew ofFacebook statuses that Snoop Dogg was coming to South Bend to perform at Club Fever on a Wednesday. I happened to be with several of my friends from Notre Dame when I heard the news, and we immediately decided to buy tickets. The concept of Snoop at Fever was just too tempting to turn down. (I should mention that at this point I did not realize the tickets were $45.) 
Fast forward two weeks. I was back in South Bend and partied out from syllabus week. In the whirlwind that was Kildare's, Club 23, Corby's, Oyster Bar, Fever, Finny's and Finny's again, I had nearly forgotten about Snoop Dogg. The initial excitement over a rap legend coming to South Bend had worn off, and I almost regretted buying the ticket. Regret is not something that I like to deal with, though, and I found myself getting ready to go to Feva Feve on a Wednesday at6p.m. 
The tickets said that Snoop Dogg would come onstage at 8 p.m. Thatseemed a little on the early side, but my friends and I didn't want to miss any of the concert, so we decided to play it safe and arrived around 8:30. The line for Fever was long, as it typically is, but it was different than the usual Thursday line because I didn't recognize a single person. Luckily, we already had our tickets and were able to skip the line and enter through the door to the Backstage Grill. (For those ofyou who don't know, Fever is attached to a restaurant. I wouldn't trust the food there.) 
We walked through the basement and up the stairs to find a sizeable crowd already there. After grabbing a few drinks and finding our friends, we went to stake out a spot near the front of the dance floor and started our wait for Snoop Dogg. An opening act started soon after, featuring the musical stylings of some 15-year-old boy. Once that ended, we expected Snoop to promptly take the stage. Snoop, however, had other plans that would delay him until 11 p.m. In other words, for almost two hours, it was like a regular Thursday at Fever, except for the lack of cages, the plethora of townies and an unusually pungent. Just when the crowd was becoming unbearably restless, Snoop finally emerged and the whole bar erupted. He was blinged out, as they say, with a diamond necklace, diamond microphone and a giant diamond ring reading "Snoop Dogg." Plus, he was wearing a Michael Floyd jersey. And, ofcourse, Snoop rolled with an entourage that was a true cast of characters. 
After this three-hour wait, Snoop encouraged all of his South Bend homeboys to "Drop it Like It's Hot" and sip on "Gin and Juice" for all of 45 minutes. Within this short time frame, Fever was transformed into a different venue, one resembling some West Coast Snoop-groupie club. It was over almost as quickly as it had started. 
For $45, I was able to experience this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of seeing Snoop Dogg at Fever. I bet you wish you were 
there, too.  0

Defensive Day 
Madeline Stone 
Brian Kelly led the Irish to a solid 23-12 win over Purdue in his much­anticipated debut as head coach. The Irish were 16-21 over the previous three seasons. Opening the season with a win over their Indiana rivals proved to be just the energy boost they needed. With the win against Purdue, Notre Dame coaches improved their record to 26-3 in their debut games since 1896. Kelly celebrated the win with his team but acknowledged the undertaking ahead. "We've got some work to do. We are not there yet, believe me ... but we took a step today and we are going to keep pounding at it and working at it," he said. The energy from the crowd was important for Kelly in his first game at Notre Dame Stadium. A sea of green shirts greeted him as he ran out of the tunnel -and onto the historic field for the first time. "I think the one thing that stood out to me today was the crowd obviously was into it, and it was a great advantage," Kelly said. The game was also the first start for junior quarterback Dayne Crist. Crist completed 19 of 26 passes for 205 yards and

NOTRE 
a touchdown. 
"We were all making our debuts today. It was a completely new field ... We all shared that together and it was a great victory," Crist said. 
The Irish adapted well to Kelly's fast­paced spread offense. Senior tailback Armando AUen's 22-yard touchdown run put the Irish ahead early in ~he first quarter. Two field goals from senior kicker David Ruffer and one field goal from Purdue's Carson Wiggs brought the halftime score to 13-3. After another touchdown, this time on a 5-yard reception by freshman wide receiver TJ Jones, the Irish held a commanding 20-3 lead. 
The Irish lead was briefly threatened at the beginning of the fourth quarter after Allen was tackled in the end zone, resulting in a safety for Purdue. Purdue scored soon after with a 23-yard run by quarterback Robert Marve. Marve's dive into the end zone, however, earned Purdue a penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct and hurt the team's field position. The Irish lead was reduced to eight points, bringing the score to 20-12, but Purdue's offense never got 
DAME 23, PURDUE 12 
another chance to score. Ruffer's field goal with four and a half minutes remaining secured the Irish win with a comfortable 11-point lead. 
Allen finished with 93 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries, including a 38­yard punt return that helped set up the t~uchdown by Jones. Sophomore tailback Cierre Wood rushed for 58 yards on seven carries. Junior wide receiver Michael Floyd added 82 yards on five receptions, which included a 34-yard catch that likely would have led to another Irish score if not for his fumble on the 2-yard line. 
Kelly's new · and improved defensive scheme was strong arid consistent, with four sacks and two interceptions against Purdue's Marve. 
"I think all of the guys are very focused on making sure that we enjoy the win but ... [that we] continue to get better," Crist said. 0

It was deja vu for the~ Irish as they fell to the Michigan Wolverines for the second year in a row. "[vVe were] obviously incredibly disappointed," said junior quarterback Dayne Crist, who was out for part of the first half with an eye injury. Although the game's outcome was not what the Irish players or fans had hoped for, Notre Dame gave Michigan a run for its money after coming back from a 14-point halftime deficit. The Irish had a strong start in the first quarter, opening with a Crist touchdown and a successful extra-point attempt by senior kicker David Ruffer. The Wolverines, however, dominated the rest ofthe first half with sophomore quarterback Denard Robinson, whose game stats totaled 28 carries for 258 yards and two touchdowns. Crist's early touchdown ended with a hard fall that left him with blurry vision for the rest of the half, requiring the Irish to bring in1 backups freshman Tommy Rees and junior Nate I Montana. This was the first time either saw game time and head coach Brian Kelly said "I did a poor job ofpreparing them." After Rees threw an interception, the Wolverines finally scored when Robinson threw a 31-yard pass to sophomore wide receiver Roy Roundtree. Later, the Wolverines quickly moved down the field in a 1:06 drive to score their second touchdown of the quarter with running back Stephen Hopkins' I-yard stretch. 
Both teams' defenses made strong showings in the second quarter. Finally, with 3:40 left in the half, Robinson scored on a record-breaking 87-yard touchdown. Montana responded and led the Irish down the field with the help offreshman receiver TJ Jones, who caught three passes. Sophomore receiver Theo Riddick then grabbed a pass for 3 7 yards down to the .Michigan 3-yard line. The half ended ,vith Notre Dame narrowly missing a touchdown pass. 
Kelly's half-time pep talk fired up the team, and the Irish dominated the third quarter. "His message was to just play for four quarters. He talked about not worrying about the scoreboard and to just play hard. He wanted us to remember there were still two quarters left," senior tailback Armando Allen said. 
Early in the half, Notre Dame took advantage of field position at its own 47-yard line, after a weak 21-yard kick by the Wolverines. With Crist back in the game, the Irish wasted no time and immediately connected for a 53-yard pass to Jones fora touchdown. 
After .Michigan once again failed to convert a first down, the Irish drove down the field. With two long completed passes to junior wide receiver Michael Floyd and two rushes by Allen, the Irish were on the Niichigan 7-yard line. They had to settle, however, for a 24-yard field goal by Ruffer to bring the Irish within four points of the Wolverines. Michigan failed to score in the third quarter after freshman kicker Brandon Gibbons missed a 39-yard field goal, the first of two misses during the game. 
The fourth quarter was a brutal back and forth battle between the two teams until the final four minutes. The Irish scored on a 95-yard pass to senior tight end Kyle Rudolph, who led the game in receiving with eight passes totaling 164 yards and one touchdown. Ruffer scored the extra point to put the Irish up 24-21 over the vVolverines with 3:41 left in the game. 
.Michigan drove the ball down the field for the next three minutes, scoring on a 2-yard run by Robinson and a good extra point to put Niichigan up 28-24 with 27 seconds left in the game. Crist and Floyd responded by storming down the field in hopes of scoring to beat the vVolverines. In the final seconds, Crist threw an incomplete pass out of tl1e end zone, resulting in an Irish loss. 0

Losing in Lansing 
MICHIGAN STATE 34, NOTRE DAME 31 

Meghan Thomassen 
The Michigan State Spartans snatched a road victory from the Fighting Irish on Sept. 18 in overtime. Setting up for a field goal, Spartans senior punter Aaron Bates made a 29-yard toss to senior tight end Charlie Gantt, bringing the final score to 34-31, a disappointment for head coach Brian Kelly's first away game. "A difficult loss, obviously," Kelly said. "It came down to one play. Michigan State executed the play and we did not." The game looked promising for the Irish when senior kicker David Ruffer broke the tie in overtime with a 33-yard field goal. But Spartans coach Mark Dantonio called a fake play, titled "Little Giants" after the film of the same name. Bates received the snap with the play clock almost out, stood up and waited until Gantt was open for an easy touchdown. "We knew Notre Dame wasn't going to be expecting that," Bates said. "That's the last thing anybody was expecting." The 3-0 Spartans made up for a 33-30 loss last season at Notre Dame. Junior Fighting Irish quarterback Dayne Crist threw for 369 yards. The Spartans stuck mostly to running the ball, passing 274 yards and rushing 203. Notre Dame had the lead at 28-21 with 13:20 left in the game, after Irish

junior wide receiver Michael Floyd caught a 24-yard pass from Crist behind two defenders. Floyd previously scored in the first quarter on a 7-yard pass from Crist. 
Both Crist and Michigan State junior quarterback Kirk Cousins threw interceptions that kept the first half low-scoring. In the second quarter, Floyd fumbled only a few plays after picking off a pass from Cousins in the endzone, giving the Spartans the ball on their own 11-yard line. The Irish managed to force a punt in the second quarter, putting the ball on Michigan State's 27-yard line, but Crist threw an interception that eventually led to the Spartans' onlytouchdownofthehalf. Traveling 94 yards in seven plays, Cousins found wide receiver Keshawn Martin in the end zone with 
2:22 left in the half. 
Game statistics were evenly divided between the Irish and the Spartans. Notre Dame had 28 first downs while Michigan State had 26. The Spartans, however, covered 477 yards while the Irish covered 461. The Spartans also had two turnovers, leaving Notre Dame's total possession time at 25:36 and Michigan State's with34:24. 
The Spartans were able to tie it up with 
7:53 remaining in the fourth quarter with a right sideline pass from Cousins to junior wide

receiver BJ. Cunningham. They maintained a consistent running game until sophomore running back Edwin Baker ran for a 56-yard touchdown just 30 seconds into the third quarter. 
The Irish quickly responded with a IO­yard pass from Crist to junior tight end Kyle Rudolph after moving the ball 74 yards in six plays. But with 5:51 left in the fourth quarter, the Spartans completed another running touchdown, gaining the lead at 21-14. It wasn't until 1:29. remaine~ that sophomore wide receiver Theo Riddick caught a Crist pass for a touchdown, tying the game again. 
Adding to the difficulties that the Irish faced that weekend, Dantonio suffered a heart attack the next morning. Age 54, he was hospitalized in East Lansing for three days. He made a full recovery after undergoing surgery to have a stent implanted in his heart. Doctors say that Dantonio had felt some_ symptoms earlier ·in the morning, and that the stent would restore proper blood flow. 
"We fell short," Floyd said in his post-game interview. The Irish entered the season with high hopes for to new head coach Brian Kelly. With this loss, the Irish record was 1-2. 

STANFORD 

STANFORD 37, NOTRE DAME 14 
Clara Ritger
Stanford's victory over Notre Dame left 
the Irish season looking bleak. For the 
first time since 2007, the Irish were 1-3. 
Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck, a talented junior who last month turned down his projected No. 1 NFL draft pick to finish his last year of school, threw a statistically mediocre game, but even that did not pave the way for an Irish victory. 
Luck threw his first two interceptions of the season against the Irish, but in three turnovers Notre Dame walked away with only a field goal. 
Junior Irish quarterback Dayne Crist sustained a tough match, throwing for a total of 304 yards, yet the Irish did not make their first touchdown until six minutes remained in the game. 
Stanford head coach Jim Harbaugh recognized Crist's strength. "He plays with a lot of poise, really good stature in the pocket, sees the field extremely well, gets the ball out very quickly," he said. "He's an accurate, decisive quarterback. He's a heck of a competitor, too. You saw that today. He took some shots. Never lingered on the ground, adjusted any pads or anything. He popped right back up and kept firing it. He's outstanding." 
The offense was Notre Dame's biggest weakness that Saturday. "We battled, but we didn't play as well as I would have liked on the offensive side of the ball,'.' Irish head coach Brian Kelly said. The Irish offense struggled to make the most of third downs and lost multiple opportunities in the red zone. 
"Stanford's a fine football team. All you want is an opportunity in the fourth quarter with a chance to win. We were within striking distance and weren't able to convert in a third and fourth down situation, which effectively ended our chance of winning that football game," Kelly said. 
Kelly lauded the efforts of the defense. "Our defense played good football," he said. "[Sophomore linebacker] Manti Te'o was all over the field. He's a guy we can push out and model." 
Te'o made a career-high 21 tackles. "We all did our jobs. We were in the right [gaps]. I don't count my tackles, I just do the best I can. It doesn't matter if I have a hundred [tackles] ifwe don't win," he said. 
The Irish started the game strong, taking a 3-0 lead over Stanford early in the first quarter. It was the first time all season that Stanford had trailed in a game. 
Stanford recovered and took the lead near the end of the first quarter. Senior tight end Coby Fleener made "a [heck] of a catch," Luck said. Stanford stayed in the lead for the rest ofthe game. 
Stanford's Owen Marecic, a senior offensive and defensive player known to play the majority of the 60-minute games, stood out among the Cardinal's top players of the day. 
"He's the perfect football player," Harbaugh said. "You've just got to take your hat off to him and enjoy watching him. I sure do." 
Marecic scored midway through the fourth quarter -twice -to seal the game for the Cardinal. His plays were a mere 13 seconds apart. 
Notre Dame had not lost to Stanford at home in seven games. 
Despite the loss, Kelly's opt1m1st1c comments at the end of the game proved true by the end ofthe season. "There's going to be a lot of 1-3 football teams across the country," Kelly said. "Some are going to finish 1-11, some are going to be 8-or 9-3. It's what you decide to do from here on out. There's going to be success down the road for them if they stay with it, and I'm certain that they will."

Notre Dame entered its matchup .against Boston College mired in a three-game losing streak and on the heels of a blowout loss to Stanford. But the Irish didn't allow their recent struggles to affect their performance, cruising to a 31-13 victory against their Holy War rivals. Junior quarterback Dayne Crist quickly led the Irish to a 21-0 first quarter lead, which demoralized the Eagles and silenced the home crowd. Crist threw for two touchdowns and rushed for a third, all in the opening quarter. "Just to get the offense rolling early was big for us," Crist said. ""\,Ve know how this team can play. We know the potential this team has and where we can go . . . Guys are happy, jumping around the locker room, and it's a great team to share it with." Freshman return man Bennett Jackson jumpstarted the Irish, giving them great field position with a 43-yard return of the game's opening kickoff. After senior running back Armando Allen's 30-yard run brought Notre Dame all the way to the 7-yard line, Crist gave Notre Dame the lead with a touchdown run. After the defense forced back-to-back three­and-outs, the Irish took over at their own 41­yard line. Crist connected with junior wide receiver Michael Floyd for 18 yards on third and 
28 I SCHOLASTIC I 10 FEBRUARY 2011 
seven to keep the drive alive and bring Notre Dame to Boston College's 23-yard line. A few plays later, Crist found junior tight end Kyle Rudolph in the back of the end zone to give Notre Dame a 14-0 lead. 
The Irish defense refused to let Boston College generate any momentum, forcing a quick punt on the Eagles' next possession. Notre Dame took over at its own 28-yard line and quickly marched down the field for its third score of the game, with the drive lasting just 2:22. Floyd's 35-yard reception set up Crist's 20-yard touchdown pass to sophomore wide receiver Theo Riddick. With the score, Notre Dame extended its lead to a comfortable 21-point margin. 
The Eagles managed to get on the scoreboard late in the first quarter when freshman quarterback Chase Rettig connected with freshman wide receiver Bobby Swigert for a 58-yard touchdown strike. It would be Boston College's only touchdown of the contest. 
Two field goals by freshman kicker Nate Freese trimmed the deficit to 21-13 and made it a one-score game in the second quarter. But senior kicker David Ruffer booted a 37-yard field goal on Notre Dame's next possession to pad the lead, pushing the score to 24-13. 
Notre Dame's defense shut out the Eagles in the second half, and Allen scored on a 2-yard run in the third quarter to put the game out of reach, 31-13. 
The victory marked Notre Dame's first road win against Boston College since 1998. "We're happy. Happy, happy, happy," Kelly said. "Everybody's happy in Notre Dame-land. Our players wanted a win." The Irish improved their all~time record against the Eagles to 11-9 with the·win. 
Notre Dame's defense dominated the Eagles from start to finish. The Irish held Boston College to just five net yards rushing. "They came in here and licked us -schematically, physically, and in every way," Boston College coach Frank Spaziani said. 
Junior cornerback Robert Blanton and senior safety Harrison Smith each hauled in an interception for the Irish, who improved their record to 2-3 with the victory. 
The game was a homecoming of sorts for Kelly, who grew up in the Boston area. "I think the 100 or so people I got tickets for probably had a great time in the tailgating lot," he said, "but for me, it was about getting the football team a win. We really needed the win." 


The Start of a Winning Streak 
Calie Mohamed 
Fallowing an impr~ssive win at Boston College, the Irish came home to Notre Dame Stadium and defeated the Pittsburgh Panthers 23-17, beginning their first winning streak of the season. Senior kicker David Ruffer made three field goals, extending the longest streak in school history to 16. The Irish defense also delivered a strong performance, ·holding Pittsburgh to one field goal in its first three trips to the red zone during the first half. After the Panthers' successful opening drive ended in a field goal, the Irish offense responded with an explosive first half, scoring a touchdown on their second possession of the game with a 1-yard pass by junior quarterback Dayne Crist to junior wide receiver Michael Floyd. On Pittsburgh's next possession, the Irish defense prevented a touchdown and forced a failed 27-yard field goal attempt. A strong running game fueled the offensive drive down the field, ending in a 10-yard Crist carry for a touchdown. "It was just an opportunity that presented itself. Uabaal] Sheard is a great defensive end," Crist said. "[He] was really disruptive all game. He is a really good player. When the play broke down, it was huge, and it just 
NOTRE DAME 23, PITTSBURGH 1 7 
happened." 
Pittsburgh's next drive ended after five plays when senior safety Harrison Smith intercepted the pass at th~ Notre Dame 40­yard line and returned the ball for 15 yards. 
After a 37-yard pass from Crist to freshman wide receiver TJ Jones, the Irish could not make it to the end zone and Ruffer kicked a 32-yard field goal. Pittsburgh made a final attempt to score before the half, but junior defensive end Kapron Lewis-Moore recovered a fumble to halt the play. 
"We have a developed attitude of 'We're going to keep you out ofthe end zone,"' head coach Brian Kelly said. "You may get three on us, but we're going to keep you out of the end zone ... I think more than anything else, they're developing an identity that we may bend a little here and there, but we'll keep you out of the end zone." 
The Panthers began the second half with an unsuccessful fourth down conversion, enabling the Irish to start their drive on the Pittsburgh 35-yard line. After several stagnant offensive drives, Ruffer connected on a career-long 50-yard field goal. 
The ball changed posession several times before Pittsburgh's successful 77-yard drive resulted in a 4-yard touchdown rush from sophomore quarterback Tino Sunseri. In the beginning of the fourth quarter, Notre Dame exploded with a 69-yard drive that featured three Crist passes to Riddick for 41 yards, catches by Floyd and junior tight end Kyle Rudolph, and rushes by Wood and Allen. The drive ended in Ruffer's third field goal of the game. 
Pittsburgh's next possession lasted only three plays, resulting in a 56-yard pass by Sunseri to sophomore wide receiver Jon Baldwin for a touchdown. 
The rest of the game was a back and forth battle between the two teams, neither making it into the opposing team's red zone. At the game's conclusion, Irish players were elated to have won two consecutive games for the first time that season. 
Floyd said the game gave the team a newfound belief in its ability to win. "Having positivity on the field, making the right choices and catching passes gets everybody motivated," he said. "We don't doubt ourselves as a team anymore. We know that we can succeed and come out with consistent victories." 0

WESTERN MICHIGAN 


Julia Steiner 
IBfway through the season, with the ish at an even 3-3, fans who filled otre Dame Stadium on Oct. 16 had a winning record in their sights. The boys in blue and gold provided just that with a 44-20 win over the Western Michigan Broncos. Notre Dame was coming off of two wins, including an impressive victory at Boston College two weeks prior. After a 1-3 start to the season, Notre Dame was poised to reclaim a winning record once again. The stadium remained quiet, as many students chose to forgo watching the game in person to travel for fall break. There was more room to spread out on the bleachers and fewer arguments about the "true location of Row 34." All the elements seemed to be in place for the Irish to take back a winning record as the stadium roared a singular "GO IRISH" to start the game. Notre Dame opened up its passing attack immediately. On the first play, junior wide receiver Michael Floyd caught an 80-yard touchdown pass from junior quarterback Dayne Crist. Floyd had recently missed some playing time due to injury, but it didn't stop him from making his comeback. Floyd's powerful presence on the field carried the Irish offense along in the game, and Irish head coach Brian

Kelly said he planned this strategy from the start. 
"There was a focus in our game plan to make sure we were creating opportunities for [Floyd]," he said. Floyd's resurgence could not have come at a better time, as junior tight end Kyle Rudolph was sidelined with a season­ending hamstring injury just days earlier. 
Notre Dame kept the offense going, scoring 20 more points by halftime, including an explosive touchdown option-pass from junior receiver John Goodman to Floyd. Crist also scored a rare rushing TD from nine yards out The defense, however, allowed Western Michigan to score 17, giving the Irish a slim IO-point lead as they entered the second hal£ Western Michigan tailback Alex Carder's rushing touchdown with 15 seconds left in the half made Notre Dame fans anxious about the rest ofthe game. 
Following what Kelly called "a little chat" with his players during halftime, Notre Dame came back in the third and fourth quarters motivated to pull out a win. They did so defiantly, outscoring Western Michigan 17-3 during the rest of the game. Floyd continued to dominate, finishingwith 157 receiving yards and three touchdowns. Sophomore tailback 
WESTERN MICHIGAN 20 
Cierre Wood also lit up in the second half, 
running for 94 rushing yards including a 39­
yard touchdown burst. 
The Notre Dame defense improved 
noticeably in the third and fourth quarters, 
forcing the Broncos to punt on five consecutive 
drives. Western Michigan's only substantial 
drive of the second half was its last: a 70-yard 
systematic push that resulted in a field . goal, 
the Broncos' only points of the half. The 
ND defense gave µp a mere 102 yards in the 
second half, compared to 212 in the first hal£ In 
addition, Western Michigan had four turnovers 
in the game, while Notre Dame had only one. 
Asthe game ended, Irish fans celebrated a 44­
20 victory. Bronco's head coach Bill Cubit said 
that his team's loss was due in part to Floyd's 
dominating performance. "He's as physical and 
as good a receiver as I've ever seen," Cubit said. 
Overall, Kelly said the team played a good 
game. "In the second half we played the way 
I expect -our team to play for four quarters," 
he said. "Our players are learning -learning 
how to play football games, regardless of who 
the competition is." With Irish coaches, players 
and fans happy, the team was poised to keep 
winning and winning big.

Not A Victory Yet 
Matt Formica
The Midshipmen routed the Irish, 35-17, at the New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ, ha~ding Notre Dame its third loss to Navy in four years. The Irish defense looked helpless against Navy's triple-option attack. The lVIidshipmen racked up 367 rushing yards, the most ever against Notre Dame. Navy emphasized the -inside run by junior fullback Alexander Teich and tweaked its blocking scheme, which befuddled the Notre Dame defense. Teich carried the ball 26 times for 210 yards, becoming the first fullback in Navy history to rush for over 200 yards in a game. Senior quarterback Ricky Dobbs also contributed to the l\tlidshipmen's performance. Dobbs rushed for 90 yards on 20 carries, including three touchdown runs. He added a passing touchdown as well. "It was amazing," Dobbs said of Navy's offense. "Very close to perfection." Notre Dame's offensive attack was anything but perfect. Junior quarterback Dayne Crist struggled, throwing two costly interceptions when the score was still close. Crist finished 19 of31 for 178 yards and one touchdown pass to go along with the two picks.

Rees midway through the fourth quarter. Rees completed six of seven passes and led the Irish down the field on a 76-yard touchdown drive, capped off by sophomore running back Cierre Wood's 1-yard touchdown run. 
The contest started inauspiciously for the Irish, who were stopped on a fourth-and-goal from inside the I-yard line. "We outman them by 70 pounds on average up front," Kelly said. "If you can't get a foot on the one-half yard line, you get what you deserve." 
By contrast, Navy scored almost effortlessly. Taking over at their own 1-yard line, the lVIidshipmen drove down the field for a touchdown in just over three minutes. Teich's 54-yard run set up his 31-yard touchdown grab three plays later, and Navy took an early 7-0 lead. 
The Irish once again managed to move the ball well on their next possession, but settled for a 45-yard field goal by senior kicker David Ruffer after their drive stalled at Navy's 28-yard line. 
Navy responded with a methodical, seven­minute touchdown drive, making it 14-3. 
The Irish cut the lead to 14-10 when Crist hit freshman wide receiver TJ Jones for a 16-yard touchdown strike early in the second quarter. Notre Dame's defense responded by forcing a rare Navy punt, as the Irish seemed to be gaining momentum. 
But sophomore cornerback De'Von Richardson promptly intercepted Crist's pass with 1:59 remaining in the half. Navy took over at Notre Dame's 30-yard line and used five straight rushes to find the end zone, bringing the score to 21-10. 
The tlmd quarter was a complete disaster for Notre Dame. Dobbs scored on a 9-yard touchdown run to cap a 77-yard drive to open the second half. With his team facing a daunting 28-10 deficit, Crist threw his second interception of the game. Navy took over at its own 27-yard line and marched down tl1e field for another touchdown, padding its lead to an insurmountable 35-10 margin. 
Navy's seemingly unstoppable rushing attack ate up the clock, eliminating any chance of a n1iracle Notre Dame comeback. The defeat was Notre Dame's most lopsided against Navy since 1963. 
"A scheme is one thing, but you still have to win one-on-one matchups," Kelly said. "We got beat today. Navy was the better football team today." 
Despite the poor showing, Crist insisted he and his teammates would not let the loss derail the entire season. "The guys are in there, they're rallying," he said. "They are a really resilient bunch." 0

TULSA 


TULSA 28, NOTRE DAME 27 
Josh Flynt 
In an emotional meeting between Notre Dame and Tulsa, the Golden Hurricane upset the Irish with a 28-27 victory, their first win over a BCS-team since 1998. The Irish family entered the late October matchup with a heavy heart after the death of junior Declan Sullivan, a student videographer who worked for the athletic department. The crowd observed a moment of silence before University President Rev. John Jenkins, C.S.C. led the stadium in prayer prior to kickoff. Both teams wore shamrock decals with Sullivan's initials on their helmets in remembrance. In the first quarter, Tulsa jumped to an early 7-0 lead on a 9-yard pass from junior quarterback G.J. Kinne to junior receiver DamarisJohnson. On the ensuing possession, Irish junior quarterback Dayne Crist carried the ball for 29 yards on third down, but suffered a season-ending knee injury when he was knocked out of bounds. Freshman Tommy Rees took over the Irish offense and connected with junior wide receiver Michael Floyd for an apparent game-tying touchdown. Senior kicker David Ruffer's extra point, however, was blocked and picked up by Tulsa sophomore linebacker Curnelius Arnick who returned it for a rare 
32 I SCHOLASTIC I 10 FEBRUARY 2011 
two-point defensive PAT. 
On its next drive, Tulsa took a 12-6 lead after a 37-yard field goal by junior kicker Kevin Fitzpatrick. Following two touchdown passes from Rees, it appeared the Irish would go to the locker room with a 20-12 advantage, but Tulsa freshman linebacker ShawnJackson returned an interception 66 yards to score in the final minute of the first half. 
In the third quarter, Irish sophomore tailback Cierte Wood caught his second touchdown of the afternoon, a 6-yard pass from Rees, who finished the game with four touchdown passes, but also three interceptions. Later in the quarter, Tulsa mov1:d within two points of Notre Dame, following a 59-yard touchdown on a punt return by Damaris Johnson. 
It looked like the Irish might hold on for the victory, but Kinne and the Golden Hurricane converted a third-and-26 that kept a late fourh quarter drive alive, setting up a 27-yard field goal by Fitzpatrick to give Tulsa a 28-27 lead. 
On the following possession, Rees converted a crucial third down with a 26­yard pass to Floyd, which brought the Irish to the Tulsa 32. Three plays later, the Irish had second-and-eight from the Tulsa 19 with under a minute to play. Instead of kicking a potential game-winning field goal, however, Rees lofted a pass towards Floyd in the corner of the end zone, but Tulsa junior defensive back John Flanders picked it off to seal the game's fate. 
The loss dropped the Irish to 4-5, but the second consecutive setback was only an afterthought following the difficult week. After the game, , head coach Brian Kelly opened his press conference with a statement about the video tower accident, before responding to questions about the game and the tragedy. 
The Irish coach commended the university for the way it came together in light of the accident, explaining that the memorial Mass, as well as the support of Jenkins and athletics director Jack Swarbrick, had helped the football program cope with the tragedy. 
In more than 20 years of coaching, the first-year Notre Dame coach said he had never dealt with a loss of this magnitude. "As a football coach, there's been more difficult weeks relative to the game itself. But in terms of the tragedy that occurred, there's never been a more difficult time in my life."

Patience Pays Off 
Katherine Fusco 
Notre Dame's 28-3 victory over Utah on Nov. 13 mark7d not only a turning point in the season, but the birth of a perfect November. The matchup featured strong Irish special teams and freshman quarterback Tommy Rees' first start, inspiring a new wave of optimism in fans. In the middle of the first quarter, a field goal from Utah's senior kicker Joe Phillips gave the Utes their first points on the board. These three points, however, would be the last the Irish would surrender. Utah suffered 10 penalties in the first half alone, finishing the game with 11 for 70 yards. The Utes were held to a maximum of 24 yards per drive for their first nine drives, advancing to drives of 65 and 61 in the second half. Their efforts, however, were futile as the Irish stopped both on the fourth down. The Irish held the Utes to 71 yards rushing and a season-low 265 total offense. This was the least amount of yardage the Irish had allowed an opponent all season, while the rushing yards were the third fewest allowed. Conversely, the Irish achieved 256 yards in only 49 offensive plays, with yards per play averaging 5.2. Just over five minutes into the game, senior safety Harrison Smith picked off his third pass of the season. In the last few minutes of the quarter, junior cornerback Robert Blanton blocked Utah's sophomore kicker Sean 
NOTRE DAME 28, UTAH 3 
Sellwood's punt, ultimately delivering a 6-yard 
touchdown. Within seconds, Blanton came 
off the edge of the scrimmage line and was 
able to run untouched, marking Notre Dame's 
first blocked punt returned for a touchdown 
since 2008. The Irish took the lead 7-3 at the 
end of the first quarter. Rees's first touchdown 
pass of the game, a 3-yard completion to Floyd 
boosted the Irish to a 14-3 lead on the early in 
the second quarter. 
The first half of the game demonstrated the 
strength of the Notre Dame defense. For the 
remainder of the game, the Irish offense, along 
with the special teams, continued to dominate. 
Moments into the second half, the Irish forced 
Utah to fumble during the opening kickoff, 
courtesy of freshman wide receiver Austin 
Collinsworth's fifth special teams' tackle of 
the season. The Irish gained possession off 
of freshman wide receiver Daniel Smith's 
recovery, and Rees connected with senior 
receiver Duval Kamara for a smooth 26-yard 
touchdown pass. 
In the third quarter, the dynamic duo ofRees . and Kamara teamed up again to deliver a 12­yard touchdown pass, making the score 28-3. 
"It's about just being patient," Kamara said. 
"Things will work out for you. No matter 
what game you're in, you have to try to make 
a difference. And you never know which play 
is going to be that play." The team worked past their previous senior day losses and most recent loss to Tulsa to earn Notre Dame's first win over a ranked opponent since Penn State in 2006. 
"I wasn't going to put this game on Tommy ,Rees," head coach Brian Kelly said. "I was going to take shots when we had opportunities because he's an accurate thrower of the football." Rees showed progress throughout the game, completing 13 of 20 for 129 yards. Rees's three touchdown passes helped the Irish end their 11-game losing streak against Associated Press Top 25 rated adversaries. It also marked the first senior day win since 2007. 
Neither team scored in the fourth quarter, and the Irish put senior quarterback Brian Castello in for the final minutes of the game, sealing the exhilarating senior day victory for Notre Dame. As the student section stormed the field, the players rejoiced for a successful sendoff of their senior teammates. 
"It was crazy, and that's how it should be," sophomore inside linebacker Manti Te'o said . "We should give our fans what they want, and show them that we appreciate their support." 0

Big Win in the Big Apple 


josh Flynt 
Although the game had no championship implications or Reisman prospects, fans attending the Notre Dame-Army game at Yankee Stadium in New York City rallied for a win, harkening back to a rivalry that once dominated college football. A pep rally in Lincoln Center, a standing­room-only Mass in St. Patrick's Cathedral, a marching band concert in Times Square and a sellout crowd of 54,251 for a game played on neutral turf-evidence of the indomitable spirit of these two historic institutions. In their first trip to the Bronx in 41 years, the Irish stormed out of the first-base dugout sporting the rarely-used green jerseys for a 27-3 victory. Notre Dame threatened to score on its first possession, but freshman quarterback Tommy Rees's pass was picked off and Army took over. Relying on their methodical triple-option offense, the Black Knights took 17 plays to move the ball 78 yards, but a strong goal line stand by the· Irish defense forced Army to settle for a 3-0 lead behind a 20-yard kick from junior kicker Alex Carlton. The Irish, however, dominated for the rest of the game. Early in the second quarter, senior kicker David Ruffer connected on a 47-yard field

NOTRE DAME 27, ARMY 3 
goal to tie the game. Later, with a 39-yard kick in the third quarter, the walk-on transfer from William & Mary extended his school­record streak to 20 consecutive field goals. After the Irish defense forced an Army punt, Rees hit sophomore tight end Tyler Eifert with an apparent 36-yard touchdown pass on third and six. The officials reviewed the play and determined that Eifert was down at the 1-yard line, but on the following play, senior tailback Robert Hughes carried the ball in for a score and a 10-3 Irish lead. 
On the next drive, Eifert, filling in for injured junior tight end Kyle Rudolph, made an outstanding over-the-shoulder catch for a 31-yard touchdown pass from Rees, giving the Irish a 17-3 advantage. Early in the second half, senior cornerback Darrin Walls intercepted Trent Steelman's pass and returned it 42 yards for a touchdown. 
For the second consecutive game, the Irish defense held its opponent without a touchdown, the first time it had accomplished that feat since the 1988 national championship season. The victory gave Notre Dame a 6-5 record, clinching bowl eligibility and maintaining momentum heading into a season-ending showdown at USC. 
Last season, Notre Dame played Washington State at the Alamodome in San Antonio, the first in a series of yearly home­away-from-home games. But in 2010, the Irish brought a piece of Notre Dame to the Big Apple for a unique matchup with Army. When the team arrived in New York, head coach Brian Kelly and his players soaked in the sights of baseball's most famous stadium. 
·"We just stood around with our eyes wide open and took pictures and marveled at the stadium and walked around here and then after [we] got enough of that ... we came in here and showed a video of the Army-[Notre Dame] history," Kelly said. 
"I can't explain it in words," junior cornerback Robert Blanton said. "The Joe DiMaggio sign [in the clubhouse], [Yankees manager Joe] Girardi sitting on the sidelines -it was unbelievable." 
"New York is a lot of things," Kelly said, "and what it was tonight was a college football town." 
For one night, The House That Ruth Built was The House The Irish Called Home. And Irish eyes were smiling as they enjoyed every minute of the 27-3 Notre Dame victory.

The Notre Dame foo!ball team boarded the plane on Thanksgiving weekend to face its last regular season opponent. A lifetime of rivalry and the emotions of an eight-year losing streak surrounded the matchup, but head coach Brian Kelly's team was poised to fight. The previously superior Trojan arsenal ofchariots and warriors came crashing down as the Irish stole a pass to win the game, 20~16. Notre Dame kicked off the ball to the 5-yard line, a strong start for the Irish, who held the Trojan offense to the USC 33-yard line on the drive. The stingy Trojan defense did the same for the Irish, however, keeping their next drive close to home at the ND 39-yard line. Back-up Trojan senior quarterback Mitch Mustain filled in for the injured sophomore Matt Barkley and completed multiple passes to move the ball closer to the Irish end zone. Junior tailback Marc Tyler's unstoppable rushes brought the ball close enough for senior placekicker Joe Houston to kick a career-long45-yard field goal. Freshman quarterback Tommy Rees, replacing the injured junior Dayne Crist, finished the first quarter with a number of incomplete passes and an interception. USC led ND 3-0. The start ofthe second quarter proved to be no different than the first, as both defenses held off the offenses for five minutes. On the next drive, 
NOTRE DAME 20, USC 16 
however, the Irish cl1anged their fortunes. Junior wide receiver Michael Floyd and sophomore running back Cierre Wood drove the team down the field and capped off their 8:10 domination with a toucl1down. The Irish led the game 7-3. 
Although Mustain sent perfect passes to his receivers in the ne.xt drive, the Irish defensive line contained senior fullback Stanley Havili's rushes to ,vin the ball back. The Irish scored, but did not get the extra point, and finished the half leading 13-3. 
In the spirit of nail-biting games, ND faltered during the third quarter. After the Trojans intercepted another ofRees's passes, Tyler moved the ball to the ND 6. After two incomplete passes from Mustain, Houston kicked the field goal. A one possession game, the Irish temporarily held onto the lead at 13-6. 
Rees struggled to complete passes for the Irish. After being sacked at the ND 10 and fumbling the ball, USC recovered with the end zone in sight. Tyler brought the ball to the 1-yard line, where Mustain stepped in for the toucl1down. At the end ofthe third quartei~ the score was tied at 13. 
More interceptions plagued the Irish offense, indicating that the Trojans would continue their ,vinning streak. With 10:28 left in the game, junior safety Marshall Jones intercepted the ball inmlediately after the Irish had gained possession. 
The following drive brought USC within field goal range, and Houston connected, leaving the Irish behind 16-13. 
In a miracle drive, the Irish moved to the USC 40-yard line. Senior running back Robert Hughes entered the game with gusto, carrying the ball to the 9-yard line. Rees completed a pass to junior ,vide receiver .i.\llichael Floyd to bring the Irish to the 5-yard line ,vith 2:45 left in the game. Hughes rushed for the touchdown, and the Irish got the ell.tra point. 
Senior Trojan receiver Ronald Johnson had a chance for a game-winning reception, but he dropped the ball, holding the score at 20-16: "It's part of the game. You drop balls," Mustain said. "That one probably would have changed the outcome. I don't know if there's a worse feeling than that." 
Luck and a bit ofrain left the Irish ,vith a long­deseved victory. "It was about time we caught a break," Kelly said. 
Four plays later, senior safety Harrison Smith caught the gamMvinning interception. "Going up for the ball, I thought, No matter what, I've got to come down with this, because this game's over," Smith said. 
After the game, sophomore linebacker Manti Te'o said, "I'm just proud of our guys. Things could have easily gone the opposite way." 0

SUN BOWL 
Irish Escape Hurricane with Commanding Win 
Matt Formica 
Notre Dame co.ncluded its 2010 football season with a convincing 33-17 Sun Bowl victory over the Miami Hurricanes in El Paso, Texas. With the win, head coach Brian Kelly made history as the first Notre Dame coach to earn a bowl game victory during his debut season. "Clearly, we are gaining a lot ofconfidence," Kelly said. "We've beaten some good football teams late in the year as we've come together and found our identity. It's going to taste a whole lot better in the offseason talking about a win." Freshman quarterback Tommy Rees passed for 201 yards and two touchdowns to junior wide receiver Michael Floyd. Rees, to whom Kelly awarded the game ball, improved his record to a perfect 4-0 as a starter. Floyd finished with six catches for 109 yards and the two touchdowns. Though a sore hamstring limited him in the second half, Floyd was named the game's MVP. The victory improved Notre Dame's record to 8-5 and extended its winning streak to four games. "There were some obstacles along the way but I think what showed with four wins to close the season was the progress we made," senior kicker David Ruffer said.

NOTRE DAME 33 1 MIAMI 17 
"We got a late jump with coach Kelly coming in, but this last month or two months, we've made tremendous gains." 
Senior safety Harrison Smith anchored the defense with three interceptions, tying a Sun Bowl record. "It was a total defensive effort," Smith said. "When you knock the receivers off and mess up the timing with the quarterback, it really makes it easier for the safeties." 
Ruffer booted three field goals for the Irish (40, 50 and 19 yards), but also missed for the first time in his career. Even so, Ruffer earned the bowl's Special Teams MVP honor. 
Notre Dame's first-half performance was dominant in all phases, as the Irish scored the contest's first 27 points. Notre Dame received the ball to start the game and faced a daunting third and 15 on its first possession, but Rees kept the drive alive with a 35-yard pass to Floyd that brought the Irish all the way down to Miami's 24. A few plays later, Rees connected with Floyd again, this time for a 2-yard touchdown that gave Notre Dame an early 7-0 lead. 
The Irish got the ball back after their defense forced a Miami three-and-out, and Rees quickly replicated the first drive with another touchdown strike to Floyd. The 34­yard touchdown grab gave Notre Dame a 14-0 first quarter lead. 
Smith's first interception set up the Irish for another score, as sophomore running back Cierre Wood immediately took a handoff and ran 34 yards to give Notre Dame a commanding 21-0 lead early in the second quarter. Wood finished with 81 yards on just 12 carries for an impressive 6.8 yards-per­carry average. 
Ruffer added two field goals to push the lead to 27-0. The Hurricanes got on the board with a field goal of their own as time expired in the first half, bringing the score to 27-3. 
The .Hurricanes managed to make a few plays in the fourth quarter, but by that point the game was already out of reach. Trailing 30-3, freshman quarterback Stephen Morris hit Hankerson for a 6-yard touchdown, Miami's first of the game. The Hurricanes cut the deficit to 30-17 a few minutes later when Morris tossed a 42-yard touchdown pass to sophomore wide receiver Tommy Streeter. 
But the Irish would add one more field goal, making the score 33-17, and the defense held on to secure the win.

ne mark ofa su·ccessful season is when 
the most memorable plays of the year 
bring a smile to-your face rather than a cringe or muttered expletive. To be sure, Notre Dame fans had their fair share of the latter in 2010, from the end of the Michigan and Tulsa games to just about every play in the Navy game. Overall, though, head coach Brian Kelly's inaugural season_ had a number of truly great moments, culminating with senior tailback/fullback Robert Hughes bulldozing his way into the endzone for the go-ahead score in the LA Coliseum. 
But when picking a play of the year for this season -one that symbolizes the 2010 Fighting Irish -the honor should go to the one play that not only fired up the team and fans, but served as an inflection point for a season· that was headed towards disaster. That play was junior cornerback Robert Blanton's punt block against Utah. 
Heading into the game against the Utes, the state of Notre Dame football was quickly going from bad to worse to unthinkable. The team rebounded from a lackluster 1-3 start to reach a 4-3 record following a win over Western Michigan, but any positive momentum was shattered thanks to a historically bad loss to Navy that left the coaching staff looking befuddled.

Football was overshadowed later that week when the news of junior marketing and Film, Television and Theatre major Declan Sullivan's death sent shock waves through the team, campus and Notre Dame family. Playing against Tulsa with a heary heart, the team hit another setback when junior quarterback Dayne Crist was knocked out for the season, and freshman quarterback Tommy Rees' intercepted pass into the end zone sealed the program's first home loss to a Conference USA opponent in nearly 60 years. 
With the team reeling physically and emotionally, thematchupwith theNo.14 Utah squad looked like a sure loss. Outlined against a rainy, dreary November sky, Notre Dame failed to get a single first down in its first three possessions. Utah, meanwhile, marched down the field for a field goal on its first drive. 
But then on fourth and eight on its own 25­yard line, Utah attempted to punt the ball away only to watch helplessly as Blanton blocked the punt, scooped up the ball and raced into the endzone to give the Irish a lead they would never relinquish. Suddenly, Notre Dame Stadium was filled with energy, as the Fighting Irish finally started to show some fight on the field. The Utes would fail to score another point for the rest of the game, and when the clock struck zero, the student body flowed over the walls to join its classmates on the field for the first win on Senior Day in three seasons. 
After that cathartic victory, the team never looked back. The next weekend, Army became the second straight team to fail to score a touchdown as Notre Dame took over Yankee Stadium and New York City for the night. 
Then the come-from-behind victory over USC snapped its eight year winning streak, thanks again to the Irish defense and a big helping hand from the ND running game. The blowout win over the shivering Miami Hurricanes in the Sun Bowl capped the incredible turnaround that had everyone believing what Coach Kelly had been saying all season about building a foundation and getting the players to believe in themselves. 
A team that was all but written off heading into tl1e Utah game now can look forward to 2011 full of confidence and optimism. In the long history of Notre Dame football, an 8-5 season is hardly the stuff of legend. But following the events of late October, the turnaround was as dramatic as any season under the Dome. And it got its start thanks to Blanton and tlrnt blocked punt.

T:e outlook wasn't b1·illia11t for the Irish hat day I The record stood fozn-and five, with but three ga1J1es 1/lore to play. Borrowing from Ernest Lawrence Thayer's "Casey at the Bat," it is safe to say that a once-promising year looked bleak for the Notre Dame football team as it prepared for the final stretch of the 2010 season. The Irish could not have endured a more difficult conclusion to October. For the third time in four years, the Navy Midshipmen had gotten the better of Notre Dame, and this time, they made it look easy, 35-14. On the following \i\Tednesday, an unusually blustery autumn afternoon, tragedy struck the Notre Dame community when junior videographer Declan Sullivan died following the collapse of the tower from which he had been filming practice. Just three days later, the Irisl"i faced the difficult task of playing · a football game, a 28-27 loss to Tulsa that left many people scratching their heads and searching for answers. A bye week gave the Irish a chance to recover from the on-and off-the-field

heartache before they set out to defeat No. 14 Utah. It was an opportunity to send the dejected class of 2011 out with a landmark win and a celebration of Notre Dame's first victory over a ranked opponent in more than four years. 
As they sought to avoid a painful third consecutive Senior Day loss, the Irish came out with a different sense of pride, an emotion that seemed to have been missing for much of the season. As my classmates and I watched our final game as students, we knew we would be leaving the stadium through the Knute Rockne Gate, but few of us expected to be joined by the entire student body jubilantly celebrating a 28-3 victory. No tailgate or post-game Finny's celebration could have topped the ecstasy of storming the field, rain-soaked and marshmallow­covered, finally experienciIJ.g Notre Dame football at its finest. Little did we know, however, that the fun was just beginning on the evening of Nov. 13. 
The following week, Notre Dame took over the Big Apple as thousands of Domers and "subway alums" made the trip for the first football game in the new Yankee Stadium. I have lived in the Albany-area my entire life and I have never been a New York City person. Yet there was something electric, something magical about being 700 miles from campus, in the nation's largest city, but still surrounded by green, blue and gold. The Basilica was swapped for St. Patrick's Cathedral, while the steps of Bond Hall were traded for Times Square. Far from South Bend, the weekend still featured many of the traditions that make Notre Dame special. 
For the second consecutive game, the Irish defense was strong, allowing just a field goal in a 27-3 victory over the Army Black Knights. The win secured a bowl bid for head coach Brian Kelly's squad, guaranteeing a postseason berth and important additional practice time for the developing team. It was the perfect ending to a perfect weekend in The City That Never Sleeps.

remains one of the most storied rivalries in college football. With USC ineligible for postseason play and ND just 6-5, however, many ABC affiliates did not carry the game, forcing fans to resort to ESPN3 and other online sources to watch the Battle for the Jeweled Shillelagh. 
The Notre Dame __ defense continued its impressive play, but things started to unravel in the second half. As USC capitalized on costly turnovers, it appeared that the Irish might be headed for a ninth consecutive loss at the hands of the Trojans. Down 16-13 with 6:18 to play, the Irish took over on their own 23, beginning an unforgettable drive that was capped by a 5-yard touchdown run by senior tailback Robert Hughes. With the Irish back on top, USC needed a touchdown to regain the lead, but senior safety Harrison Smith_sealed the Notre Dame victory with a key interception near the end zone. 
The win marked Notre Dame's third consecutive victory and first over USC since 2001. A 7-5 finish earned the Irish a Sun Bowl date with Miami, but it also marked the end of an eight-year curse against the Trojans, lifting a weight off the shoulders of the program (and its fans) and providing a glimmer of hope that the Irish could rise once again. 
Closing out 2010 in El Paso, TX, Notre Dame jumped out to a 27-3 halftime lead and never looked back. A trio of second quarter interceptions by Smith demoralized the Miami sideline. Ultimately, the latest installment in the Catholics vs. Convicts rivalry belonged to the Irish. 
The 2010 football season will be remembered for many reasons, including the start of a new coaching era, the seesaw recruiting class, and the tragic and premature loss of a member of the Notre Dame family. Prior to my arrival on campus in August 2007, I had heard so much about the incredible memories of football victories and championship seasons. Three months ago, I thought I would graduate with few of my fondest ND memories being football­related. Looking back, Hollywood could not have written a more "Rudy-esque" (read: perfect) script for the final four games of 2010. 
What makes the four-game stretch from Utah through Miami special is how so many unsung heroes stepped up when it mattered most. Fellow senior classmates, st~dent­athletes who have overcome personal setbacks both on-and off-the-field, made crucial plays in the closing moments of their careers. Duval Kamara caught two TD passes in the win over Utah, Darrin Walls returned an interception for a touchdown against Army, Brian Smith made several key plays down the stretch against USC, Harrison Smith came through with numerous clutch interceptions, and Hughes, on the final drive in Los Angeles, seemed to carry the Irish on his back into the end zone. 
The band is playing somewhere, and so111ewhere hearts are light, I And somewhere 111en are laughing, and somewhere children shout. But unlike mighty Casey of the Mudville Nine, the Fighting Irish did not strike out. In fact, with four key victories in a row, they hit a grand slam. To the delight of Domers everywhere, there is joy in South Bend. Even as the wind continues to howl and the snow piles up, the sun is shining a little brighter over Our Lady's campus as we anticipate the arrival of the 2011 season and the opportunities that await the revitalized Notre Dame football program. 0

alled a blueprint for · a national 
championship team by some, 
the Irish recruiting class of 2011 features players that cou'ld make significant contributions to the team. This class of 23 features twins, a strong defensive corps and multiple nationally ranked players to fill the gaps in the existing Irish squad. 
Although he has been recruited to play wide receiver for Notre Dame, the Vernon Hills, Illinois native Davaris Daniels would probably be fine at any. The son of ViTashington Redskins defensive end Phillip Daniels, he played wide receiver, quarterback and defensive back during his high school career. Daniels, a 6'3", 190-pound Under Armour All-American, was ranked on the Rivals.com Top 100, ESPN.com Top 150 and Scout.com Top 300 lists during his senior season at Vernon Hills High School. He was also ranked No. 15 in his position and No. 2 in his state for his performances on the field, recording 19 total touchdowns and leading his team in rushing, scoring and receiving. 
Matthew Hegarty, an offensive tackle, is touted as one of the best recruits to ever come out of New Mexico. This impressive Aztec High School standout led his team to

the New Mexico State Championship three years in a row, was named to the second team All-American Offense and played in the USA vs. The World All-Star Game. In addition, he was a finalist for the Anthony Munoz Lineman of the Year Award at the 
U.S. Army All-American Bowl. At a towering 6'5", Hegarty did not give up a sack during his senior season, earning him the rankings ofNo. 6 in his position, No.43 nationally, and first in his state. 
One of the nation's top pass rushers, Cape Coral, Florida native Aaron Lynch ranked third in his position and 15th overall on ESPN.com. During his senior football season, Lynch recorded 31 solo tackles along with 10.5 sacks, leading his Island Coast High School team to the Florida 2B State Semifinals. Lynch is an early enrollee who played in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl game where he recorded 2.5 sacks, earning him the honors of Stock Rising Player and honorable mention Best Pass Rusher. Lynch, a five-star football prospect, looks to contribute to the Irish defense with his physical play as a defensive end. 
One of the most sought after recruits in the 2011 class, Stephan Tuitt, a Monroe, Georgia native, brings his talents to the defense as a lineman. Tuitt has received many accolades -he was chosen to play in the USA vs. the '1Vorld All-Star Game, U.S.· Army All-American Game where he was named Most Physical, and FBU Top Gun Camp 2011 Standout. In his senior season, he led his team to a 6-0 start, as the defense allowed only 29 points during those games. At 6'5", 26.0 pounds Tuitt is ranked second in his position, 26th nationally, first in his state, and was named first-team all-Georgia Region 8-AAA for 2010. 
As the top football player in his state and a five-star prospect, lshaq Williams, a Brooklyn, New York native, was named Gatorade Player of the Year. In his senior season he recorded 22 tackles, six sacks and two fumble recoveries, leading his team to a 12-lfinish and the Public Athletic League's playoff runner-up spot,· and No. 55 ranking nationally. The early enrollee for the Irish has earned many honors for his performance at Abraham Lincoln High School performance, including Best Pass Rusher at the U.S. Army All-American Bowl, SuperPrep Northeast Defensive Player of the Year and First Team All-Borough Pick/by the New York Daily

Ahh, February! The month that unites generations of Darners far and wide by their shared hatred and bitter memories. Yes, Giplings, it's that time of year again, and we're all embracing the arctic atmosphere in our own unique ways. 
The creative kids at Riley are transforming giant sculptures into giant snowmen. Freezing females across campus are finally forsaking fashion for warmth. Courageous cads are smuggling spirits into the dining halls for a wintry twist on hot chocolate. And somewhere far down South Quad, resourceful little rascals are creating a snowy sanctuary for themselves, despite the obvious dimensions of danger involved in such a task! Tsk, tsk. 
But what have the rest of you ruffians been up to? Good ol' Gipp has been braving the subzero temperatures to keep tabs on you. And unlike all you lucky lads and lassies, the Gipper never gets a snow day! I must say, your ability to make asinine decisions even in blizzard conditions is truly impressive. Were not my tears to freeze, I would be quick to shed salty drops of delight. 
You see, Giplings, my heart was packed with pride when I heard tell of a befuddled boy who snacked on a tub of butter after an extensive evening of drinking. My brain swilled with satisfaction when I learned about a daft dame who almost burned a beloved bar to the ground after using a radiator as a coat rack. But the Gipp was fully floored when tipped off to the following feats of foolishness. 
It seems that one of my stir-crazy students caught a case of cabin fever rather quickly this semester, and took to the sidewalks of campus in search ofsalvation. Our thieving thrill seeker -a bit of a Clyde, minus the Bonnie -soon stumbled upon a truly unthinkable treasure. Sitting in a state of abandoned glory on Notre Dame's holiest quad was an unmanned golf cart, keys in the ignition, just waiting and wishing for some lucky lad to seize the moment. Clyde did just that, and jumped into the driver's seat without a moment's hesitation. 
To be honest, ol' Gipp envies the pure, unadulterated joy that Clyde must have experienced, cruising down the quad at a glorious 10 miles per hour, picking up every potential passenger along the way. Surely this must have been some heavenly form of nirvana on earth for our nefarious ne'er-do-well! But as the Gipper knows all too well, all good things must come to an end. 
Yes, Clyde's brief peek into the plunderer's life was somewhat short­lived. 'Twas not long at all before the owner of the lifted cart wised up to the situation and sent for the fearless fellows from Our Lady's security team. What ensued was a somber scene that Gipp can only describe as a painfully slow, low-speed chase resulting in charges of grand theft golf-cart. Clyde certainly learned his lesson, but he will be a hero to aspiring thieves all across campus for decades to come! 
Our next story starts off in downtown South Bend on a Thursday night -feel free to guess the location, Giplings. After spending last semester exchanging titillating texts with a charming chap, one ofour Domer dames found herself having a particularly successful evening out with said gentleman. Whether this was a real-life fairytale -or more likely just the magic ofsyllabus week-the two decided to take their budding relationship to the next level, and he invited the sassy lassie back to his apartment to "like, watch a movie or something." 
The evening's events from this point on are unknown to Gipp, and likely a little fuzzy for those involved, but what can be confirmed is that the unlucky lady woke up the next morning all alone, slowly but surely relieving herself right into her new friend's bed. Her initial reaction was terror, followed by shame, succeeded by an immediate instinct to make a run for it. Like any capable college student, however, she took the time to evaluate her surroundings, and was lucky enough to discover a full washer and dryer in the lad's adjoining bathroom! 
Heart pounding, she risked life, limb and dignity, depositing his soiled bed sheets into the washing machine, all the while praying his roommates would not question the unusual whirring noise coming from his chambers. For what seemed like eternity, she remained unmoving on his sheetless bed, waiting for her one true love to return and for their newfound romance to come to a horrifying halt. But when the dryer buzzed and Romeo was still nowhere to be seen, our bold little bed wetter decided to toss in the comforter just to be safe. Ifthe Gipp knows anything about his Notre Dame students, it's that they never leave a job half-finished. 
So for an hour or two more she sat in silence, saying her prayers to any and all deities her mind could summon. When the final dryer rang out she threw up her arms and let out a quiet whisper-shout of victory! Saying goodbye to his roommates as ifshe had just woken up from a peaceful, urine-free slumber, she took her leave and skipped all the way home. 
So there it is, Giplings. It seems that all the blizzards and subzero temperatures only feed your desire for foolish decisions. Ifthat's the case, bring on the second snowpocalypse! Anything for a good story, I always say. February may drag you down into the doldrums, but don't forget that ifyou take risks and break rules, when all's said and done, I want the details!

HUMOR 
Kathleen Toohi/1
Studying abroad is an integral part of the college experience, and when I applied for programs during my 
sophomore year, I was determined to head to an exotic and exciting location. That being said, I had no idea what I had gotten myself into when I first arrived in a village called Emaderton, the place where I spent the fall ofmy junior year. The culture I experienced, with its quirks and unique traditions, made for quite a memorable semester. I tried to observe the people of Emaderton from an anthropological standpoint while I studied there, and here's what I found: 
Emaderton is known for its complex rituals and traditions, many of which are often subject to scorn and derision from outsiders. 
· The mayor of the village is regarded with both awe and respect due to his reputation for being all-seeing, a widespread rumor among the village that engenders fear in many of its inhabitants. The mayor carries out the town ordinances using law enforcement officers who swear oaths to kill fun in any way they deem fit. 
The inhabitants of Emaderton live together in clusters much bigger than the typical nuclear family. These residences, which resemble sophisticated huts, generally serve to foster a sense of community among

the entire village, although occasionally relationships between certain huts become strained. One of these huts, whose residents are rumored to worship the head of a moose, is ostracized by the others for its refusal to participate in certain Emaderton rituals. 
The residents of Emaderton get from place to place mainly on foot, although more daring residents weave between pedestrians on two-wheeled contraptions made of steel. These gizmos seem to have minds of their own and often dump their riders on the ground. 
I found the cuisine of Emaderton to be generally favorable, though the mealtime rituals can be chaotic. Inhabitants roam aimlessly through the communal feeding area, seemingly unsatisfied with the vast array of food available. Some of the customs mystified me; when a resident dropped one of the devices they use to fetch water from their sophisticated wells, for example, the whole eating area erupted into cheers. 
One of the most unique aspects of the village ofEmaderton is the numerous rituals that residents undergo when making the transition from childhood to adulthood. Its residents may choose to scale a giant geodesic structure or ascend 14 levels of a building named after Emaderton's most

prominent mayor, making sure they are 
fully hydrated during the course of their 
journies. I heard stories of rituals specific to 
the spring, including a day of celebration in 
which the villagers all wear the same color 
in remembrance of a holy man of long ago. 
On another day of celebration, the people of 
Emaderton eat only the meat from a giant 
roasting pig and drink only beverages made 
of malted barley kept in barrels. 
· The most significant feature ofEmaderton 
life in the fall, however, is a test of skill and 
endurance that few residents participate in 
but all enjoy watching each weekend. This 
ritual draws chanting and hysteric crowds, 
and the mood of the community on these 
days is completely dependent on the outcome 
of this contest on the days. 
I had a great experience last semester, and would highly recommend studying in Emaderton to any student eager to experience a unique. and vibrant culture. If _you do make it to Emaderton, I wouldn't recommend visiting the neighboring village of Syarmtnias. Although the males of Emaderton make the journey every so often, none of the females I met ·had anything 
positive to say about the place. 


EXIT INTERVIEW 
PROFESSOR ERIC SIMS 

Maria Kosse 
Economics Assistant Professor Eric Sims is a Faculty Research Fellow for the National Bureau of Economic Research and currently teaches courses in nzacroecononucs. 
You graduated from the University ofMichigan with n Ph.D. in. economics in 2009. T¥he1·e do you1· loyalties lie? 
I would hope that your readers do not hold that transgression against me. As it says on the second slide of my first lecture for intermediate macroeconomics in italics, "Michigan sucks." My loyalties fully lie with the University ofNotre Dame and, in fact, I heavily root against the University ofMichigan in all ofits endeavors. I grew up a very big Notre Dame fan when I was a kid. I was a Notre Dame fan at Michigan [and] had full beer bottles thrown at me at various points. I am Notre Dame blue and gold through and through. 
Why didyou decide to specialize in economics? 
I think that I was attracted to the logic and formal structure that eccinomics provides to think about the world and our interactions within it. It's about how people do the best that they can subject to scarcity, and I thought that was very intuitive and logical. I also thought that economics was something that related to the real world and so it would be a way to apply logic and rigorous thinking to real world problems. You open up a newspaper, turn on the TV, and they're talking about economics. And so it's something exciting to be in, and it's something that has real world relevance. 
JiVhy didyou decide to come to Notre Dame to tench? 
First and foremost, I was deeply attracted to Notre Dame's mission to be the leading Catholic university in the world. And with that comes lots of different and unique challenges, chief among them that Notre Dame is a place that tries to simultaneously excel in research, excel in teaching, excel in service and make a difference in the world. Thatwell-roundedness ofthe universitywas very appealing to me. The students here are wonderful, and they're passionate about their beliefs. They're passionate about the world in which they live and they're excited to be at Notre Dame, and I wanted to 
48 ISCHOLASTIC I 10 FEBRUARY 2011 
come work with those students. My colleagues here -everybody at Notre Dame -are here because they want to be. Notre Dame is a destination institution, and it makes it a lot offun to come into work when everybody is excited to be here and is committed to a common goal ofmaking Notre Dame all that it can be. 
lou hnve n Twitte1: How does social networking impact you ns n person nnd n professor? 
As a person, social networking creates tension with my wife because she thinks that I pay too much attention to it. In reality, social networking is really interesting because it's a way to meet people. In fact, I've met a bunch of people on campus through Twitter of all things, with different backgrounds, different interests and different beliefs. So it's a way to quickly get news and opinions from people who otherwise wouldn't have a voice. It's not something that I incorporate into my life as a professor. Typically, I just try to write funny things on Twitter, and I probably don't succeed at that. But it is something that I have fun with. 
How do you liven up you1· research? 
Isn't research supposed to be boring? I think that the thing to do is that you want to have empirically motivated research questions that matter in the world. The tools that we use might be divorced from the real world, but [the research is] fundamentally driven by real world questions. Why do we have booms and busts? Why do we have unemployment? Things that people can relate to, that students can relate to. 
Ifyou could hove dinnerwith twopeople, dend orolive, who would they be nndwhy? 
I'm going to stick with the living. I would choose Pope Benedict and Brian Kelly. Pope Benedict is my spiritual leader and Brian Kelly is another one of my leaders, being a Notre Dame football fanatic. I would like to have dinner with Pope Benedict because he's such an interesting intellectual and he has such an important and challenging job. And I would have dinner with Brian Kelly primarily because I have lots of advice on how he should call football plays. In particular, we need to have a renewed focus on the run, and we need to not pass the ball on third and short or at the end of games with quarterbacks without much experience. 
TiVhnt is the one thing eve1yone should know about the U.S. economy today? 
I think that an overarching issue is thelooming fiscal crisis that we have in this country. We spend waymore than we take in and we have a ballooning national debt, and we've seen what these debt crises can do in other countries. There's a tende~cy for politicians to promise "free lunches." One ofthe central messages of economics is that there is no such thing-as a "free lunch," and we have to pay for those services that we get. The U.S. is looking at one of three things that are going to happen in the future: we're either going to have reduced government expenditures and services on public goods, increasing taxes that could cripple economic activity and innovation, or we're going to have high inflation. There are tough choices that we must make, and I think the more informed individuals are about those choices and the alternatives, the better the decision we can come to as a country will be. 
What is one thing mostpeople don't know aboutyou? When I was a college student at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas, I printed out a picture of then-head coach Bob Davie and taped it to the wall above my bed in my dorm room for inspiration. I got all B's that semester. @
