EDNOTES 
TO STUDY ABROAD OR NOT TO STUDY ABROAD ... 
As a veteran ofND's London program, I can't say enough about how much I loved my study abroad experience. I returned to campus last spring with lots of great new friends and full of fond memories I could never have made at ND: a sunny afternoon spent splashing in the Mediterranean, countless nights dancing at O'Neill's in Chinatown, sipping wine as we watched the sun set over Tuscany ... oh, and that whole going to class right next to the National Gallery and Trafalgar Square thing was pretty cool, too. 
My bank account, however, was not so full upon my return to campus. I blame the nasty exchange rate. 
Exchanging my life's savings for the most amazing 4 months of my life turned 
out to be worth it for me. But to help you underclassmen out, we've devoted this 
issue's cover package, pages 16-22, to the study abroad experience at ND. Study 
up and enjoy. 
FOR THE REST OF YOU 
Ifyou've already gone abroad or have decided it's not for you, fear not -we haven't forgotten you. Definitely check out staff photographer Haley Beaupre's photos from Europe on pages 14-15. You'll feel like you've been there. And we've packed the rest of the issue with plenty of campus content, from sportswriter Andy Gray's analysis of biogs like NDNation on pages 28-29 to staff writer Jason G'Sell's story about the PSA's new push for a free speech zone on Fieldhouse Mall. Associate Editor Maddy Zollo's adventures in the steam tunnels on page 24 is a don't-miss as well. 
TOOT-TOOT 
Yes, that's us tooting our own horn. For the first time, the Associated Collegiate 
Press has awarded Scholastic a Pacemaker award. The fall 2007 issue we submitted­
placed in the top 5 out of 78 newsmagazine entries from colleges across the nation. 
A big congratulations to last year's staff! And especially to our former editors-in­chief Amy Meyers and Doug Schlarman -I hope Amy can hear us singing her· · praises all the way in her cushy P&G office in Cincinnati, and fingers crossed that 
all that neon in the Big Apple isn't outshining the rays of love we're sending to 
Doug, in his first year of law school at Fordham. Can you tell we miss you?

Heating Up

the Scene 
ND students show a passion for glass 
Maria Sellers 
They call themselves the "Hottest Club on Campus." But the Glass Club ofNotre Dame does more than heat up the breadth of activities at Our Lady's university. It also lights a torch on a centuries-old studio art form. 
Senior engineering student Bryce Chong founded the Glass Club last year. After working with glass in high school, he brought the art to Notre Dame's campus. 
Every Tuesday and Wednesday from 8 to 10 p.m., students with majors ranging from engineedng to business to art studio gather in Jordan 106 to participate in this creative outlet. 
Notre Dame graduate student Shawn O'Neill says, "The club is pretty relaxing. After using your head all day, it is nice to be able to work with your hands." 
The club currently does etching, lampworking, stained glassmaking, beadmaking and slumping, a process that uses increasing temperature to "slump" a mould with the force of gravity. The club hopes to add glass blowing by next year. 
Sophomore business major Kelly Jones says her favorite piece is "a fused blue, green and white patchwork patterned plate, developed through slumping." 
Advisor Dr. Douglas Miller, an analytic chemistry professor, uses the club in a more practical manner. It serves as a learning tool, and he hopes the club will be able to repair some of the many pieces of chemical glassware broken each year. 
Chong believes there is something for everyone in glass art because ofits value as both an art and a science. While the majority of the members are students and faculty, community members are also welcome to participate. Membership is $65 per semester or $10 per session. Open studio sessions are normallyheld in Jordan 106, but trips are sometimes inade to area glass shops and exhibits. The small meeting sizes (typically 25 people) provide members with the opportunity for one-on-one instruction. Semester exhibitions are also held during which students can sell or showcase their exquisite achievements. · 
Chong says, "Come check it out. The most that could happen is you become addicted to glass-making." 0

Diversity in Leadership 
NO students participate in ~PMG leadership program 
Maggie Hagan 





I ,.
t's no secret that Notre Dame students are considered to be among the 
most talented in the country, and junior Saida Khan and sophomores 
Jessica Olivas and Jasmine Williams recently reinforced this reputation. They are among 51 students chosen nationwide as Future Diversity Leaders (FDL) by the audit, tax and advisory firm KPMG. The FDL program's objective is to "attract talented and high-achieving freshman and sophomore students" who, according to the organization's recruitment flier, have "demonstrated a commitment to diversity and who are interested in future career opportunities at KPMG." 
In order to be considered for this program, candidates must have at least a 3.5 G.P.A., intend to pursue a career in business and submit an application and essay to Associate Professor and KPMG Faculty Fellow Dr. Sandra C. Vera-Munoz, who then determines whether to nominate the student for the program based on his or her· qualifications and a personal interview. In the interview, Dr. Vera-Munoz assesses the students based on their skills in "communications, leadership, teamwork and time-management," along with their "level of professionalism" and how interested they are in pursuing a career in public accountancy. 
As a result of their selection for xhe program, Khan, Olivas and Williams participated in a leadership conference in Hollywood, Calif., this past summer, where they networked with KPMG employees ahd fellow FDL participants. After the conference, the students received a $1,000 scholarship and became eligible for KPMG's trainee program, an internship for next summer. 


Snatching the Snitch 
Quidditch enthusiasts s·eek university recognition 
Lisa Bucior
It started as a joke last semester when a group of Harry Potter-loving friends decided to play the wizard sport Quidditch. Now, Notre Dame . Quidditch players are taking the next step: The group is applying for official club status through the Student Activities Office (SAO). · "It would certainly help with the expenses," junior Elizabeth Dillon, one of the organizers for the Quidditch Undergraduate Association For Fantasy Loving Enthusiasts (QUAFFLE), says. Currently, QUAFFLE's three unofficial leaders cover all costs, which can quickly add up considering the supplies needed: three different balls, six goal posts made from hula hoops and PVC pipes, an outfit for the human snitch, capes and sweatbands to designate teams and positions, brooms for each of the 14 players, and two extra brooms in case some are damaged in the high­contact sport. "Our wallets like the idea of [SAO] paying for our fun right now," Dillon says. The group also wants to start playing matches against Quidditch teams from other universities, including Ohio State University and the University of Michigan. · "We have to get out there and show them what ND is worth," senior Colin Fath, another QUAFFLE organizer, says. 0

NEWS 
Mary Kaminski 
When women's boxing first arrived on campus in 1996, it was an "instructional program" made up 
of about 50 participants. Aimee Catrow, a fourth-year architecture student at the time, persuaded the university to allow women to take part in a sport that had been a tradition for the men on campus since the days of Knute Rockne. Now, 12 years later, the women's boxing program has evolved into a recognized club, raising thousands of dollars for the Holy Cross Missions in East Africa each year with its annual Fight Night. 
This year, the Notre Dame Women's Boxing Club will celebrate another first in the program's history. For the first time, the exhibition fights will take place in the Joyce Athletic and Convocation Center's CTACC) fieldhouse, a privilege that has previously been a hallmark of the men's program. 
With the help of eight female captains and several students and volunteers from the men's program, the 70 women in this year's club meet each evening for a two-hour workout to prepare them for the exhibition bouts. Beginning with conditioning and gradually moving to footwork, form, hitting and spars, the women go through the season learning the sport in a safe and structured environment. 
"Determination is the word for the women," Jimmy Rogers, a RecSports administrator in charge of both the men's and women's programs, says. 
Lauren Cummings, a senior accounting major, women's boxing captain and club co­·president, is in her third year as a member ofthe club and has played an instrumental role in the structure and organization of the group. "The first year I participated it was mostly individual, working my [butt] off to win my fight. In the second year, as a captain, it was more about teaching people and leading by example. This year, I have to worry about setting up practices, setting up the Bouts and making sure everyone is safe," Cummings says. 

NEWS 
The women prepare for the exhibition fight night with several weeks of sparring_. in practice. The boxers are divided into groups based on size and compete in three two-minute rounds of fighting. The spars are designed to simulate real boxing matches so that the competitors can gain endurance needed during the exhibition fight, when the rounds will decrease to a minute and a half. 
"While it is still a very social club, and we are boxing for East Africa, we are starting to be taken more seriously as a boxing club. Everyone has been working really hard. Sparring has become an even bigger part of the club and taken more seriously," senior captain and marketing major Liz Pike says. 
In the past, the women's fight night was in one of the small auxiliary. gymnasiums located on the upper floor of the JACC. Through new recruiting and marketing initiatives implemented by Cummings, Pike and the six other captains (senior Co­President Nicole Koors, senior KC Hunt, juniors Kristin Burke, Rebecca Neville, Kia Johnson and sophomore Kayla Bishop), the "\Vomen's Boxing Club was able to gain the money and club legitimacy needed to move the fights to theJACC fieldhouse. 
The club impressed the administration last year by raising $9,000 for East Africa Holy Cross Missions -twice as much as the previous season. That combined with the captains' motivation to raise awareness about the club allowed them to consider the possibility of the bigger arena for fight night. 
"I think it's been a long time coming. We may not have as many people as the guys, but the people we do have are just as dedicated as any male boxer. It is nice that we are finally having fights that are closer to being on their level," Cummings says. 
The first thing the captains wanted to do was increase awareness about the club on campus. "We went door to door around campus, especially targeting freshmen to increase the awareness of the club. As a freshman, I had no idea the club existed," Pike says. 
But numbers aren't the only thing the women needed to gain legitimacy. Using the fieldhouse arena costs a substantial amount more than the auxiliary gyms. The women hope to raise more money through advertisement sales in their first-ever Fight Night event program. 
"Some people might say we are taking away from the cause by spending the money to hold it in the fieldhouse, but by making it a more legit event, it will end up raising more money," Pike says. With the increased seating allowance, the club hopes to bring in more fans than in past years when there was standing room only. The club promoted the event with eye-catching posters featuring photography by senior Laurie Hunt. 
The fight night will take place Friday, Nov. 7 at 6:00 p.m. Tickets are on sale ahead of time for three dollars and at the door for five dollars. This will also mark the first year the eventwill be held on a weekend night, which will make it easier for parents and friends to attend the event from out of town. 
"With all of our fans and good lighting, hopefully it will actually feel like a real event. Especially since we only have one night, it should be really special," Cummings says. 0

Big names light up the marquee at South Bend's Morris Performing Arts Center 
Caitlin Wilson 
. Ask most freshmen where to find the nearest big-name theater show or concert, and they will probably tell you to hop on the South Shore Line to Chicago. But, as some upperclassmen have discovered, South Bend's Morris Performing Arts Center features notable events on a weekly basis. Consistently ranked in the top 100 theaters in America, the Morris will host acts as diverse as the Broadway hit "Spamalot" and country star Willie Nelson this academic year. In one of the biggest concerts of the fall season, former Beach Boy Brian Wilson is scheduled to perform at the Morris on Nov. 13. 
While the Morris offers countless exciting events, many students do not take advantage of these opportunities. For some, transportation can be a problem. After seeing the Morris on a bus tour of South Bend during her first week on campus, freshman Rachel Hamilton says, "I would definitely go back to the Morris to see a show if I could find a ride." 
To counteract this issue, several clubs on campus sponsor trips to the Morris, as do certain classes. Bus tours of South Bend may also include a showing of the South Bend Symphony Orchestra. But for others, transportation is less of an issue. Junior Michelle Comas says she saw both "Hairspray" and "Chicago" at the Morris and plans to attend again. 
Even more enticing, discounted shows are sometimes available to students. Mary Ellen Smith, assistant director of administration and marketing for the Morris, says, "The iVIorris rents the theater to promoters [ ... ] Promoters own the tickets to their individual shows and sometimes offer discounts. Each show is different. For example, South Bend Symphony Orchestra is one of the local promoters, and they do offer student discounts." 
This year, the Morris had a full house for Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons, Crosby, Stills & Nash and the puppet comedian Jeff Dunham. Smith says, "Staff work with promoters to bring big-name stars to the Morris. We strive to offer a wide variety ofentertainment for patrons." 
Upcoming events include jazz pianist Jim Brickman, Christian rock band Third Day and former Doobie Brothers lead singer Michael McDonald, in addition to Nelson, "Spamalot" and "\Nilson. Tickets are available at morriscenter.ticketforce.corri.

COVER STORY 
.. 
Taking Flight 
Sara Felsenstein 
In 2004 the Association oflnternational Educators (NAFSA) ranked Notre Dame in the top six most internationalized university campuses in the country. This award is a reflection ofthe study abroad program and of how internationalization pervades every aspect ofstudent life, including academics and on-and off-campus programs. In addition, Notre Dame is recognized as having an outstanding study abroad program in the annual Open Doors Report on International Ed1tcational Exchange. Each year approximately 1,400 Notre Dame students study abroad, and more than half of all Notre Dame undergraduates study abroad before graduation. The reasons for going abroad vary by student: to learn a new language, do independent research and study, get exposed to another culture, expand one's worldview or participate in a unique internship. There was once a time, however, when jetting away from South Bend for a semester or a year wasn't so easy. In 1964 Notre Dame had just one abroad location in Innsbruck, Austria. The program soon expanded to include bases in: Nagoya, Japan; Angers, France; and London, England. Since then, the program has grown and improved tremendously, now maintaining e~tablished bases in over 40 different locations in 20 countries. Many other universities boast that they send students wherever their hearts desire. One unique aspect of Notre Dame's program is that students wishing to go abroad are generally confined to the established locations. That isn't to say that studying elsewhere is impossible, but Notre Dame places great emphasis on keeping the quality of life and learning at each of the established locations high. Kathleen Opel, director of the Office of International Studies, says, "We have very focused opportunities for our students. There are many other universities that allow you to go almost anywhere, but_ we try to focus on having good relations with our host universities." The most popular abroad programs include London, Dublin, Rome and Australia. According to Opel, these programs can accommodate many different students' interests with their broad array of classes. And of course, the travel opportunities in Europe and Australia add to the programs' appeal. In an effort to continue expanding study abroad opportunities for students, Notre Dame will reopen its Jerusalem Program in the summer of 2009 for the first time since 2000. Students will study at the Ecumenical Institute for Theological Studies at Tantur, which is located on the road from Jerusalem to Bethlehem. About 10 students will have the opportunity to study at the site. As notable as the Notre Dame study abroad programs are, Opel says, "We're always looking to improve. There's a real focus on undergraduate research. Opportunities abroad can be pathways to something bigger and 
better ~ater on [in the student's career]." 0

even could in America. I could buy souvenirs 
without worrying about my budget. I did not 
make money on my stipend, but I was able to 
save most of the money I brought myself." 
In contrast, students studying for a 
semester in London routinely report 
spending anywhere from $5,000 to upwards 
of $10,000 of their own money. 
The OIS acknowledges that these 
discrepancies can pose problems for students. "We're cognizant of it, of course," Opel says. "What we're asking you to do as students is to budget wisely, to be aware of where you are 
going and what the costs are." 
Opel also suggests that students take 
advantage of campus resources and 
undergraduate research grants that can help 
them make the most of their experience. "All 
financial aid and scholarsl-iips, everything that 
you have when you're here at Notre Dame, 
you're covered as far as that goes," Opel says. "Ifyou're looking for additional supplements, I would say you should definitely talk within the campus." 


desirable for the students. It's like here; you 
might get assigned to one dorm that is brand 
new and beautiful and has air conditioning, 
or you might be_ assigned to a dorm that 
doesn't. And you'll pay the same." 
Opel says that the goal of the OIS is to create an even playing field. But it is no secret that forces outside the control _of the OIS quickly ~omplicate this scenario. Vastly different costs of living (housing, tuition at local universities, food and drink, travel, entertainment, etc.) and constantly fluctuating exchange rates of the various currencies can cause prob_lems. 
According to ·Opel,_ the majority of 
progra~s. provide students with a monthly 
stipend of about $400, regardless of the 
specific cost of living and exchange rates. 
Senior Chinese · major Emerson Cofell­
Dwyei ;tudied abroad in Beijing last spring. "With my stipend I was able to cover the cost of food, transportation and other living expenses with a little left over to hit the town on the weekends," Cofell-Dwyer says in an e-mail. "I was able to afford luxuries like 
Country-specific scholarships can also be found under the "financial" tab on the OIS Web site. 
Although the financial aspect of studying abroad is complicated and sometimes seems convoluted, Opel emphasizes that the OIS is ultimately working to arrange the best possible experience for all students in each program. 
Like all other divisions and departments inside the university, the OIS works with the administration to develop a proper budget for its office. "We are not a profit-making organization, and transparency is important. We do not receive the tuitions of only the students going abroad," says Opel. "It's not based on how many students do we send abroad, do we get that much money. The budget is established before we accept any students." 
Moral of the story: Do your research, and prepare your pocketbook accordingly. And don't let the bedbugs bite.

Studying abroad was the best decision I've made in my time at Notre Dame. I chose to take advantage ofthis opportunity because it provided me with a chance to live in a culture different from the U.S. and gain invaluable international experience. I felt that studying abroad would give me a better understanding of society on an international level, and it would become relevant to any future work l did within the business world. It was an opportunity to learn not only about the customs and culture ofanother country but also about myself. My experience in the Notre Dame London Program was the best four months of my life. I was able to see so many things I would never have been able to see in the States. From ballets to pubs to Shakespeare plays in the Globe, every day was a new experience. The ability to travel throughout Europe was• also a major component in my decision to study abroad. I visited several different countries including Sweden . and the ech Republic. The opportunity to meet so many new people · and become involved in something other than the Notre Dame community made the entire experience worthwhile. Studying hr-oad also helped to make me more tolerant of cultures and

It's my junior year, and with my already-abroad friends updating their European travel blogs and plastering Face book with seemingly-endless pub crawl pictures, and my other classmates excitedly planning their spring semester jaunts, I'm often asked where I will be studying abroad. And the answer is nowhere. College, the "shortest, gladdest years of life," goes by quickly enough in eight semesters that I am really not comfortable offering a precious semester or two up to the gods of study abroad. Aside from my separation anxiety from the university, there are real financial implications to ponder as well. HI am paying for an elite university education and not attending this elite university, what kind of monetary loss am I incurring? (I know you can't put a price on experiences, blah, blah, but you should at least know what you are paying for them). Some people say that they won't be able to afford to travel when they graduate and are saddled with student loan debt. But to be fair, they aren't exactly going abroad for free. Tuition is no bargain, and they are still paying for their travel expenses. So maybe it's that they won't be able to afford to travel when they are disconnected from that parental cash flow. A

DEPARTMENT OF TUNNELS 
Late one evening in 1962, a band of Farley residents snuck down to the dorm's basement with the plan to invade Cavanaugh Hall. Realizing it was too risky to enter through one of Cavanaugh's main doors, they decided to infiltrate their enemy's territory via the tunnel system. After picking the lock to an unmarked door, the attackers entered a nearly pitch-black hallway, trekking though the darkness until they had crossed North Quad under ground and reached another metal door. The Farley men burst out of the tunnel and ran up the stairs in order to catch the Cavanaugh Crusaders off guard. Much to their dismay, the Crusaders repelled the Farley invaders by spraying them with fire hoses until they retreated back underground. 
These types of shenanigans used to occur in the steam tunnel network that runs beneath our beloved university. But now, the tunnels are merely another murky legend in Notre Dame's history. In order to investigate, I was given permission to tour this notorious underground system that spans an impressive 6.8 miles. Entering through a barred door in the power plant, I follow my tour guide, Plant Manager John Brown, into the shadowy southeast tunnel. Decrepit-looking pipes run against one wall, and thick cable and power cords hang from the other. The floor is covered with puddles of old rainwater and dried pools of tar. Strips ofyellow caution tape dangle from the ceiling to warn people of pipes that protrude from the wall, sticking out in such a way that you have to squeeze your body between them in order to pass. It's hard to believe, but John tells me this is one of the nicer tunnels. In others, I would have to .. be crawling on my hands and knees or slopping across dirt £lo.ors. 
As I climb over a particularly big pipe, the flashlight flickers over some graffiti etched into the wall that reads: "Dillon sucks and Denny does too." There is a hand-drawn picture of a naked woman next to it. We forge on in the excruciating hundred-degree heat, winding around corners and ducking beneath wires, until I finally ask where we are. John tells me we are under Breen-Phillips. Then I see a picture of a pig on a nearby pipe ... I should have guessed. 
"Now this area," John says, pointing towards a clearing behind some pipes, "is where tunnel parties were held." Tunnel parties were apparently a common occurrence in years past. Couches and tables would be dragged down from the dorms, lamps and radios would be plugged into the decaying outlets in the wall, and students would drink and dance past parietals in the sweltering heat without anyone knowing. That was until the tunnel workers caught on to these antics by the empty beer cans left behind. And ofcourse, until the university decided that it was a liability for drunk students to run around in tunnels meant only to house utilities. 
Even though the days of dorm invasions and infamous tunnel parties seem to have passed, the graffiti on the pipes and walls serve as a reminder of the forgotten glories that occured beneath the manicured quads in this dark and sweltering labyrinth.

Day ofthe Dead 
Molly Conaty 
If you're looking for an excuse to go visit the building with the big black statue outside it (a.k.a. the Snite Museum of Art), this is your chance. Throughout the month of November, the museum will display its eighth annual Day of the Dead collection. The Day of the Dead (El Pin de losJMuei-tos in Spanish) is a traditional Mexican celebration that honors the deceased while-simultaneously celebrating life. It is similar to the Catholic holiday ofAll Saint's Day but looks more exotic with colors, skulls, bones and the chance to hear family stories. Go learn about Mexican culture and check out the ofrenda, or altar, that artist Eric Chavez Santiago created. Altars like Santiago's are symbolic in the Mexican culture. They recall the past while embracing the future. This work will be displayed in the museum's collection alongside other traditional memorials. 0 
Where Dome and Day Collide 
Henry Vasquez 
Fresh talent comes Notre Dame's way as young pop artist Howie Day performs at Legends on Friday, Nov. 7 at 10 p.m. The 27-year­old singer-songwriter is a star on the rise, with a handful of small singles and a great track titled "Collide" that has built a decent play count at Notre Dame. With inspiration from Dave Matthews, Jeff Buckley and Radiohead, Howie Day is a musician built for the tastes of our student body. 
Day's mastery lies in his use of contrast, lending to an exceptional concert presence that has you listening closer and singing along. Friday could be your chance to see America's next big pop star. So grab a date, take a Friday off and share in some thoughtful, heartwarming tunes. 0 
Rising Comic Star at Legends on Saturday 
Mike Tresnowski 
Stand-up comic Aziz Ansari will perform at Legends Saturday, Nov. 8 at 10 p.m. Like most ofLegends' comic acts, Ansari is a rising star. He's slated to appear in the rumored spinoff of "The Office," as well as a Judd Apatow film. While he may be playing in small clubs now, 11e could very well be mentioned alongside names like Steve Carell, Seth Rogan and Rainn Wilson in the near future. 
The strength of Ansari's stage act is his temperament. He's comfortable interacting with a crowd. It feels like he is having a conversation with you, not just regurgitating written material. In clips I've seen of him at college clubs, he's not afraid to break from his planned performance to improvise some jokes. In one video on YouTube, Ansari makes fun of a man in the crowd who's filming him. These spontaneous moments in a stand-up show are often the funniest. 
His material, however, is only above average. A great standup comedian makes you see your everyday experiences in a completely different light. It seems that too often, the light-Ansari sheds is not all that new. The punch lines are often a little predictable, but Ansari makes up for weak material with a strong delivery. While his jokes may not seem funny in taped performances, Ansari knows how to play to a live audience. And given the likely trajectory of Ansari's career, this show could be a unique opportunity to catch hlm~~ 0 
Bloc Party Fuses Past and Present in New Album 
Majia Gustin 
The British band Bloc Party is generally known for energetic and melodic guitar-driven rock. They continue to deliver on their latest album, "Intimacy." It serves as a crossover between their first album, "Silent Alarm," and their second release, "Weekend in the City," combining the artful lyrics and catchy hooks of the former with the heavier and more diverse sound of the latter. 
The first single, "Mercury," is perhaps a little too experimental, but· where that song fails, many come to pick up the slack. "Halo" and "Signs" show the band's ability to create a lush melody, while "Ion Square" and "Talons" show Bloc Party's maturation without straying too far from their roots. "Ares" features raw guitar chants and pounding drums that demonstrate the new direction Bloc Party is beginning to take. 
This album is hit or miss -some songs are great, while others fall flat. But it demonstrates the growth that Bloc Party has made and shows the whole breadth of their sound. "Intimacy" is only a taste ofwhat is to come from an innovative band and is well worth the listen. Pick it up on Bloc Party's Web site or head over to iTunes for a preview. 0

ND students take to the streets in the 2008 ·Chicago Marathon 
Claire Kenney 
The city of Chicago hosted its 41st annual marathon on Oct. 12. Among those crossing the finish line this year were students from the University of Notre Dame. The typical events of race day are familiar to them: the buzzing anticipation, the inspiration of the national anthem, fierce focus and a unique bond formed with other contestants. 
Running a marathon requires preliminary steps, including a training schedule to build endurance for the race's 26-mile route. Junior Scott Andrews trained for months to "conquer Chicago." He later revised his statement, saying, "The more I think about it, the more I realize that it c_an't be conquered because the marathon isn't what we are fighting against. It is the battle ground upon which we fight against the best and worst that is inside ofus." 
Many agree with Andrews that the Chicago Marathon is not only a test of athleticism but also a test of mentality. As junior Catherine Casey says, "Getting out of bed to train early in the morning can be a challenge in itself." 
Regardless ofone's motives for running the marathon, each said he or she felt a sense of accomplishment throughout his or her journey to the finish line. Junior Nadeem Haque says, "The day of the race was awesome. Every time I saw one of my supporters during the race it gave me an extra energy boost. I definitely want to do it again next year." 
For those inspired to compete next year, here is some advice from Irish marathoners themselves: 
Matt B11rtindale1 Ju11ior: "Drink a lot of water, and don't go out too fast. There's nothing worse than reaching mile 20, hitting the wall and still having six miles to go." 
Renee Rineb111·t1 J1mio1·: "Listen to your b?dy." 
N11dee11t H111JUC1 Junio1·: "There are-so many external forces you can't control. Don't get too hard on yourself. Keep doing it." 
Catbe1·i11e Ca1ey1 Jttnior: "Stick with it. It's hard, but all the work, effort and early mornings pay off in the end when you can't even describe Jhe feeling of accomplishment." 
S&ott A11drew11 Jttnior: "I prefer to think that we train for marathons our· entire lives. To be marathoners we must know enough about our souls to learn how to push beyond what our bodies think they can accomplish." 
SPORTS 

Irish fans take to the streets -the information highways, that is. 
Andy Gray 
If we didn't know from the fact that NBC carried every home game ofa 3-9 football season to a national audience, we know it now: . Notre Dame athletes are household names. The audiences to which sophomore quarterback Jimmy Clausen and junior forward · Luke Harangody play include fourth-generation Domers as well as fans who have been to campus once and fallen in love with the place. And now they can all connect with one another through the mysterious magic of the Internet. NDNation began in 1995 as an e-mail exchange regarding football recru1tmg between a few contributors. In just a few years, it has grown into a site for Irish fans across the nation to network, blog and discuss the news concerning Our Lady's university, centering on athletics. Such a site is bound to develop both a large base of contributors and a wide audience, and these include people in all places and situations who care about Notre Dame. "A number of our posters are current or former employees at Notre Dame in various 
28 I SCHOLASTIC I 6 NOVEMBER 2008 
departments," NDNation representative Mike Coffey says. "We're fortunate to have a very robust electronic community." 
But such an expansive free exchange is bound to include less-than-savory characters with less-than-perfect information. Earlier this year, Athletic Director Jack Swarbrick expressed this concern to Scholastic: 
"The faceless, nameless online handle that doesn't identify the author is not a good th.ing," Swarbrick says. "There are a lot of great sources out there ... but there are also a lot of people who get online and make a representation that is not true." 
All manner of rumors can find wide readership on these forums, and it may be impossible to know anything about the authors. According to Athletics Director for Media and Broadcast John Heisler, the university must at times step in to correct the record. 
Of course, the more reputable sites with the longest histories are run by people who have experience dealing with these incidents. Many times the reputation of the university is just as important to the site moderators as it is to Swarbrick and Heisler. 
"If a post purports to have inside information or something else controversial, we do our best to vet the poster," Coffey says. "The vast majority of our participants are educated professionals who care deeply · about all aspects of Notre Dame, not just football wins and losses." There will always be room in the "blogosphere" for writers to . say whatever they wish, and many run with incidents like the surfacing of Clausen's 
"Beer Olympics" photos. But NDNation and similar outlets do what they can to uphold Notre ])ame's image. 
It's. not, however, all disinformation (or damage) control when it comes to Notre Dame's interaction with fan sites and blogs. 
"Many of them are useful gauges in terms of knowing what the hot-button issues are amongst our fan and alumni bases," Heisler says. No one can deny the significance of the desires ofIrish fans and alumni; they are the ones filling the seats in Notre Dame Stadium and the Joyce Center, after all. And one way 

SPORTS 
for those fans to make their voices heard is 
through forums like NDNation. .. 
"We're aware that NDN is read by various administrators . . . We believe this can be a very beneficial thing," Coffey says. "The administrators have an opportunity to see in an unvarnished manner how their constituents are reacting to their 
leadership." 
It makes sense to keep an ear to the 
thoughts of the fans, but can forums like 
Coffey's really have an impact on the policies 
and approaches of those they discuss? 
He believes they already have. 
"We believe we've been able to affect 
change or at least raise the profile on 
issues such as the tailgating problems this 
season [ concerning a perceived crackdown 
on activities by Excise Police] and future 
football scheduling philosophies," Coffey 
says. 
This potential for influence gives rise to 
important questions. Where will the line 
be drawn on fans' say in matters of sports 
administration, and who will draw it? 
When does the interest of the program itself 
outweigh the desires of alumni? 
Contributors to sites like NDNation seem 
to want to avoid necessitating that these questions be decisively answered by Notre Dame administrative force. For instance, Coffey states that his site refrains as a rule from making contact with any student­athlete or recruit. "That path is fraught with peril, not the least ofwhich is the possibility of getting Notre Dame in trouble with the NCAA. So we prefer to stay out of that," he says. 
So what is the verdict concerning NDNation and its fellow hubs of Irish fan communication like The Blue-Gray Sky and Irish Eyes as Notre Dame media administrators see it? It's all about feedback, Heisler says. "Communication with [fans and alumni] is a priority for us ... Certainly there's immediate feedback on anything that happens relative to Notre Dame athletics [on these sites]. If you're looking for that sort of feedback, you can find all you want." And the dual facets of openness and immediacy that characterize the communication on sites like N.DNation make them ideal outlets for fans and useful resources for administrators. 
To prevent the illusion that these venues are completely concerned with ardent and critical sports fanhood, however, we must recall the personal side of these communications. NDNation and sites of 
its kind foster cohesion in the Notre Dame 
community and bring people together in 
their love of the institution. Sometimes, as 
Coffey will tell you, these communities lay 
the groundwork for other kinds of love. 
"Our primary goal as a site is to provide 
a forum in which people can share their thoughts and op1mons about things associated with Notre Dame," Coffey says. "As our community grows and matures, it furthers that goal. Along the way, people forge new relationships both with us and with each other. This summer, two people who met on our message boards will be 
getting married." 
In the end, it's about supporting Notre 
Dame in the best way these fans a:rid community members know how. Ifblogging and posting can improve the policies of athletic programs or connections amongst the fans, that's all the better. "It's easy to toss around phrases like 'Internet lunatics' and 'the electronic fringe' and other derogatory dismissals I've heard from some ND folks," Coffey says. "But I hope people are interested in 'thinking about the issues raised by sites like ours rather than avoiding them." 0

The first semester of freshman year can be quite a challenging transition -just ask freshman golfer Max Scodro. Scodro has had to balance entering· college, choosing a major and making new friends with playing a varsity sport. He recently became the first Irish freshman to win a 54-hole tournament at the UNCG Bridgestone Collegiate Championship, scoring a personal best of 213 at three under par. With this win, Scodro became the first ND freshman to win a tournament since former Irish golfer Brennan Murphy scored an 18-hole _victory in 1990. 
The transition fro11l high school to college can often be difficult. How hard has it been balancing golfwith yourfirst se111ester ofcollege? 
It has been really hard, but I've developed some time management skills, and I've gotten better at it. At first it was really challenging because it was so much, so fast, but I've definitely gotten better at balancing the two as time's gone on. 
With all ofthe ti111e you have had to dedicate to golf, do you think you are missing out on the "nor111al" college experience? 
I'm having so much fun doing both, but is it the norm? No, it's not. But that's not to say I'd change it for anything. I love it. I love it so much. 
What was it like being the first Irish freshman to ever win a 54-hole tournament? 
On the last hole I bogeyed, so I thought I blew it completely. When I found out I tied I was really happy, but at first I was just really shocked. I worked really hard this tournament, and it was a big grind, so I was really happy winning it. 
You seem really passionate a.bout your sport. Can you describe what you love about golf? 
I've been playing it since I was really little, but I played all sports through my freshman year [ of high school]. It came down to soccer or golf, and I thought it would be fun to play golf with my older brother. Sometimes I wish I played soccer, but I'm glad I picked golf because it's so much fun. It's so hard, but the harder you work at it, the more it pays off. 
What mal,es golfsuch a·dif.ficult sport? 
You can have the _be~t swing,_ and you can have the best short game, but if yoµ're not mentally prepared, you are not going to play well. It's a game that tests your mental strength, and you can never prepare for that. That's the toughest part for sure. 
_ You have three 111ore years ofIrish golf. What are your goals far the team? 
I would like for our team to ge.t into a top-25 ranking, and I'd like for us to win a Big East Championship and make it to Nationals for the first time since they changed the system [in the 1970s]. I think we can, too, especially if our team keeps maturing; we'll definitely have a really good shot at it. As an individual, I'd like to stay steady and contribute to the team. · 
Getting a hole-in-one must be one ofthe most challenging feats in all ofsports. Have you ever scored one? 
I have not-one day, hopefully. We'll see. Me, my dad and my brother have all been playing forever, and none of us have gotten one. I don't know. Maybe it wasn't meant to be in the Scodro family.

Have you ever wondered why Holy Cross Hall is no more? Neither had I. That is, until a recent run around St. Mary's Lake when I spotted the oh-so-inconspicuous headstone-like structure· commemorating the site where the dorm stood until it burned to the ground. (I can just imagine the chagrin of the alum who brings his family to campus to show them a piece of granite and says, "Yep, that's where Grandpa spent the best four years of his life.") With the constant expansion ofthe campus and the opening of dorms like Duncan, we forget about the past Darners who have called Holy Cross, Flanner and Grace Halls home. But apart from the obvious reasons for their closing, (who would have thought 500 guys spread over 20 sections was a bad idea?) I can't help but wonder if the slightly unsavory unofficial traditions of these dorms helped them earn their fates. Although it was never listed on the official SAO calendar of"signature hall events" (what blasphemy!), the men of Holy Cross Hall took holiday spirit to a whole new level with their version of the Nativity. "What's so bad about that?" you might ask. Cavanaugh puts on a Christmas pageant every December. Yes, but does Cavanaugh do it in the nude? I think not.

Boo! Hello there, little Gippling. So here we stand: All Hallow's Eve 2008 has come and gone, and whether you have retained memories of it or not, chances are that those photos ofyou sleeping outside the Dillon Chapel in your Smurf costume will be hard to erase. Gipp loves Halloween, the one holiday that he can sneak into parties with his ghost-like ways and get down, unnoticed, with the best ofyou. This year he was especially fond of the abundance of Alaskans and pregnant teenagers, though he could have done without the trolls and sexy fisherwoman (who, it must be said, repeatedly mooned him during the refrains of Kid Rock's "Sweet Home Alabama" -Gipp don't take that kind ofbait). Halloween is scary enough as it is. Which reminds the Gipp ... you never know what)ies beneath, and you never know what lies beyond .,. the state lines of Louisiana. Some weekends, when the luck ofthe Irish is particularly strong, an adventuring boy does not even need to wear a Barack Obama mask in order to procure himself a choice lady. One night, this stroke ofluck befell our dear Harold (the Gipp has chosen this name arbitrarily because the American population has neglected it). Harold was lucky enough to pick the prettiest metaphorical pig in the whole pig pen, who returned his coy advances with welcome enthu-siasm and a night time dorm room invitation. SCORE. Back in the dorm, the young lovers rushed into the darkness of the room, too enamoured to bother with electricity (they had so much of their O)Vn!). Miss Metaphorical Piggy, setting herself down on the couch, pulled Harold on top of her in order to continue their festival of passion. The love continued uninterrupted for a good 15 seconds, when one voice rang out and shattered the, until then, silent interaction: "Umm ... hello?" Harold understood that voice immediately -it was inevitably the voice of an offended roommate, begging love to be extinguished from her domain. Harold waited for his adored one to make a move of exit, but Miss Metaphorical Piggy continued her zest, so Harold, confident in her judgment, continued to embrace his opportunity and opportune one. But the voice would not die, and 10 seconds later it rang out again: "Umm ... excuse me?" And since Harold had not yet opened his eyes, and since Harold's eyes had not had a chance to adjust to the dark, and since Harold had not paused the. love consummation and was consequently unable to reason until this moment, what·happened next was quite a shock. Finally opening his eyes, Harold saw not two, but four eyes beneath him on the couch. Apparently, in her lusty fervor,_ Miss Metaphorical Piggy had failed to realize that the couch was already booked for the night. And apparently, even when Miss Metaphorical Piggy did realize that another girl was sleeping on it, this did not stop her from fulfilling her passion with Harold. Miss Metaphorical Piggy made out with a lover while lying on top of her roommate, who must be commended for silently supporting her friend's endeavor for as long as she did. Poor Miss Metaphorical Piggy. It can be difficult to be stuck between a rock and a hard place. 
Our next story takes us to the land of voodoo, Ditka and, of course, MASKS ­the Gipp's favorite October accessory. Then again, the revellers in this story did not make use of any of the above, though perhaps we could give them more credit if any of the three had been involved. As for their savory activities, our festive mob stuck to the traditional wholesome necessities: copious amounts of indulgence, exotic and illicit bars, meeting up with random freshman yacht dance dates wearing multiple beads and letting waitresses "get all up in their grills" (direct quote). One particularly feisty member ofthe mob managed to find himself a particular 4x4x50 gem. The numbers refer to the love interest's purported height in 
feet, purported width in feet and purported 
age. After all, big things come in little 
packages, and certain packages (typically 
wines, cheeses and Lousianan women) only 
get better with age. Not to be outdone, 
another mobster -we'll call him Cougar 
Jack -decided to wingman to the extreme. 
Grabbing a cowbell from the onstage band, 
he shimmied over to 4x4x50's equally elder 
friend and proceeded to get all up in her 
grill (that's at least two grills in one night). 
Cougar Jack whispered the following sweet 
nothings to his lady. Number 1: "Are you 
married?" (response: no); number 2: "Do you 
have a boyfriend?" (again: no); and then, the 
suavest, most irresistible and most daring 
of all commands, number 3: "Then kiss 
me!" And kiss him she did. They kissed and 
kissed and kissed until the sun rose up and 
fell down again. And then they kissed some 
more. And later, Cougar Jack looked back 
and told himself, "No, that was not voodoo. 
She was not wearing a mask. That was not 
Mike Ditka. But that was very real." 
And so my little Gipplings, let no obstacles 
stop your love! Love can indeed be scary, but 
ghosts and goblins, interfering roommates 
and sexually-charged cougars can all be 
overcome. Love conquers all. So stow away 
those masks until next year, and go out and 
face the world as you are. And don't forget, 
Thanksgiving is just around the corner, 
with all the hometown awkwardness and 
Gipp potential you can possibly imagine. 
Remember, the sprinklers may be on timers, 
but you all have the free will to rain down 
your antics for the glory of Notre Dame 
whenever you like. 
A cornucopia full oflove, 
The Gipper

Idon't know if you've noticed, but our crazy stock market just won't stop crashing! As an English major, I get a perverse sense of glee from all the formerly-smug business majors suddenly concerned about job security. (Thought you'd be safe with that marketing degree, huh? HA!) But once gloating started to get a little old, I reluctantly realized that hey, we're all in this together (cue the "High School Musical" soundtrack). I mean, sure, you've laughed in my face about my English major, but I'm a forgiving person (sort of). In the spirit of reconciliation, I thought that perhaps I could lend you some ideas I've entertained for post-graduate employment now that B.A.s in English·-and finance are equally worthless. 
1. Supermarket checker-outer 
Let's be serious, Mr. Accountancy, you'll be much better at this job than I will. It's a really good option for you -as I'd be screwing up-·people's change ·and analyzing the deeper symbolism beneath their purchases, you'd be methodically punching in numbers and robotically calculating totals in your head. I bet you could· even reconcile your cash at the end of the day, while I'd be standing there bewildered, wondering why the computer says I should have $80 when I know these four 20-dollar bills make $100. 
2. Rodeo clown 
Here I might actually have a better shot at being more qualified than you, former devotee of the corporate world. Through numerous humiliating class projects which required me to do things like wear a paper plate on my face while performing an interpretive dance to Toto's "Africa," I've managed to lose all sense of dignity and self­worth. Couple this with a generallack ofself-consciousness thatstems from being forced to read my inner-most feelings in front ofcreative writing classes, and I've got a winning combination. Although I do have a crippling fear of horses, I don't have a ton of backup plans. 
3. Professional ticket scalper 
This job situation relies on forces outside our control, but it is something to think about. IfCharlie can really get the team together, what's to prevent us from taking up permanent residence in South Bend and making a tidy profit off drunks looking for ti~kets? Heyo! We could even work as a team -I sweet talk people while you coldly size them up and decide how to best milk them for maximum profit. This plan is ideal, really. I've always been intrigued by townies, and 
this way, I can become one. 
These are just ideas. I'm trying to help you get the ball rolling. I encourage you to use your own (long dormant) creativity to come up with your own pathetic job prospects. Ifyou have any ideas, send them my way. I'll be the one outside O'Shag holding out the jar labeled "Donations welcome." @

,, Q&A with the IRISH GUARD 
Irish Guard Menzbers: 
Brent Locey (31·d year on Irish Guard) 
Brock Stoffel (3rd year on Irish Guard) 
Pat Sweeney (2nd year on Irish Gtlard) 
Few groups on campus inspire such wild speculation as the Notre Dame Irish Guard. When they appear at football games in the glory of full uniform, it's hard not to wonder, "Just what do they have under those game-day kilts?" Scholastic gets a glimpse into the lives of a few of the men behind one of Notre Dame's greatest traditions. Three senior members of the Irish Guard -captain Brent Locey, Brock Stoffel and Pat Sweeney-reveal all to Assistant Culture Editor Courtney Ball. Well, maybe not quite all of their secrets ... 
S~holastic: One certain way to spot a member
1: I of the Guard is to look for the recently shaved 
I. 
I heads. What exactly is the story behind members shaving their heads? Bre1li Locey: It's the new members who shave their heads each year. They do it because it is known that new guys have it done, and it shows that they have entered our class. Brock Stoffel: It is part of that tradition. As far back as I can remember they have shaved their heads. Pat Sweeney: It's part of the new guys bonding. It's like they become brothers. It's becoming a part ofthat brotherhood. 
S: 
You all obviously love being on Irish Guard, but if you had to think of one, what would be the worst part ofit? BL: All of the attention, the facebook stalking. But really, no one puts on the freshman 15. They take off the IG 10. PS: Yeah, the celebrity status. The worst part, and in a way the best part, is when we go to the away games, and we get to deal with the tomfoolery of the opposing team's fans. That is our job and function, to stop the tomfoolery and the physical violence. 

S: 
The Irish Guard is infamous on campus for its mysteries. Why is there so much secrecy surrounding it? BL: It's all about the myth and mystique. We have heard things over our three years that absolutely aren't true, but we like it because it means they are thinking a lot about us, especially those of the female persuasion. PS: The secrecy is a jealousy type thing. They want to be on the inside, but they are on the outside. A lot of it is rumors and gossip. Like, you don't actually have to be 6 [feet] 8 [inches] to be on the guard. BL: Though we have had some tall glasses of water. 

S: 
What other rumors circulating the campus about you are not true? BL: I have heard people say that we have a 


tradition of monthly sleepovers they call the Pajama Parties with the cheerleaders. 
S: 
Do you have any crazy stories or experiences to share from your time on Irish Guard? BL: Mysophomore year we almost got a penalty for yelling at the refs. We have even made the opposing team's kicker move to the other side ofthe sidelines after they missed a kick because we were heckling them. That is our job.. PS: Really, we are an integral part of the team. BS: At Purdue the ball boy tried to fight us. It actually happens pretty often. 

S: 
So, we have to ask, what exactly do you wear under your kilts? PS: There is definitely a rumor, well there have been plenty of rumors, about the kilts. But that is just one that no one will ever know. I pretty much answer yes to whatever anyone asks. On game day I am basically wearing 73 pairs of underwear based on my responses. Our classic response is, "Ask my captain." BS: That tends to keep the rumors alive. They end up thinking what they want. BL: We have heard ridiculous things ranging from boxers to man thongs. Our response is t~ leave it to the imagination. People walk away with, "I think he said yes, b~t wait ... did he?"
