There are a variety of details to attend to so that -the festival may furictiori smoothly. On campus for a•few ·days, the artists visit classes, talk to groups of· faculty and.·stu­dents, 'party, attend and. give lec­tures. · Prior to all this,. travel arrarigemerits must be ironed ·out, meetings.-. with · literature classes planned, ·meals· arranged, books ·or:. dered, programs published, library display cases organized, books· read and research done:

· works; perhaps alumnus Samuel Hazo's poem, "Breakfasting with Sophomores," is :the most overt ex­ample.·. 
. "The writers are energized by, the festival," Matthias says. Writers of "celebrity status" may_ no longer be crucial to the success of the festival. 
. They actually may be detrimental to the festival. Matthias feels both Tom Wolfe ·and Lawrence ·. Ferlinghetti "played to the audience" ~hen. they were here. Ferlinghetti, particularly, stood in contrast.to.RobertBly. "We should have; more Blys .and, fewer F'erlinghettis.. The. festival . itself _is thecelebrity.'' · 
-Costello agrees .that·. the reputa­tion of the festival is firmly. estab­lished. "The quality of its history is quite· a calling card for· the·festival and helps:to bringmore.authors to campus. Ever since the '68 festival, word spread among authors by word of mouth." Doris Lessing told James Baldwin that it was all right to 
· · · come, · even · though she has. never attended. . . . , · , ..: . , , The festival has a national, ifnot international, reputation: Matthias notes, ''Many people only know this

Faculty Manual and how are indi-? viduals dealt with according to these procedures? These questions can be answered .most directly. by looking at what happens to persons placed on the ,University faculty. 
· . A ppoin tmen t · -to the ·regular fac­ulty may,be at the rank of Instruc­tor, ·Assistant ,Professor, -Associate Professor.,or Professor, though time spent at the rank of Instructor does not count toward tenure. Suppose a person,is·appointed to the faculty at the rank of Assistant Professor. The requirements for the position, as stated. in the ,:Faculty Manual,. are that-the.person.should possess a doc­tor's degree -or .its equivalent and that,= '.'He should have _demonstrated teaching ability, · promise as a schol­ar, interest in students and a gen­uine spirit. of study necessary -. to keep hi_s courses continually revised and to assure his growth: in knowl­edge and maturity;'' 
, As· is usual, this person ·is . ap;; pointed for a contract period of three years. The Faculty Manual states that during,:this time:the person's rank and salary· .will. be reviewed each year. .This review, however, is only formalized when a faculty mem­ber comes -before his 'department's Committee on Appointments and Promotion ._'.for consideratimi -_ This usuaHy 'only occurs at .the.end of contract ·periods when decisions are made ·as to-whether or not a con­tract s~ould be renewed; In the years that. fall between. these formal re­views, the review procedure is up to each ' indivi~ual · department.• chair.­man: ·., Ideally;. there should be _an eval­uation of each faculty-member's per­formance·.by his department chair­man .every year, and··· an encounter bet\\:'een _the two_ regarding the find­ings o(such an evaluation. Such an evaluation·:is of great·importance to a faculty member in· that it may

give him an _idea of areas in which he is deficient and may improve his performance, or may serve as a source of positive .reinforcement for his performance.. Some-chairmen do conduct this type of review but not all do so, as it is up to each depart­ment chairman's discretion to deter­mine the particular method of re­view.·• 
At the end of the second or the. third year of the .contract period, a decision-must be made whether .or not to renew a person's contract. If the ' contract is to be. terminated, then the person involved must be given 12 months' notice of-such-ter­mination. If it is renewed, ·the con­tract extends.for. an additional three­year period at the same rank, accord­ing to the procedures for promotions as outlined by the Faculty Manual: "The formal procedures -for deter­mining ·the recommendation· for ap­pointment or promotion are initiated by the·Chairman of the Department in consultation with his Department Committee on • -Appointments and Promotions.

The probationary period needs to be of · a length which allows the institution a suf­ficient amount of time to evaluate a faculty member's performance, but not so. long that it is detrimental to the faculty.• _ 
The procedures for deciding whether_ or .not to -grant tenure. are the same as those· for appointment and promotion. -Evaluation :of a fac­ulty member, as stated for tenure, is, among other considerations, based ori the criteria for appointment to the rank of Associate Professor,, as otitlined by the Fa,culty Manual: '\He should:have _demonstrated out­·standing. teaching . ability · as evi­denced by his growth in knowledge and maturity, his salutary influence 
' 

on his students and . his standing [· 
' among his colleagues. ··.,Notable achieve·ment in scholarship, as shown by significant. publication, by mean­ingful contribution to public. service, will ordinarily be required for .this rank." Granting of tenure to •an Assistant . Professor, -though, does not necessarily imply _'promotion .to the rank of Associate Professor.--· . Other considerations also enterinto tenure decisions. : Staff-planning .on ·a departmental. and· University:wide basis,:. bringing in the question of tenure ratios, the ratio of tenured to nontenured faculty-" members is of real concern.-Notre_ Dame operates under such a ratio which allows for no more than one half to two thirds of .the faculty to-be tenured. The necessity of such an enforced ratio is__ argued by -the fact .that higher: numbers of tenured faculty members ·· may be.detrimental to a department . or to the. University as ,a·· whole. Financial resources can -only · go so far, and once a.faculty is overstaffed 
15 


with tenured members, the expan­sion of faculty that would be needed to bring in "new life" may simply not be financially possible. It has been suggested that if decisions are made wisely, a formal ratio is not necessary and will work itself out, but even so, any decision must take into account the effect which it will have on the overall situation of the department or the institution. 
Staff planning which projects· be­yond a year-to-year basis must take into -consideration the limited num~ ber of positions. When this number is limited,<the importance of getting the best-qualified person for the posi­tion is!increased ·an the more. -In effect, the decision not to grant ten­ure to a particular individual is not necessarily based on that individual's failure in performance as a faculty· member but may-also .take irito con­sideration whether or not the ten~ ured position may be filled by some­one else'better qualified.· 
The faculty member who has been taken as an example here is granted . tenure/ which, considering the cri­teria of judgmenFand·other factors involved,'" is 'no small accomplish..-. ment. ·Tenure 'is· a permanence ,of · appointment• and" is • granted by the University·only in writing,· in a con­tract or letter of appointment. This appointment · continues · until retire­ment, which normally occurs at age 

65. · This person is eligible for pro­motion to the rank of Associate Pro"' fessor'or Professor and his rank and salary'· •are· reviewed periodically,' formally when he comes before the Depa.rtmerit Committee on Appoint­ments· and Promotions for -consider~ atfon for promotion. ' 
Some argue that academic tenure;. by assuring perman·ence of appoint­ment, -encourages a·· mediocrity of performance. -·A professor, assured of employment,· may -not continue·•to be diligent in the'performarice of his duty: · Tenure makes 'if exceedingly difficult for an institution to· rid: it­self -of "deadwood'-':on ,the faculty. The decision to grant tenure is made with the assumption that the per­son. will continue to perform in a manner consistent with previous 
16. 
performance. In some cases,-though, this assumption may not be realized. Another faculty member, •for ex­ample, once granted tenure; becomes lax in-preparation for his courses, and· pursues no significant scholarly activity, making little or no serious effort at publication. He is secure in his position and is not concerned about further promotion or recogni­tion. The problem is that though his efforts as a faculty member have ceased to be of exceptional-quality, they are not exceptionally poor enough to warrant dismissal. 
-The fact is that such a case is 
·quite possible; ·the reasons 'for ·-its coming about may or may not be the direct result of granting;tenure. The failure is not necessarily in the sys­tem . of tenure itself but may be in the application of that system. -No judgment is foolproof. Tenure de­cisions may bewrong. A· judgment of a person may have beeri · valid at one time while it is 110w no longer supportable. Yet the quality of-such decisions . is of vast· importance, not only with regard to individuals •in­volved, but even more so for the· good of the University as a whole. Every effort to make them foolproof must be made. ­
It has been implied that ·the, dif­ficulties, or perhaps safeguards, in­volved in the dismissal of a· tenured faculty ''member are great indeed. The·· action is a serious one, the grounds for which are well defined. A tenured faculty member may be dismissed only · for. serious cause except in a case where the faculty member's academic 'division• is ·dis­continued•: or iri · circumstances of extreme financial exigency to' the University.,,. The faculty manual ·. states that: "The University must reserve the. right to .terminate the services of· any member of the fac­ulty · for ·serious cause. Dismissal for serious cause is defined as dis­missal for one of the following rea­sons: dishonesty, professional in­competence or continued neglect of academic duties, regulations or responsibilities, conviction of a fel­
1 

ony, or disregard for the Catholic character of this institution, or caus­
l

ing notorious and public scandal." 
In discussing the degree to ,which tenure may encourage mediocrity in faculty, the person taken as example would not. qualify for ·dismissal be­cause, though· his behavior. is, unfor­tunate, it is not of a nature. which would show him to be professionally incompetent. An example that would constitute serious cause is· that of a professor who .has falsified . research in order to be . published and , gain scholarly acclaim, hoping that. his falsification would not be discovered. If his .act is discovered, he. is .not only subject to clismissal but his ·ac­tions may . have legal repe,rcussions. 
The procedures. for establishing serious -cause· for dismissal are specif. ically set· forth. in the :jaculty man­ual . . Before the formal charges for the dismissal of -a faculty member are . brought; however, the Provost appoints two members of the Aca-. demic Council to try to deal with the matter in private.· -It is only when this 'attempt' fails that the . formal procedures·>are · brought to' bear. 
· These procedures are very stringent and give the faculty member ·. ade­qua te opportunity. to 'confront his accusers and present his owri de­fense with· benefit of counsel. · ·-·­
The procedures followed ·by, the University ' in such . cases are: in accord with gtiidelines>outline~. in AAUP policies and· statements. -The stringency,with which serious cause must be ·shown · is essential•to :the protection• of academic .freedom. The 
!

dismiss.al-of:a :tenured faculty mem~ ber is a matter which need be ·dealt with very'carefully, not,only to pro­tect-the rights ofthe individual in~ valved,·' but also to, safeguard; ·the academic freedom which . tenure· is designed to:insure.' ,, ·,-, , There is :'also the case of the non­
. tenured faculty .member-whose, con~ tract is not renewed at.the.end of a contract period when it is decided that a person would not be· granted tenure. Nonrenewal may· occur at 
, SCHOLASTIC 

other times, but •,it is mandatory .when tenure is denied at the end of the specified : probationary ·period.: If the faculty·member believes that the decision· not :to grant tenure, and not to renewc'his contract· for more than one year, is a violation of his academic : freedom, then 'there are clearly defined procedures which -he may initiate to· appeal the decision: 
. Until now, there has been-no way that•:a·, faculty member, who was denied tenure and whose contract \vas not renewed; could obtain a formal statement of -the reasons for nonrenewal of· his -' contract. Just recently, the Academic Council, _at the recommendation· of the Faculty Senate, approved a . revision ·of the faculty,mantial which would require a:-statement of, reasons in' cases of ·negative:•decisions on·reappoint­ment,·promotion·or tenure. Approval by the Board of -Trustees will be re_. quired before the change is finalized. It" was specified; however;-that this policy is_: entirely for informational purposes. It does not give the faculty member. right of any kind to a re~ consideration· of the decision.or to a contestation of ·the reasons;' The faculty·member concerned in such a negative ·decision ·may request, froin his department chairman; the re~.:_. sons. for the decision. ­
-The 'AAUP. recommends' the giv.: ing of a statement of reasons as con;. sideration: necessary• to any -normal human· a·nd professional -relation­ship:· The statement need not· con­stitute ajustification ·of the negative . decision; showirig,the weaknesses of the· faculty rriember· which precip­itated the -decisio·n_:_:_such a state­rrient would ihot· accomplish -its pur~ posetthat of contributing to the good of· -professional relationships.:_but the statement· of reasons niay ·be effective' in giving a: report of con­siderations: invoived in the -judge­

This policy· also involves a ques­
-tion-of whether_ or not the concept-· is in line with the application. Such a question cannot be answered until the policy begins to be administered. The application of the concepts in­volved in the giving of reasons af­fords possibilities for being an added force in serving the values of fair­ness and respect. This· may be true, though, only to the extent that this application is in line with the con­cepts on which it is based.

tual respect. It is, the value of ·this mutual respecfby all persons con­cerned that will hold the policy's application in line with the concepts on which -it is based; 
_The policies on procedures which have been .discussed: are most cer­tainly aimed at the protection of individual -faculty _members' inter­ests, 'but they are aimed also at the protection of the interests of the University.

Perspecti'7e 
Sr. Jean Lenz has been the rector of 
Farley since 19'J3. She also teaches 
in the theology department. 
For some .reason I have been 
promising myself almost all my adult 
life that I.will write a book. In so 
many ways it's a rather delightful 
curious yearning and I. recognize it 
most when I hear myself say after 
some .type of incredible event, to 
whomever is within earshot,. "Would 
that make a . good chapter!" Or, 
"Catch itfor a footnote." Or, "There 
goes _an epilogue-:-get .it in print.'.' 
Chapter headings came fast while 
I was making myway through seven 
years of;high school teaching. There 
was a team of fellow faculty mem­
bers that-fantasized through a whole 
series .of essays with me; but· not a 
word was put to paper. Till this day 
when we meet we still verbally artic­
ulate some of those tales as though 
we read them somewhere the night 
before. With all apologies to literary 
scholars, I· do believe. that's "oral 
tradition" of a sort. 
. Quite unbeknown to me;. this some­
what subtle desirefor publication got 
packed-.in with.all that Iam and 
own three years ago when I came to 
Notre Dame. I distinctly remember 
standing on the front steps of Farley 
Hall where• I was destined to turn the .title '.'Rector'.' into some kind · of real living, and ·rather flippantly remarking, "I'm sure there'll be a few choice chapters, footnotes and.a bulging bibliography in this hallowed hall." And then. life got under.way. I found myself surrounded by a host ·of folks who joined me in picking at my promise to publish with their rhythmic query; '·<lWhat's the -latest chapter?" or: their offer of details, "Listen .to this local ·color. morsel­has great footnote potential!" Some­times the conversations got so con­crete that I thought for· sure there must be galley proofs someplace in 
-those papers on my desk. 
· The desire to capture this place in 
print gets so strong at times that I 
think out loud with a burst of energy 
and conviction, "Iwill turn the whole 
book out tonight." Then in terribly 
realistic reflections I say knowingly 
and quietly to myself, "Could any­

one ever capture the unending life of this place in between periods?" But lots of moments .are .spent in the middle of those extremes and so to date there is a heap of oral tradi­tion that has· been· gathered and garnished through the spoken word into memories waiting for an author to tuck them behind a book title. 
. As; I think ,of how to keep this publishing promise to·. myself, I'm beginning to believe that to. have a title.is at least to ha_ve a start.at getting that ·oral tradition into, a fascinating sequence. of . theme and tale. And there is hardly adearth of titles. 

On a variety of occasions I find myself saying a series of words and then muttering surreptiously or an­nouncing with great gusto-:-"Now there's a book title!" One of the first titles that ever crossed my lips came as the result of making-choices from a buffet· luncheon table. As it hap-_ pened I was .at .a• meeting and dis­covered a Jesuit friend who said, ''Jean, how ·I .wish we had some minutes so I could hear about life at Notre Dame." .As .he saidJhat we stepped before t~e Jell-O. salads and I pointed to one saying, "Forlack of time let .me simply say that life at ND isHke.that seven-layered Jell-O there." We laughed some, but for days those words kept ringing in my head. There were moments when the

titie-Seven-Layered Jell-O-'-flashed 
through my, -brain, Jn all kinds of 
print-serif, sans serif, italics, and 
colors. Arni theJell-0 image went on. 
There are layers of life at this place, 
colorful and vivid, -There are cer­
tainly days when things· are. a bit 
shaky, everything from class lectures 
and assignments to friendships and 
romances..•Or there are , days. when 
life is-really rather. bouncy, like 
~ell-O can get. When the ,"heat's on" 
it's amazing. how a great amount of 
reality melts· into oblivion. Then 
when topics. and people cool off, life 
shapes up agairi-Jell-O-like. •It's a 
fun title for all its serious implica­
tions. 
..After President · Ford's · visit to campus last -year, the most -recent former editor of Schow.stic; stopped by and·said, "You know. that Jell-O image we got going, well, ·someplace in that book. you have to . say, that the Jell-O mix was filled.with a great helping of tutti-frutti cocktail mix the day the President came to cam­pus!"

layered Jell-O. · 
During my very _first days . on 
campus in August '73, I was making 
a request for. some hall equipment. 
In the process the_ man at the desk 
looked ·at me and .remarked .quite 
seriously, "A woman rec.tor•. at Far-· 
ley-you've got to. be a scandal in 
this place." I knew he meant it, and 
I tried to realize.I.was not an,easy 
newcomer for him and. other.s in the 
midst of all the male..tradition this 
place has known. But:as I:,criss­
crossed the campus back .to :Farley 
I could feel some very _definite large 
crumbs of anger inside .,me and I 
found myself. threat~ni~g~ I. don't 
know whom--'-to write -a book en~ 
titled, "Bearing the. B~rden, of the

APPRECIATION 
.-. : 

Jolin J. Kennedy, a 0 professor of government ..and internaticmal stud­ies, was a 24~year colleague of Dr. BarthiJlomew who died in late De~ cember. 
Paul Bartholc>mew spent 50 ·years at Notre Dame. He came as a fresh­man in September 1925, and he was professor emeritus of 'government and . international studies when he died in December 1975. For the large part o·f the time between, those two dates :he was a solidly established teacher at Notre Dame. Many other universities sought him, a_nd he served as visiting professor in places as near asNorthwestern University,· as distant.as the National University of Ireiand; as wen as at several other universities .. Notre Dame, however, was.where he always -returned, .. and it is not much of an exaggeration .to can· his association with. this Univer­sity: a lifelong .affair. · 
;To say anything exact and atthe same .tim'e fitting. about a· lifelong relationship between a_. man and a university is a challenge. Itmay also involve . a . presumption that · is pardonable ~nly because the. man is a long-cherished friend: Yet, as long

as institutions"and individuals C(Hl~ tinue'•to win our esteem and stimu­late o·ur affection, ,··occasions . will arise when 'we :will ·want io ·say something exact and hope that di: niay be' fitting. ' " • 
Many generations of:Notre Dame students have acclaimed PauLBar~ tliolomew ·as a gifted teacher:" He demanded much of his students, and it was' appropriate f~r him to: do so because he gave them so very much of· himself.' 'What Paul ·gave theni was .·. not _limited .· to the · cla_ssrcio~ setting. He was constantly available fo his students for advice and help. He took the lead in creating extra­curricular activities that would com­

graduate; and undergraduate levels. Paul's research and publication rec­ord is extensive and steady over a lcirig period ·of 1:ime, with a, ri~h variety ranging from his annual re­view of Supreme· Court cases to the widely heralded study. of the Indiana Third Congressional District. . 
All these matters are in the realm of achievement. Paul accomplished much'.We honor him for doing so. We mourn the loss that his. death brings; The loss __ is· obviously greater than what' the 'record of achieve-. ment, however ·meritorious, can in­dicate. :.For the total reality of the person is. always much ·. more than just the record. 
With Paul, a large part of the re­ality must be his _lifelong commit­ment to Notre Dame..A commitment by a _man to an institution has_ many / aspects. It involves an appeal to what is .noble in .human nattire, but it:need not, entirely suppress. what is ambitious. it ·imposes duty, but it does .not ieave vanity altogether out of account. It usually promises rewards and, at. least occasionally, it produces_ tensions. -The man thus committed may be.a winner one day

Some of the stories that make up most cherished book was the subject the. Willis legend suggest .the:sort of.. of his favorite course, the Scripture man -he : was. For example, some course he gave for nearly two dee­years ago he arose every morning at ades. 5 a.m. for a month to milk a sick As an auditor in that course dur­neighbor's' cow.

Willis Nutting is gone. Many of us strove to learn, and now· cherish, his words. A few even learned the music. Among those nearby are Prof. Julian Pleasants, described by Willis as "the most brilliant man I have known," and ·his oldest child, Teresa Marcy, a teacher at.St. Mary's. No one, however, knows the music bet­ter than his beloved wife, Eileen, whom. he described as "the best per-. son I have ever known" and about whom he commented: "Everything in my life has been greater in ex­pectation than reality-except my marriage.'' 
Some frank admissions must be made before this essay ends for by many standards his life cannot be described as successful. Willis Nut­ting was neither wealthy nor highly honored; his contribution to pub­lished scholarship was small, and he retired from this University as· an associate professor. Some viewed his ideas as simply foolish; others saw ­them as utopian or quixotic. One person, knowing him only by reputa·­tion, asked me'in 1970, while a group of students.were running a \'Nutting for President"' campaign, who this "Young Turk" was. He . was sur.:. prised to learn that Willis was a .70­year-old Turk. But-many of us; in~ eluding some of his students who had driven _through,_ a snowstorm frcmi' as farawaY:·as'befroit.to at­tend his funeral, felt.that his pastor, Father Ken ·Maley,. C.S.C., did not depart excessively fa.r_from the truth when in his· ·funeral_ homfly, 'he said: ''In .the_ Jnstructiori~: for. thf ne\V funeral.rit.e w~.ar~ asked_not:to give a.. eulogy ·at a ]uneral, but rather to center in on ,Christ: :With Willis, ho:w­ever,the t:-,vo are the same." . . , .

. I worked. one summer in the sta­tionery section of a moderate:-sized department store. ··It is not one of my fondest memories: for one thing, there were too many college grad­uates ringing registers near me for my soul's peace, I. have managed to erase most of the details· of that summer ·from my· mind; only about two remain: the formula for the Maryland' sales tax (4¢ . on the dollar) and the picture on the front of one of· the two retirement cards we carried. 

Retirement cards didn't seem to be'.in great demand.those days; the few.· we had, tended , to .get a little dog-eared before someone finally bought them and took them out of my• -life.·. Their . "spines"-,--if cards have spines like .books-were well . broken, :· so the covers· flopped lethargically when opened.. The par­ticular . line • of . cards l remember featured a distinguished, but, well­worn gentleman at ease in an over­stuffed ·chair;. pipe in . hand,· slippers on feet, a peaceful smile on his face. (There ·. may have been a . ; basset hound or similar canine resting •its head . in the gentleman's Jap,· eyes gazing soulfully up .at his master's pipe, but I can't. be certain,< And I .. suppose anyone who had a ·'lady executive friend retiring.went else­where for· cards.) Mercifully, I'd forgotten what the message was on 
.·by Sal_ly Stanton 

the in~ide-such episties ar~ usually ino~dinately saccharine. . . . , . 
By this · tirne you are probably· wondering why I am blathering on about retirement cards. "Good golly," you are probably saying, "it must be a late night at the Scholastic office." 
I fear it is: but my message is serious. 
A week or · so ago I went to a re~ ception given in honor of Mr._~anna, master printer and manager of Ave Maria Press, retiring this year. I was .struck . by the number of people . who .were there to wish him well. The atmosphere was sad-many people on campus will miss him-,--yet also . joyful as the people there celebrated being to­gether and the memory of their years together. I was trying to un~ derstand why I, who. am not retiring, felt· any kinship with. this party-· and I realized it reminded me a little. of the graduation parties I have at­tended. .. . .. 
Retirement: may · be a bit like graduation. Senior year is surely a time of· retiring,. by·. second· semester one begins to feel on the way out. The time has come to plan for next year when you'll be elsewhere, to choose new RA's, select new Scho­lastic editors, to begin the rituals of separation. 
Yet ·graduation is, interestingly enough, also called uconime~ce­ment.". One does' not retire. info. a black hole,• .never to be. heard of again, but into a new society, a new pattern of living. It is a sad oc­casion: . endings are. rarely happy events; btit it is also a joyful oc­casion, full of beginnings, of new possibilities..· This newness may be a bit unsettling at first-:-one gets used to the same . faces•· at coffee breaks or to ·marking years with exams and vacations. .Without the comfort of habit, one inay 'be ini­tially disoriented. But eventually a new pattern wm, emerge. 

That reception ·marked a moment of transition. 
Perhaps, then, I should have sug­gested to my customers who cotild not find a retirement card to suit _ their tastes that they look to our selection of graduation cards.

On behalf of the present Scholastic editorial board and staff and of the many. Scholastic editors who have preceded. me ·..in this sometimes harried and unreasonable position, I thank Mr. Sanna.for his years of patience and assistance in working with.this particular student publica­tion and wish him a happy,.prosper­ous and peaceftil · "commencement." Although we .are_ happy to be to­gether with the fine people who will take his· place, we will miss him.
