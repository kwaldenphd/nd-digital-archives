Hickory, Dickory, Dock, The mouse ran up the clock.................
A. DELIGHTFUL bit of poetry, but more poetry than truth. It was our steeple clock, true enough, though it was no mouse. Rather, another rat from Sorin Sub, which having disturbed the subnormals down there, was last seen as he scaled the steeple clock in an attempt to dodge some poorly aimed shots. And while we are discussing clocks, a timely wonder annoys me as to whether or not the off-campus students are allowed an hour more for their night pers than the boys in -the halls now that South Bend has gone in for the conservation of daylight.
HERE were those who thought it a reflection on Senior prestige that Johnnie Johnson’s orchestra played at Hudson Lake last Saturday night. Considering that Mr. Johnson and his fellow Swedes are syncopating only in order to insure three ordinary meals to the average day his practical foresight in making an engagement of the sort near Notre Dame is worthy of more praise than blame. The dancers who filled the pavilion were there because they believed it a privilege to dance to the orchestra that had swayed the Notre Dame Seniors. Those uneducated dancers considered the Senior Ball as having made Johnnie Johnson worth while, whereas some of our long-eared donkeys brayed all over the campus that Johnnie Johnson would make the Senior.Ball a success. Disregarding the opinions of tinseled night club queens and blotto suckers we recall that jazz orchestral distortions can produce nothing more permanent than various kinds of noise, whereas a university does its little in attempting to produce men. An orchestra has never honored Notre Dame, but Notre Dame has honored many an orchestra.
CONSIDERING that the Domes came out Thursday, there may have been a very good reason why the editor of that publication went home over the last week-end. Not being certain as to what sort of reception the campus would give him after the apeparance of his book, Tommie may have thought it best to give his parents at least one more opportunity to see him. One thing is certain about this year’s Dome—it contains a wealth of material for cartoonists. No one could look like himself while a dozen odd classmates stood about and suggested to the photographer that the subject would look almost human if his hair was combed and his ears clipped.
O the Seniors we give thanks for having brought phenomena into the streets of South Bend. Not since the Junior Prom has the Palais been treated to such beauty and youth. Girls who were as charming as they were beautiful, and as
sincere as they were charming were with us for a while over the week-end. Perhaps it is another instance of familiarity and contempt, or of distance and enchantment, but whatever may have ben the elating cause, the Seniors are philan- . thropists . Philanthropists because all observers share in the . appreciation of an import, whether it be a jewel, an automobile or a ball date.
T HERE is a difference between Notre Dame and Harvard after all; a social difference. One of that lady friend type, who are too friendly to be ladies, and too ladyish to be friends, was afflicting with her chronic disease of referring to her Notre Dame acquaintances. And any fellow who prefers derbies to nightcaps would conclude from the way in . which she pronounced the name, Notre Dame, that the only difference between us and Harvard is that the wearing of the . Tuxedo is optional at the dinners in the Harvard refectory. With us, of course it is a requirement. Notre Dame should rime with aim, not with sham.
OuR age is supposedly one of expansion. Airplanes and radios are the usual examples in freshman themes, but education is broader, radiators are more elongated, and even -week-ends are sometimes extended. Moreover, there are still some people who can walk a mile without exhaustion, a few read books that are neither- elemental or elementary, and the men who have faith in salty beer are not yet annihilated. Tire campus trees have reached across the cinder paths to ■ mingle in one another’s leaves, and even our lakes are attempting a unity of some sort. A dozen ponds huddle about and between the two lakes with no better purpose than to give the summer sessionists something to do during the warm months. Looking at those self inflicted ponds, anyone ' can prophecy that the puncturing of mosquitoes will punctuate the meals and sleep of more than one summer sessionist.
Chicken, as we colloquilly use it, .can mean a great deal or a very little. It depends upon who says it, and what he means it to say. Now from what I make out, a rooster is a chicken which crows over another chicken’s egg. Also, he is so conceited that he thinks the sun would never rise if he _ failed to announce it. Chicken applies fairly well to the fel- ; low who goes about casting insinuations against everybody v from the registrar to the janitor of Sorin simply because ; he got a high number in the list for room drawings. Not everyone can be within the first hundred, and because some-y one gets an eight hundred and forty is no reason why he should impute favoritism and influence to those who were lucky . A respectable rooster takes the best roost he can get, and waits for the sun to rise. After all, golden eggs belong,^ to geese, and no one wants to have it known that he isg goosey.

NOTRE DAME TO REMAIN ON CENTRAL STANDARD TIME
Although South Bend and other neighboring cities have officially adopted daylight saving time, Notre Dame will remain on 'central standard time, according to a recent official announcement by the Very Reverend Charles L. O’Donnell, C.S.C., president of the University.
“The printing office and a few other departments closely connected with city activities are already on daylight saving time,” Father O’Donnell said, “but the University schedule will remain unchanged as it would be too great an inconvenience to change the time of classes and student activities.”
THURSDAY, May 23—Band Concert University band, 6:30 p. m., steps of the Main building.

BLUE CIRCLE TENDERED BANQUET BY UNIVERSITY IN FACULTY DINING HALL
LAWERENCE MOORE
The entire personnel of the Blue Circle, fifty members in all, were tendered a banquet by the University in the Faculty Dining Hall last Tuesday evening. The affair was held in honor of the organization which has rendered valuable service to Notre Dame throughout the year.
Lawerence Moore, chairman of’the Blue Circle, presided as toastmaster. Guests of honor included the Reverend J. Hugh O’Donnell, C.S.C., prefect of discipline at the University; the Reverend Eugene Burke, C.S.C., acting editor of the Ave Maria, and William H. Kreig, chairman of the Student Activities Council. In a short speech Father O’Donnell lauded the work of the Blue Circle during the past year, particularly during the football season,
and thanked the organization on behalf of the University for its efforts. Brief remarks were also made by Messrs. Moore
and Krieg.
STUDENTS PREFER ROMANTIC NOVELS, LIBRARY SURVEY SHOWS
Jeffrey Farnol, Edgar C. Wallace, Booth Tarkington, Joseph Conrad, Mary Roberts Rinehart, and S. S. Van Dine —these are the preferred names in a survey to find out what authors appealed most to the library-going man of the campus. Romantic novels are closely followed by mystery-murder stories with plenty of action, in a race for favorite types of books.
The most sought-for book at present is “Strange Interlude,” by Eugene O’Neill; slips have been on file for this book all year. “Show Girl,” by J. P. McEvoy, formerly a Notre Dame man, has been assured of a reader since the book first came out. But for steady popularity over an extended period, “The Bridge of San Luis Rey,” by Thornton Wilder holds the record during the year. Since September, 1927, this book has never rested on the library shelves.
Three copies of “The Count of Monte Cristo,” by Dumas, have been worn out since the volume was first placed in the Library. “Leonardo the Florentine,” by Rachel Annand Taylor; “Francis Villon,” by Wyndham Lewis; “Dear Senator,” by McCready Huston, South Bend writer, and “The Saga of Billy the Kid,” by Walter Burns, are among the leaders at present. The works of John Galsworthy and Donn Byrne always have a number of readers.
The technical-book which finds its way over the desk most frequently is “Modern Aircraft,” by Major Victor Page. It proposes to be a “complete treatise outlining clearly the elements of aeronautical engineering.” In the recreational division, “Thirty Years of Billiards” by the peer of them all, Willie Hoppe, attracts the most readers. Volume I of “Trader Horn,” the outstanding travel book of the last few years, leads this branch of literature. Stephen Leacock, among the humorous authors, has many readers for “Literary Lapses,” “College Days,” and others.

band prepares for final campus
CONCERTS
H. PATRICK M'LAUGHLIN
The University Band, under the leadership of Professor Joseph J. Casasanta, acting head of the department of music, have added close to a thousand miles to their itinerary since May 3. The first of their contests since the Easter recess was at Barberton, Ohio, May 4, when it played before an appreciative audience in the Central High School auditorium. The affair was sponsored by the Barberton Council Knights of Columbus. While in the Ohio city, the bandmen were guests at a banquet sponsored by the ladies of St. Augustine’s parish, and at a dance given in their honor by the Knights of Columbus, after the concert.
The band also participated in the annual parade
from St. Joseph, Mich., to Benton Harbor, Mich., last Saturday afternoon, which culminated the Blossom Week Festival. While at St. Joseph, the Fox Movietone News company took three news reel “shots” of the organization, once during the coronation ceremonies of the Blossom Queen, and twice during the course of the parade.
A short concert was given at St. Joseph Hospital, South Bend, last Sunday, for the benefit of the patients and hospital personnel. This is the first time that such a concert was given, but the success of the venture insures future concerts.
The Band will close its concert season during the Commencement week program. Two campus concerts will be given, however, before that time. One will be on the quadrangle next Thursday, May 22, at 6:30, and the second on Sunday evening, May 26, at 6:30 p. m.
KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS HOLD ANNUAL OUTING
The climax to the K. of C. social season took place Thursday, May 9, when over one hundred Knights journeyed to Christiana Lake, Michigan, for their annual picnic. Excellent weather replaced the rain of former- years, and the men frolicked and picnicked all day.
Indoor baseball, boat races and similar athletic contests were run off in the morning; after luncheon the real program of sporting events was held, nuder the supervision of Brothers John Kelleher and Jack Cannon. The feature of the day was a close race between the trustees of the local council, the Reverend John J. Reynolds, C.S.C., and Professor Raymond Hoyer. The distance was seventy-five yards, Professor Hoyer beating his opponent by inches. .
After the sports, a chicken luncheon was served, followed by speeches. The Reverend John Reynolds, C.S.C.; the Reverend Holdreth, C.S.C.; the Reverend James J. Connerton, C.S.C.; Grand Knight Edward McKeown; Lecturer John Dorgan and Professor Ray Hoyer were among the speakers. The outing was arranged by John Dorgan.

NOTRE DAME DEBATERS CLOSE SUCCESS- * FUL SEASON
Notre Dame has come to the end of anothei- very successful debating season. The University extended its activities in this direction this year and put four teams on the platforms. Two entirely different questions were treated, one on the criminal code of this country and the other relating . to hydro-electric power.
These two teams won five out of the eight debates scheduled. After the traditional intra-mural debate at St. Mary’s the teams defeated Franklin and Earlham in a triangle match and then scored two victories over the University of Detroit.	.
The triumph over Western Reserve is especially notable inasmuch as the Cleveland institution has an outstanding ? record in debating circles. The contest with Purdue University at Lafayette on the hydro-electric question was so close that the critic-judge refrained from criticizing either * team and awarded the decision to Purdue because of the -better audience contact of the home team. Again at DePauw University, the Notre Dame team received much commendation although the De Pauw won in the opinion of the criticjudge.
The Reverend Francis Boland, C.S.C., succeeded the Reverend W. A. Bolger, C.S.C., as coach of the Notre Dame teams when the latter was appointed vice-president of St. Thomas’ College. But in spite of Father Boland’s inexperience his proteges won five of the eight contests on the schedule.	.	.
The following is the personnel of the four teams: Joseph McNamara, Thomas Happer, Charles Haskell, George Bae-mer, Arnold Williams, Waltei- Stanton, James Walsh, Francis McGrael, John Keefe, Charles Hanna, and Fred Baer. All these debaters will receive the customary monogram pins awarded by the University. ‘	-
The University loses the services of five of its debaters by graduation. McNamara, Williams, Baemer, Haskell and Happer all have closed their debating careers at Notre * Dame.	-

THIRTEEN VALUABLE PAINTINGS GIVEN TO LIBRARY BY DR. WIGHTMAN
A gift of thirteen valuable paintings has been made to* the University by Dr. Charles_A. Wightman, founder of the Wightman Memorial Art Gallery. The canvasses which have been in the private collection of Dr. Wightman for many years will make a notable addition to the Art Gallery on the third floor of the Library.
The paintings were carried to Notre Dame from Chicago ' in a van Tuesday, May 7. A remarkable set of art books supplement the collection and are being arranged in the / Library at the present time. They contain many ancient works, which are of value to the art student and collector.
The list of the pictures is as follows: “Industry,” by Jacobo Bassano; “St. Philip,” by Valdes Leal; “Winning of the West,” by Luetze; “Landscape,” by Wilmans; “Flight of ;... the Israelites from Canaan,” by Castigleone; “Reposo,” by" ' Murillo; “St. Francis,” by Suburban; “Marriage of St. Cath- .. erine” (Neapolitan School); “Ideal Head of Christ” (Nea- L • politan School); Ideal Landscape by Cornelius Huysmans; Spanish Primitive of the Madonna, and two Flemish paint- . .. ings.	\

pet radio, his prowess as an outfielder on Sorin’s baseball team, and, most of all, of his verbal combats with the other wranglers of the dungeon. For Bob’s spirit has been transplanted to the “sub” and the opinion of the gang there is that “Bob’s a good sport.”
Of course, it is his genius in the scientific field that has placed Bob in the campus limelight. The only honorary society on the campus is the Academy of Science; Robert Joseph Schulze is president of the Academy, and its present
। activities and prestige show that Bob is a good executive, f Bob is a senior in the college of science, in the department of pharmacy. Most of his activities, therefore, follow the lines of test-tubes and elements, acids and solutions. Bob is enrolled in the lists of the Pharmacy Club and the Chern Club, a member of two years standing in each. He was selected for the Cap and Gown committee, proving that the connection between ■ a pharmacist and a combination ' tailor, fitter and bookkeeper is not as remote as it first seems.
The Calumet Club has known him as a member for four
years, and to show what they thought of him the members 1 elected him vice-president in his junioi- year and secretarytreasurer this year. And when the Calumet Club holds a dance, Bob is usually a committee member.
f- Whiting, Indiana (population 8,000, according to the sta-[ tisticians of Sorin “sub”) is the home of the versatile gentle-I man. That is, he came from Whiting. And he brought with him, in addition to his scientific talent, a love of discussion
। and a radio. Both are now found in the ’’sub.” Every night, Bob’s voice can be heard, not boisterously, but earnestly trying to convince the boys. Convincing anyone in the “sub”
P is a difficult job, but the “sub” itself agrees that Bob is capable of it.

The reports scheduled to be given by John Nanovic, Richard T. Sullivan and John Dubuisson had to be postponed
on acount of the time spent in considering and voting upon the large number of applications for membership. These reports will be given tonight at a meeting of the club to be held in the Organizations Building. All members, new and old, are expected to be present.
MEEHAN MEDAL FOR BEST ESSAY WON BY MURRAY YOUNG
Murray Young, a senior in the College of Arts and Letters, has added to his literary honors by winning the Meehan Medal this year, it was announced by Professor Paul Fenlon, this week. His essay, “Gerard Manley Hopkins, S. J.— Modernist” was judged the best of five submitted in the annual contest.
Mr. Young recently won the Scribblers’ Poetry Contest with his “The End of Labor.” The judges were Katherine Bregy, writer; Theodore Maynard, poet, and Vincent Engels, editor. Mr. Young is also Class Poet of ’29 and President of the Scribblers, as well as a member of the Scholastic Literary board.
J. F. Walz’s “Modernity of Anton Chekhov” and Joseph F. Hartnett’s “Sir James A. Barrie—Pessimist” were considered the closest rivals of Mr. Young’s essay by the judges. These were the Rev. Joseph L. Carrico, C.S.C., head of the English department; the Reverend Leo Ward, C.S.C., professor of English, and Dr. John A. Cooney, head of the School of Journalism.
The medal is the gift of Mrs. Eleanore Meehan of Covington, Kentucky, to be awarded, according to the University catalogue, “to the senior who writes the best essay in English.” The four best graduating theses are always submitted, but the contest is open to anyone.

ST. EDWARD’S HALL TO BE REMODELED FOR USE OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS
Discontinuance of St. Edward’s School for Boys and remodeling of its present building into a residence hall for the University students was announced by the Rev. Thomas A.
Steiner, C.S.C., chairman of the building committee, Monday.
Upon completion of the 1929 school year, carpenters will begin their work of revamping the building. It will be formed into a modern dormitory capable of housing 200 students of all four classes. It is expected that the new arrangement will reduce the number of off-campus students to less than 400.
Professor Vincent F. Fagan, of the department
rev. thomas a. Steiner, c.S.c. of architecture, is in charge of remodeling the hall. He announces that the dormitory will be ready for occupany September 12, 1929, the first day of the 1929-30 school year.
At present there are 100 Minims living in St. Edward’s, most of them residents of South Bend or Chicago.
CRITICS APPROVE STUDENT POETRY SUBMITTED IN RECENT SCRIBBLER CONTEST
A recent issue of the Scholastic was entitled the Poetry Number, and in it were presented the poems entered in the poetry contest of the Scribblers. The verses had been judged, and the prizes awarded when the issue appeared, consequently there was considerable interest manifested in the issue by those who are concerned with campus writers and writings.
In recognition of this interest, and as an appreciation of the efforts of the poets, the prominent writers on the campus have been consulted as to their opinions of the poetry submitted in the contest. These writers need no introduction to the student body, for their creative works have made them known in literary circles far removed from Notre Dame.
The Rev. Charles L. O’Donnell, C.S.C., president of the University, and a well known poet, had this to say of the contest: “I have read with an interest in which surprise was a delightful element, the poetry submitted in the recent Scribblers’ Poetry Contest. The general level of the work is high. I agree with the judges in their selection of Mr. Murray Young’s poems for first prize, though in the same breath I should like to say that the sestet of Mr. Cyril Mullen’s sonnet strikes me as being at least as fine as any of the poetry submitted. It displays an insight that is truly remarkable. The Scribblers are to be congratulated upon fostering so splendid a competition, and the University may be justly proud of the work done.”
The Rev. Patrick J. Carroll, C.S.C., chairman of the Board of Publications, and a distinguished poet, gave his opinion as follows: "Nearly every poem given a ribbon of recognition in the Scribbler’s poetry show is worth while. Some poems are higher up than others, of course. Mr. Murray Young’s ‘The End of Labour’ has a genuine lyrical kick, and Mr. Cyril Mullin’s ‘A Man of Imagination’ is surpris
ingly mature. Also I like the simple wholesomeness of ‘Her Beads’ by Mr. John Nanovic. All said, everyone of these young poets is carrying the Notre Dame tradition of song. And one may modestly hope that if this can be done all along our scholastic battle front so to say—however slowly, if only insistently, we should be able to maintain ourselves in positions of cultural eminence—unless this is a mixed metaphor.
I do not know, off-hand, just how these young poets have been motivated—whether the tuxedo renters, or with those rarer birds that qualify in the finals with a maxima cum laude. But they write good verse. Some of it very good. Which is what I started out to say.”
Mr. Charles Phillips, a professor in our English department, and a poet and novelist, congratulated the Scribblers thus: “The score of poems published, taken on the whole, have two marked characteristics: they show a very promising mastery of technique, and they have a good deal of originality. They are not as ‘derivitative’ as most ‘college’ poems are; frequently they have the ring of authenticity to ? them, by which I mean the poets seem time and again to be expressing themselves, their own feelings and experiences, rather than the feelings and experiences of others. Hearsay poetry is often dead. There is real life in much of this Notre Dame poetry. Cliches and outworn phrasings are rare, original turns of expression are frequent. All this means freshness and vigor.”
Dr. John M. Cooney, head of our Journalism department, a writer and a critic, expressed his appreciation this way: “One or two of the poems were so graceful as to seem ‘unpremeditated art.’ This is rare, isn’t it, among our presentday versifiers?”
Mr. Norb Engels, of the English department, and a writer of note, gave his opinion as follows: “The Scribblers have long been doing splendid work in encouraging creative writing. The results of their recent poetry contest, published in -the Scholastic, vindicates the worth of their labor. It is genuine, wholesome work, the kind that is fast characterizing Notre Dame as a place of not only poetic interest, but even more so, of poetic production.”

REV. THOS. CRUMLEY, C.S.C.
In nothing is man more persistent than in the search for truth. Certainly truth is often difficult to attain and, even when found, hard to comprehend; yet nevertheless it is in-dispensible to man, for truth is the outgrowth of our- natural desire to place the intellect in conformity with reality. Philosophy is the highest form of truth attained by the human mind.
At Notre Dame we have a philosopher who has aided hundreds, even thousands, of students in their efforts to find the highest truths. He is Reverend Thomas Crumley, C.S.C., who is known and loved by every Notre Dame man.
Father Crumley received his A. B. degree at Notre Dame in 1896, and in the following year
he was ordained to the priesthood. After studying for three years at the Catholic University of America in Washington, he returned to Notre Dame in 1899 and became a member
of the faculty.
During the years from 1906 to 1911 he served in the capacity of Vice-President of the University, and since then, with the exception of two years, he has faithfully and successfully instructed classes in Logic, General Psychology, Experimental Psychology, and Inductive Logic, the last course being an advanced one in which he again instructs many students who profited from his other courses during their* earlier years in college.
In 1926 he completed and published a book on the principles of logic, entitled “Logic, Deductive and Inductive.” This volume has been used as a textbook in the Logic classes of the University, and as a text it has been found extremely valuable and successful. The subject matter of the work is intended for those who are newly entering upon the study of Logic and is restricted to merely the elements of deductive and inductive reasoning. These elements are presented in an individual manner, being neither hidden under an excess of details nor displayed with too little explanation. The treatment of the topics differs from most manuals in the facility of its style.
For those of you who know’ him at all it is not necessary to mention the fact that he is an exceptional observer; and his observations are indeed inspiring’ to those who are in daily contact with him and who come to love him for his quiet simplicity and sincerity.	—m.h.l.

MY LIFE IN ART—Constantin Stanislavsky. Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1929. §6.00. ■	"
Constantin Stanislavsky is the director and the co-founder of the Moscow Art Theatre. Any history of his life is inevitably bound up with the history of that theatre, and, as the history of the Moscow Art Theatre encompasses the development of all that is great in the modem theatre, MY LIFE IN ART, Stanislavsky’s autobiography, is necessarily of high interest.
Stanislavsky came of a rich Moscovite merchant’s family, and received every educational and cultural advantage that wealth and highly-civilized parents afford. The first part of MY LIFE IN ART sketches the general outlines of Stanislavsky’s boyhood. What is of greater significance, however, is the intimate knowledge of the section affords of life in pre-revolutionary Russia. The intellectual excitement of that time, the self-abnegation with which business men spent their fortunes in the interest of Russian Art, the fine spirit of co-operation which existed between the government and aristocrats and the artists, are all shown, and are all new to anyone not intimately acquainted with the non-political history of Russia.
From his earliest boyhood Stanislavsky took part in and directed amateur theatricals. This love of the theatre impregnated and informed his whole life. Real insight into the qualities of mind and soul which made for Stanislavsky’s success in revolutionizing the art of the theatre is afforded in the chapters of the book devoted' to his straggles as an actor in the amateur theatres of Moscow and the productions of the Society of Art and Literature (the forerunner of the Moscow Art Theatre). What his obstacles were in arriving at a sound—and revolutionary—theory of dramatic art, only one who knows the import to dramatic history of the inception of the Moscow Art Theatre can fully realize.
The whole of the accomplishment of Stanislavsky and the Moscow Art Theatre may be summed up in the phrase “truthfulness in the theatre”. This does not mean that Stanislavsky’s theatre is one of realism, or for that matter any other of the isms of the theatre. It includes all of them and more. It is a theatre whose purpose is the expression of inner truth' through whatever externals of mimetics, scenery, costume, lighting effect and mise en -scene- are necessary and best suited to the representation of that truth. The theatre is a wholly unified art, in which the several departments are . not organically distinct but only contribute through different means to the realization of the single effect.
With the foregoing principles to guide him Stanislavsky has had one of the great careers of the theatre. By virtue - of his genius for carrying out his theories in successful theatre practice, most of the great personages of the theatre were attracted to work with him. Tolstoy and Chekhov wrote plays for his theatre, Gordon Craig designed the scenes and collaborated with him in the direction of perhaps his greatest production, that of Hamlet. Not the least fascinating chapters of MY LIFE IN ART are devoted to Stanislavsky’s pen-portaits of these men and others of like renown.
But perhaps the greatest, because many-faceted, personality of them all is Stanislavsky himself. He writes of himself with charming candor and with entire lack of self-exploitation. Because MY LIFE IN ART so aptly reveals Stanislavsky’s personality and tells his life, the book is assured an important place among the documents of dramatic history.	—B.G.R.
DONNE, The Nonesuch Press, Random House, London, 1929.
John Donne has never been as widely known as his peculiar genius has warranted, but in recent years there has been a widespread interest in his poetry, due to the recognition that it possesses certain qualities which are singularly akin to contemporary verse. More and more people are coming to read him, and to find in his eccentric and intense poetry a tonic and an influence.
All those who have become acquainted with him will be delighted with this collection of his poems, sermons, and prose sketches published by Random House. Besides being a lovely object for the eye it has a text which follows the best readings (it conforms in almost every point with the Oxford edition), and it is supplied with a liberal compendium of notes.	|
Donnes’ life covers the heyday of the Elizabethan period, and he possesses many of the characteristics which make this period so fascinating and so golden. His poetry is full of difficult and witty conceits, and gives the effect at times of strain and harshness, but his language itself is unpoetical' to the extreme, following closely the speech of every day. Not until Wordsworth do we see a like attempt, and not until the contemporary poets do we find a successful one.
Donne’s poetry has a peculiar interest for Catholics because of the deeply scholastic cast of his metaphysics. He is the last of the poets to employ the schoolmen’s metaphysic in the structure of his poetry.	•
Donne’s influence on the metaphysical poets of the seventeenth century is easily seen, but they lack somehow just that quality which makes him so characteristically an Elizabethan, exquisite and beautiful as their poetry is. Outside of his influence on his immediate followers, Donne until recent times was almost forgotten except for Robert Browning, who learned many things from a study of his poetry.
For anyone who desires a background in English poetry Donne is essential, for English poetry is not confined, as one might easily imagine from texts and classrooms, to the brilliant and obvious stars. The lesser and concealed stars also radiate a light, stiller, colder, perhaps, but often as lovely.

Notre Dame Post Office
PAUL J. HALLINAN
“He whistles as he goes, light hearted wretch, Cold and yet cheerful; messenger of grief Perhaps to thousands, and of joy to some.”
—Cowper in “Winter Evening.”
“Any mail this morning?” “Do you live in one of the halls?” “Howard.”
“The mail is distributed direct to the halls now.”
This was early last September and the freshman had probably tramped over and back to the post office six times chat morning. No luck.
The same youth has now become more technically a “Notre Dame man.” He reads letters without thinking of the little building at the crossroads. He drops in to buy stamps; possibly he sends his laundrycase home. If the Indiana weather (which filled so many of his early letters) becomes too moist, he stands inside the post office till his trolley-car rocks office has lost much of
its Septembral attraction for him.
But the corps of clerks there keep on sorting letters and weighing parcels and addressing laundry slips. Like their fellows in 60,000 or more similar establishments in the United . States, they are “messengers of grief or joy.” Each bag that the carrier hauls in from the South Bend post office contains hundred of stamped packets: news from home, checks from home, lines of sweetness from “her,” and stories of big times ’ in the home town as told by the boy friend. It would be an interesting compilation to estimate how many “36 more days” and “the grub was terrible tonight” and “love and kisses” drop through the slide each day.
Notre Dame being a university and the post office being a university post office, business has a fluctuating quality that would drive the “efficient” business man into an orgy of ' charts, graphs and statistical reports. Brother Theogene, C.S.C., known in governmental parlance as Postmaster F. J. Merline, points out that the activities of Art Haley and his athletic association cause the humble establishment to become a “first class” post office during September, October and November each year. Last season, 24,000 registered letters went out from Notre Dame to the East and West with tickets ' for the Blue and Gold football games.
After the first, confusion is over and the Sorin mail no * longer contains letters to the sophomore in Morrissey, things settle down to a steady pace and a heavy out-put. The home town daily papers and technical journals roll in steadily with the letters. Then comes June, which means notification to all these periodicals that Notre Dame men do not live here in the summer. After a few weeks, the summer school session is on and the confusion' again has to be changed into system. '	’
When you toss your Scholastic aside this week, or page through the next Juggler, the weight of the paper is the last thing that you think of. But forty tons of reading matter, including the Scholastics and Jugglers leave the post office
every three months. This includes everything from the scientific pages of Father Nieuwland’s American Midland Naturalist to the cheerful paragraphs of Jim Armstrong’s Alumnus. Other publications which help to make up the forty tons are the St. Mary's Chimes, the Notre Dame Lawyer, the Catalyzer, the. Santa Maria, the Ave Maria, the University Bulletins, the Holy Cross Courier, and the Annals of Our Lady of Lourdes. All of these are entered as second-class matter.
More statistics could be hurled right and left about the volume of business which the post office handles. For instance, 52,000 domestic and 5,600 foreign money orders have been issued since 1871. A permanent prosperity wave, it would seem. And this year, the postmaster figures that 28,000 registered letters and parcels will go out. That is an increase of 26,000 since 1922. Page that “efficient” business man again. But human interest is what we’re looking for and it is in the laundry-case totals that we find it. For 900 packs go back and forth each week, with shirts and towels of various shades making up the “exported” cargo and fresh linen of all kinds in the import.
The name of Henry Clay suggests to most people that gentleman’s preference for righteousness rather than the presidency. To men versed in the early history of Notre Dame it calls to mind the post office. For the statesman who spent so much of his life in the service of the Senate found time to use. his influence in Notre Dame’s behalf. In 1851, Clay and Father Richard, a friend of the University and the first priest to sit in the Senate, secured the grant for Notre Dame’s post office.
We believe that any story about a post office, or the mail or any part of that huge system that Mr. Brown now bosses, is a failure without that famous phrase, “The mail must go through.” Where the expression had its origin—back when Phidipedes ran the marathon which ended in a dead heat, oi-when Jesse James made stage-coach driving a hazardous occupation—is not important. The traditional sacredness of the mails, the guarding of the mail trucks and the efficiency of the clerks are significant of the public trust. His Majesty’s Post, trotting down a road of “merrie old England” in the days of Henry VIII had no more dignity than the somber vehicle which rolls out of Notre Dame every day to the school across the way. They have much in common— principally a horror of speed.	.
Reading of the early days of the Penny-Post, we came across an incident where bigotry and unprogressiveness went hand and hand to balk the new system. About 1650, William Dockwray set up at great expense a post, which delivered letters and parcels daily to the people in and about London. As usual, a great cry was raised against it; it was declared that the Jesuits were at the bottom of it all and that every bag was loaded with treason. It’s a long way from those days to our own, when Brother Theogene and his foui-Brother-clerks manage a post office for a community of four 'thousand. But then, William Dockwray never thought of the air-mail or even the mail truck.	.
Meanwhile the Brothers keep on sorting letters.

From the Purdue Exponent:
“ ‘Amusement and education are separated from each other in European universities,’ said Dr. Franz Jaeger of the University of Gronigen, Holland, when asked to compare the higher education of Europe and America. Athletics in his university, he says, are purely personal with no thought of loyalty to the college. Even the curricular work is not closely supervised, and a student enrolled may pursue his studies as he wishes and report to take his examination when he feels prepared.”

“Thou Shalt Not Sing—at least not at 2 o’clock in the morning,” was the decree laid down to 16 students at the University of Illinois.

Does a college education pay after all? This question is raised by Judge C. W. Pound- of the New York court of appeals. Judge Pound is a graduate of Cornell university, class of ’87, and was formerly a teacher in the university’s law school. In a recent interview with a Cornell Sun reporter he stated in part:
“A college education may make a man pensive and hesitant. It might take the punch out of him. It ought not to have that effect. He will find, however, that non-college men often possess the courage and energy that count for success anywhere and for which no amount of learning will be a substantial equivalent.”
Hazing, it seems, is sometimes profitable to the hazer. It netted one dollar to this Gettysburg sophomore. He offered to move the bleachers for one dollar, and his offer was accepted by the athletic commission. Immediately the bulletin board was posted with a sign for every freshman to report to the field and be prepared for the task. The bleachers were moved—he looked on and issued commands—he’s in a dollar—and hazing lives on at that institution.

The class of 1929 at Princeton is carrying on one of the university’s time-honored customs, according to the Daily. Princetonian:
“Senior singing on the steps of Nassau Hall, which com
menced for the class of 1929 Tuesday, is one of Princeton’s oldest and best known customs.
“As early as 1760 we find the students singing campus songs at Commencement. It is not, however, until the rise of the Glee Club in the early sixties that campus singing started in its present form. At this time ‘Old Nassau’ was composed by H. P. Peck, ’62. During the Civil War campus ± songs gave way to more patriotic music, but as soon as the war ended old Princeton tunes were again taken up.
“In the eighties there existed a period of two weeks, called Senior Vacation, which came after the writing of final examinations and was utilized in the writing of theses. During Senior Vacation the graduating class regularly gathered on the steps of Nassau Hall when the sun was setting to sing the campus and faculty songs. This custom has been preserved ever since. At Comemncement the Seniors still gather before Old North for the farewell song and when they are through yield the steps to the incoming Senior Class and make a bonfire of the benches used during the ceremony.”
It pays to hit the books once in a while for the students who are “grinds” in college do better than the socially-minded student after college days are over. Colonel R. E. Rees, assistant vice-president of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, says a survey of 4,000 employees who have been out of college 25 to 30 years shows on a salary basis the scholars are 50 per cent more successful than the gladhanders.

A lampoon on the college man studying, from the Daily Illini:
“Picture of a soph studying:
“Well, it’s 8:30, guess I better start on that French. Hey, Spud, ya got my French book? Well, whooze got it? Aw, yei* crazy, how kin I see it when ya gotcher pants on it? Lessee, lesson 25—wow, a long one! L’abord, approach, no connection at all—no language like American; it’s logical. . .

An Academic Advance
FRANKLYN E. DOAN
Director Department of Public Relations
THE University of Notre Dame makes a definite advance in the academic field with the addition of Professor Emil Jacques, noted Flemish painter, to its faculty. Prof Jacques, although he has been in America but a few years, has a reputation in Europe as well as in this country, and the acquisition of such a personality by the faculty of the Fine Arts department should bring added prestige to the University. A member of the contemporary school of l lemi.sh painters, Prof. Jacques has for 35 years devoted his talents to painting. Hundreds of portraits, landscapes, murals and decorative effects bear testimony to his ability as a painter in oils, and acclaim the popularity which has been his for almost two scores of years. Administrative officers of the University, ever anxious to provide for students the best means of instruction, have asked Prof. Jacques to come to Notre Dame in the hope that Ms wide experience will prove valuable to Notre Dame men who seek distinction in the field of art.
Prof. Jacques was born a half century ago in Ypres, the territory which became famous during the war as “No Man’s Land.” He was educated in the schools of Ypres and early in his life showed a fond- ‘ ness and an attraction toward art. In 1893, he entered the Jesuit College at Ypres and remained there for two years. His teachers were so well impressed with the artistic leanings of the young Jacques that they encouraged him to seek specialized education in that field. Accordingly, in 1896, he went to Antwerp and became connected with the Royal Academy of Fine Arts
where he studied for five years. During that time; although still a young man, Mr. Jacques won the Grand-Prix of Antwerp in a competition which attracted some of the best artists of the day, and won second prize in the Grand Concours of Rome. After he had finished his course of study at the Royal Academy, Jacques was appointed to the Institut Superior des Beaux-Arts de Belgique, where he studied zealously for another five years. During this period he worked on a series of ten drawings, dealing with “The Flax, Its Culture and Industry.” The city of Antwerp, which commissioned Mr. Jacques to do his work, retained many of the paintings, but “The Hop-Pickers” and “The Flax Weeders” became the property of the Belgian government. Among the paintings which Mr. Jacques completed during this period of his life, “Innocence,” an allegorical canvas, and “The Sick Child” stand out. The former is possessed by the Ant-
River Scene and War Dance, prize paintings by Emil Jacques
werp Art Museum, and the latter is now the property of the Museum of Bucharest.
Acclaimed throughout southern Europe and well grounded in Ms art, Mr. Jacques became a professor of art in the Royal Academy of Fine Arts at Mechlin, Belgium. He remained there for five years and was also commissioned as government inspector of Belgian Art Schools. In 1918, Jacques devoted himself to portrait and lanscape-painting and in 1923 he came to America. He became a Professor of Art at Columbia University, Portland, Ore., and has been con-pected with that institution for five years.
Prof. Jacques has worked in every’branch of oil-painting. Not only are Ms paintings artistically beautiful, but many of them have added historical significance. A series of drawings which he made in Ypres prior to the World War, is now retained by the Belgian government as Mstorical document, because it preserves a section of Flemish life which was changed radically by the devastations of the War. Portraits of prominent men, allegorical and religious paintings, and mural decorations are included in the range of Prof. Jacques work and art museums and galleries throughout southern Europe and parts of America, as well as many private galleries, are proud of those canvasses wMch the Flemish artist painted.
Prof. Jacques attributes Ms interest in the Indian atmosphere to a natural love for Mstory. All of the scenes are typical ones and were painted after the artist had studied Indian life closely. In speakingof these paintings, Prof
Jacques says: “I have represented nature in bright colors because the Indian saw nature as I have shown it. I have attempted to catch Ms spirit and have given about Indian life what I consider its most salient characteristics.”
The “Tijd” of Amsterdam, says: “The Belgian professor, Emil Jacques, with these other renowned Flemish painters, Emil Claus and Theo van Rysselberghe, with whom he is af-aifined in the luminous art-expression, is a representative of the Flemish country, of the Flemish people. His work is all life and sun, full of blooming glory and sparkling colors.”
Notre Dame is fortunate in acquiring the genius and the inspiration of Prof. Jacques. To his many accomplishments as a painter of life, may be added the development of a Notre Dame man who will become distinguished in the field of fine art.

An interesting paragraph in the story of football in this country, has been written by Harvard University. The Cambridge institution recently made known its resolve to abolish intercollegiate football, with the exception of a yearly game with Yale, and substitute intra-mural competition in its place.
The plan calls for each hall to put forth a team every fall; these teams to compete for the championship of Harvard; then, from them, will be selected some eleven men who will meet Yale in Harvard’s one foreign game of the year. The plan closely resembles, it is said, the systems now in force at Oxford and Cambridge.
The Chicago Tribune has editorially accused Harvard of becoming medieval, yet the supporters of the plan will, just as vociferously, maintain that Harvard is ahead of the times, and that, after a few years the other educational institutions of the country will come abreast of her.
As a matter of fact there is nothing new in the so-called Harvard plan. As Mr. Eckersall pointed out in The Chicago Tribune, Notre Dame has been carrying out this plan through interhall contests for University championships some thirty years; and the team which represented the school in outside competition came chiefly from these interhall athletes. The Harvard plan may be new to Harvard. It is very old here. And it is a very good plan. We commend it to Harvard. It will develop what Harvard wants—a good football teain.	—M. H. L.

Ti l FAFFING GF TFT MINIM/
On another page of the Scholastic there is a news item telling of the University’s plan to discontinue the Minims department and remodel St. Edward’s Hall into a residence hall for students of college grade. Known throughout the country as a school for boys under the age of fourteen, St. Edward’s has always been associated with Notre Dame. Until 1921 both high school and grammar school students received their education at St. Edward’s, but in that year the high school department was discontinued. Now the grammar school too must go.	’,
The present expansion program of Notre Dame necessitates the abolishment of the Minims department. The school which was first started by Father Sorin, founder of the University, must give way to the exigencies incidental to the growth of Notre Dame in the last few years. The boys in the school were Father Sorin’s pride and joy—his “princes” he used to call them. And it is easy to understand why they were his “princes”; no finer collection of “reg’ler fellers” is to be found anywhere.	'
Because of this important reason University authorities have decided upon the change. But the Minims will be missed next year; missed a great deal by the students as much as by anybody else. The . youngsters are -firmly entrenched in a warm spot in the heart of every Notre Dame man, and their de parture is looked upon with regret.
The building committee is to be congratulated upon making this necessary change. Without doubt such a decision required some courage. It must not have been an easy matter to decide to abolish so traditional a department. The Minims have been part and parcel of Notre Dame too long. So the decision to make the change must have been fraught with serious thought and consideration before it was reached.	—D- W. s.

The Funeral Hour
JOSEPH CLEMENTS
( ( A ND the old lady’s dead.”
/% “Yep, she was gettin’ purty old, an’ her life was hard. Lived on the farm ever since she came from Caroliny.”
“Big family?”
“Eleven—eight boys, an’ three girls. She raised ’em all, an’ all of ’em got married too. Course the girl from Texas an’ the boy from Californy—they won’t be here. But all the rest settled hereabouts, an’ they all had big families . There’ll be a big enough crowd here for the funeral. Always liked to see a big crowd at a buryin’.”
r
The old farmhouse was crowded with coarse, stem-featured farm-people. Men stood shyly by in corners, seeking more unapparent places. They wore clean overalls, or Sunday :	suits, if they had them. The preacher consoled the sons and
daughters, and walked about with mournful solemnity. Younger , farm-maids watched these elder women disdainfully, and held handkerchiefs saturated with cheap perfume to their faces to evade the stench. Hot, panting children chewed, and twisted dirty, sweaty handkerchiefs in nervous wonderment. Flies buzzed in and out of the unscreened window, and lit on the mosquito netting over the coffin. The body had been kept five days—July weather at that!
Outside, the undertaker backed his hearse into the yard to the front door. The team hitched to it blew and blustered their nostrils as they pawed the earth, and twitched their skin in an effort to shake off the flies that clung so persistently to their hides.	•
The funeral hour was near. The undertaker bustled in and started to move the rude bunches of flowers away from the coffin. Those who had come to the funeral, just to be there, started out to their waiting buggies and wagons. The j near relatives formed a line, and passed by once more to see how Grandma looked laid out. The preacher led a short - prayer in a quavering voice, and those in the room answered
him between panting sobs. The coffin lid banged, and the casket stands squeaked as the body was rolled over to the door.
“All those wantin’ to see the corpse, form a line to the right,” instructed the undertaker.
A long line with the close relatives in the rear formed at the grave for a last brief view of the old woman. Dark thunder clouds lowered overhead, and the fresh-displaced red clay, gave off a hot, sultry oppresiveness.
The line filed slowly by. Women dabbed their eyes as they passed the coffin. Men twisted old felt hats in nervous hands. Finally, the sons and daughters came, with, their children by their sides, or in their arms. The emotion-scourged daughters wailed, and tears ran down their spotted faces onto their bosoms. Unrealizing children sobbed because their mothers sobbed. The sons cried softly, and tears ran down over their weather worn faces. They all hovered about for a last look, and then the undertaker started to fuss impatiently with the casket lid.
One daughter moaned insanely, bent over the discolored, skin-tretched face of her mother and kissed it passionately. Her tears dropped, and formed blacker spots on the black “put-away clothes” on the corpse.
“Here! Kiss Grandma! You’ll never see her again!” the crazed daughter moaned to her children.
One by one, she held the four of them over the dead body, and almost shoved their faces to the face of the corpse. Then she walked dazedly to the open grave, hands to fore-ehad, pulling back sticky, damp hair from her eyes—eyes staring wildly, and breath coming in sobs.
Once more the coffin lid banged. The casket was carried to the grave, and as it dropped slowly from view, the leather straps slithered through the knotted hands of the coarse, stern-faced pallbearers.
And then the preacher started to intone, “Ashes to ashes, and.......

Bland idleness . . .
White silence ...
Solitude . . .
Ennui . . .
Light floods the room.
THROUGH the windows, rumors of nature enter in sourdine. The wind fingering the chevelure of the tender- willows. Blotches of green, the rustling foliages. Birds inscribing parabolas against the intolerable stupidity of the blank sky. Electric wires, in front of the window by the desk. Heavy hours of the afternoon. Everything slumbering silently. Tire mind is veiled. Thought slides diagonally on a plane of two dimensions. Noises are indefinite in the long corridors. Splashing water as a door-opens—silence, as it is closed. Steps that faint and fade away. Someone coughs. Echoes stumble along. Alone in the silent room; the eyes concentrated on nothing. Looking out, looking in again. Thinking about everything, thinking about nothing. Letting the imagination leap prodigious distances and plunge into the past. Plain day-dreaming. Tire eyes finally rest on a book. Novels of Cervantes. The imagination rushes back swiftly. Noisy, dynamic New York. The vertical city. The apartment, that night. The long hands caressing the gray Persian cat. Long talks. The dark skin and the jet hair; the strange oblique eyes shining like obsidian. The sea trip together. Cocktails and laughter- on board. Tropical nights between Habana and New York. Then, just last Autumn, again in Habana; as nice as ever, waving the hand with the great ring. Nothing after that. Never wrote again. The father, that old gentleman, never-forgetting his days as Ambassador to Madrid, later to Paris, and now in exile never- mentioning them. . . .
Time passes; minutes drop like coins into a deep well. Not a stir in the room. Silence, silence, a dull, moaning silence. ... A cigarette is lit. There is the smoke now; the distracting volumes curling up like the white wigs of the French Louises. The shadows grow deeper, like wrinkles in the face of the ageing afternoon. The hours die one by one, accumulating death. The little Chinese Foo dog of white porcelain stares boldly in the empty eye. Elastic Gongor-ism. Clear remembrances of past summers in distant lands. That last afternoon before leaving. The dim room. Tire exotic things about. The setecento ivory Madonna, and statuettes carved in China; the Ming tibors; the iridescent Venetian glass bowl with lotuses; the antique furniture inlaid with tortoise shell, ivory and silver. The tall figure
standing by the Coramandel screen, talking vaguely; the words absorbed by the damasks and the brocades on the -tired walls. Then the pale hand extended with a present. The strangely calmed goodbye. The noisy streets. Then later, the hurried departure and the moistened kisses the white, empty words before the train started. The curious unwrapping weeks after .... (Another cigarette). Then .. that night in Rome, suddenly coming across the same pale face in the Corso, after a lapse of two silent years. The •< shadows have crept like leprosy. The afternoon has to be incinerated for fear of contagion. Someone climbs the stairs and walks towards the door. The steps cease abruptly; then continue. Knocks on another door. Silence. The knob is tried; in vain. The steps turn back and disappear in the distance. Ila the little siren of Denmark porcelain evokes the birth of the year. 57th Street. Fifth Avenue. New ■' Year’s Eve. The baptism of the little siren with champagne. A harmony in graws and terse flesh colours, plunging into the effervescent liquid amber. Emerging after the pagan rite like a glittering gem. The hand searches for the watch. The other hand holds the last cigarette. The room is filled with a dense mist. A feeble blade of sunshine pierces through like a splinter light. The windows are opened. ; Air enters impregnated with the perfumes of evening. The afternoon is dead, all wrapped in gray veils on a pyre. It -burns. A cheap sunset blazes away in the distance. Vanity Fair- lies on the bed. Marie Laurencin’s cover, a pale vision in grays and rose, ambiguous and feminine. The pages pass, the eyes detained on nothing. The eyes close. The world disappears.

Largo
D. H. LARRY
THE quiet end of day has come, and a long ray of the lowering sun breaks through the shaggy lilacs to lodge on the toe of my broken shoe. I hide the shoe beneath my skirt, but it is not satisfactory, for my skirt is shabby as well. It is hateful, and I bite my lip. My lip, tco is old, sodden, nerveless, wrinkled, without beauty, like all my insignificant life. . . .
You are lying on that bed where once your poorest groom lay, above the stable which housed those pawing, fiery-eyed horses, which have gone, as have your wealth and those whom , you loved, leaving only you. For you have failed; your body is the burned out shell of your once splendid self, and you will not last much longer. You know this. And still you will not admit in one least lowering of your cold prideful eyes that all your life has not been forged out to your finest satisfaction.
I sit here in the last pleasure of the sun, flunking of these things and looking at the sadness of your closed-up house, hearing the vague echoes of that long past time. Why can I never tell you all these things which I feel? Why are you able to ward off the punishment- which your life has earned ?	*	•
When you pass in the street you make me believe that you have been out for the air in the fashionable way, as if you still walked with the rich pleasure of one who knows no want and is immune from the everyday. And I hurry along, bent on the petty details of my life, and the you who lurks behind that stiff mask of face leers at me. How can this be ? when I know that you have only been to that cheap cafe for a pinch-penny breakfast: when I know that I have spent for my husband’s and my pleasure more for little good things than you can afford for a whole week.
Still you walk along with your stiff legs and your straight y body, not touching your walking stick to the pavement for fear that it will be dirtied perhaps by that soggy leaf from last night’s rain. Automobiles pass by, and street cars and great lumbering trucks; boys run along on the way from school, shouting and climbing fences and swinging books on long straps; young girls pass you by, with their eyes for ' others. All these things must tell you that your time is ... past, and more: that you have not earned even the small satisfactions which those who have begotten children enjoy, much less that you have rich memories of the beautiful life which was offered you and which you flung away. But you walk along, a little backwater that knows nothing beyond itself, nor cares.
. When we meet you ask me about my new house, and in your voice there is the feeling that it is not much of a house. And I think of the stone rabbits on your lawn here, and of the great lions crouching by the steps of your great old house. I hurry along with my basket filled with cheap little things and with my hat maybe a little askew. I know you i are not laughing. You are not thinking of me.	’
This sun is softening. The stable is throwing a long • shadow that will soon disappear, and then you will come out to stroll along the streets in the quiet dusk.
I think that sometimes you sit for a while on this old bench by the lilacs. Do you first put down a handkerchief? - When you look at your house, and its signs: FOR SALE: do they accuse you? Or do you only remember that time when
your house would have been lighted by now, with long candles. . . . that time when your house murmured to the voices of servants, and ladies whose skirts rustled on the glossy floor. . . . ladies whose hands were soft. . . . (one of them touched me once, do you remember?—it was your mother, and you laughed at me). . . . and you were its master. For you are not its master now, the lawyers can throw you out when they wish! But still you carry your cane.
I know that if you think of that old time you are all regret and no joy; you are a reasoning man now that all those passions have burnt their course, leaving only the dryness, and the cold. You must see me, with my new house built from nothing, and think that if on that violet summer night I had answered you differently you would still have those fine horses and not only the ghastly odor of them, to breathe while you sleep the days away.
You meet me on the street and make me think that it is a poor husband whose wife must walk along with heavy bundles. But you are wrong. If I have dreamt of splendid gowns with long trains, of oval mirrors and small gold chairs, of elegant men and women, gracious and grand, it is not, my husband’s fault. He has no idea of these things. He is a house and his thoughts do not go very far. He mixes all the brilliant paints which are left over in our cellar and finds that all together’ they only make gray. We wonders how this can- be. He does not know what I think of the house he has slaved since we were married to build for me; what I think of its glaring yellow pine. He mixes all the brilliant colors and gets gray, and he does not understand it.
You may think him a poor fellow. He has no canes. He has never known what it is to command a house full of servants, to own horses and carriages and to have flowers in lapis-lazuli vases from Italy. What do I think of him ? You think he is a poor fellow.
You told me I should have such an one as he. You remember it when you ask about my new house. I could have had you and this great house, could I not? Do you remember that I refused? I had that in me which refused to be enslaved, and I thought I should guard it. You know that I have lost it, as everyone does.
The great leaping horse on the weathervane is awry, and dull in the sun. You sleep beneath it, peacefully, in the room which’ was once used by your grooms. Do you have a cane beside your bed? Do you ever notice the broken ears of the cement rabbits on this lawn? How can you smoke cigarettes when you have not enough to buy food ?
But you will come out of that door when the sun is a little lower; you will be cool and fresh, with a cane and a cigarette. I will slip through the hedge and hurry along so that we will meet at the walk, where we have met so often. When we meet I will forget the boarded-up windows and the FOR SALE signs. You know this.
You will lift your cane and poke its end about the vegetables here in my basket.
“What have you there? Ah, asparagus. The tips are very fine now, don’t you think?”
And I will not answer, and after a moment you will lift your hat and go on, swinging your cane. . . . relishing yourself.

Cuchulain of Muirthemne
EDWARD BRENNAN
FOR a school as noted for its Irish sympathies and feelings as Notre Dame is, there is surprisingly little reading of Gaelic literature by the students. The Hibernian Collection in the library is almost totally undisturbed, and the books of Irish tales are allowed to gather dust, until they become as decrepit as the textbooks used by the students, which are allowed to remain upon the desks, throughout the academic year. I do not claim that I have read widely in this field, but I have read “Cuchulain of Muirthemne,” a book which I believe to be the best collection of Irish tales printed in English.
The book is really the Irish epic, being the account of the deeds of one Cuchulain, a hero of Ulster. Unlike modern novels, the main theme is not closely followed. In fact, the old Irish bards who wrote these tales seem to have been very willing to wander- off from the main trend of the narrative, and to tell us of the deeds of countless forgotten heroes, regaling the readers’ with an account of “old, unhappy, far-off things, and battles long ago.” Strange as it may sound, this willingness to wander from the main theme is the feature which gives the work half its charm, although it is true that it does not fit the book for the hasty reader. Lady Gregory, the compiler and publisher of these Irish tales, is to be given great credit for permitting these digressions to remain in the
work. With much less trouble she could have compiled a book, which would have better suited popular fancy, by pruning away these legends, until she had nothing but the story of Cuchulain left, but such a work would not have stirred the imagination as much as her work does.
True, there are many laughable incongruities in the book. Cuchulain seems to have thought nothing of slaying a hundred enemies with one doughty sword stroke. Heroes bear charmed lives; coming through bloody battles unscathed, and they are able to bear untold hardship or to do seemingly impossible feats; in one story Cuchulain nonchalantly lifts a castle off the ground, but in spite of these shortcomings, or rather because of them, the tale remains a very entertaining* one. They portray the thought and feeling of a people who regarded a story as an end, not as the means to an end, people who were in love with stories and story-tellers.
Such is the tale of Cuchulain, a tale well worth the reading, in my estimation. To give some idea of the sweep and power of the work which, although in prose, has the roll and grandeur of blank verse, I will quote the superb lines with which the tale is ended: “But the three times fifty queens who loved Cuchulain saw him appear in his Druid chariot, going through Emain Mancha, and they could hear him singing the music of the Siddhe.”
The Poetic Imagination
PHILLIP DE ROULET
IT has been said that poetry is the singing in a man’s heart which sometimes is overheard. Unfortunately, however, this definition leads the reader to suspect that the creation of beauty through the medium of lyric rhythms is a very simple process—one which requires a light heart and an audience possessed of sharp ears. It excludes the delicate carving, the fine chiseling, the careful craftsmanship which the true poet must possess along with the purity and strength of mind which encourages the flowering of poetic image. The importance of technique cannot be overrated in a study of poetry, that is, if the student carries on his investigations with even a remote desire to achieve a modicum of success in creative writing. We shall assume in this paper that the reader studies versification better to fit himself for the writing of poetry ; and, we shall presume that he has already a keen and eager appreciation for the singing ecstasy of meter, imagery and rhyme.
In the study of technique no form of poetry is more valuable to the student than the verses of Japan. In the verse of the Island Empire we find the most exquisite in poetic carving. So delicate are the strokes of the creative artist, so sure his hand, that in his work we find beauty—infinitely simple, yet glowing with a sort of interior iridescence. The form of the Japanese poem might be compared to a translucent globe of tin proportions, through which glows orient light of pure beauty. Ken Nakazawa, an authority on Oriental Literature, has defined the poetry of his people as,
“the dewdrop that holds a rainbow in its heart.” The comparison is obviously apt, when we pause to consider that the '' two most popular* forms of poetry in Japan are the tanka and the hokku—of thirty-one and seventeen syllables respectively.
It is amazing how much beauty can be carried Li a form so slight. These forms of poetry seem to me to be not unlike a beautifully carved incense burner, in which is placed an exotic perfume endowed with a mystic power to trans- ' port us into delightful realms of fancy. This is the intent of the poet of Japan. He makes no effort to paint for us a picture, a thing of beauty resplendant with detail. He merely suggests, with lines of almost infinite purity, a scene so lovely as to leave the appreciative beholder almost breathless with delight.
Probably the most typical of the really fine poem of the Oriental artist is:
“How cool! Moonbeams drip from bamboo leaves.”
In this we find all that is beautiful in the poetry of the East. It is delicate as a miniature carved in ivory, as care- -fully executed as a slender vase of cloissonne. It possesses all the power of suggestion, for which the truly great poet strives, and it carries the reader into far-off places, places crowded with romance and beauty, mysticism and magic. Yet there is about this slim verse a naive quality which the poetry of the. Occident has infrequently attained.

A Poet of Love
LOUIS L. HASLEY
RUPERT BROOKE is one of the most truly lyric poets in the English language. He devoted himself to one great theme—Love—and this keynote is apparent throughout his work. Whether he sings of his friends, his native England, the soul, a sweetheart, spring, war, heaven, or of death, it is always Love that is uppermost.
No other poet with whom I have come in contact is as continually and irresistibly exuberant as Brooke. Here and there one finds a mournful or a disappointed note—a dejected mood—but only for a moment; for he is soon back again singing of Love, of Love, of Love unquenchable. He is “The Great Lover”:
“These have I loved:
White plates and cups, clean-gleaming,
) Ringed with blue lines; and feathery, faery dust;
/ Wet roofs, beneath the lamp-light; the strong' crust
Of friendly bread; and many-tasting food;
Rainbows; and the blue bitter smoke of wood;
And radiant rain-drops couching in cool flowers.”
J And after thus naming a long list of delightful things, I he says:	*
“Dear names,
‘	And thousand other throng to me!”
In this poem, certainly one of his finest, we see Brooke as a man in love with life, experiencing a joyous surprise with every new object he encounters, or with the mere mention of old familiar sights. But his is not entirely a materialistic love, for he says:
'	“Oh, never a doubt but, somewhere, I shall wake.”
Often his song will take a whimsical turn, when he seems to part from himself and view lovers objectively. In “The Chilterns,” he speaks of an unfortunate love affair:
“And I shall find some girl perhaps
।	And a better one than you,
•-	With eyes as wise, but kindlier •
And lips as soft, but true
I	And I daresay she will do.”
I Despite the general singleness of his theme, the poetical |	forms that Brooke uses are widely varied. He	employs the
H	short lyric in numerous forms, and handles the	longei- lyric
S	with exceptional artistry, although he seems,	like Poe, to
g	feel that there is no such thing as a long poem.	His longest
I work, “The Old Vicarage, Gratchester” is less than one hundred and fifty lines. He was a tireless experimenter, I and consequently many of his poems cannot be classified un-| der any standard form; and in none of them did he discard the use of rhyme—but rhyme that is neither too simple or
obvious to become wearying, nor too difficult to call undue attention to itself.
It is, however, in his use of the sonnet that Rupert Brooke is especially fine. Here he combines the experiences of his delicate sensibilities, his excellence of technique and, what is more important, his faultless dramatic taste. It is always interesting, although perhaps idle, to speculate just what a poet of Brooke’s calibre might have done had he lived to old age. To me it seems inevitable that, had he lived, he would have been the foremost dramatic poet in the English language to-day. Mr. Lascalles Abercrombie, one of the greatest of our present day younger poets, has called Brooke’s “1914” sonnet sequence “incomparably the finest utterance of English poetry concerning the Great War.” The five sonnets contained in that sequence are, indeed, the body and soul of Rupert Brooke, equally as noble in his love of life as in his willingness to die for his country. In “The Dead” he says:
“These laid the world away; poured out the red
Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be
Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene
That men call age; and those who would have been, Their sons, they gave, their immortality.”
Brooke’s dramatic sensibility is perhaps best exemplified in his sonnet, “The Hill.” Two lovers are blissfully repeating how happily they will die:
“We shall go down with unreluctant tread .
Rose-crowned into the darkness! . . . Proud we were And laughed, that had such brave true things to say.
—And then you suddenly cried, and turned away.”
The" last line is a monument to his artistic genius. And this sonnet is an experiment—certainly a successful one. Witness the unusual rhyme scheme: a-b-b-a, c-d-c-d; e-f-f-e-g-g.
When the World War came in 1914, Brooke was one of the first to go. He sailed ■with the British Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, and. in April of the next year he died on shipboard in the Aegean. Mr. John Drinkwater, prominent English poet and dramatist, said, “There has not been, I think, so grievous a loss to poetry since the death of Shelley.” Brooke was twenty-eight when he died. Certainly, if the quality of poetry that Brooke has left us is any indication of what he might have done had he lived, Mr. Drinkwater’s statement is no exaggeration.
To-day on the little island of Scyros in the Aegean is a hallowed spot where fourteen years ago a body was gently laid to rest at night, by torchlight. There, by thoughts that know no space, or by reverent pilgrimages, the world pays homage to Rupert Brooke.
3Ky Ship Of breams
Like a ship on the deep, Battered and torn By winds, That comes into port at last After the storm has passed;
So has the Ship of Dreams Weathered the storms And anchored lies
Again.	—john l. nanovic.

Track Men Score Over Michigan State
Coach Nicholson’s Squad Takes 10 Out of 15 Firsts
Flashing an unexpected display of speed and brawn, a surprisingly strong Irish track team rode rough-shod over Michigan State last Saturday on Cartier field to bury the Spartans undei* an 83 1-3 to 41 2-3 score.
Notre Dame jumped into a commanding lead at the very outset when Elder, Boagni and Nichols slammed the hundred.
Then Pete Morgan ran the finest race of his career to nose out Clark of Michigan State, a point-winner in last year’s I. C. A. A. A. A. championships. Morgan ran a heady race, timing his sprint beautifully to win by inches from the smooth-running Clark.
Johnny O’Brien skipped over the high hurdles to win easily in the fine time of :15 5-10. Hackney of Michigan State surprised by coming from behind in the 440 to nose out Tom Quigley in a driving finish. Joe Quigley came right back however, to run his field into the ground in the 880. The younger member of the Quigley family led all the way to lead Don McConville to the tape in the excellent time of 1:59.2.
Roy Bailie turned in what was possibly the best performance of the day to win the broad-jump and the low-hurdles. His distance for the broad-jump, 22 feet, 10 inches, was above the ordinary, but his time in the low-hurdles was undoubtedly the best of the meet, despite the fact that he had the wind behind him. Lauren Brown, State’s diminuitive distance star, ran his usual well-judged race to win by some forty yards from his team-mate, Chamberlain. John Brown, who has been training for the mile instead of the two-mile during the outdoor season, finished third.
To Big Bob Walsh went the only record of the day when he heaved the shot 47 feet, 6 1-2 inches to smash Dan Lyons’ field record. Later the big fellow came back to win the discus throw with a heave of 128 feet, 1 1-2 inches, making him the second double winner of the meet. McDonald and Hoffman also garnered places in two events, as did Johnny O’Brien. Dan-Welchons showed signs of his old form when he took the high-jump with a leap of 5 feet, 9 inches. Fish-leigh and Slattery, Irish pole-vaulting twins, tied for second place behind McAtee, Spartan crack.
AU in all it was a most satisfactory performance that Coach Nicholson’s men turned in, the times in the distance and middle-distance events being especiaUy noteworthy considering the strong wind and the condition of the track. It seems that at last the fruits of Coach Nicholson’s labor are being brought forth. Bailie, Walsh, Joe Quigley, McCon
ville, Hoffman, Morgan and O’Brien are all products of the genius of Coach Nicholson. These men had little or no experience a year or so ago, but now undei* the skillful guidance of John Nicholson they bid fair to be the backbone of what will probably be one of the best track teams in the country next year. The summary:
- 100-Yard Dash—Elder, Notre Dame, first; Boagni, Notre Dame, second; Nichols, Notre Dame, third. Time, :09 7-10.
One Mile Run—Morgan, Notre Dame, first; Clark, Michigan State, second; Brown, Notre Dame, third. Time, 4:31 8-10.

NORTHWESTERN SWAMPED IN FREE HITTING BATTLE, 11-5
In a free hitting contest, Notre Dame piled up ten runs in the first three innings against Northwestern last Saturday afternoon on Cartier field and defeated the Purple, 11 to 5. Oliphant, Northwestern’s first sacker, knocked a homerun over the left-field fence in the sixth inning, scoring Prange ahead of him. This is the first time in four years that a ball has been driven over the left-field fence of Cartier field.
The Notre Dame slugging machine got into action early and collected a total of ten runs in the first three innings. Northwestern tied the count in the second inning after the victors had opened with a trio of runs in the first. The Ramblers came back in the second with two, and pounded the offerings of Panosh, Purple twirler, mercilessly for a total of five runs in the third. Panosh was then taken out of the box after allowing eight hits, and McAleece replaced him on the mound.
With McAleece in the box, Notre Dame failed to get but two hits and one run which they scored in the eighth inning. The earlier rallies were aided by poor support on the part of the Northwestern infielders, six errors in all being chalked up against the base guardians .
Oscar Rust easily had the better of the pitching duel, allowing ten hits and striking out eight .men, while only one Notre Dame man whiffed during the game. Notre Dame garnered ten hits off the combined pitching efforts of Panosh and McAleece.
Jim Bray, subbing for Bill McCleary at the keystone sack, played a fine fielding game and besides took all slugging honors for the day by procuring four hits in five times at bat. His base running was well above par, as he stole second three times. Moran and Feehery also hit well, the former making a triple and the latter a double.

JACHYM HURLS FOUR-HIT GAME IN DOWNING MICHIGAN STATE, 9-1
Joe Jachym came out of his “hard luck” slump and let Michigan State down with four hits, while his team-mates were piling up a total of nine runs against the Spartans’ one in a contest played at East Lansing last Friday. Notre Dame opened the scoring with a lone run.in the second, and Michigan State tied the count with one in the second as the result of a bad throw by Joe Lordi.	.
For the first five innings it was anybody’s game, but in the sixth Notre Dame got to Gerald Byrne, Michigan State twirler, and scored three runs after two men had been re-tired.
Another rally in the eighth frame netted four runs for the victors and a last run was added in the ninth to make the final score, 9 to 1. Jachym allowed the Spartans but four hits and kept them well-scattered. He fanned twelve of . the Michigan State players.
Moran led the Notre Dame sluggers at bat, poling out four hits, one of them a double. Joe Lordi crashed out three singles and Jim Bray was credited with a triple.

RACQUETMEN MAKE CLEAN SWEEP IN MATCH WITH MICHIGAN STATE
The Notre Dame squad of racquet swingers overwhelmed the Michigan State college team Monday afternoon on the home courts in a dual meet by the score of 7 to 0. The Irish captured the five singles matches and both of the doubles events.
The most interesting matches of the meet were those played by Capt. Griffin, Notre Dame, against Swan, Michigan State, and Burns, Notre Dame, and Pennington, Michigan State. Griffin failed to hit his stride in his opening set, dropping it 4 to 6. In the next set, however, he came back strong to win 6 to 3. The final set was the most interesting of the match. There was an abundance of volleying from back court enlivened by quick spurts to the net for kills. Griffin finally won out by the score of 6 to 4. Burns copped his opening set easily enough, but dropped the second when his opponent ran off three games to van 6 to 3. The final set went to Burns after an exhibition of good tennis on both sides. Scores:
Singles—Markey (Notre Dame) beat Kanex (Michigan State), 6-2, 6-4; Griffin (Notre Dame) beat Swan (Michigan State), 4-6, 6-3, 6-4; Burns (Notre Dame) beat Pennington (Michigan State), 6-4, 3-6, 6-4; O’Brien (Notre Dame) beat Jennings (Michigan State), 6-4, 6-3; Kane (Notre Dame) beat Bentley (Michigan State), 6-3, 6-0.
Doubles—Markey and Griffin (Notre Dame) beat Kane and Pennington (Michigan State), 4-6, 7-5, 6-3. Reaume and Cianci (Notre Dame) beat Swan and Jennings (Michigan State), 6-1, 6-2.

STRONG NORTHWESTERN TEAM TAKES TENNIS MATCH, 5-2
The Notre Dame tennis squad met defeat Wednesday, May 8, at the hands of the strong Northwestern team, 5-2, on the Evanston courts. The matches were all closely con
tested and the outcome of the match was not assured until the first match in the doubles had been played.
Bud Markey, Gold and Blue flash, had an easy time in his singles match with Bert Riel, winning in straight sets. The Irish ace drove and smashed his way to a 6 to 1 victory in । the opening set, and as he continued this fast attack in the second set Riel resorted to a lobbing game in an effort to slow up his opponent. Bud proved equal to this style, however; and consistently took the lobs in mid-air for kills.
O’Brien, the only other Notre Dame player to win his singles match, defeated- Rooney in straight sets. The duel between Burns, Notre Dame, and Perrin, Northwestern, was the most spirited of the day. Although the Purple star won j( in straight sets he was forced to carry the opener to twelve games and the final to fourteen.
Both of the doubles matches were dropped by Notre Dame, although they were close and fiercely contested. Both doubles matches went the entire three sets. Scores:
Singles—Markey (Notre Dame) beat Riel (Northwest- ji ern), 6-1, 6-2; Bergherm (Northwestern) beat Griffin (Notre	.(
Dame), 6-2, 6-4; Perrin (Northwestern) beat Burns (Notre | Dame), 7-5, 8-6; O’Brien (Notre Dame) beat Rooney (Northwestern), 6-3, 6-1; Martin (Northwestern) beat Kane (Notre i Dame), 3-6, 6-2, 6-2.
Doubles—Riel and Bergherm (Northwestern) beat Mar-	|
key and Griffin (Notre Dame), 5-7, 6-3, 6-3; Perrin and	j
Rooney (Northwestern) beat Burns and O’Brien (Notre Dame), 8-10, 7-5 and 6-3.	.

MARKEY AND GRIFFIN REPRESENT NOTRE DAME IN C. I. C. MEET AT CHICAGO
Bud Markey, fresh from his recent victory over Tom Wilson in the Indiana college tennis meet, and Ted Griffin are representing Notre Dame in competition with thirteen othei-colleges in the first annual Central Intercollegiate tennis meet at the Chicago Town and Tennis club. The semi-finals are to be held today with the final events tomorrow. Silver loving cups are to be awarded to the winners and runners-up ; in both singles and doubles play.	.
Tom Wilson of Butler, who defaulted his finals match to । Markey in the downstate tourney last Saturday, will also be present. Christopher will be Butler’s other entrant. Markey and Griffin also copped the doubles championship at the meet held in Muncie, Indiana.	.
With the cream of the middle-western racquetmen entered, interest is running high as to the outcome of the tourney. At least six stars who have held junior and sectional titles during their tennis experience are entered in the singles play, and three of these will be watched closely when the national college championship play begins in June.
Harris Coggleshall, Grinnell ace, who went to the quarterfinals of the national collegiate meet last year, only to be defeated by Julius Seligson of Lehigh, who subsequently won the college title, is picked to win the Central Conference title. Coggeshall’s march to the top will not be unimpeded, however. Riel, the number one man on the Northwestern squad, is conceded a chance to whip Coggeshall. Tom Markey and Tom Wilson, of Notre Dame and Butler, respectively, are rated close to the Grinnell player. Frank Brody, tri-states champion last year, and George Boehmer, whom St. Louis university is depending upon for singles honors, may spring a surprise.
Harry A. Walsh, president of the Western Lawn Tennis Association, and Knute K. Rockne, director of athletics, will have complete charge of the play. Leo J. Lunn of Chicago has been named as head referee of the tourney.

; TWELVE HERING MEDAL CONTEST WINNERS ANNOUNCED
As a fitting climax of a most successful Spring football practice season the Hering Medal contests have occupied the major portion of this week. The ■ Hering awards are made possible through the generosity of Mr. Frank E. Hering, ’98, a prominent South Bend attorney. Each year the outstanding men in the various departments of the game, enter the competition for the awards.
The player to show the omst improvement over last year’s work and the best all around man are - yet to be announced by Coach Rockne. Any man who has previously won a Hering medal is not eligible for the competition.
The following are the winners to date:
Punting—E. A. O’Brien.

Eight games with opponents of the highest college calibre is the card for Tommy Mills’ boll tossers during the next two weeks. Coach Tommy is confident, however, that his men have hit a winningstreak and that they will continue to win games by clouting the ball.
J t ?
The return of Bill MacCleary to second base will bring the personnel of the club back to normal. “Vic” Hart took care of the center garden in creditable style while Jim Bray was in the infield, and Harry Francis showed his ability on the bases and in snaring flies.
t I i
Harry Francis is, by the way, probably the fastest man on the team. Rojan, the Northwestern catcher, made a good choice for his team when he picked “Tank” Donohue to run for Lordi in the game last Saturday. Had he selected Francis the fans would have seen some speed.
t $ t
Oskar Rust is probably hurling this afternoon at Illinois. If the Arkansan’s pitching is up to the standard he has set so far this season the Illini will be in for a tough session.
tit
Coe College may be faced by “Tank” Donohue tomorrow. Tank has turned in some nice games to date and should hold the Coe hitters down. Other hurlers who may soon see action and who will bear watching are Art Dorwin and “Lefty” Disecki. Both boys work hard and are developing into excellent material for next year.

SOPHOMORE HALL LEADS MAJOR LOOP;
BROWNSON HALL HIGH IN MINOR
Next Sunday’s games will complete the interhall baseball season and the winners of the two. leagues will probably be the present leaders, Sophomore in the major loop, and Brownson in the minor. These two teams have won nine straight games without a single loss.
Two teams in each league are tied for second place with seven wins and two losses apiece. Mon’issey and Sorin are the runners-up to Sophomore in the major circuit, and Carroll and Brownson trail Brownson in the minor loop.
Morrissey hall’s major team lost two games last week to give Sophomore undisputed possession of first place. The Morrisseyites lost to Carroll, 11 to 9, and in the big game Sunday, they were defeated by Sophomore, 7 to 5.
A youngster from Brownson hall, Joe Miller, turned in the best hurling bit of the entire season by pitching a no-hit, no-run game against Howard while his team was winning, 13 to 0. Several Howard .men got on base via walks and errors but not a single player was able to reach third during the contest. Miller, a southpaw, struck out twelve men.

Even if Harvard does drop all intercollegiate competition except the contests played with Yale, it is doubtful that there
will be many to follow her example. Many schools could not maintain the intensive intramural competition favored by Harvard unless there were intercollegiate contests to pay the expenses of the campus competition.
❖
Incidentally one of the things that has made intercollegiate competition so beneficial is the fact that the contestants train religiously, thus aiding in character development. It is hard to conceive of the contestants in intramural games training to take part in them.

As a constant user of EDGE-WORTH Tobacco for the past four years, I can say I have enjoyed the comforts and pleasure of the World’s Finest Tobacco. If EDGEWORTH were running for re-election, here is one sure vote for it. Its uniform quality is the outstanding feature and 1 recommend it highly. The EDGE-WORTH Club hour over WRVA is highly pleasing and helps to form a good combination.

Camel
WHY CAMELS ARE THE BETTER CIGARETTE
Camels are made of the choicest tobaccos grown.
The Camel blend, of Domestic and Turkish tobaccos has never been equaled.
Camels are mild and mellow.
They do not tire the taste.
They leave no cigaretty after-taste.
Camels have a delightful fragrance that is pleasing to everyone.
