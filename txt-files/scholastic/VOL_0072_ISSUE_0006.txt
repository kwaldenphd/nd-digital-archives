LINNETS BRILLIANT IN OPENING SHOW
By Edmund Butler
A prefatory blare of trumpets heralded a glorious rebirth of the Linnets in Washington Hall last Wednesday evening as the group, reorganized by freshmen, presented their first concert, an amazingly colorful and lively show.	.
Bolstered by intricate lighting and stage effects, which lent the air of Broadway production, and attired in their new gold-buttoned, mess-jacket uniforms the Linnet Glee Club and orchestra presented unique interpretations of such memorable numbers as “Deep In My Heart,” “March of the Musketeers,” Ravel’s “Bolero,” “Stouthearted Men” and many others.
The vivacious pace which characterized the performance brought back memories of the more informal Linnet rompsters that tread the hall boards a few years ago. It was seven years ago when the boys first organized, intent on presenting musicals with a modern touch. During their two years’ existence they gave excellent versions of two operettas and did various shows on the campus which were met with vigorous acclaim, but after the transfer of their director the organization dissolved.
The quality of the two talented soloists of Wednesday’s show, Anthony Donadio and Martin Wiede-man, recall the fine work done by Roche and Maynard of the old crowd, whose rich tenor voices won wide acclaim.
The new group is twice the size of the old one, and their performance is assured by the unity that they manifest. At 7:25 last Saturday'morning the Linnets sang at a Mass said for them in Cavanaugh chapel by Father Trahey, C.S.C. These Saturday' morning Masses will continue throughout the school year, and all are welcome to atetnd.
From 7:30 to 8:00 next Wednesday night the Linnets will do a broadcast over Station WFAM. This will be their second appearance over the air waves.
Friday, Nov. 4, has been set as the deadline for Scrip contributions according to Fred Digby, editor. All manuscripts should be received by him, in room 401 Walsh Hall, before that time.

PHILOSOPHERS WILL ATTEND FORUM
The symposium on political and social philosophy to be held at the University Nov. 4th and 5th will attempt to erect some permanent and scientific markers along the high and low roads over which modern political philosophies are marching today. The clash of the totalitarian doctrines of communism and fascism with democratic standards will be discussed.
Jacques Maritain of L’lnstitut Ca-tholique, Paris, France, will open the symposium. The noted French philosopher and author will choose as his subject “Integral Humanism and the Crisis of Modern Times.” Professor Carl J. Friedrich of Harvard University will follow Doctor Maritain and warn of “The Threat of State Absolutism.” Professor Friedrich is known for his writings on constitutional problems and foreign politics. His most recent book is The Making of Foreign Politics.
At the afternoon session, Nov. 4th, Ferdinand A. Hermens of the University faculty will discuss “Dictatorships and the Economic Policy.” Dr. Goetz Briefs, specialist in labor economics from Georgetown University, will follow Professor Hermen’s discussion with a talk on “The Rise and Fall of the Proletarian Utopia.”
Dr. Waldemar Gurian, of the Politics faculty of the University, will open the second day’s session with a paper on “The Political Religions of Today.” Dr. Gurian’s widely read articles on international politics are considered source material in this country and abroad.
Desmond Fitzgerald, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Irish Free State and present member of the Irish Dail, will follow up Dr. Gurian’s address with his answer to “The Problems Facing Catholic Rulers.”
Dr. Yves Simon, member of the Faculte Catholique de Lille, France, and the University of Notre Dame, will then speak concerning “The Concept of Work and Workmen.” Dr. Simon is especially well known for his valuable studies on the moral principles involved in the Italo-Ethiopian conflict.

The Making of a Capitalist
If the textbook entitled The Business Man’s English is a criterion of the intelligence of the average senior in the Commerce school—well, we’ll let you judge for yourself. For instance, the chapter called “Punctuation” begins with this profound bit of exposition: “The period. This mark (.) is used.” After the examples that follow, the chapter goes on to the question mark, i.e., “ ( ? ),” the exclamation point, i.e., “( I ),” etc. Of course we have always had a feeling that there are several Commerce seniors who might not know how to punctuate, but we really thought that they knew at least that the proper symbol for a period is a dot.
Then too, we claim the book makes an unwarranted divergence when, in discussing the parentheses, it says, “These marks ( ) are used.” Obviously it should retain the policy it has been using all along and say, “These marks ( () ) are nsed.”
We really did learn some very important facts, however, in the part of the book devoted to the use of the telephone, an instrument of “momentous importance in modern business.” For example, here is a nifty little Dale Carnegie bit we picked up on answering the phone:—“Do not shout, ‘Hello,’ with that injured tone which plainly says, ‘Well, what do you want, anyway?’ This will drive away business and cause you to lose your position about as quickly as anything you can do.” And for the niceties of Bell etiquette when making a call: “When the operator says, ‘Number, please?’ give her the number desired..........If the operator repeats the number, you should say ‘Right,’ if it is correct; otherwise say ‘No’ and make the correction. In most places the operator no longer repeats the number but merely says ‘Thank you’.” We are most unhappy because the book neglects to state whether you answer the operator’s final sally with a flat “You’re welcome,” or a snappy “You said it, kid.”
The philosophy majors have calmed down somewhat over what we said about them last week, so when the Commerce seniors cool off sufficiently now, we will proceed to attack the engineers or somebody.

The Light of Learning
Notre Dame has definitely arrived as a first-rate institution of higher learning. Like the ancient Greeks who argued essential questions everywhere from the Olympic games to the banquet hall, Notre Dame students are carrying their intellectual discussions to the football stadium. When a big cheer at one of the recent home games stopped suddenly, there was a loud silence except for one naked voice that still hung in the air shouting the accusing words, “Garvey is a Platonist!”

The “Cracks About the Dining Hall” Section
We have often heard stories about the clever salesmanship of the students who sell football programs and we thought this bit (though of course it doesn’t surpass that old one about learning the salaries of the players) was one of the best. A fellow standing at the entrance to the dining hall attracted buyers among the students coming out, by yelling, “Buy a program, take your mind off the meal” ... In case that dining hall cook is wondering where he lost that collar button last week, it turned up in a fellow’s mashed potatoes.
Warning
Whenever the mouse is tempted to go after the cheese he gets caught in a mousetrap.
The “Our Hero” Section
The referee of last Saturday’s game certainly caught just what his name implied he would getch.... Department of Understatement, (South Bend News-Times):—“Coach Kern of Carnegie was quoted as saying that Getchell ‘can be captain of the allAmerican team of boneheads until a bigger bonehead comes along.’ ‘That,’ Getchell commented today, ‘is a little bit rough of Kern.’ ”.... There were three important meetings at the football game last Saturday—the meeting between Notre Dame’s two courageous invalids, Van Wallace and Fred Snite; the meeting between those two artists, the Tech band leader and our own Nijinski; and that Four Power Conference among Adolph Friedlander, Benito Kern, Premier Beinor, and Neville Layden to discuss that erring Czechoslovakian, Getchell.

“Pointer” Points West Point for Points
If you can figure out the “point” in the title to this article, it’s time that we told you that ever since the September 23rd issue, the West Point Pointer has been suggesting a victory over the Irish this year. In their initial football write-up the Army magazine prefaced its sports notes with “Beat Notre Dame.” Then, in no uncertain terms the paragraph tells of the Cadets’ distress about the N. D. situation: “We of the class of 1939 first heard it in 1935 when the then first class told us that no man at the Academy had ever seen a Notre Dame victory. ‘Beat Notre Dame’.” Well, lads, gather around while I explain our side of the Notre Dame-Army story: We, as seniors, have never seen any Army victory, and we’re expecting to have this year’s juniors repeat the same thing- next year.-
Status Quo :
Last week we told you about a boycott thrown up against us by a certain girls school near Chicago, and now we’re'told from a reliable source that the score in the boycott business is tied so far as we’re concerned. Our secret “College Parade Agent” tipped us off that our friends across-the-road want us to- boycott them and don’t care to have their school’s name mentioned in this space again. It’s all because they didn’t particularly care for the publicity we gave them in our “squib” about Saint Mary - of - the-Woods. So you see, this boycotting business has its vicious circles too.
Unconstitutional
At the University of Chicago, they once had a rule that provided for an “occasional” entertainment of girl friends in the rooms of the boys’ dormitory. By some implied interpretation the hosts thought this to mean a visit by the girls every evening until 8 p.m. But the authorities at Chicago have lately ruled that “occasional” only means that the girls may rest in the dormitory lounges and look over, the dormitory during the customary open-house periods.

Two choice debating battles were being waged at the same time last Wednesday evening. Chairman Funk rushed from the Library, where Alumni and Dillon were arguing, to

the Law building^ where Cavanaugh and Zahm were , debating,. and back again to the Library trying to see all the action, with the result that he was punchier than any of the contestants at the end of the evening.
Robert Weaver’s big,, bad, affirmative Seniors from Alumni trounced the poor, little, negative Juniors from Dillon. Three frightened affirmative Freshman from Cavanaugh barely defeated three equally frightened, negative Freshman from Zahm. Strangely enough the affirmative side, which had hitherto been considered the weaker, managed to win both debates.
The judge for the upperclass debate was John O’Dea; “T-bone” Bill Mahoney of track fame judged the Freshie’s efforts. Considering that these were the first two debates of the season, the boys were fairly well prepared.
Schedule for next week: Wednesday — Badin (aff.) vs. Freshman (neg.); Corin (aff.) vs.Dillon (neg.). Thursday: Lyons (aff.) vs. Zahm (neg.); Alumni (aff.) vs. Walsh (neg.). Friday: Cavanaugh (aff.) vs. Morrissey (neg.); Howard aff.) vs. St. Edwards-Old Infirmary (neg.).

Mr. Dowling did this in recognition of Father Murphy’s long years of advice and assistance to him. He felt that the .play deserved a higher destiny than mere box office returns.

VAN WALLACE MEETS "THE BOILER KID"
•
Van Wallace met Fred Snite last Saturday afternoon. As the bands filed off and the stands settled for the second half of the Carnegie game Van Wallace on his ambulance cot was driven along the north wall of the stadium to visit the “Boiler Kid” in his trailer. They talked for a few moments, Van Wallace looking out the back door of his ambulance to the mirror where Fred Snite smiled to him from the “Iron Lung.”
It was Fred’s last game this year. He had seen the Kansas and Illinois games but will be wintering in Florida Nov. 12 when the Irish play Minnesota. Van Wallace was seeing his first game since Pitt played here last year, but he hopes to come down from Detroit to watch the Irish make it two straight over the Gophers.
Monsignor Lavelle, LL.D. 1920, the Rector of St. -Patrick’s Cathedral, New York City, watched from the stands and'estimated the Irish chances against' Army "in Yankee Stadium Saturday. Monsignor Lavelle has been rector of St. Patrick’s for a number of years and has received the varsity the morning after the Army game many times.

Hands that "Recover" T-Shirts. Pack the Trunks;
Managers are Propmen Behind Stadium Setting
By James Magarahan
Although the famous Notre Dame Irish use only eleven men on the gridiron to vanquish their foes, many times that number labor vigorously and modestly behind the headlines to make the game a success.
Many eulogies have been penned about the touchdown whizzer, the dependable blocker, and the sensational tackler, but this is a tribute to those energetic Notre Dame men who carry the ball in the locker room, in the office, and on the train.
The managerial system, long one of Notre Dame’s outstanding campus or-

ganizations, was brought into existence in the days of Knute Rockne, and has continued until today being probably the most active group at the University. Through this medium, all preparations for games at home and on the road are completed.
Heading the 1938 football division is Joseph F. Dray, prominent senior, with four years of managerial experience behind him. Head Manager Dray, with his two associates, Lucien J. Lacroix and Andrew F. Wilson, . have already completed one distant trip with the team with success, due to the cooperation of the efficient staff of fifty-odd recruits from the Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior classes.
Before any such trip, preparations go on behind the doors of the gymnasium that require hours of tedious labor.
Several nights before departure, Andy Wilson, who is.responsible for all equipment, supervises the packing of .11 mammoth trunks. Assisting him are all the Juniors and Sophomore managers, who carefully tuck 40 helmets, 40 equipment bags containing the players’ togs, shoes, shirts and so forth into their places. Extra rain pants and rain “mud-cleated” shoes occupy space in another trunk, while trainer’s supplies are packed in a third one.
On the day of departure, Wilson stays with the trunks until they are carefully insured in the baggage car
of the special train. He aiso makes arrangements with a local trucking firm to haul them to and from the station, and then he takes a comparative rest during the journey.
In another department before the game, Joe Dray assists in outlining a detailed itinerary, which the party follows explicitly during the sojourn. Even the time of meals is recorded on a mimeographed sheet which is issued to each player. On the train the three seniors and two juniors, who usually make the trip, are kept busy 24 hours a day. Special spring water from Wisconsin is circulated through each car of the special, including the dining car. The players drink no other water in order to avoid infection. Twenty-five cases are carried on each trip, each case containing three gallons of water. Every precaution is taken to keep the Blue and Gold gridiron warriors in best physical condition. The managers check the players at meals, after meals, and also at bed-time, usually around 10 o’clock.
On arrival in the opponent’s home town, Wilson once again remains with the trunks, supervises their hauling from station to stadium, and their unpacking.
During the mornings, the forgotten men usually have time for a much needed rest while the coaches instruct the team in chart talks, but during workouts and afterwards, five managers carry on the work done regularly on Cartier Field Monday through Friday by 30 fellows.
Dirty white clothes are speedily packed into a trunk, wet uniforms are hung up to dry, and final preparations are made for the game on the following day. At night in the hotel, once

BOWLER ADDRESSES POLITICAL SYNOD
•
Harold Bowler, junior in the department of government and politics from Ware, Mass., and a member of the varsity tennis team, addressed the Academy of Political Science on Tuesday evening at the Academy’s synod in the Law Building. Mr. Bowler reminded the Academy members and their guests of the “. . . 30-year period in which the immortal John Marshall headed the highest bench in the land” as he stressed the importance of “A New Deal for the Constitution.”
“Modem writers,” said Mr. Bowler, “attribute to Marshall the creation of the elementary principles of constitutional construction. Those who extol and those who criticize the work of Marshall—both of these groups admit the excellency of Judge Marshall’s basic principles of nationalism.”
“From the very beginning to the present there has been little variation from the main stem of construction which Marshall, in successive cases, drew with a firm hand.”
Tracing the movements of the interpretation of the Constitution chronologically, Bowler said, “The doctrine of what is now called judicial review is the last word, logically and historically speaking, in the attempt of a free people to establish and maintain a non-autocratic government.”
“Let us look at a Supreme Court that has suddenly turned liberal,” Bowler continued, “and let us look at the future prospects that New Deal legislation has before the courts of our land.”
The speaker then discussed the new Wages and Hours law that is in effect in many states already, and which definitely will come before the Supreme Court for review. Should holes of defect be found in the law, Congress will get the opportunity to mend them in its next session.
The Academy is admitting a limited number of juniors and seniors, not majoring in the political field, according to Fred Sisk, chancellor of the group. Applications for membership should be addressed to Edward Huff, 404 Howard Hall, chairman of the membership committee. Assisting Mr. Huff are Ted Kmiecik and Bernard Swanser.

Man About the Campus
By Graham Starr
Everybody knows that the Army game is tAie goal of the student trip this year. But few know the inside reason for its choice. Queer coincidence of the week is that Robert William Huether, Sharon, Pa., S.A.C. chairman of the trip, celebrates his 22nd birthday tomorrow. And his roomie says that for months Bob has been yearning to go to the Metropolis for his birthday. Speaking of plebescites in German territory. . . .
Bob has a faculty for making trips. So far he has gone home 26 times since he came to Notre Dame, with a record of 17 “bummings.”
Maybe this denotes a man of the world, but Bob is a family man. The youngest in the family (“My how I
hate that baby of the family talk,” he says), he has five sisters, two brothers, and 13 nieces and nephews.
Bob started out early to be a Man About the Campus when he first set foot on the campus as a freshman. He had climbed from his car parked at the express office, and was demon-, strating the traditional freshman “blank look” when a priest came up and asked from where he came. “Sharon, Pa.” he answered.
“Oh, the Huethers come from Sharon,” Rev. John F. O’Hara, C.S.C., president of the University, said. Bob’s two brothers evidently were men about the campus themselves. Brother Ted knew Elmer Layden, and Brother Jack was president of the S.A.C.

PURDUE PHYSICIST EXHIBITS GLASS
A beautiful collection of art glass which contains a large number of old Bohemian, German, and French pieces, will be exhibited tonight in Washington Hall by Dr. K. Lark-Horovitz, head of the department of physics at Purdue University. As a supplement to the rare exhibition Dr. • Lark-Horovitz will present a lecture on the explanation and technique employed in the making of glassware, and the historical development of the different methods employed in the art of coloring, painting, and engraving artistic glass pieces.
A native of Vienna, Dr. Lark-Horovitz has served at several different institutions in this country before coming to Purdue University in 1928. At Purdue he has developed a modern research department in physics which employs now close to 50 staff members. Most of the research work in the department is concentrated in the fields of X-rays, electron diffraction, and nuclear physics.	,
While serving in the Austrian army in the Sudeten, center of the Bohemian glass industry, Dr. Lark-Horovitz had the opportunity to get acquainted with a great number of glass factories and started a collection on art glass. He will show a number of lantern slides illustrating glass objects from Roman times, some new slides furnished by the Copenhagen Natural Museum.
Dr. Lark-Horovitz will also exhibit samples of old and new American glasses partially obtained from the collection of Louis Buckles, Mrs. George Spitzer, and others in Lafayette. To make the technique in the different processes of glass engraving visible to a large audience, the art objects themselves are enlarged by use of a projection lantern. The objects will be on exhibit before and after the lecture.

Radio
By Bernard Feeney
The Campus Radio Studios will offer staff members a larger variety of production experimentation in view of the ambitious program sched-ues released for the next four weeks. Station WFAM has allotted fifteen quarter-hour periods for each week of November. The weekly schedule seems well-balanced, featuring adequate proportions in the educational and variety types of programs.
The regular series of Faculty Talks, heard on Monday evenings at 7:45, will feature Dr. Francis McMahon, Professor of the Philosophy Department. Last week Professor Staunton, of the English Department, inaugurated the Faculty Series with an address on the approach to English literature. Professor Bartholomew will present students of his Political Science classes in discussions of recent political developments each week, Monday through Friday, at 11 a.m. This series received much response last year for excellent presentation of varied subject-matter.
- The campus microphone will be focused on Morris Frank, who will offer a quarter houi- of light classical songs Wednesday at 7:45 p.m. The Music Department will present a series of music appreciation programs on which student talent will be featured prominently. The time for this series has not yet been set. The Mod-ernaire’s Dance orchestra, under the direction of Carl Hunn, will resume their regular period of dinner dance music on Friday evenings. Consult your local newspapers for the exact time of each of the above musical programs.
Radio reviews sports with Walt Hagen each Thursday evening with Walt’s fast-clip delivery hitting your loudspeaker just about 7:05 p.m. Last year this sportcaster had a pretty good average on his football guesses, and -this department looks forward to a good Hagen repeat this season. The Periscope, a fifteen minute commentary on campus events, - will again feature the subtle reviews of Ed O’Connor, our raconteur deluxe.
It is hoped to have production plans completed within a week for the Round Table broadcasts of the Academy of Political Science. This is a new addition to the schedule and the list of subjects selected for discussion should attract the interest of the general radio dialer. On November 16th, the University Players will present a preview of “Room Service,” the successful Broadway comedy scheduled for local presentation the following week.

Wenninger, C.S.C., dean of the University’s College of Science, the Midland Naturalist continues to present in a concise form the latest developments in the sciences with which the publication treats. Dr. Just, former assistant curator of the National Museum Herbarium in Vienna, Austria, is engaged in cataloguing the valuable Greene botanical library and herbarium now housed in the Biology Building. Father Wenninger is editor in charge of papers in invertebrate zoology.
In the current issue not only scientists but also gardeners in general will find interest in an article disclosing the discovery of nine new species of “thrips.” “Thrips” are very tiny but serious pests, usually of the plant parasite variety, which attack onions, cabbages, melons and greenhouse products. J. Douglas Hood, of Cornell University, is the author of the report.
New information regarding the striped skunk and interesting revelations concerning the cottontail rabbit of southern Michigan are included in the 13 articles on natural science in this issue of the magazine.

With Paris as base headquarters the Society of St. Vincent de Paul moved on into the towns of the provinces and then into foreign countries.
In 1936 was published a report concerning the work of the Society in Egypt and the Sudan. Cairo claimed the first conference established in Egypt in 1853. The second was founded ten years later at Alexandria. At the time of the reports, there were 80 conferences in Egypt and Sudan, Cairo having 46 of them, Alexandria 10. Egypt had subscribers and honorary members who numbered 2,389. The active members totaled 887.
Port Said represented the Suez Canal Zone with a conference in 1908, and in 1936 it had a good membership. This conference was dedicated to the Immaculate Conception.
Spain lost the work of the St. Vincent de Paul Society as an organization when it was driven out of the country after the revolution in 1868. Not until 1875 did the Society regain its former status.
Frieburg has its Academic Vincent’s conference in 1909, and in 1934 it celebrated its 25 years of work. In those 25 years, 266 students of the various schools, such as the law school and the philosophy school worked with the Conference. There were,’ however, during this quarter of a century about 2,000 students associated with the Conference.
New York City was the first Conference of the Society established in this country, in 1846, at St. Patrick’s Cathedral. By 1858 the Society was spread into such places as Philadelphia, Rochester, Albany, and Louisville. One of the great works at the time of the Civil War was the distribution of “The Christian Soldier’s Manual” which was put out by the Society. Through the efforts of the . New York Council the Little Sisters of the Poor were brought over to this country, and have taken wonderful care of those old men and women who were in need. It is remarkable that in 1865 at the Second General Assembly for. the Society in this country the St. Louis Superior Council as well as New York’s was present; there were all the 11 Particular Councils and' 101 Conferences^ the number in the United States, that had their delegates.

Theatre
By R. J. Sadlier
A man from Mars — with a ticket to the funniest entertainment in the universe — shooting off into space and leaving it to the gods to drop him in the right spot, would be pulled by a great magnet to Washington Hall, right here on the ol’ N. D. campus. And he’d probably be plopped right down into a mob of laughing people who wouldn’t be giving a “tinker’s hoot” about how sore their sides were getting from their hilarious outbursts. And, as for that man from Mars, well — he’d be rolling in the aisles with the best of them!
What’s this all about anyway? Well, my doubtin’ Tom, here’s the cate du jour. The play is “Room Service,” direct from Broadway and Hollywood where it left everybody in convulsions for months and months. You think I’m kidding? All right. Then read what “Stage” has to say about it.
“There’s no stopping this mad-hat-ter farce. The manager of the Whiteway Hotel or whatever it’s called is still trying to get that bunch of broken down actors out of that hotel room and people still stream in, bearing their stuffed animals. It’s one of the funiest pieces of dementia ever conceived.”
There you are. If you’re not convinced by now you will be in November, because the Players are presenting this opening vehicle of their on the 22nd and 23rd. Those are the dates, all of you first nighters and N. D. critics, and the curtain will go up at eight!
New Play Hailed
Raymond Massey, one of the very great of the great English actors, has just taken New York by storm. The play is Robert Sherwood’s “Abe Lincoln in Illinois.” Massey does the part of Lincoln; and his performance is so fine in its physical picture and so genuine in its projection of the heart and soul of the martyred one that it is pretty sure to haunt the memory of any playgoer who sees it. One scene, in which Lincoln stands on the New Salem prairie, his face bathed in moonlight, and offers a simple prayer to the Almighty to save the life of a child, is an incident of such sheer beauty and dramatic eloquence, that there is nothing able to surpass it, except possibly that scene from “Shadow and Substance,” in which Bridget, played by Julie Haydon, sees her miraculous “vision.”
Washington Hall Invaded
Washington Hall is a strange place these nights. For the first time in many moons, young women have invaded our hallowed sanctuaries and are working hand-in-hand with these
“Irish” actors of ours for the greater glory of “deah ol’ N. D. (Surely, if-the Jitney’s can have “deah ol* alma mater,” we can have “deah ol* N. D.”) Miss Barbara Southard is co-starring (my! my! this terminology!) with G. G. Hogan, Esq.; and Miss Gertrude Krause is “pitchin’ woo” with R. Blake, Esq. — on the-stage, of course. Consider yourselves fooled, you Wincheilites! We have no flashes on any tete-a-tete back-stage. Good Lord! Here I’m wan-, dering on and on and on, and the. Director is tearing his hair out in the wings. It’s my cue to get off the stage, so, if you’ll pardon the attempt at humor, ex-cues me until the next time.
Music Notes

The students and friends of Notre Dame extend their congratulations to Joe Casasanta and his boys for the fine entertainment they provide during the halves. Much can be said in
Director Casasanta His boys parade.
praise of the Notre Dame band. The band exists without the inducement of scholastic credit. The only return the band members receive is one or two trips a year and the pleasure of working with Joe. In each game this year the band has prepared completely different formations. The music played on the field is memorized, an accomplishment that can be said of few other bands.
That the out of town visitors recognize the quality of the Notre Dame band is shown by the following letter:
Oct. 17, 1938 Mr. Joe Casasanta Department of Music Notre Dame, Indiana
Dear Mr. Casasanta:
My compliments to you on the splendid performance of your band last Saturday. We enjoyed hearing and seeing it very much.
We appreciate your courtesy and hospitality on the occasion of our visit. We hope that you will be able
to bring your band to our stadium in the near future.
Very sincerely Mark H. Hindsley Assistant Director Illinois Marching Band
The Kiltie band of Carnegie Tech was organized by the late Ed Sullivan who died last summer. Between the halves of the Carnegie Tech game the Notre Dame band formed the letters of his name and played Gounod’s “Ave Maria” in his memory. Mr. Sullivan was an outstanding band leader and a friend of Notre Dame.
This week the band ’goes to New York. This trip is the climax of the marching band season. The entire fifteen minutes between” halves' will be turned over to the Notre Dame band. The maneuvers will include Irish formations, salute to both schools, and a tribute to Rockne.
The band deserves our encouragement and support. -Best wishes, Joe, for continued success. ‘

Almost every day the University Art Department is visited by curious students going or coming from Public Speaking classes. Perhaps these students, and those others to whom the Art Department is but a vague reality, would be interested to know just what the University Art Department is all about.
The art students number about 25 in all. They seek to develop their innate abilities in art under the guidance of Professor Stanley S. Sessler and Francis J. Hanley; and, at the same time, to continue their liberal education toward a general A.B. course that differs but slightly from the prescribed routine of the regular A.B. student. During their Freshman and Sophomore years the art students are trained in the fundamentals of drawing — emphasis being placed on the careful observation and rendering of various inanimate objects in different media. This includes accurate studies of the numerous sculptural reproductions that have been collected at considerable expense by the University. When the students enter their junior and senior years they begin a period of advanced study and are given more opportunity to express their own individuality in their work. Their classes are centered about a re- ‘ view and appreciation of world art, a study of anatomy, portrait and still life painting, and life drawing. When graduation rolls around eac student must present his thesis to the Univer-

Twenty-Fifth Meeting
TOMORROW afternoon in New York when another capacity crowd files into Yankee stadium, they will see the twenty-fifth meeting of the football teams from the United States Military Academy and the University of Notre Dame.	•
Year after year this game has remained as the unchallenged headline game of the week. Its annual. popularity is so firm that many fans attend, because they know the spectacular thrills of the Notre Dame-Army game are as certain as day and night. To some thousands of these fans, the contest will mean an opportunity to support with their loyalty one of the schools which they probably have never seen. For others it will. mean a cemented loyalty to either the Irish or the Army because this class of fans are students or alumni of one of the two schools. By radio the battle between the Army and the “Notre Dames” will be carried to another overflowing
crowd whose reasons for hearing the game are the same as those of the actual spectators.	•
Aside from this, tomorrow’s game can be viewed from a symbolic viewpoint to show the causes which have resulted in such lasting effects. The beginning of the game will symbolize the existence of two schools which were founded on and have taught the identical principles of man recognizing God first, his country secondly, his school next, and finally himself. And when the final score of the game has been written into the quarter-century football history of the two schools, everyone will know that a win, tie, or defeat will be accepted in a spirit of good sportsmanship by either side, because each school believes in a standard of discipline, scholastically and physically, which trains its men to tolerantly anticipate and "accept wins, defeats, and ties in life just as in a football game.—Frederick E. Sisk
You and the "Scholastic"
THE COLLEGE magazine exists with a twofold purpose, to put before the students such information about college activities as may be of interest to them, and to serve as an organ for the expression of the students themselves, their talents and opinions. In fulfilling this purpose the Scholastic has met with numerous obstacles, chiefly in the nature of a lack of voluntary interest and expression on the part of the student body at large. We are cognizant of a recent trend towards an extension of activity in this field. However, before the ultimate goal of an eminently articulate student body is reached, the improvement must embrace a much larger perecentage of the students. And we do wish to point out a few of the many possible aspects of student life which offer a wide field for expression of opinion. .
Campus clubs provide a prolific source of inspiration. In their meetings, discussions occur, papers are read, opinions are aired. And to what end—that a few pleasant hours are spent, and forgotten. Other people are interested in what specialized groups are doing. Why not let them know about it—and incidentally leave a permanent record of yourselves and your activities that you can look back upon with pride. How many students spend their years at Notre Dame with nothing to show for them— not the least contribution to the tradition and culture of the school—nothing, save a degree.
Even to those who are not active in campus clubs, the Scholastic offers an opportunity for expressing themselves. What about the “bull session?” Often has this time honored college institution been defended with the same platitudes about teaching you to think and expressing yourself. If it really does help you express yourself, and we are not at all certain that it does not, then you have even less excuse for remaining silent.	,
Willingness to cooperate is what we ask. Every issue of the Scholastic carries an invitation to potential contributors to come and see us. Opinions, evaluations, criticisms of events, lectures, books, movies—these are but a few of the possible fields open to you. Cooperation and interest in college journalism, specifically your Scholastic, will go far toward developing the most potent factor in Catholic action, the Pope’s own desire for an informed, articulate Catholic laity.—Mark J. Mitchell

Mellowed Memories
By FRANK AUBREY
A gentleman of the old school returned to the campus last week. More specifically, Mr. Samuel Keeler, a kindly and - chipper old grad of the class of 1895, came back to revisit for the first time the somber halls and the storied surroundings of his youth. Mr. Keeler first saw Notre Dame way back in ’86 when he entered old St. Edward’s hall as a youngster of seven. At that time St. Ed’s was considered the “Gold Coast” inasmuch as each student paid the sum of $500 for a year’s schooling there. Five hundred dollars translated into our present inflationary currency would amount to around $2,000 according to Mr. Keeler, and consequently he feels quite proud about the whole thing.
Back in Sammy’s days, for that’s what he wanted me to call him, the Main Building, Sorin, St. Edward’s, the Infirmary, Science Hall, the bakery and various workshops comprised the buildings of the University. Out behind the Dome in the woods stood the ice-house, for in that era the lakes were used for something more than receptacles for the forcibly baptized or swimming holes. The old post office reposed plump in the middle of the present Main quadrangle. Just how often the St. Mary’s mail came in, Sammy wouldn’t say.
Activities and recreation in the ’80’s were confined to the campus. There were no shows or Rosie’s to frequent. Instead, the boys had their fun with and at the expense of the Brothers who had charge of the halls. Though Sammy was one of the three Protestant boys in his class, no one could have a greater love and respect for the Brothers and Sisters than he. Thursdays were holidays for the school, and Sammy’s rector would always gather a good-sized group of boys, send over to the kitchen for pies, cake, cookies and some big jugs of hot chocolate, and take the gang down to the lake for a picnic. Sammy was unable to suggest how such a mouth-watering spread could be arranged nowadays, and we didn’t think
Mr. Lovelly would be very reasonable either.
In response to a query about the Friday bill of fare, Sammy explained that in his day St. Mary’s and St. Joseph’s lakes were teeming with bass, pike, and trout which often supplied the piece de resistance for the day. He also explained his intricate method of catching these fish — an arrangement featuring a sled and a hole through the ice — but the stunt seems impracticable nowadays when we can

FALL
By Robert B. Johnson
I hate,the fall
When wind rips dying leaves
And drops them down to lace the ground
In brown decay;
Fall is the evening of the year— The dying time of day.
But after all,
When weak man sighing grieves
At winter’s frown that lurks around— So dead, so grey,
It is not that which makes him fear, But his like-destined clay.
। ■ ' ................
get fresh fish direct from the ocean. Nevertheless, anyone who has any doubts of the directness of the itinerary of our Friday fish supply can get in touch with Mr. Keeler of Considine, Michigan, and get their fish his way.
Sammy wouldn’t have dared to mention this 45 years ago, but it
seems that Notre Dame students of old acquired much of their “outside” edibles from the surrounding farms. Many’s the nightly foray he’s been on when the loot included peaches,-plums, pears, tomatoes, radishes, and even watermelon. As an adHed feature Sammy tells about the time he himself brought back one farmer’s cow and managed to drag her up two flights of St. Edward’s stairs and deposit “Bossy” bag and baggage in the prefect’s room. Repercussions from this escapade were violent and explosive, so much so, in fact, that Sammy wouldn’t advise anybody to try the stunt again. I assured him any foreign bodies introduced into present halls are more likely to be more portable — firecrackers, or beer bottles, for instance.
Getting Mr. Keeler to tell us about himself was beside the point, but he revealed that he was a former army officer, having served during the Spanish-American War, in Hawaii, in the Philippine Islands, and in China. At present he. holds a position in the government service. He wanted to emphasize that because of his training at Notre Dame, he “never had to work with my back or muscles, but used this,” (pointing to his head). His personality did not belie his words for Sammy was very pert and active despite his age, and had a wonderful memory. He remembered the names of all his old teachers, — all the Brothers and Sisters, and little incidents connected with each.
Sammy wished to add a little personal message to every Notre Dame student. He believes firmly that “any boy who goes through Notre Dame and lives a good, clean life, will make a go of it no matter what business he enters, and he will look back at his life spent on the campus as the very reason for any success he may have.” He added somewhat humorously, that “everything he has and everything that he is, he owes to Notre Dame— that is, excepting his stomach trouble which for forty years has prevented him from eating solid food.”

"Old Rough and Ready"
By Himself
Mgptqlly I was as active as a fat man in a turkish bath? T'ju'stWasn't thinking. So with my mental resistance at an unprecedented low I found some mysterious force whipping my lagging steps to that den of professional time wasters, the old Rec Halls. I staggered in, eager to buy wooden nickels for a dime apiece, and got off to a promising start. Cyril the Clipper inveigled me into a dastardly game of fourteen ball, fifty point limit and then closed out with my grand total at eight. The raucous clink of my coins accompanied by wheezy grunts of glee from the Clipper heralded my prudent withdrawal.
With my ears flapping in the smoke riddled air, I meandered over to watch a heated ping-pong match and with my usual keen perception sized up the situation in one glance, put my cookies on the wrong swinger and, accompanied by violent protests,
paid up once more. Word got noised about that..Fish Reddy was around and sooner than it takes to recite the Gettysburg Address backwards with inflection on the wrong syllables, numerous Happy Joes sidled up with wonderful schemes ranging from left handed pens that alternate red and green letters and cues to break balls allergic to the corner pocket. It took me ten minutes to fight through this insistent crowd.
Weary and spent, but with Rover* Boy courage and Frank Merriwell cunning, I pushed over to a table, threw my books down and made as if to study. That fixed ’em all right. It’s the unwritten rule that one who studies or even tries to, is ostracized. It’s even rumored that once, not so many years ago, a youth made a practice of studying in the Rec. Hall. Business fell off, the' poolers and
pingers sought new spots for expression. So alarming and complete was • the exodus that , the custodian of cues and paddles timidly requested the oddity to depart very quickly.
All this flashed through my agile mind and lest I should suffer the dis-comforture of my predecessor, I shut my times with an authoritative plop and gave myself over to the enjoyment of a piano recital ten feet away. The maestro was soothing the student body’s collective nerves with “Beatin’ ’Round the Mulberry Bush.” Then the mighty R.C.A. chipped in with “Flat Foot Floogie” and something about a whirling dervish. A fellow with a face that made Frankenstein look like Shirley Temple-was jitterbugging up and down the hall. My poor head throbbing like Krupa’s drums, I skittered out of the clamor palace and over to class where one man does all the talking.
An Open Letter to "The Week"
In defense of a seemingly unpopular cause, I take issue with a certain statement made by a prominent columnist in the last issue of The Scholastic. Couched in dogmatic and no uncertain words, the alleged truism ran thus: “The proper object of the class is to absorb the knowledge imparted to it by the professor.” Offhand I would say that at least ninety percent of the faculty and five percent, yea six percent, of the student body will find some fault with your idea of the class. Probably you just listened to the noble sound effects which issue from this phraseology and hurried on with the rest of your syllogism. I am sure you didn’t understand what you wrote, or you wouldn’t have written it.
Though I am not an education major, I have always taken pride in the fact that in my capacity as a student I was considerably more than a blotter, a device that automatically soaked up anything thrown my way by the professor. A blotter takes it all in and under your scheme of things, the student is a blotter, a purely passive recipient of a thing called education. I am not a blotter.
I make a sincere effort to arrive at truth by blotting — absorbing, as you say — the truth and ignoring the untruth. And even a professor will tell you that some of what he “imparts” —71 like that word — is not the truth.
Most truth is arrived at by a prcess that is analogous to a phenomenon of the bovine world: rumination. By ruminating — a thoroughgoing “blotter” student doesn’t ruminate — the mind knifes away the oftentimes appealing fallacies and arrives at the bone, truth. This all presupposes considerable activity on the part of the ruminator. He isn’t a skeptic, mind you, nor an arguer for argument’s sake. But neither is he the swallower (absorber) of the whole chunk, meat, bone and gristle. Enough of that revolting analogy. It sounds simply awful alongside your formal excellence.
I am reminded of a simpler analogy which, I think, fits your definition of education as snug as a glove. It’s not the one about a classroom lecture: a passage of “education” from the notebook to the professor to the notebook of the student without touching the mind of either. That’s
too old. Very appropriate, however. No, this is one I made up. Under your scheme, the professor is like a man with a bucket of water, who comes into the classroom and empties his bucket of water (education) into your bucket. Then you make off and come back a month or so later. The professor asks that you give the water back and you comply. The giving-back is the examination. The only trouble is that you can’t give back all that has been given you. In the various transitions, you have spilled some. And while it was in your possession you spilled plenty. You don’t care, though, because you spent nothing getting it. And after you have “imparted” it back to the professor you are through with it. Surely no impression, profound or slight, has been made on your mind. But that is the kind of education your statement ‘ smells of. It isn’t education at all. .
Maybe these conclusions have been rash and fanciful. They do serve, however, to illustrate the dangerous simplicity of your major premise. We ruminators suggest that you make amends.

THE WEEK IN SPORTS
FROSH SHINE IN FALL HANDICAP MEET
•
Varsity trackmen, had their first test of the season last Wednesday and Friday when the annual fall meet was held. Some of the veterans did not compete for one reason or another, among them being Captain Greg Rice, Steve Szumachowski, Joe Beinor, and Curt Hester. But a few freshmen turned in some surprising performances, — Keith Roy winning the quarter mile in 51:8, Schierve besting Tucker and Coughlin in the 220 in the time of 23 seconds flat, and Kenny taking the half mile in 2:04.
Wednesday’s program got under .way in routine style with Steve .Coughlin and Bill Tucker running one, two in the century, Steve’s time being 10.4 seconds. Ray Schlenk was in the third position. The quarter was run off under ideal conditions— especially ideal for Nick who saw a possible successor for Pete Sheehan in Keith Roy, who beat it around the oval in 51.8 seconds, a very auspicious debut for a frosh.
The mile run, without Rice and Szumachowski, was somewhat slow, but found Kenny, another freshman, winning over Doggett and Norm Schickel in 4:58. Veteran Bob Lawrence took the 120 high hurdles from his old team-mate Morgan, and also repeated the procedure in the 200 low hurdles on Friday. Bob ran the low barriers in 21.8. Milwaukee’s gift, John Dean, vaulted 12 feet, and seems to have things his own way this season with Langton and Gibbs among the alumni. The broad jump was won by Tucker with a 21 feet 7 inches leap. This was Bill’s only first of the meet, but he had two seconds. Frosh Hilgartner and Junior Vin Giesler were second and third in this event.
The shot-put was taken by Costello who heaved 37 feet 6% inches, a scant margin over Dean and Donoghue.
■ Friday furnished a laugh for the spectators when a freshman named Buckley ran the 220 yard cinder track barefooted — after his usual high school custom. Nick can’t wait to see him run with shoes on. Another first year man, Schierve, took this event from Tucker and Coughlin in 23 flat. The half mile unveiled -Kenny who looms as great replacement material for Johnny Francis. Kenny’s time was 2:04, and he beat

Murphy Defeats Platt, Takes Frosh Crown
Jimmy Murphy of Cavanaugh Hall emerged victorious over Francis Platt of Brownson in the finals of the annual Frosh Tennis tournament held Monday afternoon. The scores were, 6r4, 6-4, 2-6, 3-6 and 3-6.
Both men fought their way to the finals the hard way, as they were pressed to the limit from'the very start of the tournament. Murphy came through the' semi-final round by defeating Dan Petersen of Brownson Hall 6-2, 4-6, and. 6-1- Platt won over Jack Barry of Brownson in their semi-final set, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 and 6-3.
. Platt seemed invincible in the opening sets of the final playoff, capturing both by scores of 6-4 and 6-4. But Murphy came back strong in the final three sets to win.
With the completion of the final sets, the tournament, which started several days ago, proved to be one of the hardest fought Freshman tourneys seen at Notre Dame in recent years. Competition was very close from the outset with over 50 men competing.
Al McGrane and Jim Rogers. The discus thrown went to Costello with a whirl of 114 feet 9 inches followed by McCarthy with 111 feet and Callan 98 feet 9 inches. The final event of the meet was the high jump taken via the handicap route by Morgan at 5 feet 8 inches.
On Saturday afternoon a Silver Anniversary will be celebrated in the Yankee Stadium. The gridders "of the United States Military Academy and the University of Notre Dame will be feted. The occasion — the 25th meeting of the elevens who represent these institutions. The Irish, however, will be in a sentimental mood. The Army, to them, is just .another difficult obstacle in their march toward the national title.
Captain Bill Wood is in his first year as tutor of the Cadets. He is determined not to duplicate the record of his predecessor, Gar Davidson, whose teams were never able to conquer the Irish, and feels that there is no time like the present for that Army victory. A look at the record will convince us of the offensive strength which the Cadets carry. Army opened against University of Wichita and they were victorious, 32 to 0. Virginia Poly fell before them, 39 to 0, but Columbia upset them, 20 to 18. Harvard was next to feel their pressure, 20 to 17, and last Saturday Boston University was bombarded, 40 to 0.
Art Frontczak, whose 96 yard dash was the highlight of the Columbia encounter, has taken the place of Jim Ryan in the Army backfield. Captain Schwenk, excellent pass receiver and blocker, “Woody” Wilson and “Huey” Long round out the secondary.
The veterans, Sullivan and Yeager, giant pass snarers, will be at the terminals. Little and Stella, tackles; Lotozo and Brown, guards; and Maxwell, center, complete the line.
There are several interesting sidelights. To many of the contestants this game will be a resumption of hostilities. The rival coaches are not strangers. In the early ’20’s the names of Bill Wood and Elmer Layden were opposite one another in the Army - Notre Dame lineups. Both were speedy fullbacks and excellent punters. Art Frontczak, powerful back, comes from the neighboring town of Dowagiac, Michigan, and will be anxious to meet the old rivals — Paul Kell and Earl Brown — who shared All-State honors with him in ’34. Joe Beinor will also be glad to get another look at Harry Stella, Cadet tackle, who played for Kankakee High when Joe was back in Harvey, HL

CADETS "BONE" FOR IRISH CLASH SATURDAY; ARMY SQUAD AT FULL STRENGTH FOR TILT
By Cadet John S. Harnett,
Assistant Sports Editor, The Pointer, Official Publication, United States Military Academy
WEST POINT, N. Y., Oct. 26.—(Special to the Notre Dame Scholastic) —Color, interest, rivalry, or just plain football—take it from any angle you want—the Army-Notre Dame series reaches a new high each season. Speaking
in cadet slang every man at West Point “bones” the Notre Dame clash with
unbounded enthusiasm. Cadets do not attempt to conceal the fact that Notre Dame and Navy are the two major campaigns of the season. The spirit of the Corps soars to mad heights and overshadows other facts of the game. During the week of the battle plebes paint white sheets with sketches, diagrams and illustrations of the coming encounter and the sheets are displayed on the walls of barracks. Pep rallies are more boisterous than ever, cadets’ grades go sliding merrily down, and it is not unusual to find history, philosophy or mathematics recitations cut short for remarks on the game. In brief, the week finds the Corps and officers “Notre Dame conscious.”
Tomorrow will find Elmer Layden and Capt Bill Wood renewing their rivalry as coaches. It was 14 years ago when the two were opposing players. Here’s what Capt. Wood says:
“From the standpoint of players and coaches the Notre Dame series is one of the best. Win or lose we have always learned a great deal from our games with Notre Dame and this association has been a distinct benefit to football at the academy.”
Wood said Army’s squad should be at full strength. In the cadet back-field Wilson, Frontczak, Long and Schwenk are the big four. Due, Mullin, Dubuisson and Martin are capable reserves. Starters in the line will be Sullivan, Lotozo, Little, Gillis or Maxwell, Brown, Stella and Dobson.
It is difficult to compare the two squads due to the variations in their respective schedules. The Army team is ready, the Corps is ready—come on you Irish, let’s go!

FRESHMAN, ZAHM TO MEET IN FINALS
•
Competition in the Interhall Pass-Football League reached its highest point of the current campaign during the past week as the Freshman and Zahm aggregations prepared for their coming championship game. It is probable that this game will be played on Thursday, Oct .27.
As the tilt approached, interest was centered mainly on the two Zahm teams. The Blues and the Golds both finished at the top of their respective divisions in the season’s play. In last Sunday morning’s semi-final round of the playoff, the Blues and the Golds combined to trim the Cavanaugh representative, 12-0. Then, to settle all controversies, the two Zahm team played each other on Sunday afternoon, and the Blues, by their thrilling 12-6 victory, gained the right to represent their hall in the finals.
Freshman gained the final round by edging out Brownson, 6-2. The outstanding feature of this game was the playing of Jack Leahy who threatened to give Zahm plenty of trouble in the final game.
In the soccer league, the Junior team leads the standings after a 5-0 victory over the cellar - dwelling Freshman squad. The Sophomores, by a forfeit from Cavanaugh and a 2-1 victory over Brownson, moved into a second-place tie with Brownson.

FR. M'NAMARA TELLS OF ARMY SERIES
When N. D. men jam the Yankee Stadium to see the Irish meet Army • Saturday, they -will help celebrate 25 years of brilliant football rivalry between Notre Dame and the United States Military Academy.
On a crisp All Saints’ Day in 1913, an obscure eleven from Notre Dame, a school somewhere in the Mid-West, came to West Point to give the Cadets a “breather” in the midst of a tough schedule. But by the half the breaths came in gasps. The Army was meeting bewildering opposition from a “fighting” team that was to be called the "Fighting Irish.” Four names which were to rock the football world stood out that day. They were Dorais, a 145-pound agile quarterback, Gushurst, Eichenlaub, and an end named Rockne. That unassuming Rockne fellow, the Army backs said, was all over the' field catching those novel forward passes in stride. Strange. Even more strange was the final score: Notre Dame 35, Army 13.
Among the 5,000 fans who brought their lunches (or went without) and sat in the crude bleachers that November 1 was the Rev. John MacNa-mara, ’97. He’s not missed a game since.
Father MacNamara stopped eating breakfast to tell about that first game with Army. “Of the incidents that stand out most clearly after 25 years, I remember the beauty of the fresh fall day at West Point, the startling passing combination of Gushurst, Rockne and Dorais, and the helplessness of the Army.”
Father MacNamara explained that the forward pass was a revolt against the tight-line strategy of those days; hence Army was bewildered. “A brand of football that opened the eyes of the East to the forward pass and to Notre Dame,” was the way Father MacNamara characterized the game.
So began a 25-year relationship that was to feature names like Rockne, Gipp, Elder, Cannon, Schwartz and innumerable others. Notre Dame has played Army 24 times, winning 17 of these contests, the Army five. Two games ended in deadlocks. For ten years Army-Notre Dame games have been consistent sell-outs, and here are some of the reasons:
1.	In 1917, when the Army was leading by two points, George Gipp, the back whom Rockne said was the greatest player .he ever had, ran 75 yards to a. touchdown.'
2.	In 1919 Gipp scored twice in the fourth quarter to beat Army.
3.	In 1920 Gipp-’instigated 20 Irish first downs, threw a pass from behind his own goal to mid-field.
Introducing
By Eddie Huff
Ed Longhi is one of two men ever to hit a baseball out of the park at Yale University; the other was Al Barabas who did it for Columbia against the Eli Blue. Ed pumped his long floater to the consternation of the Yale plebes while he was performing with the Roxbury Prep nine in 1935.
That feat is given considerable cognizance when it becomes known that the New York Yankees have swatted on the New Haven university’s diamond against several Yale pitchers.
Joe Nardone, Notre Dame’s base-
ball captain, tells that story so that Coach Jake Kline will collar Longhi to catch for his varsity in the spring.
Edward John Longhi won a “fan” that day in New Haven, and now the boy who won a number of monograms at Torrington High and at Roxbury Prep, in Connecticut, while competing in six sports, hopes to better his status at Christmas vacation time. Ed has five “framed” reasons hanging from the moulding in Lyons sub — the poses are differently lovely, however.
When Ed kicks off to the Army elen on Saturday afternoon in the Yankee Stadium, he will be facing the service squad for the fourth time. He opposed the plebes once as a prep-school athlete, and he has already met the charge of the cadets twice from the center of the line of the Fighting Irish.
One of Ed’s prep school rivals was “Dick” Tuckey, national professional league back. After the game, Mike Jacobs sought their contracts. Elmer Layden has converted certain and particular tendencies of the French-
CARNEGIE FALLS IN TOUGH BATTLE
•
Outfought and outgained for 50 minutes of the game, Notre Dame’s football team proved her right to the title, “Fighting Irish,” by breaking . through in the last quarter to earn a 7-0 victory over Carnegie Tech.
Undoubtedly the best team Notre Dame has faced this season, Carnegie Tech held the upper hand for more than three periods. So devastating was Tech’s attack that Notre Dame did not have possession of the ball in enemy territory until the closing minutes of the first half.
The first half gave the Notre Dame fans no pleasure, as Carnegie Tech marched up and down the field. Only when they neared the goal line did the Notre Dame forward wall brace, and hold for downs. The only threat of the Irish was when Bob Saggau almost broke away for a touchdown in the final seconds of the half.
The third quarter was all Tech, as the performance of the first two quarters was duplicated. Muha ran the opening kickoff back to the Carnegie 38, and in two plays the ball was advanced to the Irish 48. From there Muha took a reverse from Ingalls and broke away down the west sidelines. He was in the clear until speedy Ben Sheridan overtook him on the 16 yard line. An offside was called on the play though, and Carnegie was penalized five yards. After this penalty Carnegie continued her backward march by losing ten yards on the next play, and then five more for stalling. Carnegie lost possession of the ball when Carnelly kicked to Sheridan.
Early in the fourth quarter Tech pulled the “boner” that eventually led to their defeat. With the ball on her own 47 yard line, and fourth down coming up, Carnegie elected to plunge for a first down. The plunge failed, and Notre Dame took possession of the ball on downs. Play was held up while it was explained to the Tech players that only four plays are allowed to make a first down.
From this point it was all Notre Dame. Peipul crashed through the line for 20 yards and a first down. Sheridan twisted his way to the ten yard line where he fumbled, and O’Brien recovered. Kerr took the . ball on an end-around and scored standing up. Morrison kicked the extra point.
Italian, and Ed today is “Long” and “high” on ability at the Notre Dame pivot spot.
But don’t be fooled; that pronunciation is “Long-ee,” with a “Long” accent.

NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC
SPLINTERS FROM THE PRESS BOX
MICHIGAN AGAIN ON J CAGE SCHEDULE
Well, that was quite an exciting afternoon we had last Saturday. Too bad the Skibos had to leave with sour looks, sour thoughts and sour words. It would be the charitable, but not the natural thing, for them to forget and forgive Referee Getchell’s faulty cerebration in the fourth quarter for the unfortunate, unintentional slip that it was; undoubtedly we ourselves would have been horribly peeved in a similar situation. Nevertheless, that decision did not give Notre Dame the ball game. The Irish were, to be sure, better off than a Tech punt would have left them, but 47 yards is still 47 yards, and any team that can cover all that ground in three plays has something more than luck on its side.
The first three quarters of the game showed what a good team with an aggressive line could do to a better team with a souatting line. The Irish, warned by scouts to be on guard for Carnegie’s long signal-count, concentrated on not being pulled offside, and went to the other extreme. And for three-quarters of the game, the Tartans out-timed the Irish, carrying the fight, hitting first with the Notre Dame linemen still on their haunches. Then the Irish, stalled for so long, got their first “break” and really went to town.
It is interesting to note that Notre Dame’s aerial attack could not be used as a threat to soften up the Tech deefnse against running plays, because the Irish were never in a passing position till the fourth ouar-ter. And then the passes weren’t necessary. In the first half, the Irish' gained possession of the ball seven different times, twice on their own 15, three times between their 20 and 25 yard lines, and only twice beyond their own 30. An intercepted pass— our only heave of the day—spoiled one advance from the 36, and a 15-yard penalty stopped another from the 35. Tech meanwhile had had chances to move from their own 47, their own 44, and Notre Dame’s 19. In the second half the Irish got the ball twice on their 31, punting once, and losing a first down the second time as Ed Simonich fumbled when knocked out by a hard stomach-high tackle. They took the ball on downs once on their own 26, punted, then stopped a fourth down plunge on the Tartan 47, and — you know what. Piepul-Sheridan-Kerr-seven points.
The Scots were a good, strong, rough-and-tough team. On offense their backs ran like a few other we have seen from the Smoky City, but .in making six first downs all day they didn’t exactly tear the Notre Dame line apart. Even Kansas made nine first downs against the Blue and Gold.
On defense the Tartans were about as hard to penetrate as any team that the Irish meet this fall — but still a team that makes seven fumbles would stall its own offense against any kind of an opponent, weak or strong.
SIDELIGHTS
The Tech locker room before—. . . . Signs chalked on trunks, rubber mats, walls, — “Come on, Tartans” . . . “Down the Irish” . . . “Beat the Irish” . . . “Down with Notre Dame” . . . “We Can Do It” . . . “Let’s Go, Carnegie” . . . The team members taking their time taping up, pulling on tight gold pants, looking serious but confident. . . Bill Kern, big, bluff, blond, moving around quietly, smoking a cigarette ... The trainer, when we introduced ourselves, shaking hands slowly, looking us over suspiciously. . . .
—And After: . . . A lot of swishing and slushing in the showers . . . Towels snatched viciously . . . Not a pleasant word to be heard . . . Chalkmarks on ,the walls, mats, and trunks almost obliterated . . . Bill Kern taking short, fast puffs on his cigarette, throwing it down hard . . . Everyone “touchy” . . . Locker doors rattling and banging ... A snapping, steely, smoke-blue atmosphere, tangible as electricity. . . .
They tell us that the motion pictures of last year’s game were run off some 12 or 14 times for the Carnegie boys, as they noted the characteristic actions and reactions of the Notre Dame players, particularly the tackles. It did the Tartans some good, for they worked inside and outside Beinor and Kell and the others most of the afternoon, but it didn’t do them enough good. For once past the tackles, the Skibo runners smacked right into the backers-up, particularly the combination of Simonich and Longhi, and made no long gains all day . . . The Irish, on the other hand, saw the pictures but once, and got most of their information in chalk-talks.
A week or so ago, just before the weather got nippy, we ran across a freshman in Coach Nicholson’s Fall Handicap Meet running the hundred with bare feet. He said he was from Freshman Hall and Saranac Lake, New York, and simply started running that way because his high school didn’t have track shoes big enough to fit him. He had no comment to make except that the Cartier Field cinders weren’t rough enough — “couldn’t get any traction” ... He then walked out on our inquisition, leaving us still highly curious. . . .
The addition of New York University, Michigan and Cornell highlights the 22-game basketball schedule of the proteges of Coach George Keogan. New York University will make its cage debut at Notre Dame on March 12—the finale of : the season. Earlier in the season, the Irish will play N.Y.U. at Madison Square Garden, Athletic Director Elmer F. Layden has announced.
As a major feature of midwestern athletics, Notre Dame renews basketball relations with Michigan,. The baseball, track, golf and tennis teams clashed last year but not for several years have they tangled on the hardwoods.
Twelve of the Irish games will be played at home, beginning on Dec 1 with Kalamazoo College as the attraction. A home game for Dec. 6 has been tentatively set, but no opponent has been announced.
Coach George Keogan lost three-fifths of his 1937-38 squad but is hoping for another team to replace the unit which won 20 out of 23 games last season. Outstanding losses were: Johnny Moir and Paul Nowak, all-Americans at forward and center, Tom Wukovits, guard, and forward and Captain Ray Meyer.
The Schedule includes:
Dec. 1.......Kalamazoo College at Notre Dame Dec. 3.......Ball State at Notre Dame
Dec. 6.................Home game, tentative
Dec. 10................Wisconsin at Madison
Dec. 15..............Michigan	at Notre Dame

SO THEY SAY
“Elmer Layden’s knees are not knocking together tonight. His voice doesn’t shake any more. Carnegie Tech is out of the way. The Irish charged, they fumbled, but they conquered the Tartans, 7 to 0, today to maintain a clean slate in their march toward a national championship.”— The Chicago Times.
“To start from the beginning, after establishing that for three periods it was Tech that had the only scoring chances; it was Tech that did the fiercest tackling, the most savage blocking and the hardest running. In short, it was Tech, Tech, Tech for three quarters.”—The Chicago Herald-Examiner.
“What looked like a sensible Carnegie gamble put Notre Dame in a spot to score. With only a yard to go on 4th down and the ball on their 47-yard line, Carnegie elected to go for the yardage.... Gamble they did —and lost!” — The Chicago Daily News.
“The Tech boys hollered and stamped their feet. They threw down headguards. They were, it seems, very mad. They appealed' to the officials. Their coach, Bill Kern came on the field, and hollered too. After several minutes of this, the officials explained that the ball belonged to Notre Dame, which was what every one else had realized from the start. Every one but Tech, that is.”—The Chicago Herald-Examiner.
Chicago will make history in the automobile racing world on Sunday, Nov. 6, when the world’s first indoor board midget auto-race track will be opened at the 124th Field Artillery Armory. More than $25,000 will.be spent to complete this track, which is being built by Claude J. Girard, well-known builder of bicycle tracks.
GAME BROADCAST
The Army - Notre Dame game will be broadcast from Yankee Stadium over the CBS and NBC networks Saturday afternoon at 12:30 o’clock, C.S.T. Ted Husing will describe the proceedings for Columbia, and Jim Britt, former South Bend announcer now at Buffalo, N. Y., will be at the NBC microphone.
THE SACK OF ROME
(The Chicago Daily Nexvs)
THURSDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1938
(The scholastic needs to make no comment in reprinting the accompanying editorial. Its timeliness and spirit are its ozvn best recommendation.)
The red tongue of cannon licked through the fog that caped the walled circuit of Rome. Through the mist broke howling the imperial army unpaid by the German Emperor Charles V and seeing in pillage their only hope of recompense. At prayer in the Chapel of the Vatican, Clement VII fled along the corridor to the Castle of St. Angelo — that age-old papal fastness from Goth, Norman, German, Roman nobles and the Roman mob. Screened by a tower, the Pope looked down upon a night of horror: Roman soldiers and citizens piked by the German and Spanish mercenaries; the streets choked with the furniture of churches, and the relics and sacred ornaments of the altars.
For six months thereafter Charles held Clement for a ransom of 400,000 ducats and the capitulation of papal revenues and cities — all to finance the Emperor’s interminable wars with France. Thus the Hapsburg, himself a Catholic, continued to enforce an historic spoliation that was, at bottom, not religious, but political; and
thus Clement was added to the prelates who must, through the centuries, surrender to the conqueror lest the lands and cities be wasted, and the people starve and die.
In reality, the long “war of investiture” between the spiritual and the temporal power was a systematic process whereby the German emperors sought to control or seize the tithes and treasures of the Church. New civil laws were made to order or dug up, and opposed to canon law to legalize the greedy alienation of crops, mines and bullion. More often than not, the Castle of St. Angelo withstood the marauders, but John X, Gregory VII, Pascal II, and Gelasius II — to name only a few — suffered outrage and captivity; and today, in Vienna, Theodore Cardinal Innitzer is no less an actual prisoner of German imperialism.
No Castle of St. Angelo the Archbishop had to bar out the mob which sacked his palace. By new “law” and official expropriation the Nazis plan to strip the Austrian Church of its wealth gathered through the ages, and therein they will imitate the exact course once pursued, not, this time; by a German, but by Henry VIII of England. Under the bld common law of the “king’s visitation” that monarch sent a committee to “discover” — or invent — “immorality” among the monks and “oppression” of the people to cloak a capital levy wherewith he later gorged his treasury and'his nobles — remaining orthodox, himself, and setting up the new English merchant class. Upon Hitler I have descended the ambitions of the English Henry VIII and the German Henry IV.
Surely, Cardinal Innitzer must turn the eyes of .the mind backward upon the vistas of. the. past, and know that, although the Castle of St. Angelo has often been taken and looted, the Castle of the Church stands forever, with towers not built by-hands, and ramparts invincible against the dark.

(Editor’s note: The following is a letter received by The Scholastic. The sentiments therein expressed •are in no sense to be construed as editorial opinion of The Scholastic or any member of the staff.) Sirs:
I want to know why you can’t find a good picture for Saturday night in Washington Hall. I’ve been going ’ overe there every week and I haven’t seen one yet—and this isn’t my first year either. The trouble with you is that you don’t consider your audience. Now if you think that we Notre Dame men are going to sit quietly through a picture like one some Saturdays ago—that Stage Door picture—you’re crazy. Do you think we want to see those dames emoting all over the place. Honestly, that’s an insult to our intelligence. It makes me feel embarrassed as the dickens— that’s why I always give that sort of stuff the razzberries. Plenty loud, too. Sure, there’s a few intellectual dopes around here who think that sort of baloney is great stuff. One of them was trying to tell me that last picture had some real drama in it. I told him off plenty quick. He was probably one of those guys who got a lump in his throat when that babe jumped out of the window in the picture. That was one of the funniest scenes in the whole thing—I got a-bang out of that one. You can sure find out a lot about a fellow from the way he reacts to some of these pictures. It really shows him up.
What we want here at Notre Dame is something really worthwhile; something with action or fast gags—something entertaining. We’ve had enough of that dramatic juk. You ought to know how we feel about it by now if you keep your ears open on Saturday nights. It’s just like trying to put classical music over on us. Get that long-haired stuff off the screen. We’re not used to that kind of stuff where we come from, and don’t forget, if you keep on having pictures like that one, we’re going to make just as much racket as we did that Saturday night.

talked quite luridly and seditiously,” said Mr. Fitzgerald. “Later we marched 12 miles to Dingle where I spoke again. That night a warrant was issued for my arrest, and when I heard a pounding on my door I looked out and saw my house surrounded by armed men. They took me into custody and took possession of my house, but I was released shortly afterward and told to stay in Wicklow.”
“I went to Dublin, however,” continued Mr. Fitzgerald, “and asked MacNeil, our leader, for an uprising and some information that I needed. Again I was arrested, on three charges—promoting sedition, discouraging recruiting, and disobedience to orders. I wanted no lawyer at my trial, and made my own plea. In spite of that I was sentenced to six months in jail at hard labor; and I did set a record for work while I was there. Oddly enough I found a bit of humor in that prison—in a jailer who tossed me a copy of Deeds That Won an Empire while I sat in my cell; and in a fellow-inmate who was cutting my hair.

“However, I did serve my sentence and then went to Dublin to demand a quick uprising. During Holy Week a shipment of guns for us was captured by the British and our parade was called off. But this very night I heard shooting in the streets which were blocked by the military, and was made an adjutant under O’Rahilly. We fought, but our wounded were not properly cared for and we were so outnumbered it seemed hopeless.” Mr. Fitzgerald recounted the story of fighting in the Post Office building and then in the Coliseum, whence he and his men escaped across the street during each lull created by the reloading of the British machine-gun. He was taken prisoner, however, and brought to Trinity College. Hsre he told the shell of truth because he was too sleepy to use his wits to lie, and was let off scot free.

This time freedom wasn’t so pleasant for Mr. Fitzgerald, either, “because all my friends shunned me and even my wife wanted me to keep away from the house until the search for the Irish leaders was called off. And it wasn’t long before the British caught me again and a court-martial 4 ordered me shot, although the sentence was commuted to ten years in jail.

BAND MAKES PLANS FOR ARMY TRIP

Tomorrow the band sets forth on that much talked about, and long worked for trip. For to go to New York is the climax of our football band activities. Everything has been planned with this one game in mind. Each of the preceding games has given us more confidence and experience, and now we shall strut before all Gotham.
The New York trip usually produces something new in the line of band goings-on. An innovation of the last band trip was the hat design, oui’ now famous “shamrock chapeau.” It was New York which first acclaimed these hats — perhaps New York will be the impetus for something new again this year.
Stretched out over several coaches (no Pullmans), the boys will do their best to keep things lively on the way to New York. Incidentally, we hope for peace on the way back Sunday night. Freshmen bandmembers are warned, for anything can happen when the fuses are blown out in a coach!
Once in New York, we shall scurry to the Hotel McAlpin, and from there we shall take our police escorted buses to Yankee Stadium. During the half the Notre Dame band will commemorate the 25 th anniversay of this great football classic. The entire half has been turned over to our band —hence the necessity for our many rehearsals this week, starting on Sunday afternoon. When the game is over, the band makes one final appearance, giving a short conceit in the lobby of the Hotel McAlpin. Then away we go to relax and enjoy Gotham.	.
Fitch vs. Wranglers
Frank Fitch, varsity debater and Wrangler member, amidst the shouts of, “It has not reduced the surplus problem so out with it” valiantly upheld the Federal Crop Control Program at last Monday’s regular meet-

NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC
History Club Organized
Rev. Thomas T. McAvoy, C.S.C., professor of history and university archivist, has announced plans for the organization of a history club. Its purpose will be to promote the study of history, especially current events, on the campus. As the number of members must be kept small if the club is to attain any degree of success, Father McAvoy asks applicants to apply to him, presenting a statement of their qualifications in general, and particularly in the field of history.
MANAGERS WORK

When the final whistle sounds curfew for the melee, five weary men hastily re-pack the trunks and ship them to the train, waiting to chugg out immediately. On the last trip, 11 trunks were completely packed in a half-hour, a task requiring plenty of speed and agility.
Then comes the tedious trip home. No water is passed out now, players loll drearily in their berths, and managers sleep the sleep of the weary.
When the train arrives in South Bend amid the wild throngs of students, the team members usually “blow” from the scene, but managers stick to their posts, for their work is not yet completed. Wilson again assumes command of the trunks, carries them back to the gymnasium, and, with the help of fresh underclassmen

These are just a few of the duties of the leading figures in the Managerial system, but because Monday’s sun lifts its head from the horizon, these same managers prepare for another routine day of classes and an afternoon session on Cartier Field. Their work is endless and their credit meager.

DISTRICT F. B. I. CHIEF GRILLS LAWYERS
“We want men in the FBI to whom we can point with pride for their unceasing efforts in law enforcement,” Harold Reinecke, director of the FBI for this district, told the members of the Law club at their first monthly smoker last week.
After an introduction by Edward Boyle, a senior in the College of Law from Duluth, Minn., who acted as chairman, Reinecke described in full detail the qualifications requisite for agents in the internationally famous federal police service.
In an explanation of the routine work of the G-men, he drew much from the notorious Bremer kidnapping case of recent years and illustrated how the service went about tracking down the desperadoes involved. Reinecke emphasized the fact that the G-men considered their work paramount to all their other activities.
At the conclusion of the address Reinecke answered questions from the floor and in response to a question divulged the fact that in all his years in the service he had not fired a shot in actual combat, but it is notorious that he can outshoot any of his aids.
Dean Konop brought the meeting to a close by extending his official greeting to James Kearney, the newest addition to the law faculty, as well as greeting the members at the meeting.

Youll find smokers everywhere keeping Chesterfields 6 with them all day long. They add to your pleasure when you’re on the job and when you take a night off.
It takes good things to make a good product. That’s why we use the best ingredients a cigarette can have— mild ripe tobaccos and pure cigarette paper—to make Chesterfield the cigarette that smokers say is milder and better-tasting.
