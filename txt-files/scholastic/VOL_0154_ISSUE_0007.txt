EDNOTES 
There I was: pen held finnly in hand, eyes glued to my piece of lined paper, detennination written across my sweat-drenched forehead. I was certain victory was within my grasp ­victory in my elementary school handwriting competition, that is. 
Before you laugh, there was a lot up for grabs: not only adolescent prestige but also a mediocre-quality fountain pen in a fake wood box. This was no spelling bee; these were the major leagues. 
As I meticulously crafted every letter of the given sentence with my No. 2 pencil, I fantasized about the euphoria I would feel when my name was announced as the winner. And, possibly, the new toy or video game I would get from my parents. Like I said, big stakes. 
Alas, it was not meant to be, for as I neared the halfway mark of my sentence, I veered off the dotted line. Panic seized me, but I regained composure. Erasing was against the rules, but my eraser was a pristine white. "There's no chance they'll notice an eraser mark," I thought. 
Of course, they found it, and I was awarded second place. The winner, now a longtime friend, took great pride in parading her prize. 
Itwas then I learned the tried-and-true lesson that the best laid plans ofmice and men often go awry. As Forrest Gump says, "It happens." You would think that as editor-in-chief, I would have remembered that lesson. Think again. 
Thank-you's and an Introduction 
Luckily, unlike during my handwriting competition, I have plenty of help with Scholastic. In that spirit, I would like to thank the Scholastic staffers, who work tirelessly into the wee hours ofthe morning to bring you these issues. Thank you to the seniors, who set the example for a fluid production process (looking at you, Erica Pepitone). Although their official run with Scholastic is over, they wrote this issue's cover, called "Sarcastic," an annual humorous take on -well, I won't spoil it, but please note that it's entertainment, not real news. 
I would also like to thank Clara Ritger,Jason G'Sell and Laura Kraegel, who have graciously agreed to work with me on executive staff. (For anyone who knows me, that's no small task.) 
Finally, a special thank-you to the writers, who turned out fantastic articles in a horrifyingly short period of time, and to the designers, who strained their eyes for hours to create the stories' beautiful backdrops. 
As for me, my name is Chris Milazw, a sophomore Program of Liberal Studies and Arabic double major hailing from New Jersey, as seen on MTv: (Yes, I live on the Jersey Shore, but no, I don't know Snooki.) A resident of O'Neill Hall, I have been writing for Scholastic since my freshman year, and I am the editor-in-chief for the 2011-2012 school year. 

Thoughts and Prayers 
The entire Scholastic staff sends its thoughts and prayers to the victims ofthe earthquake and tsunami in Japan, especially those students who are from or have family and friends in the region. 
Don't get fooled tomorrow,

Getting the 
An Essay by Madeline Stone 

The word "summer" usually conjures up images of crashing waves, warm sand and endless hours in the sun. Though those things will still be an important part of my summer, business clothes and office work will now factor in as well. As I wait to hear about internships back home, I'm still getting used to the fact that I am going to have to add work clothes to my summer wardrobe. 
Some of my greatest childhood memories are of those summers when I was free to do whatever I wanted, when I didn't have a care in the world. Growing up on the beaches of southern California, I have always spent the summer laying on the sand, playing in the waves and working on my tan. 
As I enter the final month ofmy sophomore year, I'm realizing that it is time to spend my summer doing something more productive. It's sad, but true. Gone are the days when summer meant long days spent at the pool or summer camp. 
I used to have the greatest summer job ever, teaching swim lessons to little kids at my city pool. Not only was the pay great, but I enjoyed some sun and had a ton of fun with my coworkers. I also got to pretend I was still a kid as well. In no other job could you find . yourself in the pool, with your arms stretched out, hollering, "Now do a cannonball to me!" I spent days on end shamelessly singing songs with such goofy names as "The Noble Duke of York>Jand "TheMore We Swim Together." By the end of each session, my students were able to perform a variety of swimming techniques, most ofwhich had been cleverly renamed with 
4 I SCHOLASTIC I 31 MARCH 2011 
kid-friendly titles such as "starfishes," "ice cream scoops" and "torpedoes." I would give almost anything to go back to the pool, but all of the career fairs and talk ofinternships have brought me to the sad conclusion that it's time for me to get a real summer job. 
College students face enormous pressure to get internships in their future line ofwork. We are constantly told that we need internships so that we can have a competitive edge over everyone else. We need experience in order to get jobs, but this is what I've always wondered: How am I supposed to get experience in a field if employers are only hiring people with prior experience? It's a never-ending cycle of stress, and it brings out an ugly, competitive side of people. 
I tackled the scary world of Summer internships over spring break when I spent some time applying and interviewing for positions back home. I have to admit that I was a little intimidated by the whole process at first, but I realized that everyone has to start somewhere. As I toured a future employer's office, I was excited as I imagined myself working there. I still don't know. if I have the job, but I've decided that getting an internship doesn't have to be the end of summer as I've ,known it)l"ci>uld get that valu_able experience and still have time to do all of the other things I want to do with my summer. 
Maybe I should take this as a sign that I am finally growing up, as corny as that sounds. I am finally entering that pei;iod ofmy life when I must take on real, adult responsibilities. It is time for me to figure out what exactly I want to do with my life. I may have to give up some things along the way, but all good things come at a price. 
And really there are a lot of great things about internships. You finally get to apply all those complex tl1ings you learn about in class to real-life situations. 
That first-hand experience'xnight cause you to change your career path completely. Who knows -you might get a job at a law firm and find out that you really hate law, or you might volunteer at a hospital and rea]ize that you can't stand the sight ofblood. · 
But an internship can be extremely rewarding and reinforce why you were interested in a field in the first place. And when it comes down to getting a job after graduation, I'm sure I'll be glad that the Career Center told me to get an internship over the summer. 
One thing ~as become clear to me as I wait to hear about internships back home. Whether or not I get the job lwant, I'm going to make sure that I still enjoy my summer. As I finalize my plans, I'm leaving plenty of time to just relax on the beach -I guess I'm not ready to give up on the dream of a·worry-free summer just yet. 0

How to Conquer April Fool's Day 
/acqueline Patz
Although it may seem like a less-than-legitimate holiday, the origins of April Fool's Day date all the way back to Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales" (thank you, Wikipedia), in which the day 
was first referenced. It is a day during which good-natured pranks are acceptable, and childish behavior is . encouraged. (Whoopee cushions, anyone?) The holiday may be ridiculous, but no one wants to appear ridiculous themselves. With the help of Scholastic, you can survive April 1 with your dignity relatively intact. Who knows, maybe you can even ._(.i"llli, make a fool of everyone else! 
! J Exercise skepticism If someone makes a statement that seems : 1 questionable, appear to neither accept nor reject its veracity. This way, you will avoid looking gullible. Simply gaze uncertainly into the distance, look quickly back at your friend, shake your head and say, "Sorry, I was zoning out," then smoothly change the subject. This will ensure that you are in no way responsible for any information you've just "heard." ,:~ Treat doors as dangerous objects Whether or notyou know much 
d}) about pranks, it's obvious that doors create sketchy situations. From :('·=1 water perched above the door to an apparently jammed handle, doors provide a wealth ofpotential opportunities for trickery. Open them slowly or, whenever possible, kindly step aside to allow another to enter first. ·Keep it plausible Assuming you'd like to make fools out ofyour friends "ct:qt with an amusing tall tale, stick to realistic stories. "The Lions 
:~~ are favored to win the NFC Championship next season" is not :f:S!/ as believable as "Brett Favre has come out of retirement again, · announcing he will pay whichever NFL team will take him to come back another year." 
/;,;11 Avoid special announcements If at all possible, do not receiveti~W1 any good news on April 1, because when you try to share it with 
till anyone, you will be met with doubt, laughter or annoyance. Save your news for the April 2, and save yourself a headache. [Jff:: Skip it alt?gether When in ?oubt, cop o~t. April Fo~l's is basically tt:dJ)) a fake h?hday, so you could JUSt pretend 1t does~'t exist. Refuse to 
engage m any tomfoolery, and you should make 1t through the day unscathed. You'll just be ... boring. Maybe you could use the day off to plan a big prank for next year, like when Taco Bell claimed they bought the Liberty Bell and renamed it the Taco Liberty Bell -and people believed them. (Yeah, that happened. God bless America!)

Popular Coffee Shop Will Not Reopen 
Bethany Freeburg
Despite efforts to find a new location after the cafe's lease was terminated in the fall, well-known coffee shop and Notre Dame student hot spot Lula's Cafe will not be reopening in the near future. Located east of campus on the corner of Edison Rd. and Rt. 23, the coffee and sandwich shop was host to poetry readings, book clubs and musical performances during its 16 years in business. Lula's owner Steve Egan received notice in October 2010 that Lula's lease would not be renewed. Given until Nov. 30 to vacate the building, Egan searched for a new location, considering over 40 different local sites. When he was unable to find a suitable building, Egan closed the coffee shop late last year with the intention of reopening it when he found a fitting location. Egan, a 1993 Notre Dame graduate, says Lula's was a community meeting place that drew individuals and groups from Notre Dame and Michiana. "Many have referred to Lula's as the community living room, a comfortable, eclectic environment where you feel at home and part of the family," Egan says. "Lula's attracted so many interesting people. We've always encouraged and supported intellectual discourse and cultural events and have been proud to bridge both the ca1~pus and Michiana communities in many ways." Part coffee house, part art venue, part meeting place, Lula's offere_d coffee and chai and a lunch menu of salads, sandwiches and wraps. Patrons could play board games in the corners, study on the couches or view the work of local artists. Senior English major Rachel Roseberry discovered Lula's her freshman year and regularly visited the cafe with friends and to study until it closed its doors in November. "Not only was the food and coffee great -I truly miss the toasted brie -but the location provided a welcome and convenient break from campus," Roseberry says. "Since December, I've found myself wishing countless times a week that they were still open, and, honestly, I can't believe that I'm going to end my time at Notre Dame without Lula's." Since Egan accepted a position with Anthony Travel in March, the search for a new Lula's location is on hold. Egan says on Lula's website, however, that he is open to purchase, partnership or other agreements that may allow the coffee shop to reopen. "I am very hopeful that there will be a soft landing for the cafe," he says. A different coffee shop is tentatively scheduled to open in the space formerly occupied by Lula's later this spring. 0

"Be Bold." "Hip Hop Night." "Songs You Know by Heart.'' These are just a few of the campaigns created by the talented Legends of Notre Dame student marketing team. Supervised by Legends · Program Coordinator Chris Hinsberg, a Notre Dame alumnus wl;io · worked at Legends as a student, the team is charged with generating ·.. buzz for the club's events. 
The twelve-student team is divided into three teams of three with three auxiliary positions: a webmaster, a photographer. a11d a press. writer. Each of the smaller teams consists of two ·marketing assistants •. and one graphic designer. "This is a very dynamic team who works < extremely hard week after week to advertise.sev~n. unique eve11ts each weekend here at Legends," Legends' general manager Aaron· ' Perri says. "Their campaigns include posters, handbills, magazines/ newspapers, e-newsletters, Face book, Twitter, a website,contests a11d a whole host of other creative initiatives to ensure our messages get• out each week." . . ·.· y . · 
During dinner at South Dining Hall on March 3, stud.entscould have seen two Legends marketing team members Ill a~tion as they. publicized their then-upcoming Super Mash Bros concert>They handed out edible gummy versions of the Mario Brqthers franch.ise . characters and offered VIP passes for cut-the-line adrriittanceto Hip · Hop Night. Sophomore English major Catherine Flatley.Was one of the marketing assistants on hand that night. After applyingfor the job in August, she began working for the marketing team during fall · semester. 
When it comes time to plan their week of adverti~ing, Flatley and her partner, junior Eugene Staples, a marketing and Film, Televisi6n and Theatre major, sit down and discuss promotional tactics for the events they believe can be successful. "We automatically knowwhich ones we are most excited about," Flatley says, "and we.pick two to focus on." 
This year Flatley has been involved in marketing a numberof events in creative ways. For the Bl Block Party in the fall, she dressed up as a bee. At another event, Flatley and Staples created a "kissing booth" that gave out Hershey kisses. In addition to promoting the events, Flatley works during events, including concerts.

DEPARTMENT OF CREEPING 
From debates about which dining hall is superior to angry rants about people who whip around corners or take too long to scoop individual green beans onto their plates, the fount of dining hall discussions never seems to run dry. Yet there remains one dining hall activity that is rarely discussed: people watching. · 
Dining hall people watching is different from other types of people watching because the probability of inadvertently creeping on someone you know is alarmingly high. In its purest form, people watching is not the activity of stalkers or frightening individuals. Rather, people watching is a harmless activity resulting from mildly invasive curiosity, aka boredom. 
People watching requires both the tendency to zone out frequently, whether or not someone is talking directly to you, as well as the ability to concentrate intensely for a very short period of time on a particular person. A true people watcher will be ~aptivated by the seconds-long sighting of one person, yet cease to care about that individual the moment a new person appears. The instant you start to zone in on only one person, following his or hei: every move, you become creepy. Stop immediately. 
Over break, I was able to watch many non-ND students, but I have come to the conclusion that people watching is an entirely unique experience here. Domers are a peculiar breed, and their interactions reach the peak ofawkwardness in the dining hall. 
As such, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow Domers for their conduct in the dining halls. You have granted me much mindless entertainment as I peer down from my lofty perch in the swanky dining establishment that is North Dining Hall. 
As a side note, whatever your dining hall preference, North is infinitely superior for people watching. It has varying levels of perspective as opposed to one level plane ofdiners at South. Also, you get to watch people actually fixing their meals and walking into each other, which is so much better than watching couples same-siding it. Who wants to see that? 
I would also like to thank you, awkward opposite-sex interactions. You have provided me with many a dining hall chuckle. That is not to say that awkward opposite-sex interactions do not pervade many other (or all) instances of the ND experience. (For further details, please consult any published work written about Notre Dame, ever.) I am simply observing that it is exponentially more awkward (and entertaining for my fellow people watchers) to run into any sort of ex in the dining hall holding a tray than while walking to class. At least in the latter situation, you can pretend to be texting someone and avoid eye contact. 
Thank you, anyone who engages in dining hall shenanigans, including the rock paper scissors tray stacking game or attempts to build massive cup towers. Your creativity is infinitely refreshing and you provide hope for onlookers that you will build a plastic cup structure to the ceiling one day; Keep your aspirations high, and maybe one day you'll defy gravity-or at least your cups will. 
Thank you, diners with obnoxiously loud, absurd laughs. While 
161. SCHOLASTIC I 31 MARCH 2011 
this may annoy my fellow diners, I typically seek out the source of any raucous cackles to catch a glimpse .at what sort of creature is capable of making such a noise. It's an impressive feat -give her credit! (It's always a girl.) 
Finally, thank you, angry diners who scramble through the dining hall, shooting gamma rays out of your eyes to warn fellow students not to cross your path. You're on a mission to get your food as quickly as humanly possible, and so help you God, you're going to intimidate people with your huffy noises of frustration until they let you through. What's impressive about you is not that you're in a hurry -everyone's in a hurry -but just how worked up you are about toasting your bagel efficiently. This is food time -you should be happy! 
And yet you've all made me very happy with your performances. Domer diners, thank you for providing me with mealtime entertainment. I invite you to join me in my practice of people­watching. So ifever you're in need ofa break, put down your Scholastic or glance over the shouider of your dining hall dinner date and glean harmless amusement from the antics of those around you. 0

BRO COUTURE 
As the sun breaks through the permacloud, there's no better time to evaluate your wardrobe and make sure it's ready for spring. In this issue of Scholastic, we preview the fashions that are sure to be making an appearance on a quad near you. 
Chris Milazzo 
Topsiders 
There might not be a great deal of water around campus, but that doesn't stop students from sporting these seaworthy favorites on their landlubber legs. Available in a myriad of matte and shiny leather finishes, these country club staples are truly all purpose. On a relaxing spring day, they're perfect for tossing around a frisbee with your "bros." And if you're in need of some quality dress shoes for that big interview, don't run to your local high-end shoe store-just slip into your Sperrys! Worn with a clean pair ofslacks and blue blazer, your Topsiders will give any Italian leather dress shoes a run for their money. (Added bonus: If you do land that big job, you can wear them to your boss' private marina.) 

Pastel Shorts 
No day on the quad would be complete without some Easter egg-inspired 
shorts. These springtime essentials complement almost any style of top: dress shirt, T-shirt and "LAX" pinnie. (See No. 4.) And don't think these fashion statements are just for "dudes." Ladies can be seen sporting these shorts ~ albeit in much smaller sizes -all around campus. · 

"Bro Shades" 
Speaking of unisex clothing, the "Bro Shades" are a "must have" for spring. Cheap, easily replaceable and perfect for that post-parietals stroll to Reckers, these oversized sunglasses can also be used to support an entrepreneurial venture. Simply buy some custom shades with your business' name on the side, create a Facebook event and you have an easy way to show.your parents you're doing something productive at school. Demand is sure to outstrip supply ofthese springtime favorites, and don't be surprised when they make a returri)n the fall for football season. 

The "LAX" Pinnie 
Once relegated to the athletic wear section ofyour local sporting goods store, the "LAX," or lacrosse, pinnie has taken campus by storm after the ever-popular "Party Like a Champion Today" version made its debut in the fall semester. Easily the most comfortable article of spring wear, you can see the "LAX" pinnie on the quad, at parties and throughout your dorm. Along with rejected team names, this new addition to the springtime collection is sure to be a favorite at Bookstore Basketball. 
How To DRESS BRO LIKE A PRO: 


The "Sorry for Partying" T-shirt 
Although it can be seen year round, the "Sorry for Partying" T-shirt's light design makes it less-than-ideal for chilly South Bend winters. Now that the weather is warming and Pigtostal is approaching, you will see them in full force. Our generation's version ofthe Jim Belushi "College" sweater, you can spot these now-iconic tees at many an off campus party. (Scholastic reminds you, however, that a t-shirt will not be accepted as an excuse for bad behavior by the local authorities. Wear at your own risk.)

Irish Eyes On: 


KEVIN DUGAN 
Catie Mohamed
11e director of Men's Lacrosse Operations, 2001 Notre Dame graduate n finance and former men's lacrosse team member, Kevin Dugan has many accomplishments to be proud of. He was a member of the 2001 Fighting Irish semifinalist lacrosse team, influential in leading the 201 O Irish lacrosse squad to the 2010 NCAA championship, and he has started a successful charity that supports community-based organizations in rural Uganda. His organization, Fields of Growth International, organizes athletics­infused service trips for college students. Dugan has spearheaded the launch of the Uganda Lacrosse Association and is working with community leaders at the grassroots level to support education, outreach to HIV-positive children and social entrepreneurism for women's groups. This year, Dugan helped organize the Stand with Sudan Peace Rally and the Playing for Peace basketball tournament. 
Howdoes itfeel to be backatNotre Dame after coaching atUniversity ofScranton, Yale and Gordon College? For most people involved in athletics, working at their~ mater is a really special experience, so yes, it is a really special feeling to work for Notre Dame. For me, it is about the mission and ideals this place represents. It enables me to do my job with real passion and spirit. Graduating from Notre Dame, working for Notre Dame, being associated with Notre Dame -all those things are a great honor, but with that comes a great responsibility: [the] moral obligation to make your life count for something more than yourself. 
What goals do you have for the 2011 Irish Men's Lacrosse Team? We have one goal every day and that is to realize our full potential in the next practice. Coach [Kevin] Corrigan has an obsessive focus on the next practice. He doesn't talk about winning a championship, but he does talk about the process of being a champion, and that happens one great practice at a time. Coach Corrigan definitely has a John Wooden-like philosophy when it comes to goals for the program. The ultimate goal in striving for success is to have the peace ofmind of!mowing we did our best to become the best we were capable ofbecoming. 
Whatmade you so passionate about Sudan, and how did you come up with the ideas to raise awareness here atNotre Dame? There are so many things about Sudan that interest me. It is a melting pot of today's most important social, political, economic, ethnic, religious and environmental issues. The expiration of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in Sudan this January was a ticking time bomb that demanded the attention ofthe international community. When I was hired, one ofthe first things Coach Corrigan asked me to do was find a way to get our team more involved with the campus community, and we came up with the idea for this event that involved the collaboration of students, faculty, staff and offices across the campus. 
What is your &vorite part about Fields ofGrowth, and what has the organization done for you? By far it is the relationships I've developed -I like to call FOG a growing 
__<ii the country. Seeing Jake Brems from our team here at Notre Dame help jump-start an AIDS widow's poultry business; or Ryan Flanagan, one of the top college lacrosse players in the country, raise over $20,000 to help build a school; or Kerry Hamill, [a] former women's Oacrosse player] from Yale giving hope to marginalized school girls in a rural village -all those experiences have been incredibly fulfilling things that I never imagined I'd be involved in when I was in New York. Seeing these trips transform the worldview of bright, talented students as they figure out what they want to do with their life has been really special. More than anything I've learned from experiences of solidarity that you can buy pleasure, but you can't buy happiness; that I need Africa more than Africa needs me; and that, at the end ofyour life, everything comes down to relationships. 
This summer, you took former Notre Dame football player Oscar 
McBride with you to Uganda. What was that experience like? 
Itwas a really powerful experience for Oscar-to accompanyhim on that trip was really special. I lmow that it was a specifically special and soulful journey for him, being ~ African American on his first trip to Africa. It was really special listening to Oscar explain to the kids in the village what "Play Like A Champion Today'' means. Oscar would tell kids the story about how Lqu Holtz would explain to tlie football team that "Play Like A Champion Today" means you need to make the most ofthe gifts God has given you, be someone that cares about their friends, be someone that is committed to excellence and be someone that can be trusted. Those are all natural law principles ofsuccess that are just as relevant to kids in rural Uganda that want to emerge from poverty as they are to winning football games. 
How do you influence student athl~_tes with the lessons you've learned 
through your service work? · ' · There is a really good book called "LetYour Life Speak." It is about listening for the voice ofvocation. That's the best thing any of us can do to influence people: Let our lives speak for themselves.

otre Dame men's head basketball coach Mike Brey finds himself 'in an arguably strange position following his.'team's 71-57 loss to Florida State in the second round of the 2011 NCAA tournament. His team overachieved this season by almost all accounts -many analysts picked the Irish to be in the middle of the Big East standings. This is not the first time Brey's squad has performed better than expected, but his teams have always failed to make it out of the early rounds of the tournament. In 2003, Notre Dame advanced to its only Sweet Sixteen appearance in Brey's 11 years as coach with a 68-60 victory over Illinois, the Big Ten Tournament champions that year. It was the Irish's first Sweet Sixteen appearance since 1987. Notre Dame shot a school-tournament record 13 three­pointers. Guards Dan Miller and Chris Thomas, who scored 23 and 17 points respectively, led the team to victory. Ncifre Dame ·raced to a 47-34 lead in "the first half before Illinois began a second-half resurgence. Miller hit five straight three-pointers to start the game, and Notre Dame started off 6-11 on three's as a team. Illinois cut the lead to six with just

e Irish women's rugby team has shown 
reat promise in its inaugural year: 
The women are finishing off a historic first season with a trip to the National Championship playoffs. Their early success is even more impressive considering that most of the team had never played the game before this season. 
"It was definitely a hodgepodge at first, but we had a steep learning curve because the best way to learn rugby is to play it," senior Kayla Bishop says. 
The Irish started practicing last spring but did not start competing as an official club until this fall. Junior Christina Konkey, who is now the club's vice-president, approached the Student Activities Office (SAO) during her freshman year and proposed the idea of starting the club. Once she and current president senior Erin Connor received approval from SAO, they began recruiting girls to join the team. Konkey says she targeted those involved in contact sports like styles. Unlike football players, however, rugby players do not wear pads or helmets. The Irish say that this may seem painful, but it really helps them to improve their overall game. 
"You learn how to tackle cleanly and safely so that you're not hurting yourself and you're not hurting other people. There's a lot more control in it," junior Margot DeBot says. 
Many of the team members were also attracted to the diversity of positions played in rugby: There is one for almost every kind of 
build. 
practice harder and find their rhythm. 
"It was a matter of thinking, 'OKnow we've done it, we know what it's like, so let's [prepare] in the way that we're going to play,'" sophomore Priscilla Nyankson says. 
The Irish won their next two games by wide margins, including an 84-0 win over Northwestern University. They finished the fall season with a 6-0 record in their league, the Chicago Area Rugby Football Union. At the Division II Midwestern Championship playoffs, the team finished No. 2 after a loss to the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. 
They are now preparing for Notre Dame's first appearance in the National Championship playoffs. The team has practiced throughout the winter and is now able to train three times a week outside. Scheduling practice times has been difficult because, as a club sport, the team has to share practice slots with Ultimate Frisbee and women's field hockey. The coaches encourage the team to take individual responsibility for their conditioning since they do not always have the field for practice.

flag football and Baraka Bouts. Nyankson was one of the initial recruits and was approached by Konkeywhile playing football with friends. 
"She told me that you could tackle in rugby, and that's basically all I needed," Nyankson says. 
Though the rough nature of rugby drew many.of the women to the sport, it was daunting for others. Their spring practices focused mainly on skills and no-contact, scrimmages. Once the team moved outside and started full-contact practices, the number of players dwindled. 
"The contact scares a lot of people," Bishop says. 
Still, the players insist that there is more to the game than tackling. Konkey says it is a "surprisingly intellectual sport." 
"It's a true coupling of mind and body. It's fast-paced decision-making, but you also have to have that balanced with physical strength and endurance." 
Rugby is often compared to football because both sports combine strategy and rough playing this season, as it was often forced to play a man down. Nyankson 
· say they never let injuries or their lack of substitutes.affect their playing. "It inspires Irie so much, because you'll have somebody [who] hurt their ankle on the 
· field, and they'll get up and play the entire · game and score. If they can do that, well, I'm healthy, I can do a lot more," Nyankson says. 
The team has become very close over the course of their first season. The players constantly encourage each other to work harder with the ultimate goal of winning when they travel to San Diego for the National Championships in April. Nyankson says the tenacity of her teammates is what keeps her motivated wh!;!n things get tough. 
"I'm doing it not just for myself but for my teammates, because they don't quit. Because they don't quit, I won't quit," Nyankson says. 
The Irish play April 9 at McGlinn Fields in a friendly match that will help them prepare for the playoffs. Konkey says women interested in joiny1g the team next season can email her at ckonkey@nd.edu.

HUMOR 

Well hello, my delightfully decadent and debauched Domers, and may I welcome you back from spring break! I'm sure you used your time to embark upon journeys of deep spiritual reflection, intellectual discovery and charitable work that would make Mother Theresa proud. But I digress. 
While recently traversing our hallowed grounds, I couldn't help but notice certain sultry changes. The piles of snow have melted to reveal a blossoming garden of discarded Natty Lite cans, while mangy squirrels limp behind the dining halls on the hunt for unsuspecting students and the female population boldly tests the limits of human endurance by discarding their sweats and Uggs, baring their legs and donning skirts. ("No, I'm not cold. It's 40 degrees out -that's practically tropical.") Yes, my pretties, spring and all its glories doth cometl1 to the Bend. 
And as warmer weather stretches out its tender caress, coyly inching its way toward our frigid land, a certain, shall we say, friskiness enters the hearts of Domers. And so I, your faithful watchdog of student hilarity, your prince of the paranormal, your "Lord of the Rings," have endeavored to search out the stories of students who, tl1rough their faithful Dionysian worship, have offered themselves· up as_ sacrifices upon the Gipp's Altar of Ridicule. Lady Gaga may tell us that God makes no mistakes, but these kids sure did. So buckle up for the ride, my precious, and let's hit the road. 
Our story begins during midterm week: It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Now, one merry band of revelers decided to expunge those ghosts of midterms past with the help of]. Daniels & Co. Things were going swimmingly until one sozzled sweetheart -drunken Domer, I dub thee "Deb" -began to feel -dare I borrow from that baddest of beasts, Winnie the Pooh -a rumbly in her tumbly. Thus, Deb spent the next few hours praying to the porcelain god. 
The host of this shindig decided in a show of chivalry to escort Deb to her dorm. It was not until the duo was on their merry way, though, that Chuck the Chivalrous discovered he'd forgotten his key. Chuck assured his drunken damsel he would return with the speed of a cheetah and left. While Deb was outside becoming acquainted with the liquidy contents of her stomach, a troupe of the most intelligent, beautiful and perfectly-happy-with-their­choice-of-college-thank-you-very-much Belles came waltzing up to our heroine, bearing horrific news: "The Boys in Blue are on their way! Run away, run away!" They rushed hither and thither, desperate to elude South Bend's finest -who were, of course, nowhere near. 
At this point Chuck returns and, lo and behold, Deb has vanished! Chuck rallies the team and calls out the bloodhounds, but Deb has disapparated more effectively than H. Potter himself. NDSP is called in as a last resort, )Jut then -miracle of miracles! Deb is located tucked snug as a drunken bug in a rug, snoring peacefully in her bed. How those brilliant Belles managed to deposit Deb (sans keys and ID) into the correct dorm, room and bed is a mystery yet to be solved. 
I shall now interrupt this program to bring you the latest news regarding that holiday which we hold dear to our hearts: St. Patty's Day! While the unerring wisdom of our elders led them to schedule spring break for that most blessed of days, you wily students found your way around those barriers. Thus I shall recount just one ofyour many glorious exploits. 
Wednesday found one fine professor puzzled as to the general green hue of the students' garb in her classroom. Upon questioning said leprechaun wannabes, the poor prof received nothing but a snicker and a wink. She might have continued on in blissful ignorance were it not for an interruption provided by a trio of drunken damsels. Apparently these Guinnessed girls were under the impression that they were the benevolent emissaries of St. Patrick's day bliss and had come to share their Irish love. The prof, needless to say, was not amused -especially when they outed their equally inebriated friends tucked away in the back of the classroom. After a futile attempt to join in the class discussion, the less-than-classy ladies were booted from the room. The prof's innocence now shattered (no, Virginia, there is not a Santa Claus), life resumed again. Whispers of a spectacular drunken faceplant outside ofNorth Dining Hall have reached my ears, and the Gipp wonders if one of these Three Musketeers was involved. 
And so, my most excellent Domers, I shall leave you -parting is such sweet sorrow, etc. Keep up your dashing devilry, and always remember: Friday may be fun, fun, fun, but Sunday comes afterwards. 
Love, 
The Gipper

How did you become interested in Cuban drama? 

I am interested in how playwrights say what they want to say without getting themselves in trouble. Most of what I look at are plays from Cuba since the fall of the Soviet Union, when, economically, the conditions in Cuba became exceedingly difficult. I am curious about how artists create art when it's incredibly difficult to do so financially. I found that, because I had some background in Spanish, I could read Cuban plays in the original Spanish, and they were electrifying. In 2003, I was able to go to Cuba for the first time. Once I was there, seeing the International Theater Festival in Havana and the level of the work that was being presented, I was completely blown away -not only by Cuban productions, but by productions from all over Latin America and even other places like South Korea. There was a wonderful production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" in the Korean language in Cuba that was fully understandable to everyone in the audience. It\those kind ofproductions that wowed me and kept me coming back to Cuba. 
Some Americans are unfamiliar with Cuban art and theate1: What might they be sttrprised to learn? 
The artists I've met in Cuba in every regard -whether they're musicians, actors, directors, designers or painters -are highly trained, not just highly skilled. One ofmy friends who is a painter in Cuba took me to the art museum and he knew every single piece there. He didn't just know the year, artist and title, he knew the piece's materials, the techniques, where it fit into the artist's trajectory, the critical effect it had when it was produced and how it related to the work of other artists. And he knew all of that information for every piece in the entire museum. It astounded me. His training was so thorough that he understood the entire history of art in his country in a way that I think our artists do not. 
What is the connection between drama and politics? 

Drama is political. Bodies are political, and that's what you see on stage. Where the playwright intercedes is creating characters that live within that politic, or it could be about the playwright himself or herself. Sometimes just being a playwright is a political act. Ifyou're an African American woman in a certain context, being a playwright and making the choice to write is a political act. Drama and politics are tightly intertwined, and I think that trying to remove a play from its political context is treacherous. You lose a lot ofwhat is intended.

Laura Kraegel 
Assistant Film, Television and Theatre Professor Yael Prizant teaches courses in dramatic literature, script analysis and dramaturgy and researches Cuban and Cuban-American drama. Her hook "Theaters ofRevolution: Staging Cuban Identities after the Cold War" will he published in 2012. She plans to hike through Cuba when she visits the country on leave next fall. 
How do you work withplaywrights to develop their ideas? 
My best experience, probably, was with the playwright Garry Michael White. He wrote a play called "Arlington," which has five different vignettes about responses to war in the U.S. There were scenes from World War I to modern warfare. The play changed a lot as we worked on it. It was originally done chronologically, but it ended up in reverse after I had asked him questions like "What is the final image you want to leave the audience with?" So I read scripts and give feedback to the playwright about what elements are working structurally and what is unclear. I see my role as a dramaturg as a bridge between the page and the stage, between the audience and the production. My job is to ask questions and get the playwright thinking. 
I hear you're in a band ... 
Yes, my students are so enamored with that right now. Yes, I sing in a band. Part of what we're struggling with is how to name it. It's only a handful of months old and at the moment, we're mostly doing our own take on other people's music and covering songs. We're not writing original music just yet, but that's coming. We rehearse at LangLab South Bend, a 33,000 square foot warehouse space that has been converted into an artistic venture. Some of my students have gone to play rea<iings there. It has yoga classes. There was a hip hop group there last Sunday. A.roller derby group is having its anniversary party there soon. It's a very creative, open space where anyone in the community can propose something artistic. I'm the theater liaison on the Board, and I think it's a pretty fantastic addition to the artistic community in South Bend. 
What plans do you havefar the future?· 
I have a huge interest in nature and hiking, which there isn't a lot of here. But coming from California, that was just built into daily life, so I have plans to do a bigger nature endeavor when I'm on leave next year. I leave for Cuba in the fall,. and I may hike across part of the country. We'll see. I'll be there for the International Theater Festival in Havana and to work with the playwright Abel Gonzalez Melo on an anthology ofhis plays. Most importantly, I'll be there to just experience the state of Cuba, because it changes so rapidly. I was there in 2009, but I guarantee it has a different feel now. · @
