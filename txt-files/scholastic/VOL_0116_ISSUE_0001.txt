Often their motives are the highest, yet .perhaps not often enough. . . : .. 
I take note of these contemporary student proclivities · this morning, however, not to unfold _these mis­givings, but rather to . recognize a challenge to us as educators ·of so many men and women whose desire it is to become members .. of .the learned . professions. . 
Which are the learned professions we speak : of?. The three most an­cient are well known'from the three departments of the early universi­ties: Divinity, Law and Physick.

To begin with;-. each.•of .the professions is 'dedicated .. directly, to the enduring needs of the human· person .. Still more' specifically,: each 
is particularly needed, to:'iintefvene 
· THE SCHOLASTIC 

at the critical points in life: ,the 
physician, at the failing moments 
of the body's health; · the scholar­
teacher, in the growing season of 
the mind's 1maturing; the advocate, 
when men are in conflict within so­
ciety; the priest, at people's turning 
points before God. 
There • is also a peculiar way in which training and intelligence have to combine in professional activity. It is never enough.that one be bril­liant. There is a body of knowledge to be instructed in, a . tradition, to be.mastered by-priest, lawyer, _doc­tor or academic. The young aspirant has to be initiated· by,, his or her elders, to become "learned," to come to know ··the constant truths im­bedded in different. experiences.· And yet; when'·.one comes to practice on one's. own; it is not simply knowl­edge that people require, but a cer­tain sagacious sense of how to apply learning. to the problem, at hand. Discretion, wit and sober sense are what make the tradition live in any­one's grasp. .The professional per~ son . is in. this curious sense both companion and virtuoso. Profes­sional tr~ining involves a period of apprenticeship when , the future practitioner works under critical supervision and direction. Yet on the day one gains . fuH professional status, one succeeds to the responsi­bility and autonomy of one's most senior colleague; 
Itis said that a professional person is 'never quite an employee. His pay is a fee, rather than a salary. Of course he is appointed, and has tasks and often.· working conditions · set either by those who hire him or by his peers acting collectively. In the actual performance of duties, how­ever, in: the very moment when he renders · his· professional judgment, he assumes a radical· independence, he has no master. His service•is pre­cisely one · of judgment and discre­tion;· It is unsupervised because un­supervisable. Let a person exercise significant responsibility in banking or journalism, government or. manu­facturing-he will never be clothed with quite the same freedom which the professional enjoys. Nor·will he have quite the same lonely burdens. Engage the services of a professional and you will hear what it pleases him to say. It is you who are served, but he who determines the. service. You may terminate his services; 
you may not dominate them. If 
. through craven or corrupt or con­fused performance he should tell you, not what he.judges to be true but what you.wish to hear, then you will be ill-served, however satisfied. If conscientious, a priest, attorney, physician or teacher will not hesi­tate even to rebuke the very ones who engage his or her services. 
The· point we might draw from this is that at. critical juncturesin a person's life,· at sometimes un­repeatable . moments • when . one's future and character and safety lie exposed to great jeopardy, one is in the hands of a professional• per­son. The very lives of people:-phys­ical, -, mental, social and spiritual­are at stake. Even more significant: ly, if the professional servant be not capable or conscientious, not only can clients suffer unrecover­able· loss: they may never know they have• been ill-served. It is in the nature of the work of doctor, lawyer, teacher and priest that nei­ther patient nor client nor student nor believer need .discover that he deserved better than he got. 
Mischief lies close at hand to any career our. students may choose. to pursue. Dishonesty in business and incompetence in government service occur often enough to persuade some young women and men pos­sessed . of stern ideals and generous energies that they would be awk­ward walkers along either of these ways of life. Nevertheless there is in these careers at least the likeli­hood of outside voices calling for justice. ·. The customer generally knows when . he or she has been cheated; the citizen, when he or she has been ignored. Both have their remedies. But in the activities of the _learned professions, standards of right conduct can be discerned, protected or imposed competently only by those who stand within; An angered public may on occasion 

SEPTEMBER 9, 1974' 
strike out in censure at one or an­other profession, but the only deft ·and effective discipline is what comes from the guildsmen them­selves. 
How often does this self-discipline exist in the professions? With· mis­erable rarity. Doctors known to be habitually incompetent are protected 

, by their fellow-physicians rather than exposed, in the absence of a public scandal. Chronically ill-tem­pered or useless clergymen are transferred, not unfrocked. Teach­ers generally know which of their colleagues are incapable, yet con­sider them a ·burden to be borne ·rather than laid aside-borne by others, that is. Lawyers are rarely disbarred unless convicted of a fel­ony. The record of collective con­science being exercised to maintain ethical standards in the learned pro­fessions is less than impressive. In­deed, to outsiders it often appears that the professions prefer to cloak misbehavior and incompetence in their midst rather than to purge themselves. What an American Bar Association committee reported in 1970 can apply to the other profes­sions as well: . "With few excep­tions, the prevailing attitude (?f lawyers toward disciplinary en­forcement ranges from apathy to outright hostility." My point this morning is not that ethical performance within the . learned professions is any less hon­orable than in other walks of life. In two regards, though, to work there is more parlous. There is more at stake, since the welfare of human persons is directly in one's charge at times of crucial importance in their lives. And there is little moral surveillance or admonition. to be expected from laymen or from pro­fessional comrades, as a stay against those cheaper and more exploitative tendencies we all commonly bring to our work. 
Our students, then, many of whom will hold in trust the bodies and· souls, the personal destinies of their fellow humans, have a special edu­cational need that constitutes a claim upon us. They mus_t leave this place as men and women who have internalized their own moral norms, whose consciences are vigorously active. In the teeth of public reti­cence and of apathy or even corrup­tion in the professional guilds which are unlikely to discontinue using their immunities as a protection for privilege, these must be -young men and women who, upon the threshold of their careers, facing great pres­sures and early decisions that will form habits, will impose upon them­selves stringent standards. 
This, surely, is what honor is all about. Honor is that courage by which we commit ourselves to a higher moral standard than the common conscience . will support, a determination to fulfill claims of duty, promise and equity no matter whether others observe, ignore or dissuade. The honorable woman or man need be sustained neither by honor at large (which shall never be) nor by honor in the corporate profession (which: is only slightly more likely). It is a stubborn virtue, and· often a lonely one. It is also a Christian virtue, embodied •in Jesus who took up his cross while deserted by people, kin and disciples. Because 
"The new year begins a,t Notre Dame. Let it begin with_ a scrutiny of our 
. 
. ,,
consCiences ... 
it is a Christian virtue, and a gift of the Father's grace, it is agreeable to hope that in this Catholic univer­sity it might flourish, not simply in honorable_ and persistent indi­viduals, but in the company of us all. It is a personal virtue, but not a private one: ironically, it is the hon­orable person, not dependent on the public or his peers for self-disci­pline, . who has both vision and courage . to assault those corrupt structures and vicious prejudices and unjust institutions which stifle honor in both ·the public and the profes­sion. The honorable professional is a hero who struggles that heroism be not so necessary. 

Failing education in. honor, our education fails. Each of us, dear colleagues, will have our own opin­ion in this matter, but it is a fair estimate that our various courses of study -undergraduate, professional and graduate -·treat far too little of the claims of· honor, and take too much for ·granted. Our students have a right to an explicit consider­ation of this terribly . fundameJ'!tal character. trait which· will prevent their lives' work from spoiling. Since we are ourselves professional . peo­ple our ·own behavior, which is most cannily watched, .will be the more · compelling cue. --A campus survey on the question · of academic honesty revealed last year that stu­dents tended to· excuse their own dishonesty when they observed us, their mentors, taking advantage of our unaccountability to play favor­ites, to evade duty, to give lazy in­structions, or otherwise to use our freedom to personal comfort and advantage.· 
Who will learn honor if we be not intransigene to practice it? As Presi­dent Ford said last week when asked whether there would ·be an· ethical code published for . the executive branch: "The ethical code will be what they see me_ doing." 
The new year begins. at Notre Dame. Let it begin with a scrutiny of our consdences that our students, who are to hold their fellows in trust as we now hold. them, may scruti­nize theirs. 
Finally, brethren, whatever is 
true, whatever is honorable, what­
. ever·. is just, whatever -is pure, 
whatever is lovely,· whatever -is 
gracious, if ·there is ~ny excel~ 
lence, if there is anything .wor­
. · thy of, praise, think . about these 
things. What you have learned 
and received and· heard and• seen 
in me, do; and the God _of peace 
will be with yo·u. (4, 8-9) 

May that God of peace share with us more of that stubborn purpose­fulness of sweet-Jesus, who swerved not from his task, that .we might live.

This is a text of the eu,7,ogy deliv­ered at the funeral of Prof. Francis 
J. O'Malley by Rev. Charles E. Sheedy, O.S.O. ~ May ·11; ~9_74­
Dearly beloved friends of Profes;.· 
sor Francis O'Malley! 
His beloved _ sisters! (And . : we ·think here-of his mother in Massa.;. 
chusetts, alive in her nineties, a lady 
of power and fortitude, from whom 
he surely inherited his own tough. 
fiber.). · -. 
Beloved colleagues of the faculty! 
-in the Department of English, and 
across the colleges of the University. 
Think of how you have revered his 
fierce integrity and gained courage 
from his loyal partisanship~ -· 
Beloved priests · of Holy Cross! 

You gave him the only humble h·ome ­
he ever really wanted in his ·great 
teaching years. · You walked· ·and 
talked with him, and explored .to_. 
gether, in many springtimes, every 
cherished yard of earth in this calm 
campus. You· prayed with him and. 
worshipped God in· countless litur;._ 
gies, and Holy Weeks and ordina­
tions-and many charming mar­
riages of students and>solemn :-fti­
nerals of friends-in this great and 
noble Church of the Sacred Heart, so 
familiar, so dearly loved. : · 

Eulogy for Francis J. O'M~lley 
And how beautiful, how appropri­

ate and fitting; that his mortal body should remain for its long rest (un­-til the King of Glory comes!) in-the ­Community Cemetery, on the cam­pus, among the priests·and brothers of Holy Cross.. There. he will have, as close particular neighbor, his wise and sensitive teacher and preceptor, -Father Leo L. Ward, '.who perhaps _above · all . others . gave · Francis O'Malley freedom to teach and afflr­
mation of his freedom. 
Above all, I would· say and he 

would · say, BeW1Jed. Students! His present and former students, in that widespread and long-extended com­munity of discipleship, which has meant and .means so... much to you in your affection for Notre Dame. You know that you were everything to him. He taught you to read and . write; to love -the good and hate the evil... In his own_ words, which· I 

. solateness, their abandonment. Sud­denly He lives, · and' through His spirit their lives· are renewed in a 
.. fearless and unflagging , creativity. Out of a .death. came a ·renewal .of · life, a reconciiiationof opposites. 
And we -may·.think of_a dialectic of opposites in the Beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount, this morn: ing's reading from the Gospel. We · . think· of the freedom of. the truly ·-poor in spirit, of the inward joy of . Jhe afflicted sufferer, and of the 
: moral power of the meek. and self-. _less person. All-of these stand in .. opposition to ·.· possessiveness, · . and 
_ < -THE SCHOLASTIC 

heard him. say more than · once, he thought of you as "friends of the work." To me this is a noble phrase. These four words carry both the lov~ Ing commitment of his affection and his cool view of the objectivity of the common search for truth. _· 
0 dear friends, you see that even in exclamatory words of greeting my thoughts are outrunning my ability 
· to express them; I: find .:. ·myself merely reciting a litany of his loves. I would wish to be able to utter some suitable words which: might· capture clearly his elusive spirit, and :make use of these words . to inspirit· you: But Mr. O'Malley -was your Mr. O'Malley, as he was mine. -His spirit says a different·and inspiriting word 
to each of us: 
Yet you will agree that the spring~ time season of the Resurrection is a most appropriate time for us to mourn his death and celebrate his life. Death and life, two polar oppo­sites: the wall of separation. b~~ween them is broken down by the Resur­rection of Jesus. We think of the 
-sorrow of the disciples,_ their discon-. 
pleasur~ ·seeking, . and ariog~nt 
pride. ,The· genuine happiness prom­
ised. by :th!:! Gospel is exactly in the 
opposite direction ·from the •path 
down which the worldly person 
seeks for it · ·, : ' · 
' The truth to be found in this dia­l~ctic of.opposites' ·may perhaps. be seen in the. life; of Francis O;Malley. I think of hfni as by_personal prefer­ence :_ a . private :an_d withdrawing person, ev!:!p. a solitary person. Yet he-carried. out• a public• mission of tea·ching which through his students has entered helpfully ·into· the cul~ ·tural stream· of,'_our'·country. The country particuiarly needs now, arid always . needs, a· more humane. and civilized :culture, a.' higher standard .of private and. public· character_ and conduct, and a nobler public ideal. 
These are standards and goals which 
Mr. O'MaUey ·has regularly taught 
and personally .• embodied for his 
students. ; · · ·' : 
. Mr:' O'Malley was not ·at all a fac­

ulty .activist,· nor a 'political person. 
Yet 'when he felt the demand 'of ne­
ces~ity he spoke ~ut strenuously for

Mr: O'Malley· was a great' Catholic, but I had the feeling that he was not realiy interested in the.contro~ versies of post-Vatican U. or the question of Communion in the hand. I.never thought of him.as liberal or conservative, or ·of any particular persuasion other than the desire to live as a Christian in the Church. His religion was worshipful .and modest, not · clangorous ·or contro­versial. He expou9ded a high ideal of Christian culture. He introduced his students to the writings of Bernanos arid Guardini,_:Claudel and Peguy, Chesterton and Newman, in a .high tradition of · Catholic letters that reaches back through St. John of the Cross and St.' Teresa to St. Thomas Aquinas and the quaint and lovely English mystics of the 12th and 13th centuries. · : But all I have been saying is noth­ing but bits and. pieces of his life and character. I would want to re.: turn to the one thing necessary for your understanding. This is his love, devotion, devotedness to his stu., dents. He did not consider-himself at all. His life belonged to his stu­dents. The quesHon agitated in fac­ulties of teaching versus professional progress was meaningless to him. 
.. The University existed for the stu­dents: they were its raison d'etre. Whatever did nofreacli the-students .was a side issue' of little interest. Mr..O'Malley andI were both in­. terested. in superior students, .in . de­. veloping programs' of study for stu­dents of unusual energy.and ·talent. But he did not love. them, because they were gifted. The effect was the other way around. • His love and con­cern conferred giftedness. I have often heard· him describe ·an under­graduate as "Great"· ("a. great per­son") with exactly .the same tone and emphasis that alawyer might use . in describing . Cardozo as . a "great judge" or an art critic might call El Greco great. So I would· think of Francis O'Malley mainly as a '.'friend of the work" who spent his life in inspiring and nourishing a. whole network of ·friends· of the work~his students. He has left us, but he lives on in the fideiity of his students to the rigor~ ous ideal which he set for them.. I know that the students ·wm remem­ber him in their prayer ._11nd work. The faculty will recall and take new heart .from the remembrance of his courageous steadfastness. . To all of us at Notre •Dame· he. was more a 
. person ·than· a -_role, .more ·a. .spiritual presence than a professionaL He has been agift' to us, a. gift for which we are grateful. Now he has been taken from us, but he was never wholly of this world. Our oppor­tunity riow is to pray, for him and for .ourselves, and to remember, and to go forward with our present and future work, so as to be worthy of the great teachipg he gave us all.

Words for Frank .O'Malley 
this essay is his philosophy of edu­cation, and to a large degree, the man himself. It is unfortunate that Frank O'Malley did not leave a legacy of eloquent volumes. Yet, it was not in the nature of the man to close himself to others to acquire the privacy.and quiet necessary for writing. Most of his lectures, how-. ever, are.preserved in manuscript. . 
Due to.his poetic sensitivity to the anguish of the lonely and suffering, he took it upori hiinself to exercise a special ministry. Even in the most problematic students-the troubled, the lazy, the dull-he would find goodness deserving of praise. In this he fostered growth where there was often storm and tempest. For exam­ple, he always resided on campus:· He lived with his students from the be-· ginning of his career as a Prefect in Howard till his final days as a resi;_ dent of Lyons. Another facet of his tendance of the human things can be discerned in his humanistic politi­cal beliefs, and his corresponding work as a· Precinct Captain. · 
In his. classes he represerited the pulsatinglife of the Spirit. He nur­
"... he seemed to discern 

even the most minute workings 
of the Spirit in others." 
Frank O'Malley was ateacher. 
Unlike many, more concerned with publication. and· promotion, it was his life with students"which earned his reputation. As his friends recall, he was both generous and gracious to his students. One friend said that he spent a· great deal of money tak­ing students to dinner, but the cru­ciaL thing was the communion that they shared and not.the expense. He 
was a man who loved words and felt their awesomeness in conversation. 

-In helping students with their writ­ing he was ·a consultant, a fellow traveler.. Most often his students would respond to his encouraging concern and begin to work at the edge of their . ability. Sometimes their very being would seem to change. Many learned to understand life in newer, more mature ways. All in all, Frank O'Malley lavishly spent himself for his students. His scholarship was prodigious. He consumed books.as others con­sume food. Even in his early days in Howard Hall, he would frequently miss meals so that he could con~ tinue working. .A disappointment, now that he is dead, is that he did not publish more. Much of what he did write can be found in back copies of.the Review of Politics. His pro­posal for Christ College is.his most representative piece. Embodied in 
tured it in others and was often the catalyst for its growth.. Incarna­tional in his embodied Catholicism, he seemed to discern even the most minute •workings" of the Spirit in others. •: . 
His lectures were..testimony re.: garding the. good and .beautiful things which ,could be found only through the life of. .the mind. He lived in tension toward the good and beautiful things, knowing that dur­ing one's years, there would at best be· moments of ecstasy.• His classes were anguished• attempts •· to find words that described the splendors that were continually present .to one and the impririt of the Spirit found in all things. He contemplated and created in an interior silence that se~_med to make him a lonely figure. The profession that he · lived also contributaj. to this. Such suggestions ofloneliness were aggravated by his natural shyness. He lived in an in­tense awareness of the tragedy of the human condition. But, there were moments of graceful ecstasy. In all of this. he was a friend of Diotima, and he shared his best mo­ments with his friends, i.e., students. 
It is difficult to find words that adequately describe Frank ()'Malley. His,.life calls for superlatives, but even they lack the razors' 2clge of intensity. ·Perhaps the sharp meta~ phor of the poetic form is niore·.ap­propriate. Orie .• did not meet with Frank O'Malley, one encountered him in an I-Thou relationship. Such encounters were intensely personal. The meaning of his career arid the reality of. his reputation rest upon such encounters. Perhaps, _there is a studentof his with the ability and courage to. write a dialogue.·· · 
Frank O'Malley is· a ; model .for imitation. ·, Indeed, . for those v.,ho knew him well, .he seems to repre­sent the limit. case. Frank O'Malley, as he shall rightfully live in mem­ory, was a teacher..· . . ·

The character: A bored Notre Dame or Saint Mary's student. 
. The , scene: The 150th rerun of "Where the Boys Are." The solu-.. tion: The Notre Dame-Saint Mary's Theatre,, offering four. major plays, aLaboratory Theatre, arid programs in Dance, Film,. and Broadcasting this year. · · Located in O'Laughlin. Audi~ torfum at Saint Mary.'s, the• coopera­tive Notre Dame:.Saint Mary's Theatre believes in giving _the com­munity .a· .variety in period, style and interest in their selection. from world theatr_e. According to Dr. Reg-· in_ald· Bain, newly elected chairman . of the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's Speech and Drama Department, this diversity is an outgrowth of the free · kind ·of atmosphere needed to thrive in college, and a complement.­to the liberal education. 
'Following this tradition, the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's Theatre opens its ninth season with "Look Home-. ward, Angel," an important Ameri­can play, which focuses. 'upon Eu~ gene Gant's struggle to break away from' home . arid family, especially his mother.. Based on ·the novel by Thomas Wolfe, a Pulitzer Prize-win­ning play by ·Ketti Frings,• and di­rected by Charles Ballinger, "Look Homeward, Angel" deserves a look on Oct. 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, at 8:00 
· -p.m. in O'Laughlin Auditorium. To provide the community with a high quality, contemporary theatre 
14 
program, .the .· ND-SMC stage not only presents the classics, but also the . experimental, the new. plays . Written by Chris Ceraso, a recent graduate of Notre · Dame, and win­ner of the Mitchell ·Playwriting Award _giveri '.annually at Notre Dame, ''Fellows;, opens on December 6, at 8:00 p.m. in Washington Hall. An absurdist. comedy-intrigue, in 
• which two.comic characters attempt to arrive at a stable,11nderstanding of a . verbal puzzle, "Fellows" is an unusual mixture of the serious ·and the silly. "Fellow~," also, is the 
. second student-written major play ­produced at the ND-SMC Theatre within three years. 
Insuring a balanced season, Dr. Frederick Syburg will direct the Greek classic, the "Medea" of Euri­pides, as freely ·adapted by the poet, Robinson Jeffers, on February 21, 22, 27, 28, and March 1, at 8:00 p:m. in Washingtcm Hall. Using a small chorus o{' three women, "Medea" will describe an_ outcast _woman de­
. stroyed by the forces around her. 
The last production chronicles the destruction from within, the dreams of Cervantes' Don Quixote in "Man of LaMancha." This musical adap~ tation by Wasserman, Leigh, and Darion represents the annual musi­cal presented by this theatre, a very popular feature in their program. Reginald Bain directs "Man of La; Mancha" for performance on · April 25, 26, May 1, 2, 3, at 8:00 p.m. in-­O'Laughlin Auditorium. 
Best known for its theatre, the : Speech and ·Drama Department also 
offers programs in film, broadcast­
ing, and dance. A new broadcasting 
studio, a WNDU internship, and two 
professional • dancers added to the 
faculty promise·· expansion in these· 
fields. · 
Whatever. the program or play, however, the department stresses that the· real importance remains with the student; drama major or nonmajor. Both are invited to par­ticipate in the major plays and the Laboratory Theatre, ·a .studerit~run organization . always.. looking :ior actors and technical craftsmen. Call notices are posted on .the bulletin board of O'Laughlin's Green. Room Lounge year . round.. Justly proud of their graduates, the department can boast of· leading . actors·• in .the Trinity Square' Players of . Rhode Island and the Guthrie Theatre :in Minnesota, as ND-SMC , graduates. Every year,. ther'e ·are ND-SMC stu­dents as finalists in _the University Resident Theatre Auditions, the only. national competition for college ac­tors. Pride also extends to the many_ non~ajor ·actors, . to the two pre­meds who were among the best male actors last_ year. So, everybody should g() to the · tryouts, o·ne can never tell. Bernie Schartz, look out.

Notre Dame Jlfagazine, ·edited by 

Ronald R. Parent, was selected by 
the American Alumni Council·as one 
of the top 13 alumni. magazines in 
the United States. The magazine, 
which has won numerous awards in 
its three-year history, competed with 
magazines representing universities 
from throughout the country. Other 
magazines cited included Brown Uni­
versity, Harvard, Yale, Cornell, Uni-·• 
versity of Pennsylvania, University. 
of Massachusetts, Swarthmore Col­lege and Michigan State University. Darby O'Gill, the noted campus .philosopher and wit, has been trans­£erred from the Keenan Hall staff to 
an unrestricted position ·with the. Campus Ministry. Thewizened cocker 
}fathe_r Theodore Hesburgh, Presi­dent of.the University, was awarded an honorary bachelor of·arts degree at the commencement exercises last May. Although a recipient of several higher degrees, Fr. Hesburgh was never awarded his B.A. after. his dis­patch to Rome in 1937. The citation presented to him read: "Having en­tered this University and the Con­gregation of Holy Cross as a young

two years short of his graduation. Higher degrees earned in Rome and 'in Washington never concealed the 
· fact that he had been from his Alma Mater's womb untimely ripp'd. 
"He returned to Notre Dame as an instructor in. religion, but the want of that. most basic of credentials could never be remedied by a brilliant teaching performance or a prodi­gious publishing record, arid hence he was downgraded into administra­tion, descending successively from chairman to vice president to presi­dent. 
"As chief executive officer· of this institution, he was often called to address himself to students ·and to alumni, yet always with that uneasy consciousness that. what the one grciup sOughf.and the other group valued-the baccalaureate of 'Notre Danie-he had so sadly forfeited. Nor was the embarrassment cloaked discreetly within the precincts of our own University family. Decades after the fact, he was·obliged to step down from•. the chairmanship. of our na­tion's Civil Rights Commission, when it had been discovered that his aca­demic qualifications were ill-suited to· the intellectual demands of our 
·government's executive branch. 0 Rcime and Washington, grievous is the burden you have laid upon us! 
'"Amid the nearly half a· hundred colleges and universities that -have hooded him with honorary doctor­ates in laws,.and in humane letters, and in divinity, . could not one .of them, have healed the misfortune at its source by awarding ,the bacca­laureate ·of arts? No, that must fall 
to.his own Uriiversity. · . .. . '_'Now, therefore,·' 'to.· secure the· ch_aracter and prestige of .its 'presi­dency, the University ofNotre Dame annuls this sore .deprivation of 35 years, and ov'er the signature of John F. O'Hara, C.S.C., the presi­dent, and the date of 1939, confers the degree of bachelor ·. of .arts honoris causa on Theodore Martin · Hesburgh, C.S.C., Notre Dame, Rome, Washington, and Elsewhere."

ND: The Freshman ·Perspective
\ 
Yes, coming to a new place with unknown people is a strange expe­rience. . But, just because it is a strange· experience doesn't mean that it . necessarily has to be a bad experience. Ori the contrary, it can be one of the best experiences of your life, if you let it be. 
You arrive at Notre Dame on a bright, cheery August morning. As you drive up Notre Dame Avenue, you see the Golden Dome glistening in the ·sunlight. "Very cliche," you say to yourself, "but the Dome isn't going to make my stay here really that much ·better." And, you are 

right. . Notre· Dame has much of which to be proud. We have "the Dome," · the A.C.C., the 'brary, the Rock, and many other campus sites and attractions. .. All these things are great, but they are not the essence, the main ingredient of our school. . As you drove up to your dorm, you were probably met by three or four smiling faces. You were asked if you needed any help, information or•, directions. -You were. assisted with your luggage and given one or two valuable little nuggets of infor­mation..Then you were left to your own devices and ideas as to what y~u \\'ere going to do with all that st:uff_ you brought. with you. As you were unpacking, a body or . two probably wandered in to say "hi!" and to inquire about where you are from and what your major is. You're glad to find other students to talk with. Now that Mom and Dad have left, you want to establish yourself: and get on with meeting some of the other people with whom you will spend the next few years. 
As the days· go on, you will find that you're not the only :one who didn't know that you don't -bring your own bathing suit to the "Rock" or that just because you have cal­culus that you don't necessarily go to the Mathematics and Computing Center. You will also find that not everyone will hate you because you like The New Riders of the Purple Sage or ~ecause you call soda by the term "pop." . . 
This is Notre Dame. And,· the people who_ comprise this University are a special breed of. people .. These people have much to offer you. And, believe it or not, you have much to 
offer · them. . · 
Yo.u will always find th_at there is someone who'll have time to• con­verse with you and take an interest in you~ If you need a hand with your physics, there's somebody to help you. If you need counseling, there's somebody to help you. If you , aren't sure what •major you want to undertake, there are people to help you.: And, if you want to talk football; there are more than enough . people to talk with you·. Whatever you may want in·the way of people or. their ..companionship, you can probably find it·here.. J3ut you are the catalyst.. . 


You are the import~nt part. There 

· are many wonderful people to meet ori the campus: But, they. ar~~ not always going to :walk up to you and introduce themselves.-H;s. up _to you to: go out and meet the.people here. -And,. when I say 0peopie I don't ex­clude teachers, . adininistrators . or rectors.. They have as ·much to_ offer you as anyone else does. And, in _turn, you have much to offer them. · Don't. sit around and say,. ICWeH, I'll wait until next year," , bec~use every year. that you wait is one less 
.that you will have .to . cultivate ~ friendships and exchange ideas. . · 
_You probably came to Notre Dame for an education so don't cheat your~ self. Getting an education is more than going to class or putting in hours "with the books." Your :edu­cation is people. Learn with them, learn from them, .and learn •. to live with them.

THE SCHOLASTIC 


On Resignation a·n•d--Prosecution 
On August 9, 1974, Richard Nixon achieved his final first. He became the first President in American his­tory to _resign; , , His. own adIJ?,ission, demanded by his own loyalists, that he diverted the FBI Watergate in­vestigation was the deathblow. Now the political , ·doctors perform the postmortem, ' old;' friends a'nd. foes gather for one last look, and the na­tion debates'his epitaph;, ' 
The. debate reaches Notre Dame in full force and there are atleast as many opinions. here as debaters. A quick survey (with no claims to statistical precision) reveals some of the issues and ·arguments. . 
The first question is why· it hap­pened. How did it start?·Why did a "third-rate burglary" · as · Ronald Ziegler called it grow into ·such· a crisis? · Prof. Paul' C. Bartholomew of the government department said, "It ·is· still a mystery to me how a man with such great political skill could have handled the thing the. way he did.· Iryou were to write a· scenario of the worst possible way to do· it you couldn't get. it worse than what actually happened . ., 
· Junior government . major Hank Van Dyke, Keenan Hall's Republi: can, is also puzzled. "If he had only been completely open. two years ago . he. ·would have survived -there would · have been an upset . but he would have survived." Sophomore Don Bishop is glad that it happened when ,it did.,."!. think it had been brewing for a long time and we are lucky it ·broke when people could still stop. it.'.'-., .. 
The ·. manner ·and timing of :the. resignation · also · stir · a : : great:deal; of argument,; though there is gen­eral agreement· that given the reve­lations .of .t~e last tapes it had to come.· "After:.the .Court decided that Nixon ,had _· to turn over.· the tapes, things just fell apart/ Many of his supporters felt· betrayed and were going to desert.him ontheimpeach­ment and removal'votes." Bartholo­mew ,stated.·:·"He had ,no altei;na­

tive." Van Dyke, who gave Nixon his full support up until the final days (he won a ten-dollar bet that Nixon· would still be President last April) reluctantly agrees: "He had lost the consent of the people and could no longer be an effective Presi­dent; but I still don't think there was enough . evidence_ of serious crime to impeach liim." .. 
Some were considerably less re­luctant · to see him· go. "I think he should have resigned long before," Prof. Edward. (;;oerner commented, "but not for the reasons he gave. He should have admitted wrongdoing· and cleared the air." Government Prof. John Roos agreed;. Since pro~ longed . impeachment proceedings were the only alternative it was best for the nation that he resign, though · he should have confessed too. 
Personal, emotional reactions to the resignation varied widely. Bar­tholomew, who still has Nixon's pie­ture above his desk ("I may change the whole room around soon") called August· 9 "the saddest day in American politics, since JFK. was shot. -The fact, that a President had. to resign, especially when the whole scandal could have been avoided, is not· a cause for joy."·Roos' ·feelings were mixed: "It was sad but . not· tragic--:-Nixon ·lacked the greatnes.s. necessary for tragedy-it was hu.; manly sad." 
Fr. :Robert Griffin, new University· chaplain, commented, "At first I was·· tempted to agree with a remark William F.. Buckley. quoted, that Nixon should be impeached, not be­cause of his crimes but because h,e. is a horse's ass. But seriously, I.do' not ,want to exult in anyone's shab­biness; I've done some pretty shabby things myself and I· hope · someone would be. good. to me about them. I feel· reluctant about making· easy_ moralistic judgments suggesting that· if I were faced with the same situa~ tion I would never give in." 
. Others. thought that too much charity might be misplaced .. Steve Kerri, a senior R.A. explained that «the resignation ·at first outraged me -the idea that he would ·get that pension and may have made a: deal with the prosecutor. But now I've mellowed some ' and think resigna­tio'n is better than a long, drawn-out impeachment, though we stili haven't got the whole truth." Rosemary Barnes from· St. Mary's disliked the "big 'tearful farewell televised na­tionwide ·to · play on ·our sympathy· and make Nixon look like a martyr."' 
The propriety and possibility of prosecution does not evoke any more consensus. The group . interviewed was about evenly divided.:· · 
''Whatpurpose would prosecution serve?"· Bartholomew asked. "Pun~ ishment? ·He has · been punished· enough by being brought down from· the most powerful · office · in the· world. Deterrence? Any future President would be deterred by what has happened to Nixon already. Revenge? That is certainly not in keeping with the· American system, but it ,would be ·the only purpose served. We could wind up hating ourselves for heaping humHiation on the man." . 
· Roos and Goerner disagree, ,;Resig­nation or removal from office is not a punishment," said Roos. · "Nixon had no personal right· to the office of President, it was a public trust under the Constitution as the Found­ers set it up.'· Removal from office is not like taking away his property or freedom to which he has. a per­sonal right." .If Nixon is convicted, Roos suggests, he should be given. a penalty like "a month's ministry to the poor." Goerner. argued that ven­geance would enter only._ if the pen~ alty were very severe. "Give him a suspended sentence." ·. 
· Those ..in . favor , of ; prosecution offer other reasons . besides , punish­ment,. deterrence_and revenge. "One reason to: prosecute,'.' . Goerner sug-, gested,· "is· to get the_ whole, story out ·rather than leaving things stand, with. Nixon's explanation .that . he, 
19. 

:I 
just made a few missteps and lost congressional support. That kind of thing creates a bad precedent, al­most implying a parliamentary sys-tern that we don't have and don't want." Kern pointed outthat "in a sense he was working for me all those years, at least he was supposed to be working for me, but all along he was lying and we still don't know the. whole truth.. He was lying to everyone, including his own lawyer. r don't want to see Nixon crucified but the whole thing should come out.'; 
Bartholo_mew on the other hand sugges'ted .· that "we have to make allowances 'for human nature.. Let the guy salvage a little self-respect, 1et him at l~ast avoid grovelling in the dust. It's only natural when you do something wrong to make a few excuses; . to say ·•r will go on to do other things/ The . facts will come out eventually, so forcing a .confes­sion· savors of revenge.''. Griffin also dislikes the .. thought of prosecution. CCI would .take nopleasure in seeing it happen to him or Jri seeing him destroyed completely. I hope that some other ways could be fou~d to 
get_thetruui:•• · · .. · 
Perhaps ..the strongest ,argument offered-for . prosecution is one of "equal Justice,"-that no one is above the law and if, Nixon's aides are to be prosecuted he. should _be as well. 

This, was,;-put ,picturesquely, if· strongly,. by, Don. Bishop: "Nail Nixon's ass to the .walt He is the biggest crintlnal in Americ~n history, and .if we ;let him get away we should let every crook loose.'; Busi-. :i:iess major Chris Schweitzer pointed • out that Nixon steadfastly _opposed· amnesty for men who refused to . serve in Vietnam, "so why should he get amnesty for himself?,, 
. Van Dyke, representing the hard­core · Nixon supporters;· still main­tains that there•is not enough evi­dence for a criminal case. "You could corivict Nixon for stupidity in. picking his aides, and for lack of foresight but· those are not criminal and the tapes are not admissible," he said.. Bartholomew • agrees that no one is_ above the law-but argues that "the office .demands consideration. · Toppling from such a height is in-· trinsically different from losing a job : like . attorney-general and'· it would be demeaning, both to·ourselves and·· to ·Nixon, to prosecute on top ·of 
20 

that." He argued that the prosecu­tion of former aides is not analogous since they occupied lower positions. The constitutional clause specifically providing that a man who has been removed from office can still be prosecuted applies chiefly. to lower .. officials, he thought. "The President 
is in a different league. If there had 
· been a case before this of a President being prosecuted after removal it would set a preced~nt we might have to follow. But this is the first time this kind of crisis has occurred." 
Goerner · also talked about· prece­dents for Presidents; "We need a public affirmation that this sort . of activity is illegal regardless of. office. We must say clearly that we have a President, not a king who is above the law. There is no need for a stiff sentence but there . is a need for. a firm decision.''. 

:No one interviewed was ready· to make a confident prediction that Nixon would be prosecuted and con­victed. Roos thought an indictment probable. "Jaworski seems to .see himself as corrimitted .to enforcing the letter of the law and the grand jury has already named Nixon as an uniridicted co-conspirato.r.'' · Goerner­agrees that Jaworski has no choice but to bring charges against, Nixon, but suggested thaf Ford might par­don him before .the case :reaches court. 
Noting that. the· Supreme. Court once called· accepting a, pardon an "implied admission of guilt," Bar­tholomew thought Nixon might de­campaign reforms and many people in and· out of, Congress think that.· the Presidency has become too pow-· erful and Congress too weak. Others see a moral reform in politics and greater voter sensitivity to cleanli­ness. ' There is . much discussion. but will there be any results? 
· There is not much optimism among the group interviewed con­cerning campaign reform. "It's very much up in the . air,". Goerner re­'marked, "and a lot". depends on whether Ford pushes for' it or. drags his heels .. Usually Republicans are riot inclined . to spending. reforms since they have· a ,financial .·edge.'' Roos agrees tha.t the outlook:.is far from bright. Government major Paul Cassani would like to ·see·a national election contioL board and limits set on campaign dona.tio~s and. spend­ing. "We really do not need t<> spend this much money on an election; it's. ari invitation to corruption,'' he said. 
. Th~ ~utlook for ;ubstantial shifts of presidential power is also not too ·rosy if these commentators are cor­rect.-."I. don't s~ much .Jess power for the President inthe future," Van Dyke. remarked. "Certainly' his con­trol. of _foreign. affairs seems solid.. If anything we . should fear . a move towards the parliamentary .system of government .where. Congress can force-a.President from office .. r don't think ,we are evolving _that,way -yet though.'' ,;.,r 
Roos pointed out thatthere had· already been attempts made by Con­gress to regain closer controls of. the 

. budget and war· power. ''.But there are always lots of potential reforms, the question is whether · Congress can :make · these stick; politically, whether they, themselves· can stick together and set a precedent of re-, . newed control' and activity. for the .next two or0 three years.''. ·Goerner too sees a chance.for·a-power·shift: on the budget, but is much less opti-· 
cline a pardon if it were offered to · mistic (or-pessimistic depending on him: "As to an indictment," he said, your view) · 'about foreign and, do­"the chances right noware about · mestic policy. "The Presiderit's, 
flfty.;'flfty, but; I think that time is on Nixon's · side. As emotions cool the country· will come ,around against, prosecuting." Van Dyke also doubts Nixon will · ever sit in the docket .· "and he will certainly never be: con-' victed even if he does." 
Will: any major reforms come out of Watergate? The-Senate Water­gate· Committee suggested various strerigth in .foreign -affairs rests to a large extent on an imperial foreign· policy and J.'"see no signs ,of tliat changing. There is still a.· general feeling that the President should be the strong· leader in domestic policy as well," Goerner said.· '.•": , :. 
Bartholomew argued that ::the: power that ·,the President wields, at any..time depends ori two;factors­
.THE SCHOLASTIC· ' 

the situation and the person. "If of the man who steals a loaf of there is an emergency the President bread to feed his .starving family.

provided he is a strong man ready. 
to take it on-'-as-Roosevelt did iri 
1933 and as Lincoln did in·the Civil 
War. People would welcome leader­
ship in a crisis." : : 
Much comment has been made on 

the moral implications of Watergate .and the need for. clean.politics. Sev­eral people interviewed mentioned this .point, ·:with several different 
opinions. , . . 
Van ·Dyke predicted,, that in the 

immediate , future, "for. about the 
next, five. years" there would be a 
higher consciousness of post-Water­
gate' morality. "But I don't think 
there wilfbe anything permanent or 
dramatic,"'he said.. ·

· Orie point thlit came up most often from all sides-of the controversy is that our-system worked in a crisis, that the Constitution is not just a scrap ofpaper.

Surely, this is not the 'case ·with Richard ·Nixon.

· Equally inappropriate is the in­clinaticm of some----:-whether it be in~ dulged. in . by advocates or. oppo­nents -to equate amnesty forthose· who ·resisted:service in the :viet­namese' War·. with immunity for Nixon and his co-conspirators. Put quite simply, the situations are not sufficiently analogous to mandate· similar resolutions. -The allegations against Mr: ·Nixon amount to· charges of the most serious and per-' vasive abuse of the public trust and attempted subversion of our con­stitutional system ·by an individual particularly charged ·by his oath of office to uphold and enforce our Con­stitution· that •have come to light in our two-hundred-year history as a nation. Such felonious activities· far transcend, in. both their· magnitude and their · culpability, the resistance to · military service · by those . con­scientiously opposed to United States participation in the Vietnam­ese War. Nor, for that matter, is the conditional amnesty which some seem inclined to grant to the .draft.· resisters justifiably akin to the com-. plete amnesty which is now being urged for Mr. Nixon.· Not only does the effort to equate the two situa­tions•. ignore the punitive· aspects of the exile suffered by those who fled the country to escape the draft,. but it fails .to do complete julltice to those among the exiles who had been specifically. denied the opportunity to perform ·alternative services to the nation at the time of their resis­tance. 
Mr. Nixon's resignation, it should be remembered, was not a magnani­mous 'gesture designed to save the nation from· the stress: and expense of long drawn out and debHitating impeachment proceedings. -If such haq . been the true motivation, .·· it would·. have' come 'much earlier. In fact, it actually carne only aftercon­viction of.• an ·· impeachable·· offense · and reinoval from. office by the Sen­ate had become ·a foregone conclu-. 
sion. It was merely another step in the long, grueling process of grudg­ing responses to overwhelming pres~ sures designed to avoid complete dis­grace. and'. accountability:•· Only.· .by carrying through ·with.·· the · normal judicial process can we.· prevent the success of that last-ditch strategy and reestablish the rule of law in its full integrity. Early in the Watergate controversy; as the Seriate hearings were getting under way,. then-Presi­dent Nixon insisted that tl?,e question of culpability was properly for the courts• to determine. In the interests of equal justice and fuU commitment to;the rule. of law, now that he him~ ~elf is clearly amenable to· the or­dinary judicial . procedures .. designed to. assess guilt or. innocence, let us have that long-awaited judicial .de­termination in the case of citizen.

. There is good reason to not prose­cute Richard Nixon. In the Bcholas­tic of last March 29, I published an article .on the definitions .of an im­peachable offense.. Although I thought.then that he. should be cim­peached and removed .from office, I attempted to be objective and non­partisan in my analysis: Here, by contrast, I have been asked to play the advocate. lwill defend Richard Nixon in this forum simply because · . "every man deserves to be defended." That maxim is as old as the one that "no man is above th~ law/! . . 
First, we should dismiss _three arguments which -do not stand up to close• scrutiny;· His resignation 

· doesn't prove that he is guilty. This is entirely true and largely irrele­vant. The question. is not fact of guilt, it is wisdom of prosecution. Public policy. normally. requires a prosecutor to have good reason to file criminal charges. The measure is ''probably cause" to believe that crimes were committed and · that . this person .was the one who com­mitted them. The devise which puts a check on a prosecutoris the grand tion, witll:what are we Jeft? 
· One, it is· not necessary to prose­·cute ·the former President: in. order. to. establish. his guilt for the record. 
Some have advocated ,prosecution 
because Mr. Nixon failed to'explicit­
ly admit his guilt in his resignation 
speech. There is something petty .

Prospects for· orderly on-campus social drinking niay riot ,be. as bleak . as many students assumed. Several possibilities are in the works to end

'-Laiighlin and ·Assistant Government Professor John Roos are coordinat­.in·g efforts in an attempt to reach the Indiana State Legislature.· Last . week McLaughlin .met with local · state legislators to present the prob­: lem, ' find', out how to reach other · legislators :and ascertain what type • of bill . would most .: readily pass through Congress.

erations include blanket .18-and 19­year-old bills and. an. 18-year-old 3.2%,.. beer bill. Kathy Cekanski, · 
.. former rector of Breen-Phillips and presently South Bend . Deputy City Attorney, -believes ,students would have a better chance of success if 
they lobbied for a 3.2% beer bill rather than blanket 18-year-old drinking privileges since 1974 is an r election year and legislators will . avoid. taking a firm stand either way --on such a sensitive issue. University General . Counsel Philip F.accenda contends . there, is a · ."reasonable chance for action" when this session convenes in J aimary'. Two years ago an 18-year-old drinking · statute passed the legislature but was ve­toed by the Governor. Last year's bill died in committee. ' ' ' ' ' ·. 
McLaughlin has also· arranged for Senator Birch Bayh. supporters ' to register 'students to vote in Indiana by September 21, and is looking into joining .the Indiana Student . Lobby Association. . · · · 

, THE· SCHOLASTIC 

Another possibility is that the Brattain v. Herron decision may be reversed on appeal, if the case goes up on appeal. The Scholastic will make further inquiries to determine the present status of the case. 
Cekanski\ further proposed that Notre Dame student leaders hold a brainstorming session with local university student government lead­ers to uncover ways of dealing with the problem.· After deciding what could be done, the local ABC com­missioner could be contacted to de­termine the feasibility of the pro­posal and provide a proper reading and interpretation of the recent 
court decisions. · · 
· .' Finally a . slim possibiiity exists that parents would stipulate to join the University in ,liability should an accident occur involving their.child and an intoxicated party;.· Faccenda rejects _this _option since most par­ents realize the University has far greater_ assetst~an they do and thus would be in a far better position to pay _the damages incurred. Nor would this proposal stop parents of Notre Dame students from suing the university.-'Cekanski claims the waiver· w,ould gain· little support in cirde~ influential_ enough to pu.sh ft through th~ legislature aIId/or Uni~ versity administration. . . . 
-In-the meantime, hall staffs. are making . adjustments .at . the dorm level. Br9ther Bill. Collins, C.S.C., a Dillon resident• assistant · ancl for­mer assistant .rector, said their head staff was attempting to sponsor non­alcoholic' social -events, . such ·as barbecues and picnics, .and to , en­courage •. more 'creative' ways of socializing than keggers. -·_.. 
Generally spe~king, the· policy in Dillon, as elsewhere on campus, will be to, confront -only -those students who.are obviously drinking. In other words,. administrators , won't . be knoc!<:ing on doors. An exact.state­ment of_ the .. enforcement policy is difficult . , to. ascertain, since every 
-R.A., while consistent with Univer­sity policy;. has_ his or her own way. AsSr.'Don McNeill, assistant rector at Grace, put it,' "The experience en­forcementds something that almost has to be lived through before being

SEPTEMBER-9,:197_4 
Macheca concerning alcohol restric­tions. Most expressed regret at the implementation of the restrictions and hope that mutual cooperation between students and administrators will ease the adjustment. · 
Macheca's directive containing the policy reversal came as a direct re­sult of two recent decisions handed down by Indiana courts. The first case, Brattain v. Herron involved Donald Farmer, age 20, who had been drinking at his sister's home prior to an automobile accident killing three heads of families and Farmer's companion. He and his friends ar­rived at 11:00 a_.m. and consumed several beers and whiskey and Cokes before leaving at 3:00 p.m. His sis­ter, Helen L. Brattain, knew the al­coholic beverages came from her· refrigerator and even spent part of the time with her visitors. She made no objection to their drinking nor to their faking a few beers with them o_n the way .out. She knew her brother was underage and knew or should have known that he would be driving as soon as heleft. ,__·The Indian~ Court of Appeals held that Mrs. Brattain, who violated the statute prohibiting giving liquors to minors (IC 1971, ·7-1+32(10)), could be held liable for negligence. The decision, .in part,_ reads, "Any person, including social -provider, who violates statute prohibiting giving liquor to minor can be liable in civil action for negligence; violation of statute is negligence per se.... The Legislature has not seen fit to dis­tinguish between a seller and a social provider of alcoholic beverages to..a minor and it is our opini~n 'that no such distinction would -be either logical or equitable;" Thus, the $225,000 verdict against Mrs. Brat­tain was upheld. · 
What, this means is that the Uni­versity and its agents may no.longer sanction social events at which al­coholic beverages are served, lest it be termed "social provider" -and. in­cur liability for negligence should an accident occur. The risk of a $225,­000 verdict would outweigh any ad­v,antages of. on-campus drinking. 
Close on the heels of this decision came the Huey Reeves opinion in which a foreman was fined $50, given a four-daysuspended sentence and put on one-year probation· for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The minor;, Reeves' employee, 
consumed 15 or 16 beers at Reeves' 
home and had ·to be taken home. 
Reeves was convicted merely for not 
"halting -. or discouraging" the 16­
year-old. The implications are that 
any ·University agent, such as a rec­
tor or an _R.A., could also be held 
liable. ­
As far as the extent of .the rec­
tor's or R.A.'s duties, Faccenda said 
it must be decided· case by case. The 
university agent must defend that 
he or she did what a reasonably pru­
dent-person would do'.under that set 
of circumstances. ­
• Prior to .the above incidents no case law had been written on this particular ·_-subject sirice the late 
1soo•s. · · 
Since the law has been the same 
for decades, how· did the University ­
justify its previous policy? Collins 
explains, "Before, we knew we were 
taking arisk and we made· a judg­
ment of the risk we were taking. 
With the recent decisions, the risk is 
a much more defined thing.",. -
Faccenda elaborated that two 
sanctions ·can be opposed. in the case of a drinking violation: criminal and civil (or .damages). The University was unconcerned with· the criminal aspect previously since the · advan­tages of educating students in dis­ciplined social drinking outweighed the risks involved. -In the Reeves case, however, the state decided to increase enforcement by bringing ac­tion againstadults for contributing to the delinquency· of a minor. Re­-strictive · advertising of alcoholic beverages also resulted. Finally, the costly Brattain damages ($225,000) also considerably, increased Univer­sity. r~sk .• and fear of a lawsuit. Faccenda · said there_ is no, argument that the judge did not have the uni~ versities' _in mind _when handing down these decisions and indeed, a "very_ dramatic change·_ in Indiana 'dram shop' law has occurred.J' Al­though no complaints have been filed against universities as of yet, these -two cases have opened the 
way. 
. Legal and adrrlinistrative solutio~ 
are h~ the process· of being worked 
out. Now, as· 'collins_ aptly puts it, 
"the real chalienge.-for student lead~ 
ers is'to accomplish what wethought 
we-could-accomplish only through 
the use of alcohol.'' . __

Where Do We Go From Here? 
On December 31,.1973,.the Univer­

sity _of Notre Dame's football. team 
defeated the University of Alabama 
24-23 to win the National Champion­
ship. .l had the· unique pleasure of 
watchingS,that. game, and enjoying 
that victory.. In the spring, I cov­
ered the team for my new position as . Scholastic Sports Editor, .and wit~ _nessed the Blue-Gold Game, a game which proved that Notre Dame has · a a solid chance to retain its title as National Champion. 
. Well, a summer has come and 

gone, and we are back at . school 
again. This time,· however, the foot­
balL.team is not the, same as it was 
when we left in May. I don't want to 
go .into anything about the dismissal 
of,our_six players·; so much has;been 
said , on the subject, . and· as Colonel 
John Stephens has said, l'The situa­
tion . is over, and we . ought to let 
things go at that." .... . , r' would . like to make one point 
about the situation, however; these students were_,not arrested.for crim­inal ch~rges, as many sources have indicated, but w_ere dismissed .for violations:of University rules. They are lost for the year, and that is · that. On behalf of the students,. I hope that they .reapply and are ad­mitted, and can graduate from Notre 
Dame. 
Looking to the season.ahead, Ara 

has his work cut out for hin1. ; The 
loss,.of_Simon and.Zanot, as.well-as 
the . six suspended players, has cre­
_ated critical problems for the coach­
ing staff. With only one returning 
player in the defensive backfield, and 
a kicking game, that looks very sus­
pect, . we . will have_. to wait and 
see what wili happen to the team. Tom Clements and. his entire back­.field are returning (when Eric Pen­ick recovers from· spring surgery), as well as most of the offensive line. Pete Demmerle and Robin· Weber appear to be holding_down their jobs 
·at. the end position, and great plays are expected from these two: Defensively, Greg . Collin~ leads about the only healthy group on;the

Speed and ·mo­bilitywili be the key to the Notre Dame ·defense, and ' barring· any

The kicking game was decimated with the graduation,of'Doherty and Thomas, but Tony Brantley has irri­
. pressed everybody with his punting ability, and Pat McLaughlin, a walk­on, ·has looked strong kicking off. The, first• grant-in~aid for · a kicker was given this year, and Dave Reeve has . shown a consistency in his • field
