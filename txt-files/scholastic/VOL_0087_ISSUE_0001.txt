COLLEGE I ALALL
By THOMAS M. HIGGINS
In this the first column of the new term, we wish to nod to all our old readers (two) who are back with us again this semester, extend a word of welcome to all the old Notre Dame men who are returning to the campus after a tour with Uncle Sam, and, finally, toss a greeting to all the new students who are entering the University for the first time. May their stay here be a pleasant one.	.
From that eminent literary work of our sister college, the St. Mary’s STATIC, we have culled the following excerpt. For our paid;, no comment is needed. Read for yourself with what* great esteem they regard us.
BUT MY HEART ISN'T IN IT
Oft at a tea dance
I stand at the door
Looking for an N.D. man
That I’d adore;
Valorous, virtuous, never late
Always lending all he owns,
Loves getting my friends a date,
Eager to wait for the one he loves.	.
Never bemoaning the state of affairs
That insists I return at ten.
Interested wholly in my care
Not mad when I criticize men.
Ever gleeful, from him no complaint,	'
What I want’s no N.D. man,	•
Just find me a saint, f	’
While on the subject of S.M.C., were you by any chance one of the fortunate 150 “admission by invitation only” boys last weekend? ... In the old days, it used to be that a pink slip meant you could go no place, now it means that you may visit St. Mary’s. The girls at “the Rock” aren’t too crazy about this new system. Being' reduced to a hundred odd guests rather cramps theii’ style; maybe it is their penance for Lent. One comment heard Sunday was a paraphrase of the memorable challenge from Wake Island, “Send us more Japs.” . . . Can’t something be done about this?
❖
Since this is our basketball edition, it would probably be considered appropriate for us to inject a note or two about the hardwood sport (and we don’t mean dancing).
Recently two basketball players who proved to be thorns in the side of the Fighting Irish have been making the headlines. George Mikan, 6' 9" DePaul center, was signed by the Chicago Gears’ professional team to a $60,000 contract to be spread over five years. Who said a college education didn’t pay off?
Congratulations too to Max Morris, Northwestern star, who was named last Saturday as the Big Ten’s most valuable player. Max Morris was also the Big Ten’s leading scorer last season, and will be remembered for those 22 points that he poured through the hoop in N.D.’s last home game against Northwestern, and we won’t even mention the 29 points that he scored in the Chicago stadium in the first contest of the series.
At I.U., the Indiana DAILY STUDENT believes that Indiana is assured of a great basketball season next year if their coach is as successful at directing his team as he is at solving his domestic troubles. It seems that Coach Branch Me Cracken was able to find a home for his family where no house could be found. . . In Bloomington that is almost as hard to do as it is in South Bend.. . At Colorado school of mines this session, every one of the eleven members of the basketball squad received a letter for his activities on the court . . . reminds us of a fellow we know who received a letter for his activities in court.	•

Traditionally Speaking ...
Down through the course of Notre Dame’s century old history many traditions and customs have come into use and it is oui- purpose to acquaint the new students with some of the factors contributing to the school’s significant and often dramatic past.
To those of you who noticed the signs on the steps of the Main Building tersely telling the reader to climb to the upper-regions elsewhere, we may explain that this was not due to a structural weakness on the part of the stairs but to custom which dictates that no undergraduates shall use the front stairs of the Main Building until graduation day when they will ceremoniously march down these stairs to receive their diplomas.
There is no restriction on the stairs leading to the Grotto behind Corby Hall. Generations of Notre Dame men have worn smooth the stone steps in their trek to have a daily talk with the Queen of Heaven regardless of weather conditions. A visit to the Grotto along with daily Mass and Communion is a tradition of the first magnitude at Notre Dame.
Of course there are traditions in a lighter vein in the form of hot water fees sometimes charged to unsuspecting Freshmen. Knute Rockne’s desk lamp and George Gipp’s easy chair all come up for resale each semester. How many times they have been sold and to how many different students has never been accurately determined. The running commentary at the movies in Washington Hall on Saturday nights which sometimes proves to be better entertainment than the picture itself, malteds in the Huddle, walks around the lake, griping about the food and the annual pilgrimage to St. Mary’s, now by appointment only, are other time-honored customs. Be nice to the girls across the Dixie boys, because we owe them a debt of gratitude. Many years ago the girls of St. Mary’s donated the statue of Oui- Lady which stands atop the dome.
When the frost is on the pumpkin and the football season is in full swing you’ll see the Notre Dame spirit in those gigantic pep meetings. You’ll troop down to meet the team after the Army game, win, lose or draw. You’ll see all this and you will know why we are called, “The Fighting Irish.” The Notre Dame monogram is the only athletic emblem worn on the campus.
Each of the residence halls on the campus has its own distinguishing features with venerable Sorin and -her four silo-like towers leading the parade. Walsh has closets. Lyons boasts of an arch. St. Edward’s leans slightly into the wind and dreams of Fr. Sorin’s Minims, Dillon and Alumni have their enclosed court. Badin brags about her second floor porch and the bog which is the scene of many a ball game. Zahm has a muraled recreation room. Cavanaugh men can satisfy that urge to read a good book in their reading room. Breen-Phillips has solitude and a ringside seat to a new construction project.
In keeping with the teaching of Christian principles is the complete social equality amongst the students. There are no class distinctions here. Your success at Notre Dame does not depend upon the possession of a yacht on the sea or a family tree which is traceable to the builders of the Mayflower; it depends solely on your personal initiative and achievement.—Johnny Walker

LETTER
Sir:
Returning to the campus after four ydars in the service my first impression was: “It’s the same old grand place.”
Thursday evening as you know the Vet’s Club held a smoker in the university dining hall. It was a chance to meet friends who also had been away doing their part.
But that is not my primary purpose in sending or writing this note to you.
The point is I was actually stunned when our Glee Club rendered “The Victory March.” Not one man in the assembly stood up as was the custom just a few .short years ago.
My reaction was the same as the other old students who . . . were amazed by the lack of the spirit that has always been associated with Notre Dame.
Would it be possible for you ... to help bring about the return of spirit that should always be synonymous with the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame?
Sincerely,
Just an old-timer.
The Scholastic concurs. With the return to normal conditions, the large number of neiv students must be SHOWN that Notre Dame’s far-famed spirit is still alive:—Editor.

RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING KEEP GENERAL ELECTRIC YEARS AHEAD
AIR CONDITIONING AT GENERAL ELECTRIC
NOW perhaps more than ever before home owners and builders are anxious to install some form of air conditioning or automatic heating— or both. Industrial plants are now finding new uses for air conditioning and refrigerating equipment daily— activity in this field was tremendously stimulated during the war. Air conditioning offers ample opportunity for career seekers in this field to learn a business and establish themselves.
Manufacturers need engineering talent—tor designing, application engineering, and for commercial engineering activities. And the sale of air conditioning and refrigerating equipment to factories and mills, retail stores and theaters will require competent sales and application engineers. The scope of activity is very broad, and hundreds of opportunities will be open for both experienced and inexperienced men. General Electric Co., Schenectady, IN. Y.

Dear Proletariat,
With the final issue of last semester, I had fully intended to bring my literary career to a triumphant (?) close but when I heard that C&P—ye latter day Rover boys—would return to the pages of The Scholastic, I decided to return with them. So, welcome, old friends. And to new friends: In time you probably will come to loathe me, as do many, many people, mostly certain girls at St. Mary’s.

So behold me—a sophomore (from the ancient Yiddish meaning Wise Fool). And can anybody tell me what army was commanded by General Sy Collogy?

THE CAT'S MEOW!
As the cat said when she rescued her offspring from the violin factory, “I didn’t raise my daughter to be fiddled with.”
And brethren, it is written also about two kittens who were watching a tennis match. For an hour or more, they swung their’ heads pivot-like as they followed the ball. Finally, one said “Let’s go. I’m getting tired.” And the other replied, “No, I’m going to stick around for a while. My old man’s in that racket.” (Racket, that is.)
POME:
Little Audrey, mad as ... .

Said her mother, drawing water.
“Gee it’s hard to raise a daughter.”

A book'of English at my feet;
If I should die before I wake— Just look what I missed!

CHLOROPRENE RUBBER DEVELOPED BY DU PONT
Chemists and Engineers Unite to Produce “Neoprene,” Prove Value of Group Research
The synthesis of rubber was for many years a challenge to the chemists of the world. In 1925 Du Pont chemists undertook to solve the problem, using as
Chemistry extends the mold-free life of baked goods
A hungry world cannot afford to waste bread. Yet until recently millions of pounds of bread were being wasted annually in the United States because of mold. There was a real commercial need for a material that would delay the growth of this food enemy, if only for a day or two. But to meet requirements, this material had to be edible, wholesome, and completely beyond any suspicion of being toxic.
Combined chemical and bacteriological research resulted in the discovery that 0.3% of calcium propionate or sodium propionate in bread would delay the growth of mold for as long as two weeks. In commercial practice, a concentration between 0.1 % and 0.2 %
their starting point a discovery announced by Dr. J. A. Nieuwland at Notre Dame University in connection with the polymerization of acetylene. The Du Pont research staff modified his process to form a material known as monovinylacetylene and discovered that this, treated with hydrogen chloride gas, produced chloroprene, a chemical previ-
was found to be sufficient for average conditions.
Calcium and sodium propionates are made from propionic acid, the synthesis of which (from carbon monoxide and ethyl alcohol) is another chapter in the achievements of Du Pont research— and an interesting one. The propionates occur in low concentration in Swiss cheese and other dairy products, as well as in the human body. Hence their consumption in foodstuffs is both natural and safe.
"Mycoban”—as the Du Pont propionates are called—is a shining example of how intensive research solved a problem which long perplexed baking technologists.
ously unknown. Their next discovery was that the polymerization of chloroprene resulted in a rubber-like solid, superior in many respects to natural rubber itself I
Neoprene, as this synthetic rubber is now called, was first placed on the market in 1931. Although more costly than natural rubber, the demand for it grew rapidly. Du Pont engineers were called upon to design and build manufacturing units embodying improved equipment and better production techniques. The result is that today neoprene production is measured in millions of pounds a year, and the price is only slightly higher than that of prewar natural rubber.
The development, the improvement and the large-scale production of neoprene are another tribute to the value of modern, coordinated research. Neoprene is the result of the cooperative efforts of many Du Pont research chemists, engineers and other technical men.

NOTRE DAME, INDIANA
N. D. Enrollment Reaches All-Time High
Half of Students
War Veterans
A total of 3,337 students, more than half of them war veterans, has been enrolled for the Spring- semester, it was announced by University officials. This total is a new high for one semester at Notre Dame.
Normal capacity at Notre Dame, prior to the inauguration of the accelerated wartime program in 1942, was approxi-, mately 3,200 students. This semester, however, residence accommodations are being taxed to the utmost in order that as many students as possible may be accommodated.
Approximately 1,800 of the students enrolled at Notre Dame for the Spring semester are veterans of World War II who are attending the University under the G.I. Bill	of Rights	and Veterans Re-
.	habilitation	Act. Last	semester, a total
of 600 veterans attended the Univer-'	sity.
The total	number of	students enrolled
at Notre Dame include 456 members of the Naval Training Unit at the University. This semester marks the final four-months period during which naval trainees will be on active duty at Notre Dame. Effective June 30, members of the naval ROTO unit at the University will ! be returned to inactive status.
The College of Commerce leads in to-1 tai registration among the five Colleges of the University with a total of more than 1000 students, followed closelj7 by the College of Arts and Letters with 890. Engineering- is third with 840, trailed by Science with 361 and Law with 140. A total of 106 graduate students have been enrolled for the Spring-semester.
Due to heavy enrollment, resident 1 space on the campus is at a premium. Doubling up, reminiscent of the war, has been in progress on the campus. Although the housing shortage was allevi-!’ ated somewhat with the acquisition of
Accelerated Program
Will End at Notre Dame
The “accelerated semesters” in effect at the University of Notre Dame in World War II to enable students to complete their education before entering the armed forces will come to an end with the spring term.
As the last of the “accelerated semesters,” the new term will complete Notre Dame’s record of maintaining three complete semesters during each school year affected by the war and will prepare the way for the return next fall of the two-semester school year.
But the resumption of a peace-time curriculum, although ending the wartime need for speed in education, brings the university to the most urgent housing problem in its history, Notre Dame officials acknowledged Saturday. Last semester’s enrollment of 2,900 was increased by new registrations for the spring term and is expected to reach a new high of 3,800 next fall, Rev. Louis Thornton, C.S.C., registrar, reported.
“Several hundred students had to double up in single rooms,” Father Thornton said. “We are utilizing our facilities to the utmost so that we can take as many students as possible; otherwise, they wouldn’t get the schooling they want.”
Accommodations for 200 are expected to be provided in a new dormitory to be built as a duplicate of Breen-Phillips hall. The federal public housing administration is scheduled to provide 117 family dwelling units for married veterans. One of every six veterans at Notre Dame
Lyons Hall and a portion of Howard Hall for civilian use, it was necessary to press Carroll Hall into service until such time as the students residing there could be reassigned to other residence halls.
is married, Rev. John Lane, C.S.C., director of veterans’ affairs, said.
Veterans will represent more than 50 per cent of the March enrollment at Notre Dame and “by far the larger part of the veterans are former students returning to the university,” Father* Lane estimated. “Naturally, the Notre Dame men who have been in service and .now want to resume their education are given top priority in enrollment applications,” he added.
He praised the cooperation of many South Bend residents who have offered housing accommodations to students.
“Many of these people,” he said, “are going far out of their way to help make it possible for returning veterans and other young men to get an education.”
Inter-American Affairs
Club Holds Election
The Inter-American Affairs Club elected officers at its first meeting of the semester last Monday evening in the Law Building. Rolando Duarte was elected president; Vincent Hogan, vice-president; Tom Murray, secretary; and Father Cunningham, faculty advisor.
The Club is planning a very active program for this semester, including timely lectures by noted speakers, some illustrated movies, dinner meetings, participation in the NFCCS conferences in Philadelphia and Chicago, and social activities.
The next meeting will be held Monday, March 25, at 7:20 p.m. in Room 1 of the Law Building. Mr. William Harper, of the Dominican Republic, will give a timely talk on the political situation in his country in reply to an article in the March number of the Inter-American Revieic. If you are a prospective member and can’t attend this meeting, kindly contact one of the officers or leave word with Father Cunningham’s secretary in the Law Building.

University to Set Up Army Barracks for Vets
Rev. John J. Lane, C.S.C., director of Veterans Affairs at the University, announced today that 39 army barracks will be converted into 117 housing units which will be located along a 1,000 footfrontage on Juniper Road. The F.H.A., has approved the site, which will take up approximately 13 acres. These units will house veteran students and their families.
The 117 housing units will be grouped into three dwelling units. Each barrack will contain three apartments, made up of two bed rooms, living room, kitchen, and bath. The apartments will have coal heaters, ranges, hot water heaters, storage tanks, and ice refrigeration. The sewerage and water systems are now being installed by the University.
Courses Expanded for Mechanical Engineers
A new sequence of courses intended to train Industrial Mechanical Engineers has been introduced into the curriculum of the Department of Mechanical Engineering.
The new course, which was inaugurated this semester, includes instruction in plant design, tool design, industrial organization, production processes, industrial economics, production control and cost estimation. It is taught, by Professor C. Robert Egry, of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Notre Dame.
Industrial Engineering, although not a' new branch of the Engineering Sciences, is a field which has become more prominent during the war years because it treats of the scientific approach to the solution of mass production problems—the most efficient-relationship between men, machines and materials.
This new curriculum has been added because of a demand from many returning students, mostly veterans, and is designed to complement the present course of study in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Notre Dame.
On Education Committee
The Rev. J. Hugh O’Donnell, C.S.C., President of the University of Notre Dame, has accepted membership on a committee of distinguished educators from the National Catholic Educational Association to study the possibilities of assisting Catholic educational institutions in Europe during the post-war period.

Fr. O'Donnell Represents N.D.
at Cardinal Glennon Funeral
The high esteem held for Cardinal Glennon at Notre Dame was expressed by Rev. J. Hugh O’Donnell, C.S.C., president, who represented the University at the prelate’s funeral. An honored guest at Notre Dame on many occasions, the Cardinal had been a friend of the University for 50 years. The services were held in St. Louis one month and three days after Cardinal Glennon, with the other three American Cardinals, had flown to Rome to receive the red hat at the papal consistory. The trip proved too much for the prelate’s advanced years and he died enroute home March 9th in the Irish presidential palace of Sean O’Kelly. The following statement was issued by Father O’Donnell in connection with Cardinal Glennon’s death:
“With the passing of Tiis eminence, John Cardinal Glennon, archbishop of St. Louis, Mo., the University of Notre Dame mourns an esteemed and dear friend of more than a half century.
“Among the late Cardinal’s many friends at Notre Dame of some years ago were such illustrious personages as Father Daniel Hudson, C.S.C., long-time editor of The Ave Maria; Father John A. Zahm, C.S.C., internationally famous

Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C., president of the University, while in South Bend. Mr. Strake, a member of the board of lay-trustees, had just flown from Rome, where he was the guest of Cardinal Spellman at the consistory. Mr. Strake gave the late Cardinal Glennon his first plane ride only two months ago. .	—Photo by Ferstel
scientist, writer and explorer; and the Reverend Andrew Morrissey, C.S.C., and Father John W. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., distinguished educators and former presidents of Notre Dame. All four preceded him in death.
“Cardinal Glennon maintained an active interest in Notre Dame until the last. He was a frequent visitor on the campus until a few years ago when increasing responsibilities, coupled with advancing years, made it necessary for him to remain most of the time in his Archiepiscopal See.
“Because of his long, intimate association with Notre Dame, it is only natural, therefore, that the University should hold him in prayerful memory. Requiem masses are being offered for the happy repose of his soul by friends among the priests at Notre Dame, while Lay officials, faculty members, students, and alumni are joining in prayers for the same intention.
“John Cardinal Glennon will always be remembered at Notre Dame as a noble, generous, gracious priest of God, and an inspiration to all. May he rest in peace.”
Metropolis by the Lakes
Out South Bend’s Notre Dame avenue, just past the north city limits, sprawling out over the plain, dipping down to the shores of two clear, blue, spring-fed lakes—St. Mary’s and St. Joseph’s—is a unique city. In America’s most representative country, it is a city unlike any other in the United States; it is a city apart, yet it is as cosmopolitan as any from East to West. It is Notre Dame, Indiana, known scholastically as the University of Notre Dame.
The municipal area of the collegetown is a 1700-acre campus, with 48 buildings, large and small. Spread orderly over the flat, green land they form a T-shaped main quadrangle and numerous side courts. And soon there is to grow up on Bulla Road a pleasant homespun subdivision of government housing units, lace-curtained and proper flowers at the door for married vets and their wives. Citizens, this spring, were approximately 3,400 navy men, civilians, instructors, professors and administrative officials and officers.
Most utilities at Notre Dame are publicly owned. On campus is a great modern power plant which heats campus buildings and pumps water from St. Joseph’s lake for plumbing. Winding for two miles under the campus are lighted tunnels containing heating and water pipes and electrical conduits. Drinking water comes directly from deep spring wells.
Laundry and Dry-Cleaning
The laundry and dry-cleaning plants are just two of the utilities which have geared up to meet the new demands of
ment. To service additional pressure on the dining hall, the upper dining room above the cafeteria was opened recently to the public. A modern soda fountain is also housed in the cafeteria, which has become the site of many a bull session. Civilian students require a dining hall book to prove their right to be served with meals. Mr. D. C. Ford, the present manager of the dining hall, reports that the students every day consume two tons of spuds, 3,000 pounds of meat at a meal, 700-800 loaves of bread, 600 gallons of milk, SCO do ens of sweet rolls, and 1200 dozens of doughnuts for Sunday breakfast.
Rockne Memorial Gym
The Rockne Memorial is a modern well-designed gymnasium situated at the far west end of the plaza. One of the main features of the building is the standard swimming pool, in the central part of the structure. Above the pool is a large gymnasium for interhall basketball, indoor tennis, and gym classes. In the wings flanking the central part of the building are a general apparatus room and a room for corrective exercise. These rooms are also used by the Department of Physical Education and by the navy for instruction and drill. Twelve courts for handball and squash, a room for boxing, a room for wrestling, and one which serves as headquarters for the University golf course, are all located in this impressive monument to a great American. The foyer of the buildings, which is the memorial proper to the late Knute Rockne, is one of the most attractive places on the campus, impressive with its glassed-in shelves of
trophies, cups, prizes, and awards of Notre Dame athletes.
And Others
There are many other buildings of the University which serve the campus body. The post office handles innumerable stacks of mail each day, and the packages which pour in around certain holidays read like a “Believe it or not” item. The local barber shop, too, has had to expand to take care of the new style haircuts ... it always stands ready to take the ribbing which local wits usually cast upon its politically-minded personnel.
The libraries, accessible to the student at the University, provide in all about 340,000 volumes. There is the general library, the law library, engineering library, the chemistry library, and the biology library. Aside from these, other departments boast of having private libraries which are the envy of many outside the University. It is a well-known fact that the metallurgy library, located in the engineering building, is one of the most complete, most expensive in the world. Dr. Edward G. Mahin has obtained the nation’s best metallurgical volumes in order to maintain its reputation and nationally recognized prominence.
Other utilities are the Western Union office, the Shoe Shop, the Watch Repair shop, and the Huddle, all located across from Science hall. The Huddle is almost a Notre Dame tradition. It is the stopping place between classes for a soda, ice cream, malt, sandwich, or anything you may need. Sport goods may be (Continued on page 37)	-
needed mass production. Clothes bags are numbered, and each item in turn is numbered by laundry workers; it is this number that identifies the items later for packaging and delivery. Civilians’ laundry is handed in every other week, and is ready to be picked up a week later. Badin hall, directly in front of the Dining hall, houses the calling headquarters for laundry seekers, and for leaving and picking up dry-cleaning.
Dining Halls
3200 civilians and navy men can be fed in the Notre Dame dining halls in cafeteria style within one hour. Two huge modern-gothic halls, seating 1,200 each, and designed by the eminent architect, Ralph Adams Cram, serve the stu' dents three times a day. The cafeteria is used by visitors, professors, graduate students, and by those who desire to supplement their- dining hall nourish-

C.S.C. FURTHERS GOOD NEIGHBOR POLICY
WITH ST. GEORGE'S COLLEGE IN CHILE
1700 Veterans Attend Smoker; Leahy Speaks
One of the least-publicized projects developing immeasurable goodwill between North and South Americans is St George’s College, an English-speaking school at Santiago, Chile, conducted ■ since 1943 by priests from the University of Notre Dame.
The school is attracting more and more attention in the United States. Latest to comment on the splendid work being done there is Maurice Early, distinguished columnist of the Indianapolis Star, who at present is visiting in South America.
In a recent article appearing in his newspaper, he wrote that since the Notre Dame priests assumed direction of St. George’s at the invitation of the Archbishop of Santiago, the school’s enrollment has jumped from 400 to 700, and includes sons of the best families of Chile. Buildings are being remodeled to meet the new expansion. The faculty comprises 47 instructors, including lay teachers and priests.
According to Mr. Early, the Notre Dame priests who conduct the school do no “flag-waving” for the United States.
“Theirs is not a mission of propaganda,” he wrote. “Instead, they are letting the job they are doing speak for itself. In the years past there has been a lot of

propaganda against the United States. It was held up as a godless nation.
“Now the most important families in Santiago are seeing these men from the United States do a good job in preparing their sons for university life. Many of these boys will study in the United States.”
Mr. Early also wrote that the Hon. Claude Bowers, United States Ambassador to Chile, “gives this school a lot of attention.” Ambassador Bowers, who was awarded the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws in 1930 by Notre Dame, long before he entered the diplomatic service, “usually attends graduations and other events” at the college, Mr. Early remarked.
The president of St. George’s is the Rev. William C. Havey, C.S.C., of Indianapolis, Ind. Father Havey is assisted by six other Notre Dame priests: The Rev. Alfred C. Send, C.S.C., Traverse City, Mich.; the Rev. James E. d’Autre-mont, C.S.C., Monticello, la.; the Rev. Theodore J. Huard, C.S.C., Cloquet, Minn.; the Rev. Joseph M. Doherty, C.S.C., Homesville, N.B., Canada; the Rev. George S. DePrizio, C.S.C., Mansfield, Mass.; and the Rev. Francis A. Provenzano, C.S.C., Squantum, Mass. All of these priests belong to the Congregation of Holy Cross which operates the University of Notre Dame.
The University dining hall was bulging at the seams on Thursday night, March 14, when over 1700 veterans, old and new, attended their- first Smoker of the spring semester.
Speakers were Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., vice-president of Notre Dame; Rev. John Lane, C.S.C., director of veterans’ affairs; Rev. Joseph Kehoe, C.S.C., prefect of discipline; Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, C.S.C., chaplain of the Veterans’ Club, and Frank W. Leahy, head football coach and director of athletics.
Father Cavanaugh officially welcomed the new veterans to the campus and urged them to make the most of everything that Notre Dame had to offer. Mr. Leahy assured everyone that inasmuch as many talented players were being returned from military service, the campus ought to have a representative football team next fall. In a more serious vein, he urged the veterans to guarantee through their own lives that America would be what their dead comrades wanted it to be.
Father Lane warned against the danger all vets must face, that of self-imposed isolation. He pointed out that such a procedure would result in missing one of the greatest benefits of Notre Dame—the feeling of democratic brotherhood. Father Kehoe echoed that theme by asking the veterans to give their closest cooperation to the various activities and aspects of university life. Father Hesburgh, the Club’s chaplain, dwelt briefly on the fact that about one in every ten men in America is a veteran. This, he said, means incomparable power not to dominate but only to do good.
The Smoker was concluded with the presentation of the various officers of the Veterans’ Club, among them Jerry Wayno, president, who outlined .what has been done and what^ is being planned for the club this semester. Jerry also introduced the club’s mascot, a schnauser named Peter, brought back from Berlin by one of the veterans.
Earlier in the program refreshments were served and the Notre Dame Glee Club povided entertainment, singing: “Smoke Gets In Your Eyes,” “Old Man River,” “Ave Maria,” and “Anchors Aweigh.”
At a meeting last Tuesday night in the Engineering Building auditorium, nominations for club officers were made. The veterans will elect officers for the semester next week.

Death of Dan Hanley Mourned at Notre Dame
Dan Hanley will always hold the leash of the late Clashmore Mike, spunky Irish mascot in our memories.
Dan Hanley, genial white-haired prospector and general handyman . about the campus, cheerfully toiled at his job of caretaker of the gym until last fall when he entered Healthwin Hospital. Gn March 2nd Dan died at Healthwin and was buried in Houghton, Mich., his hometown, four days later.
Coming from the mines of Michigan and the plains of the west to the University of Notre Dame in 1927, Dan Hanley became best known to all the students as the trainer of Notre Dame’s mascots. His love for dogs and his patience in training them to jump the hurdles made him an ideal trainer. Clashmore Mike, the spunky Irish terrier presented to Head Coach Elmer Layden by a Chicago kennel-owner in 1935, was the last mascot that Dan trained.
Dan Hanley was born and reared in Houghton, Mich., a mining region and the home of the immortal George Gipp and Hunk Anderson, one-time head football coach at Notre Dame. As a youth Dan worked in the copper mines of Houghton. When the tariff on imported copper was lowered during the reign of President Cleveland, Dan went west to Arizona to prospect for quartz. He traveled across the entire western part of the United States, reaching into Mexico and British Columbia on two different trips.
Dan’s early Catholic training was evident in all his actions, and sometimes he severely criticized those who wrote against the Church. He deemed Catholic Action to be one of the biggest things which had come to the front during his time, and he advocated that every lay person should, in his or her own particular group, prove a valiant Catholic in action.
Each Benediction service in Sacred Heart Church at Notre Dame found Dan in the fifth pew from the front on the left-hand side of the church. Dan walked quietly and steadily across the front of the church, entered his seat behind the huge pillar, and remained there until the two Holy Benediction services were finished.
For the past 17 years, Dan had been on the campus of Notre Dame and had watched many great athletes enter the University as greenhorns and leave four years later as famous men. In his neat little room in the gym, Dan lived a
quiet, unassuming life, happy and cheerful in his work, and very encouraging to all who came into contact with him. As he walked through the gym each afternoon, Dan paused to wise-crack or talk seriously with each athlete he encountered.
Intimately Dan knew them all, and they knew him. Sometimes as he watched the Fighting Irish practicing on Cartier Field, he would stand off by himself—maybe reminiscing on the mines of Michigan or the western plains or perhaps upon the great George Gipp oi; other noted athletes who have passed through Notre Dame, comparing them with the prospects then wearing the colors of Our Lady.

K. of C. Elect
McShay Treasurer
At the first meeting of the semester, the Knights of Columbus elected William H. McShay, Commerce sophomore from Indianapolis, to serve as treasurer for the curent school term. Other business carried out included the appointment of John F. Power, lawyer senior from Chicago, as the promotor of the Bengal Bouts. He will work in conjunction with the Rev. Charles M. Carey, C.S.C., who will serve as chairman of the tournament which will be staged the latter part of April and the first part of May.
Reports on the coming Vaudeville show and the presentation of the applications of new members was also included in this initial gathering of the knights. An announcement was made that the local council will enter a basketball team in the K. of C. tournament which will take place in Ft. Wayne on the 30th -and 31st of this month. Fred Rovai was named as manager and captain of the ten man squad which will be selected after a few workouts.
The Rev. John J. Harrington, C.S.C., recently discharged chaplain from the armed forces, spoke upon the conditions in India and of the work being carried on there by the Bengal Missions to which he soon will return. To complete the evening, tentative plans were outlined for an all-Notre Dame third degree initiation for the ninth of June and refreshments were served. Information concerning forthcoming first degree initiations can be obtained at the council offices in Walsh Hall.
What N. D. Needs
Ninety-one students in a biology class at Colby College, in Maine, while waiting for the professor to arrive suddenly heard his voice boom out of the loudspeaker explaining that although he was in bed with a cold, he would proceed with the lecture as usual. Students sigh for the reverse situation at Notre Dame —with students tuning in on the lecture from bedside speakers.

To Hold Student
Council Election
This particular “voice” is better known as the Student Council, which is almost as traditional at Notre Dame as meeting the team after the Army Game. It is an authoritative voice, to be sure, and exceedingly relentless in its clamor when student affairs are officially discussed. It receives its recognized volume from the student body itself, in the form of representatives from civilian halls on the campus.
In this land of democracy, where every citizen has the right to express an opinion or judgment, it is only natural that a university allow its students to organize for beneficial purposes. Therefore, your Student Council is much like the Senate or House of Representatives— smaller in size, of course, but equal in importance and vitality.
This semester, under the direction of Acting President, Brendan O’Grady and Secretary, Bill Carey, the Student Council has revised its former constitution and plans to present it to Father O’Donnell for approval this week. If this new constitution is accepted, it will cause many changes and improvements in the previous style of government.
Hall elections will take place much the same as before, with the ballots being placed in all rooms. However, instead of being collected by Rectors and Prefects at night check, the ballots will be dropped in a box at night prayer. This procedure will make elections much easier for all concerned, and since a Council officer will be nearby, it will also eliminate “stuffing the ballot box,” as the expression goes.
The new constitution, besides affording the organization greater power, also gives it jurisdiction over student activities. In other words, the Council will call meetings with all of the University clubs, committees, and groups, thereby coordinating dances, meetings, and general “get-togethers” with a minimum of interference.
Since all elections must take place within a three week period after the beginning of a semester, the primaries will probably be held on March 28 and 29, with the finals following on April 1 and 2	I i’

As soon as the officers are elected, the Student Council will begin its weekly meetings, and resume its activities as the “vocal chords” of an ever-increasing student body.

Engineers to Meet
at N.D. April 29
The Notre Dame student branch of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers will be host to Society members from a number of mid-western colleges. The tentative dates for the conference have been set for April 29 and 30.
The meeting will include a tour of the campus for members not from this University, a tour of local plants for all A.S.M.E. members, and a banquet. One of the highlights of the meeting will be the speeches given by representative members of the attending universities on topics relative to engineering. Prizes totaling $110.00 will be awarded the five winning speakers.
All Mechanical Engineers are urged to join the student chapter of the A.S.M.E. here at Notre Dame. With the help of new members, the Notre Dame Mechanicals can make this tremendous task a success-. Mechanical Engineers who have not yet been contacted by the Society are asked to watch for notices which will appear on the Engineering building bulletin board.
Company Drill, Rifle
Competition to Begin
Weather permitting, the navy’s company competition will begin in the near-future. The schedule will be much the same as the one for last spring, except that instead of one company and platoon drill there will be two. The individual companies will also participate in a rifle competition. Lieut, (jg) Disque, athletic officer, announced that a schedule of athletic events including baseball, touch football and volleyball is
YCS Sponsors Eleven
Vocational Lectures
The YCS is sponsoring a vocational lecture series to acquaint each student with the objectives and inner workings of each department of the University, so that he can choose wisely and work understandingly in his own field of study. The next in the series, on March 29, will deal with Electrical Engineering.
It has been observed that many new students on the campus, as well as some of the older ones, have not come to any definite conclusions about either their future careers or their present major subjects. It is felt that every student should be given the opportunity of finding out as many as possible of the details of the various courses offered and character of the work involved, the life of the university and of the department, and the opportunities within the different colleges. To this end the cooperation of the heads of the departments was sought and enthusiastically given, and a series of lectures was planned for the semester.
Each week on Tuesday evening (usually) one of the departments will conduct a special lecture in the amphitheater of the Biology Building. The speaker or speakers for each department will discuss the work in that particular field, the training necessary, and the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing such a specialized course of study. Movies, slides, and other visual aids will be used where available and applicable. The lectures will be frank and will pull no punches; there will be no rosy pictures painted to give false impressions.
The Schedule of Lectures follows:
March 26	Electrical Engineering
April 1	Modern Languages
April 9	Combined Commerce
April 16	Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering
April 23	Biology
April 30	English
May 7	Architecture and Civil Engineering
May 14	Physics
May 21	Philosophy
May 28	Physical Education
June 4	Chemistry and Chemical Engineering
June 11	Music and Speech
June 18	Law
being formulated. The companies are awarded points for placing in each event and at the conclusion of the term the company possessing the highest number of points receives the colors of the unit.

Dick Nesline is greeted by the flash of our photographer's bulb as he steps from the train. Dick, a freshman from Washington, D.C., just entering Notre Dame, shied away when the photographer proclaimed his intention of following him through registration day activities, said he felt that a new student shoudn't be publicized, agreed when the persevering photographer pointed out that it was for the edification of the student body.

A disheveled registrant finally reaches the Students Accounts' window, receives his certifications. Actually, registration this semester was practically painless in comparison with previous terms.
Dick starts up the steps of the Administration Building, runs headlong into his first tradition—and the man says no. "Where d'ya think y'are going, ya big goof? Cancha read, huh?"

Facing the Long Tomorrow
By REV. THOMAS P. IRVING, C.S.C.
Once in the proverbial blue moon someone delivers an address packed full of solid, homespun wisdom—so good and timely that it is worthwhile to cherish forever. The Scholastic is privileged to present to Notre Dame students the address delivered by Father Irving at the February Commencement.—Editor
I do not know whether a poll has ever been taken in which an audience was asked the question, “what thought is uppermost in your mind before the speaker begins his talk.” My guess is .that over half of the members are asking themselves, “How long is he going to talk?” Chesterton says somewhere that he inflicted a series of lectures on a group of persons who never did him any harm. During your years here you were subjected to the process of rationing, but you never found any rationing of lectures, and you were talked to several times a day, and I imagine that you would not be adverse to an armistice. In view of this, I assure you that my “infliction” will not be long.
We compare life to a journey. You have' completed a part of that journey, but an important part of it lies ahead of you. What you have completed were the “school days” for the future, and the days to come might in a sense be called the “school days” for eternity. Two questions come to mind on this occasion: first, what equipment have you for the journey, and second, what will you meet in the future.
In speaking of your preparation for life it should be noted that the University does not by any means take to itself the full credit for your preparation. A few years ago you came here to follow your courses and the University began to build upon the good foundation which you brought from a good home. At times we may give the school too much credit by ascribing the graduate’s success to the training which the school gave him. The training, however, was begun in the home, and the qualities which made for leadership and achievement were there when he came to the University, and the school continued to perfect what the student already had. That is all that Notre Dame claims to have done, namely, to aid and direct the growth that was already begun when you came here.
What equipment have you for life? It is not necessary to recall the knowledge, the skills, and the techniques which
you have acquired in the courses which you have followed. But you have something which is of great value. You have a pattern, a philosophy, or a plan of life. This plan is based upon Unchanging Truth, the truth about God, about man, about life and the purpose of life. This philosophy of life has special value today because the world seems to be tottering on the brink of chaos and ruin, and it has come to this state because it has rejected truth and the plan based upon truth.
Father Irving
It is instructive to note that as we move away from truth ive move more and more into slavery or into a state akin to slavery, a state which is not befitting our dignity as rational beings. You have the right plan and the principles and ideals of Christian living, and by being faithful to these you can be apostles for good to others, and you ivill make the community in which you live the possessor of a richer and more wholesome life.
During your years here you have strengthened your power of moral and intellectual growth. You have made your mind a more perfect instrument of activity. You have increased your ability to meet problems, to judge, to evaluate, and to make right decisions. Your training has also fitted you with the: means necessary to meet moral problems. You have strengthened yourself against the allurements and the deception which would entrap you and make you the slave of what is unwholesome or base. You can continue to grow and to enlarge your powers. The consciousness of growth will buoy you up, and it will put joy into your life and will add zest and beauty to your living.
. You have another power. When the infant in the presence of the family struggles out of his horizontal position and manages to raise himself up on his two natural props and maintains a temporary though dubious equilibrium, a cheer of joy goes up and it is announced that “he can stand alone.” One
of the purposes of your education is to enable you to stand alone, so that in the face of difficulties, when others forsake you, when you meet trial or ridicule, you will not make any compromise but will remain faithful to your principles. These gifts and powers are some of the more important elements which make up your equipment for your journey.
What lies ahead? What does the future hold for you? No one can answer that question for you, and perhaps it is just as well that you do not have the answer. If we saw the things of the future in one glance it might crush us. Those of us who were living in 1895 were perhaps better off in not knowing that in the next fifty years the United States would go through three wars, and two of them World Wars. The horror of it all might have been too much for men to stand.
A kind Providence has ordered that our days with their problems come one at a time. However, one thing is certain, that unless the rulers and peoples of the world return to Christian principles and Christian sanity, then the horrors and the sufferings of the last half century will be but a preliminary rehearsal for a destructive tragedy. Today, when we see rulers toying with the fortunes and destinies of peoples, we are reminded of the ancient saying, “whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.”
To be a leader is one of the opportunities that you will have. College graduates constitute about six per cent of the population. Since you have had greater advantages than the majority, they will look to you to assume leadership. You have the true principles of living and you should apply them. It is desirable that you attain honor and high position in your field of activity, and then use the advantage which you have in order to promote the common good.
What about making money? Yes, make money, make as much as you can, but make it honestly and with proper regard for the rights of others. Remember that you are not the absolute owner of your wealth, but only the custodian. Be the master of money, do not allow it to master you and make you its slave. Use your wealth to do good. Use it to bring truth to the ignorant, to lift the burden from the shoulders of the dispossessed and the poor, to wipe away the tears of those who suffer and are forsaken, to bring cheer into the homes of widows and orphans. Do all this in a spirit of humility and of gratitude for the gifts which God has given you in a spirit of charity for others. Give in.

Presenting the Fighting Irish
Basketball Squad of 1945-46
whose achievements include—
WON 17 GAMES, LOST FOUR.
Establishment of all-time record attendance for a Notre Dame basketball season—185,000.
Establishment of all-time record attendance at home basketball games—36,000.
Playing before the largest crowd ever to witness a college basketball game in the national history of the
sport—22,622, Chicago Stadium, February 23.
Playing before largest crowd ever to see a Notre Dame game in the fieldhouse—4,500, January 5.
Establishment of all-time individual high scoring record for a single season at Notre Dame by Leo Klier—355 points.
THAT, IN BRIEF, sums up the accomplishments of the 1945-46 basketball team, one of the greatest in Notre Dame history. To the Notre Dame squad, to those who did not win monograms but practiced diligently night after night without the reward of. action, as well as monogram winners, we dedicate this issue of the Scholastic.
21
On March 2, before 10,000 spectators in Detroit’s Olympia Arena, the Notre Dame basketball squad stylishly wrote finis to its 41st season with a smashing 66-39 victory over Detroit University’s Titans.
It may not have been the most successful Irish court season since Coach Frank E. Hering and Capt. Marty O’Shaughnessy first launched hardwood proceedings for Notre Dame way back in 1898; still 17 wins and 4 losses wouldn’t exactly keep any coach awake nights either. There were the great teams of 1908 and 1909 under the tutelage of Coach Bert Maris. And there was the unusual year of 1912 when there was no Notre Dame basketball coach, but Capt. William J. Granfield piloted the team to a 14 and 2 campaign. There were the late George Keogan’s 1925-26 and 1926-27 quintets which twice came up with 19 and 1, the latter captained by the irrepressible Johnny Nyikos of South Bend. The period from 1935 to 1938 was another Golden Era for Keogan’s boys. With two time captain Ray Meyer at the helm they rolled up 62 victories with only 8 setbacks.
THIRTEEN GAME STREAK
But the 1945-46 Notre Dame team made basketball history. It was far and away the most memorable. Memorable because it defied one of the most rigid 21-game schedules in the country and wound up with 17 wins. Memorable because it shattered basketball attendance records wherever it played. Memorable because for almost five consecutive weeks it was rated the team of the nation and ended up one of the top quintets of the country. Memorable because with its scintillating, star-studded line-up it consistently gave the customers their money’s worth regardless of the price of admission. Memorable because by winning its first 13 games it set a modern winning streak record for one season at the University. And, finally, memorable because Leo Klier, with 355 points, established a new Notre Dame individual scoring record, eclipsing Vince Boryla’s old mark of 322. Boryla, who last year* had broken Klier’s record, came within two points of breaking his own mark this year.
Opening the season against mediocre Camp Atterbury, Notre Dame played haphazard ball. They won, however,

and then played the same erratic game to win from Chanute Field with the outcome much in doubt throughout. The unfamiliar Eastern type system of play installed by Elmer Ripley, coach at Notre Dame on a one year’s leave of absence from Georgetown, at first drew rounds of disapproval
'in these parts, particularly from the local sports scribes.

The next 11 games of the 13-game winning skein added a few more grey hairs to the Ripley noggin and exerted a strain on many a patron’s heart. Such as the night against Furdue when they built up a 31-18 half-time lead, blew it all I in the second half, and finally won out 49-47. Eleven days later the Irish took on the Boilermakers again, this time down at Lafayette, and though the game was not as spectacular it was another of those close, knock-down, drag-out fracases which is characteristic of all Notre Dame-Furdue ■ court meetings. On Jan. 5 Ripley brought his unpredictable eagers back to the fieldhouse where they kept their victory string intact by sneaking past Ray Meyer’s DePaul Blue Demons in one of the most thrilling games ever witnessed on	.
a Notre Dame court. DePaul, with its All-American center,	।
George Mikan, hitting on all cylinders, took a 26-15 advan- j tage at the intermission. With six minutes of the second half j gone the score was 35-19. Then “Crystal” Klier, the triggerarmed, dead-eye from the heart of Hoosierdom, ace bucketman Vince Boryla, and nimble George Ratterman went to j work and cut the lead to 42-41 with 10 seconds to go. Pulses were beating like trip hammers. On an outside ball in the forecourt Billy Hassett passed to the freshman sensation, Ray Corley. Corley, unable to shoot or to find an open man under the basket, smartly passed back to Hassett who hit on one of those long, looping shots as the gun sounded, giving the whole affair- a Frank Mer-riwell touch. Hassett and the team had a little difficulty getting to the dressing room that night.
The DePaul victory definitely established the Irish as No. 1 in the country. From now on there j was no rest for the weary; everybody was out for the Notre Dame scalp. Great Lakes was, surprisingly enough, easily disposed of at the Training Station, but a week later the Irish netters had to stave off a cyclonic Bluejacket second-half rally in the Chicago Stadium to win 56-54. Likewise, the St. Louis University Billikens, who were beaten 60-45 in the fieldhouse, put up a terrific battle before bowing down in St. Lou, 51-48. That i» made it 10 straight, and fans from coast to coast were beginning to take notice. Tickets were sold ► out weeks before game time. So avid became the interest that Notre Dame played before 185,000 customers for the entire season.

WARNER
After outlasting a whirlwind Marquette second-half fury to win 69-67 for the sixth close call of the season, sports writers everywhere dubbed Notre Dame the “Squeeze Kids.” For the next one Coach Ripley and his colorful band of basketeers invaded the Southland to play the high-flying Kentucky Wildcats in what was billed as one of the “dream
Up in the Windy City 22,000 people, the largest crowd ever to watch a college basketball game, saw DePaul gain sweet revenge over Notre Dame by whipping the Ripleymen 6S-47. Then at Marquette the Irish defense burst at the seams and the Marquette Hilltoppers seeped through to a 6859 triumph which also avenged for them an early defeat by Notre Dame. Making the last home stand of the season against Northwestern, Notre Dame proved that it was invincible on its home court by taking the measure of the Wildcats 57-50. Sparked by the shooting of Klier, Dee, Boryla and superb floor work by Ratterman the game went into the books as the 24th consecutive home victory over a span of three years.
games” of the year. Kentucky had been beaten only by Temple in 14 starts. As it developed, Notre Dame provided the only other blemish on the Wildcat’s schedule for the season, winning 56-47. Unusual highlights of the game was Boryla’s scoring of the first 14 points for the Irish and Ratterman the last 11. Boryla, in addition, outsmarted and outscored the sensational, much-publicized “Wah Wah” Jones.
NORTHWESTERN SHATTERS STREAK
Back to the home grounds came the Irish courtmen, now at the peak of their season’s form and still rated No. 1 for the fourth successive week. Placing its winning streak up for grabs for that unlucky 13th time, it was almost broken by the Michigan State Spartans. Notre Dame was saved by the phenomenal shooting of Klier and a lay-up in the last 30 seconds by Chicago’s “Scooter” Dee, whose floor work and ball stealing were a standout all season.
Then the axe fell. Appearing in the Chicago Stadium against Northwestern, Notre Dame received a dose of the medicine it had been dishing out all season—pulling ’em out of the fire in the waning seconds. The Irish played impressive ball against the Wildcats but after the lead see-sawed several times during the game, Max Morris converted a long pass under the board in the last minute to eke out a 56-55 win, thereby ending one kind of Notre Dame victory march.
From there on in, those train trips began to leave the
players listless. Of the remaining seven games, six were played on the road. Saturday night became a nemesis. On
successive Saturdays they lost to Northwestern, N.Y.U., Marquette, and DePaul.
IRISH LOSE IN NEW YORK
Like Kentucky, the N.Y.U. game was promoted as another “dream game.” Both the Irish and the Violets were ardent contenders for the national title. Each had been defeated once. The attraction was a natural for the Madison Square Garden gate. The game was given an added incentive for a Notre Dame victory when two days before the game Violet Coach Cann popped off to the press why it would be a cinch to stop Notre Dame. So incensed was Capt. Billy Hassett that he dribbled through the entire N.Y.U. team to score on a lay-up on one of the early plays of the game. Cann’s predictions materialized, however. Tanenbaum did an astounding job in blanketing Klier, holding the Hoosier Hot-shot to a mere eight points, his lowest single game total of the season. While Klier was being hog-tied, Schayes was limiting Boryla to 13 points. It was one of those exceptional times during the season when neither Klier nor Boryla hit for over 15 points. Consequently, the Violets vaulted over the Irish as the nation’s No. 1 collegiate quintet.
SQUAD TO LOSE HASSETT, KLIER
There’s no telling what kind of season Notre Dame will have next year. Ed Krause will resume his duties as basketball coach and many former Irish stars will have returned from the service by then. Badly missed, though, will be those two clown princes—Capt. Billy Hassett, one of the deadliest set shot-artists and shewdest floor generals in the business, and his running mate and pal Frank Gilhooley, an invaluable team player and pepper-pot. Also ringing down the curtain on a brilliant college court career is Leo Klier, who along with Johnny Moir, Johnny Nyikos, Earl Brown, Paul Nowak, and “Moose” Krause, ranks as one of the greatest basketball players to come out of Notre Dame. Gone, too, will be Coach Elmer Ripley who has already departed for New York City.
It wasn’t easy to guide a team to a successful season especially when that team was pegged to win virtually every game before the season even started. His was an unenviable position, but Ripley turned in his usual commendable job. And while handing out plaudits, it might he well to toss a well-deserved baker’s dozen in the direction of the shock troops. They are the boys who didn’t win monograms. Some never made the road trips, but all aided immeasurably in giving Notre Dame an unforgettable basketball season by virtue of their long, daily, arduous scrimmages against the varsity. They were: Don Gatens, John Goonen, Ralph Hing-
er, Herman Hohnhorst, Dick Kluck, Jim Korth, Norm Mir-
rington, “Mogus” Mullen, Leo Murphy, Tom O’Keefe, George Riley. Joe Sobek, and Dave Wassmer. '

Coach Ripley Directed Irish Through Successful Season
The toughest schedule in the country faced Elmer Ripley when he took command of the Notre Dame basketball squad at the start of the season which has just been successfully completed. His past record included several seasons as a professional star with the old Troy, N. Y., and New York Celtics club, and 16 years as a leading coach in the East, where he directed outstanding teams at Georgetown, Yale, and Columbia.
The most amazing part of his experience here, according to Coach Ripley, was the demonstration on numeorus occasions of the famous Notre Dame Spirit. With every foe on the schedule pointing for the Ramblers, the spirit of the team and the student body was credited by the coach with being very much responsible for the margin of victory in several of the close ones captured by N. D. The schedule of the past season called for games with many of the leading teams in the country. There wasn’t a breather in the lot, and a great amount of traveling was necessary. That
the Irish compiled such a "good record under these conditions calls for a lot of credit for the players and the coach. The streak of 13 straight wins was the second longest in the history of basketball at Notre Dame. The loss to Northwestern put an end to hopes for an undefeated season, but the team bounced back and played their best game of the season against Canisius.
Coach Ripley acclaimed Leo Klier and Billy Hassett to be two of the greatest court stars he ever had under his direction, and picked them on his own alltime, all-stai- team. He predicts that Vince Boryla and George Ratterman will become two of the outstanding players in Notre Dame basketball in the future. Others to watch in the coming seasons will be Dick Kluck, George Riley, Don Gatens, Norm Mirrington, and Tom O’Keefe among other excellent prospects who were unable to break into the lineup this season due .to the closeness of the games.
Last season Ripley’s Columbia team was the winner of an experimental game
in which the 3-second lane was widened, and three points were given for a goal scored from certain parts of the floor. This cut down team play and limited greatly the space given for offensive operations. The ten-second rule is one of the pet peeves of Ripley. He contends that practically all stalling is done in the last, five minutes of most ball games, so enforcement of that rule at the end of the game would eliminate stalling while giving the offense a chance to maneuver during the major part of the game without being penalized by having to take the ball to the defense. Return of the center jump in those last five minutes would also improve the game, according to Ripley.
As soon as the season ended, Mr. Ripley went to his home in New York to undergo an operation for a hip injury incurred in a fall from a horse. He expects to be hospitalized for several weeks. He has been on leave of absence from Georgetown and has signed to direct play there next season.
Coach Ripley said, “I want everyone to know how much I appreciated the chance to coach at Notre Dame, and I want to thank them all for their fine co-operation. It was an experience I’ll never forget.”
Golf, Tennis Included
When Coach Ripley came to Notre Dame last fall he was behind the well-known eight ball. With a wealth of material, including two All-Americans, he had to produce—and he did, for a 17 and 4 record. Under Ripley's tutelage the Irish wound up the season with a rating as one of the nation's top teams.
in Interhall Program
Golf and tennis are expected to be included in the spring interhall program for the first time since the war, Mr. John A. Scannell, director of the physical education depax-tment, announced this week. In addition, baseball will also re-tuim to the curriculum.
A well-rounded spring program has been arranged by the physical education depax-tment. Other- sports to be conducted on an interhall basis will be softball and volleyball. Full details of the spring athletic program will be announced later.
Boxing, Wrestling
Rooms Ready for Use
John A. Scannell, director of the physical education department, announced this week that the boxing and wrestling rooms in the Rockne Memorial are again ready for use. Any individuals who wish to practice during the day or in the evening may use these rooms. Equipment will be issued in the same manner as basketballs are issued. Supervised practise periods will continue to be held in the old gymnasium.

Presenting the 1945-46
WILLIAM J. HASSETT
Captain of the 1945-46 Notre Dame quintet, Billy Hassett again proved himself to be an All-American player. Hassett was the playmaker of the Irish five, always steady and dependable. His long-set shots rang the bell for 169 points during the season. Though only 5' 10", Billy got more than his share of rebounds against taller opponents.
As a freshman and sophomore, Hassett played with Georgetown under Elmer Ripley, winning All-American honors with the Hoyas when they won the NCAA title during the 1941-42 season. He dropped out of school for a year and entered Notre Dame in the fall of 1944. He was a standout on the Irish five last season and broke the Notre Dame individual scoring record for guards in one game when he hit for 22 points against Marquette. He was named All-American at the close of the 1944-45 season.
Captain Billy Hassett will always be remembered for his game-winning basket in the final seconds of the DePaul game played in the fieldhouse January 5. Notre Dame trailed throughout the game and Hassett was having unusually tough luck on his shots, missing on 11 attempts before that eventful last try. DePaul led 42-41 with about five seconds to play when Hassett received the ball and let one of his long-set shots fly. The ball sunk cleanly through the nets arid the Irish had won. His greatest scoring nights came against St. Louis, first game, and Northwestern, first game, when he hit for 13 points in each. His greatest exhibition of floor work came against Michigan State as the Irish won their 13th straight. Hassett did not score a point in that game but his play was sparkling nevertheless.
Hassett is a senior. He has completed his basketball career in college, but he will be out on the diamond with Jake Kline’s baseball team during the spring. He won a monogram as a shortstop last season. Billy hopes to play pro baseball after graduation.
LEO A. KLIER
Following his discharge from the Navy where he served as an Ensign, Leo “Crystal” Klier returned to the Notre Dame campus to complete his senior year of school and bowed out of Irish athletics in auspicious style. Leo broke the Notre Dame individual season scoring record by running up 355 points during the 21-game schedule and was voted the most valuable player on the squad by his teammates.
Klier hails from Washington, Ind., where he won two letters with the Washington high school quintet. During his senior year Washington won the Indiana state championship,
Southern Indiana Conference title, and regional championship.
During the 1943-44 campaign with the Fighting Irish, Klier broke Johnny Moir’s old individual scoring record of 290 points by tabulating 293 that season and received AllAmerican honors at the close of the season. Klier was in the V-12 program at Notre Dame and was later commissioned an ensign. He was discharged shortly before the opening of the November, 1945, term.
Coach Elmer Ripley wasted no time in installing Klier in j his old forward position. His long one-handed set shots began swishing the net in the first game of the season and didn’t stop until the Detroit game was over. Leo thrilled the thousands who saw the Irish play this year as he shot from all possible angles and positions. He scored 24 points against Chanute Field; 25 against Wisconsin; 22 in the first Great ; Lakes game; 21 in the second St. Louis encounter; 22 in the Marquette game on the fieldhouse court; and 26 in the Michi- । gan State game at Notre Dame, which was Leo’s most spectacular shooting performance of the year. Late in the season Ripley moved Klier to a guard position but he continued his

scoring during the Northwestern game, surpassing the old scoring mark set by Boryla, and finishing with 26 points against Detroit.
Leo was much more than a mere scorer. His rebounding was the most consistent on the team and his ball handling was dazzling. Most Notre Dame opponents placed Leo on their all-opponent teams.
Klier will graduate from the Commerce School in June.
VINCE BORYLA
By scoring 28 points against Canisius in Buffalo, N. Y., Boryla set a new individual single game scoring mark for that city. His other top games were Wisconsin, 22 points; Great Lakes, second game, 24; 21 in Marquette first game; 18 against Kentucky, of which 14 were the first 14 points of the game scored by the Irish; and 20 against Marquette in Milwaukee.
GEORGE RATTERMAN
The versatile Navy trainee, George Ratterman, again proved his ability on the hardwood during the 1945-46 Notre
Vince “Bullets” Boryla hails from East Chicago, Ind., where he was an All-State center on the Washington High quintet in 1943-44. As a freshman at Notre Dame last season, Vince broke four individual scoring records: single game mark (31), fieldhouse record (31), individual scoring record (322), and most field goals in a single game (13). Boryla entered the Navy shortly after the season ended and received an appointment to the Naval Academy. He resigned from the Academy last fall and reentered Notre Dame.
The 6' 4'' center had another great season with the Irish. He relinquished his season scoring -record mark to Klier but was nonetheless sensational. He scored 321 points, one point less than during his first year. Boryla is almost certain to establish a Notre Dame scoring record that will never be surpassed, namely, points scored during a varsity career. With two more seasons to go, Vince should have little difficulty in setting a new mark. Johnny Moir holds the present one with 780 for three seasons. Boryla now has scored 643 points during two seasons.
Boryla proved to be a hard man to stop around the free throw area, as his jump shots and pivot wizardry accounted for'most of his 128 baskets. He also led the team in scoring free throws—65 of them.
Dame basketball season as he ended up as the third highest scorer on the squad with 180 points. Ratterman got a late start in basketball due to his presence on the football squad until early December, but when George got into the swing of court activities he became one of Coach Ripley’s steadiest performers and ended the season as a regular. He became noted for- his cool temperament in the most heated engagements.	•
Ratterman was a regular last season under the coaching of Clem Crowe. He is one of four Notre Dame men to win four monograms in a single year. He won monograms in basketball, baseball, tennis, and football over a 12-month span. At Xavier High in Cincinnati, where he prepped, George won all-state honors in football and basketball, captaining both teams during his senior year. He is considered one of the “slickest” players in college ball, and as a freshman was named to the All-Chicago Stadium team.
During the first half of the 1945-46 schedule, Ratterman was the “sixth” regular, being inserted into the game at the precise, crucial moment. When Ripley changed his strategy and shifted Klier to guard, Ratterman moved into a starting- forward position. His rebound work was extraordinary and his one-handed arch shots trustworthy. ‘
27
Ratterman is a navy trainee in the R.O.T.C. program on rhe campus. A blond, blue-eyed German-American boy, Ratterman’s fragile appearance has the spectators afraid for his welfare when the going gets tough, but George has always managed to take care of himself.
One of his best games of the season was the Kentucky tussle. When the Wildcats had pulled within four points of Notre Dame late in the game, George tossed in a free throw and three quick field goals in succession to provide the Irish with a comfortable margin.
JOHN F. DEE
One of the sparkplugs of this season’s highly successful Notre Dame basketball five was diminutive Johnny Dee of Chicago, Ill., regular forward. Despite his height of five feet, seven inches, Dee displayed great ability in getting rebounds, but his particular forte was “stealing the ball” from his taller opponents. In addition to his stellar defensive play, Dee was also a consistent scorer.	’
Dee attended Loyola Academy of Chicago, where he starred in basketball. He entered Loyola University, where he remained for one semester before entering the United States Coast Guard. He received a medical discharge in April, 1944, after serving for nearly three years and entered Notre Dame during the summer to continue his education. Dee is now a junior and is majoring in law.
This was the second year that he has been a regular on the Notre Dame basketball team. Last season lie was the second leading scorer on the team with an average of 12 points a game. This year he was a steady scorer but not the high-point man that he was a year ago since this year’s team proved to be a more well-rounded five. This year he averaged almost six points per game.
In addition to his fine basketball playing, Dee is also
noted for his ability in football and baseball. He was a reserve quarterback on the 1944 Notre Dame team, seeing considerable action, including a starting assignment in the Georgia Tech game. He is an infielder of sufficient ability to have attracted baseball scouts while playing independent and sandlot baseball. However, Dee decided to concentrate on basketball at Notre Dame and forsook the other sports.
Johnny’s best scoring games during the past season were against Chanute Field when he hit for 10; the second Purdue contest in which he scored 11 points; and the second Northwestern game in which he scored five field goals for 10 points. His best games, however, were not necessarily ones in which he scored points, for Dee’s speed and fight seemed to be a spur to the Irish attack.
FRANK P. GILHOOLEY
The old adage of “like father, like son,” could never ‘be applied more correctly than to Frank Gilhooley, guard on the
1945-46 highly successful Notre Dame basketball team, and his father, Frank Gilhooley, Sr., former outstanding baseball player in both the major and minor leagues.
Frank, Sr., saw major league service as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals, New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox between 1912 and 1920. He was an outstanding center fielder and was one of the speediest men in the league. The former star is now employed in the County Treasurer’s office in Toledo, 0., where he makes his home.
Frank, Jr., who earned his second basketball monogram at Notre Dame as a member of the Irish quintet, was one of the most spirited men on the squad. His “pepper” and chatter while in the game became a feature on the Notre Dame team. Although only 6 feet tall, “Gill” weighs 180 pounds and is a stalwart in grabbing rebounds under both baskets.
28
And even while on the bench, after being relieved on the floor by George Ratterman of Cincinnati, 0., or Ray Corley of Staten Island, N. Y., Frank continued to “play the game from the sideline.” His antics on the Irish bench, in which he cheers his mates on to victory, became a common sight to fans who attended Notre Dame games.
Off the basketball floor, Frank is one of the most popular men on the Notre Dame campus. A great wit, “Gil” has the pleasant personality that makes him a friend of everyone he meets. A senior in the College of Commerce at Notre Dame, Frank will graduate in January, 1947.
The Toledo, 0., youth hopes to follow in the footsteps of his father right into the baseball major leagues. A regular on the Irish nine for the past two years, Frank is tagged as one of the best outfielders in college ball. He is a speedy fielder and a great “ball hawk,” and although not a long distance hitter, he batted well above the .300 mark during each of the last two seasons.
As captain of the 1945 Notre Dame baseball team, Frank displayed enough talent to attract the attention of several major league scouts. He is preparing himself to enter business after graduation, but has high hopes of playing professional baseball before inaugurating his business career.
RAYMOND C. CORLEY
The youngster of the 1945-46 Notre Dame basketball team was freshman Ray Corley, who was the only first-year man to win a monogram. Corley saw action in 18 of the 21 games, usually as a reserve guard. He was a very steady, dependable player and an excellent floor man. He did not score much but did show a peculiar overhead shot that more often than not found its way into the basket.
Ray came to Notre Dame from Staten Island, New York, where he earned two monograms in basketball and three in
football while performing for St. Peter's High School in Staten Island. A fast, shifty lad with a good shooting eye, Corley was named on the All-City basketball team in his senior year. He was captain of his freshman, junior varsity, and varsity squads.
Much credit is due Corley. He became the “seventh regular” on one of Notre Dame’s best basketball teams, playing with all experienced men while only a freshman. He displayed the coolness essential in the clutch of a hotly-contested game, and this asset was one of the main factors contributing to his first-year success.
Corley’s greatest exhibition came in the thriling DePaul game played in the fieldhouse. In the midst of this exceptionally torrid battle, Corley not only played a smooth game but also tossed in the basket late in the second half that touched off the Notre Dame rally that eventually won the game.
Having passed his physical exam, Corley is headed for the Army so may not be available for the 1946-47 season. He recently turned 18. Ray is 5' 11" tall and weighs 160.
SALUTE THEM---
The Reserves
While seven men carried the brunt of the season’s load for Coach Elmer Ripley’s 1945-46 Notre Dame basketball squad, the remaining team members cannot be casually bypassed. At the close of the rugged schedule, Ripley stated that he wished he had been able to use his reserves more because he had a wealth of outstanding material stored away on the Irish bench during the season.
Of those who did not win monograms, Joe Sobek, Dick Kluck, John Goonen, Goerge Riley, and Tom O’Keefe saw the most action. Sobek, discharged from the Army Air Corps last June, is the third member of the Sobek family to play for Notre Dame. George, the eldest, was a regular during the 1939-40 and 1940-41 seasons, while Andy was a squad member last year. Joe showed plenty of scoring ability in his short appearance during this past season and promises to be a steady performer- next year.
Dick Kluck, a 6' 2" defensive specialist, hails from Chicago where he was captain of the all-city champions at St. Philip high. Johnny Goonen was a prep star at Seton Hall and now lives in Lafayette, Ind. He was recently discharged from the Coast Guard. George Riley, 6' 8" center, was a regular with Decatur high, 1945 state champions of Illinois. He averaged better than 20 points with the Decatur team last year. Riley should develop into a great center and his experience this season has helped him-in reaching the goal. Tom O’Keefe is a Jersey City freshman who should also become a stellar courtsman with a little more experience.
The names of Gatens, Hinger, Hohnhorst, Mirrington, Mullen, Murphy, Wassmer, and Whalen were probably never given notice during the season except for listing on thb programs but these boys formed an integral part of the 1945-46 quintet. While they saw nd action during the campaign, they drilled conscientiously throughout the year and aided not only in the development of the regulars but also themselves.

Jim Costin says:
Faster Basketball Sends N. D. Scoring Records Spiraling Upward
SCORING RECORDS
You get a good idea of how the tempo of basketball has increased since the center jump was used to start play after each field goal or free throw. The Notre Dame figures are revealing in that respect. In Ed Krause’s playing days he set three Notre Dame scoring records by counting 547 points in three years, 212 in one year and 23 in one game. Then Johnny Moir came along, the center jump was eliminated, and look what happened to Ed’s three records. Moir counted 550 points in two years to break Ed’s three-year mark of 547, and then added 230 more to put the new record total up to 780. Moir also got 290 points in one season and 25 in one game to break Krause’s other two marks. Krause was graduated in 1934 and Moir in 1938. and Johnny’s three new marks stood up until one of them was tied four years ago by Bobby Faught, who hit for 25 points against New York university in Madison Square garden.
Then along came Leo Klier two years ago to break Moir’s season’s record of 290 points by counting 293. Klier did not make the team in his sophomore year, getting only eight points in his few brief appearances with the varsity.

The ink was hardly dry on Klier’s entry in the record books until Vince Boryla showed up from East Chicago a year ago last fall. Only 17 at the time and in his first year of competition as a freshman, he shattered every Irish scoring record in the books.
POURING 'EM IN
Boryla, in his freshman year, set such a terrific pace that he wound up the season with a new university record of 322 for one year and he shot the single game mark up to 31 against Detroit in his final game, although he had previously topped the 25 of both Moir and Faught. Now Boryla has already seen his record of last year topped by Klier. By getting 26 points against Detroit Saturday Klier ran his season’s total up to 355 for a new all-time Notre Dame record. Klier would have had 10 or 12 more points than that for his season’s work, but the Iowa Pre-Flight game scheduled for the Notre Dame floor on Feb. 6 was called off by the navy team.
Klier’s three-year total is therefore 656, keeping in mind that he got only

eight in his sophomore year, and the other 648 as a junior and senior. That two-year total tops Krause’s old three-year total of 547, just as Moir also beat it in two years by getting 550.
ONE BEYOND REACH
There is one record that Boryla. is practically certain to establish that will be so far and away that it will never be touched in future Notre Dame basketball. That is the total scoring mark for his varsity career. Because he was enabled to play as a freshman under the relaxed war time regulations, Boryla
will get in four years of competition to the three enjoyed by others, and if he keeps on going the next two years as he has in the last two he’ll wind up with an all-time total of something like 1,300 points to beat Moir’s present record by more than 500 points. However, Boryla won’t need that fourth year of competition to set the new record. Boryla scored 643 points for his freshman-sophomore playing career and if he gets only about 150 next year he’ll own the new record. Maintained for four years that average would give Boryla 1,300. Of course, some phenom might come along in the future who will be able to average better than 400 points a year—which would be more than 20 a game—to beat Vince’s four-year mark of 1,300, but it would be a rather risky betting proposition. However, Ed Krause, who will

Finals of Bengal Bouts Scheduled
for May 9; K. of C. Promote Fights
FITE FACTS
Contestants are to report between the hours of 3 to 5 to the Boxing room beneath the north Stand of the Field-
The 15th Annual University BoxingChampionships known popularly about the campus as “The Bengal Bouts” will be decided May 9th in the University Fieldhouse. The Bengals, a charity affair the proceeds of which go to the
Bengal Missions in India, are being-sponsored this year by the Knights of Columbus at the request of the Scholastic, which promoted the Bouts in recent years.
The Bengal Bouts, a traditional activity at Notre Dame, goes into its 15th year with a colorful background featuring heated competition on the part of hundreds of men who have helped to make this show a growing success. Started in 1930 by the Student Council, the bouts were taken over in 1932 by the Scholastic, and have been the outstanding intramural event each year since that time.
All students enrolled in the University are eligible to enter. Classifications in eight weight divisions from 120 pounds to heavyweights even competition. An average of seventy contestants has turned out each year to drill under the supervision of members of the staff of the physical education department, an average which this year should be increased by the enlarged student enrollment. Of the men participating in the 1945 bouts, eight civilians fought their way to the finals followed closely by six members of the NROTC and six members of the V-12 unit.
Some of the 'outstanding personalities of the pugilistic world have made appearance in the Notre Dame ring in the past. Max Marek, one of the few men ever to beat Joe Louis and a former Notre Dame man, refereed the Bengals
many years ago. Barney Ross made two appearances in that capacity, first in the early 30’s and again in 1944 shortly after his discharge from the Marines. Others have been Jack Elder, former chairman of the Illinois State Boxing Commission and alumnus of Notre Dame; Billy Conn, the number one contender for the heavyweight crown; Arthur Donovan, well known referee in fight circles; Danno O’Mahoney, one time world’s wrestling champion; and Elmer Layden, former coach of the Fighting Irish and former commissioner of the National Professional Football league.
The Bengals will take over the Field house for a five night stand, with the Preliminaries on April 29th, 30th and May 1st. The semi-finals will then be held on May 2nd and the Championship on May 9th.
The title aspirants will report for training Monday, March 25th in the boxing room beneath the north stands of the field house. Realizing some of the contenders may be slightly out of condition, it is advisable to report for training immediately so as to round into championship condition by May 9th.
house. Workouts will be held daily, Monday through Friday from 3 to 5.
Contestants must procure a slip certifying eligibility from Dr. McMeel at the Infirmary.
(Continued from page 30) resume his duties as head coach next year after having been gone for two years while serving as a lieutenant in the marine corps in the Pacific, reports that he’ll be able to stand the shock if some player comes along in the future who’ll get himself an average of 20 points a game.
Come to think of it, I wonder how many Ed himself would have made in his great three-year career as a Notre Dame player had he been playing under the present firewagon rules rather than under the old, slow, deadly dull regulations that kept him in the pivot spot to do his scoring while always closely-guarded by the other fellows’ biggest man. I think it is reasonable to assume that he would have doubled his 547 output, and that his one game and one season marks would have been such as to test the mettle of even a Klier or a Boryla.

1946 Court Team Sets
Attendance Records
The 1945-46 Notre Dame basketball team, after concluding its season against the University of Detroit in the Motor City March 2, had played to approximately 185,000 persons—the largest total attendance in the history of basketball at Notre Dame.
Attendance figures show that the outstanding Irish quintet, winner of 17 games in 21 starts, played before a total of approximately 170,000 persons in its first 20 games. A crowd of 15,000 witnessed the Detroit game in the Olympia Stadium, swelling the season total to approximately 185,000.
Home attendance, at Notre Dame basketball games took a definite upswing during the 1945-46 campaign, with 36,000 fans witnessing nine home games. This figure compares to a total of 13,582 fans who attended nine home games during the 1944-45 season. Twelve games played away from Notre Dame during the current season were attended by approximately 149,000 fans, compared to approximately 114,400 who attended 11 road games the Irish played during the 1944-45 season.
Largest crowd of the current season was on February 23 in the Chicago Stadium when 22,622 fans witnessed the Notre Dame-DePaul and Ohio State-Northwestern double-header. This was announced as the largest crowd ever to watch a college basketball game. The Irish also participated in two other double-header programs at the Chicago Stadium, each of which drew more than 18,000 fans, and one in Madison Square Garden which surpassed the 18,000 mark.
All-American Klier
to Play in New York
The first annual East-West charity basketball game, sponsored by the New York “Herald-Telegram,” will be held in the Madison Square Garden, March 30. This game is the court sequel of the East-West football game staged in San Francisco each New Year’s Day.
Leo Klier will represent Notre Dame on the ten man West all-star squad coached, by Harold Olsen of Ohio State. This is a fitting climax to the collegiate career of Klier. Among his western teammates will be Lawson of Purdue, Shrider of Ohio State, Mikan of DePaul, Kurland of Oklahoma A. & M., and Morris of Northwestern.
Klier hopes to be able to leave for New York about the 26th of March. The team will form and drill in New York for a few days prior to the game.

At Ann Arbor on March 2, Notre Dame finished second to Michigan in a triangular meet. Michigan State was third. Bill Leonard won the mile in the best race of the evening in 4:21.7.

THE FINAL TRIBUTE
For the last time we salute the 1945-46 Notre Dame basketball team—one of the greatest ever to represent this institution. Since early December, 1945, we have heaped words of praise upon the Fighting Irish, all said with sincerity and truth, backed by the play of the team. The boys had a lot to live up to from the outset. With last year’s five regulars back plus Leo Klier, 1943 star, Notre Dame was conceded top honors right off the bat. On paper the Irish were expected to win all of their games. On the floor they almost did. After winning 13 straight games, the pressure became too intense and four defeats in as many week-ends followed. But the final record of 17 wins against 4 losses ranks Notre Dame among the top quintets in the nation.
No matter how good the team appeared on paper, they could not have been expected to win all of their games. Basketball is not that kind of a sport. Any team can have a “hot” night against the best in the country and walk off the floor with a so-called upset victory. The Northwestern defeat was fair and square. The Wildcats won in the same fashion that Notre Dame had defeated others. New York University earned their victory as did DePaul. Marquette should never have beaten Notre Dame, but they did because that’s the way basketball goes.
The season is over and the records permanently in the books. Notre Dame is justly proud of Elmer Ripley and his 1945-46 basketball team. It was a great one to watch, win or lose. Elmer Ripley has gone, and Leo Klier, Billy Hassett, and Frank Gilhooley have played their last basketball for Notre Dame. Leo leaves behind him one of the most brilliant basketball records in Irish history. Billy Hassett, who with Klier won All-American honors twice while with the Irish, leaves an unequalled record as a team player and leader. Billy played every game as hard as he knew how and played with his heart as well as his body. Frank Gilhooley was always a reliable man, a fighter all the way. As a group, the team has engraved its record into Notre Dame athletic history*—a. record of Fighting Irish at their best.
RING IN THE OLD
Cast away that phrase, “Ring out the old,” and make it read, “Ring in the old.” The former Notre Dame athletic stars are returning to the campus or declaring their intentions to return in a steady flow. Football players who have returned or expect to do so in time for the 1946 season and Army, are Bob Kelly, halfback 1942-43; Johnny Lujack, quarterback 1943; Bob McBride, center and guard 1941-42; Luke Higgins, tackle 1942; Gerry Cowhig, fullback 1942; Jim Mello, fullback 1942-43; Zygismont Czarobski, tackle 1942-43; Fred Early, quarterback 1942-43; and John Perko, Joe Signaigo, and Gasper Urban, guards 1943. Basketball players returned or on the way include Frank Curran, Bobby Faught, Ray Kuka, John Kelly, John Niemiera, Bill Davis, Buster Hiller, Johnny Lujack, and Carl Loyd. John Smith, outstanding hurdler in track, has returned to the fold. Smith was called into the Army three years ago before he had the opportunity to compete for the Irish. There will be others coming back. Add that list to the list of stars returning from last year's teams and it adds up to an impressive prospect for the coming year of Notre Dame athletics.

Track Team Captures Central Collegiate
Indoor Championship
Paced by Bill Leonard, Notre Dame recaptured the 19th annual Central Collegiate indoor track championship after a three year lapse. The Irish racked up 48 points to take the title March 9 in the Michigan State fieldhouse at East Lansing. • The host team was second with 32 points and Drake, the defending champion, was third with 28.
Notre Dame won the meet in 1943 before it was abandoned because of the war, and Drake won last year.
Leonard took first in the mile and 880-yard runs. Dick Young was another double winner in the 440- and 300-yard dashes, while Ed Taylor, Western Michigan, captured the high jump and low hurdles.
In addition to Leonard’s two wins, Bill Fleming won the 75-yard high hurdles and finished second in the 75-yard lows. The one-mile relay team took that event to account for Notre Dame’s

Prospects Bright for Successful Seasons in Outdoor Track, Baseball, Tennis, Golf
Prospects are bright for successful seasons in outdoor track, baseball, tennis and golf at the University of Notre Dame as Irish mentors prepare to start drills in the near future prior to the opening of competition.
Opening of the tennis schedule is set for April 29 against the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis. Schedules for the golf, baseball and outdoor track teams are expected to be announced shortly.
Elvin R. (Doc) Handy, coach of the Notre Dame track team, has guided his Irish cindermen to an outstanding indoor season. His team has won dual meets with Western Michigan and Wisconsin, a triangular affair with Marquette and Michigan State and the Central Collegiate Conference Championships. The Blue and Gold trackmen finished second to Michigan in the Michigan State Relays, and also wound up second to the powerful Wolverines in a triangular meet with Michigan State as the third team. The Purdue Relays at Lafayette, Ind., on March 23 and the
Chicago Relays in Chicago Stadium on March 30 remain on the Notre Dame indoor card.
With the advent of the outdoor campaign, the eyes of the nation’s track fans will continue to center on sophomore Bill Leonard, of Schenectady, N. Y., Notre Dame war hero miler. Leonard, who participated in the Battle of the Bulge, will be seeking to better his mark of 4:17.7 in the outdoor mile set while a freshman at Notre Dame during the 1943-44 season. Frazier Thompson, Philadelphia, Pa., Negro, also is in the national spotlight after running the 60-yard dash in 6.2 seconds against Wisconsin. Thompson is recovering from a pulled muscle in his right leg.
In baseball, Coach Clarence J. (Jake) Kline, who also is a professor of Mathematics at Notre Dame, hopes to uncover a pitcher or two when he issues a call for candidates next week. Coach Kline plans to open the Irish baseball season in mid-April.
In three departments, catching, outfield and shortstop, the Irish will boast
three of the top collegiate performers in their line-up. Tommy Sheehan, of New Haven, Conn., who has been approached by several major league scouts, recently was discharged from the Navy and is expected to be the No. 1 Notre Dame catcher during the 1946' season. Sheehan was rated one of the best collegiate catchers in the nation during the 1943 campaign. At shortstop will be Billy Hassett, of New York City, who was the regular Irish shortstop last season. Hassett, brother of Buddy Hassett of the New York Yankees, is a better than average hitter and is an excellent fielder. He also was AIl-America guard on the 1944-45 Notre Da-me basketball teams. Frank Gilhooley, of Toledo, Ohio, son of former major league star Frank “Flash” Gilhooley, will hold down one of the outfield posts for Notre Dame. Gilhooley, also a basketball monogram winner, is a great outfieder and a steady hitter. Frank is considered one of the best outfielders in collegiate ball today.
Rev. George Holderith, C.S.C., coach of the Notre Dame golf team, will be greeted by four returning monogram winners when he calls out his golfers to prepare for the 1946 season. The four returning monogram winners are: Thomas Kennedy of Rochester, Minn.,
35
captain-elect; Paul Porter of Beaumont, Texas; Arthur Mesher of Long Beach, Calif.; and Joseph Besenfelder of Spring Valley, Ill.
A returning war veteran, Dick Whiting, of Detroit, Mich., xvill round out a promising Notre Dame golf team. Whiting, who was called into the Army Air Corps in 1943 as a sophomore, was discharged last summer as a Captain. He is a veteran of more than 50 missions over Germany and survived a crash of his B-17 bomber after it was shot down on a raid over Cologne, Germany. Three of his crew members were killed in the crash, but Whiting escaped with flak wounds. Whiting won the Michigan junior tournament three times and also copped the Western Junior Open meet before entering service.
Meanwhile, Coach Walter Langford, Professor of Spanish at Notre Dame and coach of the Irish tennis team, will have three monogram winners around which to build his 1946 squad. The three are: George Ratterman, of Cincinnati, Ohio, Bill Tully of Bronxville, N. Y., and Olen Parks of Mishawaka, Ind.
Ratterman, who has won monograms in baseball, football, tennis and basketball, at Notre Dame, performed with the Irish netters last season, as did Tully. Parks was with the Notre Dame team in 1941 before entering the Army.

Over Illinois Tech
Bud Gartiser came home with three firsts in the Notre Dame-Illinois Tech meet in Chicago, March 15, to pace the Irish tracksters to an overwhelming 96 to 8 victory. Ace miler Bill Leonard trotted at a 4:21.1 clip to equal the fastest collegiate mile of the current season, a mark which Leonard himself holds.
Notre Dame swept the 60 yard high hurdles, 440 yard dash, 60 yard low hurdles, 880 yard run, and won the mile relay. Illinois Tech failed to take a single first place.
Gartiser won the 60 yard dash in :06.3 with Mike Scarpelli taking second. Bud also took first place in the 60 yard high and low hurdles. Bob Purcell, Ray Sab-ota, and Fred Jones slammed the 440, Purcell’s winning time being :50.8. Bill Tully won the 880 in 1:58 followed by Notre Dame teammate Bud Tracey and Fred Jones. Joe Pogue vaulted 12 feet to take the pole vault event and Bill Fleming won the high jump at six feet. Floyd Simmons took top honors in the shot put and Jack Hunter won the broad jump.
The Notre Dame mile relay team of Bergtold, Kenny, Sabota, and Purcell won over the Techmen, being clocked in 3:25.7

"LANDFALL." Navy Year Book, to be Published
The members of the Notre Dame NROTC, V-12 and V-5 units are in the midst of preparing the largest and finest yearbook that has been published by any group of its size. Not only will the volume be an acccount of the graduating class, their pictures and their activities, but it will also contain feature stories and pictorial accounts of the various feature stories and pictorial accounts of the various military units based at Notre Dame throughout the war.
The publication is aptly titled Landfall, a term used by old “salts” when land was sighted after a long voyage. After their long voyage, the men from Notre Dame will be securing their discharges or being commissioned, and although some of them will return, it will be in those good old “civvies” and not in the too-familiar “navy blue.”
Roy Arnholt is behind the driver’s seat on the project.
Livingston is the associate editor. Lieut. Commdr. M. A. Censale is the advisor. Anyone wishing a copy may secure one by contacting Ed Lund in Morrissey Hall. The cost of the volume is five dollars.

Father Irving
(Continued from page 20) the spirit of God’s almoner.
You have seen enough of life to know that it is not going to be all sunshine. No doubt there will be days in which you will meet disappointments, reversals, and trials. Some of you might be found worthy of the privilege of suffering persecution for justice sake. Probably there will be days in this journey which will test your strength as the storm and the battle test the ship at sea, and it may happen that in those times of stress you will have to stand alone. The strong man accepts these trials as a challenge, and in a spirit of faith he makes them the stepping-stones to greater achievement. Such a man conquers trials and is not conquered by them.
One more suggestion—too many of us lose much of the joy of living because our attitude towards others is wrong. We use faulty means in evaluating men. That man is unfortunate who instead of trying to see how much good he can see in another rather begins his acquaintance by seeing how many faults he can find in his neighbor. After all when God created us He gave us the capacity of loving and enjoying the good.
The man, who though he sees the faults in others, searches for the good, will enjoy wholesome living. On the other hand the person who looks for evil will find it, and the result will be that he will see a distorted world in which . everything is wrong except himself. He draws aivay from others and his love and sympathetic helpfulness do not go out to them. He lives a cramped and wizened existence. Surely he is in poor company.
You are leaving your college home. Those who remain at the old home will keep their interest in you, for you are of the family of Notre Dame. We will be glad to hear of your success, and it will give us joy to know that you are true to your principles, and that you are living the truth in justice and charity. Notre Dame’s wish to you can best be expressed in the words of Tobias’to his son, “may you have a good journey, and God be with you in your way, and his angel accompany you.”

THREE SHEETS TO THE WIND
BY JOHNNY WALKER
In sunny Italy there stands a beautiful tower called the leaning tower of Pisa. From atop this slanting structure Galileo made his law of gravity experiments. He could have very well experimented from atop St. Edward’s, which is leaning too.
The slant away from perpendicular will be even more marked if the current rumor that has ancient St. Ed’s fraught with worry is true. The termites are leaving! It was to be expected that the wily termites would soon discover that there was greener lumber in which to roam. Where will they go? Whom will they seek? Our guess is out across the quad to that abortive attempt at architecture in the circle, the White Cabana. We are afraid that the frail structure which we thought was the mid-semester exam for freshman architects and later was positively identified as a waiting room for the Notre Dame bus, will disappear very shortly under the advances of these seasoned termites who have digested the stout pine and oak of St. Ed’s for lo these many years. We fear that upon the departure of the termites there shall be nothing- to support St. Ed’s but wishful flunking.
But this former abode of Father Sorin’s minims is also the haven of other representatives of the insect and rodent circles—the red ants and the musical mice. Whatever good ants have done to edify sluggards in this world, the red ants of St. Ed’s have undone one hundred times over. Most self respecting ants go south for the winter. But the frigid blasts of winter just encourage them in their crimes. It matters not where an item that strikes the ants’ fancy is placed in a room. They are like the Post Office Department in that nothing shall stay them from the swift completion of their appointed rounds. If hungry enough, whole battalions of ants will come charging out of their lairs, subduing the students and making off with all that is edible. Tom McDonald of St. Ed’s tells of being trapped in his room by the ants who had man-uvered between him and the door. After a few minutes the ants relented their war of nerves and withdrew to reform their lines.
Tom also relates the tale of Diogenes, the musical mouse who comes forth
from the caverns in the wall to perch upon the radio and listen. No amount of yelling, broom waving or coercion will drive Diogenes away. If the music is not suitable, Diogenes will indicate his dislike by gnawing through a wire or two in the radio. Tom seems to think that Diogenes’ likes in music are split between Chopin and Spike Jones.
We think it is only fair to warn you Sophomores so snug and complacent within the dark recess of what has been called Consumption Hall that you must tread lightly upon the stairs. And we bid you be not afraid if articles move from place to place in the night. ’Tis the ants and nothing more.

S.S. Rockne Captain Presents Rosaries
Two rosaries and two crucifixes blessed by His Holiness, Pope Pius XII, were presented recently to prominent members of the New Jersey Chapter- of the Notre Dame Alumni Association and to Notre Dame University by Captain C. D. Kerr, master of the Liberty Ship, the S.S. Knute Rockne, named for the late Notre Dame football coach.
The rosaries were presented to the Hon. Joseph M. Byrne, Notre Dame ’16, of Newark, N.J., Commissioner of the Port of New York Authority and Rockne’s c^ssmate at Notre Dame. One crucifix was given to Thomas A. Farrell, Notre Dame, ’26, of West Orange, N.J., prominent business man, and the other to the University of Notre Dame.
The S. S. Rockne, operated by the Grace Line, was used in 1943 and 1944 to transport military supplies to the United Kingdom and Mediterranean theatres of war. For* the balance of the emergency it made many trips to the West Coast of South America and was instrumental in supplying thousands of tons of metals, ores, and other* strategic raw materials to the U.S. war machine.
On its most recent voyage, the Knute Rockne delivered a full load of coal from the United States to Italy. It was on this voyage that Captain Kerr had the privilege of a private audience with the Holy Father, at which the rosaries and crucifixes were blessed.

PERSONNEL OFFICE ASSISTS STUDENTS IN JOB PLACEMENT
When the office of Student Personnel was inaugurated in March 1945 three distinct departments were set up: Student Personal Records, Student Counseling and Placement Counseling.
The Personal Records division concerns itself with securing as complete a record as possible of the student, his High School scholastic training, listing preferences in subject matter studied, his extra curricular activities, his health record, his work experience, and his plans, if any, for the future.
Student Counseling goes on from this record endeavoring to ascertain if the student is reasonably sure of the vocation in life he intends to follow and if the course of studies he carries will fit him for that career in life. The Student Counselor will indicate certain alternatives when advisable and when it is evident} that the student has genuine doubts about his work in life the Student Counselor will advise the taking of recognized Standardized Examinations and tests which will aid in the proper choice of vocation. Final choice of vocation, however, is always left with the student and his parents.
The Placement Counselor has the task primarily of vocational counseling. This Office is not an Employment Bureau, though in a number of instances business firms offer specific openings. It is the aim of the Placement Counselor to develop as many Placement contacts as possible. This is done through correspondence with firms expressedly interested in Notre Dame graduates, and through personal interviews with firms’ representatives visiting the campus from time to time. A second means of Placement contact is through the Vocational Committees set up by the Notre Dame Alumni Clubs throughout the country. Established at the instigation of the Alumni Association Board of Directors, with the approval and encouragement of the Rev. J. Hugh O’Donnell, C.S.C., President of the University, and under the direction of Mr. William Dooley, assistant secretary of the Alumni Association, these Vocational Committees, aimed primarily for helping the returning veterans and the alumni, develop local opportunities and are in a position to offer constructive aid with regard to job contacts.
The Placement Counselor, basing his counsel on the general idea of career areas, as developed by the Student Counselor cooperating with the individual student, will attempt to channel those careers according to the students preferences and abilities and in line with occupational opportunities. The Placement Counselor does not make the job application for the student but will help him in the collection and assembly of material foi* the application, will suggest the letter outline, and will proof-read the letter* of application, if called upon to do so. Not only the method of ap

proach by letter to secure a personal interview but also the recognized procedure in an interview will be discussed with the student, but the letter must be drafted by the student himself and the interview must be handled alone. It is the hope that by this method the student will be taught to stand firmly on his own feet, will learn how to assemble pointedly and present convincingly the list of his capabilities, and thereby do a good job in salesmanship for himself. In this way, ultimately, the work of the Vocational Committees of the Notre Dame Alumni Clubs will be aided because the alumni who in later years will present themselves for Placement contacts will not be floundering in doubt and indecision but will have clear and cogent reasons for the work they seek, and will have at fingers’ tips their choices of jobs in the order of their own preference and ability.

To Honor War Dead on
Universal N.D. Night
The memory of more than 300 alumni and former students of the University of Notre Dame who died for their country in World War II will be honored at the twenty-third observance of Universal Notre Dame Night on Monday, April 29, by Notre Dame alumni clubs throughout the United States and in several foreign countries.
The date for this year’s observance was announced by the Rev. J. Hugh O’Donnell, C.S.C., President of Notre Dame. The observance will mark the first step in the revival of the world network of more than 100 Notre Dame alumni clubs, which are composed of more than 25,000 alumni and former students.
Theme of Universal Notre Dame Night this year, Father O’Donnell said, will be commemoration of Notre Dame’s participation in World War II. The nationwide observance will be dedicated not only to Notre Dame’s war dead, but also a co-dedication to leadership in religion and citizenship to perpetuate the peace, he added.
Tentative plans call for a national radio hookup which will be carried to members of individual clubs assembled at designated places for dinners and local programs based on the central theme of Universal Notre Dame Night. Father O’Donnell and other notables will broadcast to the clubs and Notre Dame men everywhere.
301 Former Students, Alumni Died in Action
The number of alumni and former students of the University of Notre Dame who died for then* country in World War II has reached 301, according to latest figures released by the Notre Dame Alumni Association.
The 300th Notre Dame man to die was Captain Charles O. Fisher, ’41, of Indianapolis, Ind. His death in action in Jugoslavia, where he went in August, 1944, on “a hazardous military mission” for the Office of Strategic Services, was confirmed recently by the War Department. Subsequently, Lieutenant Robert L. Hengel, ’42, of Pierre, S.D., was reported killed in action during a bombing mission over the Negros Islands in the Philippines on Nov. 1, 1944.
Twenty Notre Dame men are still on alumni reports as missing in action. According to unofficial Alumni figures, more than 1,200 other Notre Dame men were casualties, most of them being wounded. A total of 9,000 Notre Dame alumni and former students served in the Armed Forces of the United States during the war.

Brains were over-taxed and lights burned far into the night as the navy staff searched for a suitable title for this column that relates of the lighter side of the ROTC, V-12, and V-5 life. After ignoring such “out of this world”
possibilities as “Navy Gravy,” “RO’s Sorrow,” “Barry’s Boys,” and “Morrissey Moanings,” someone asked us why we weren’t continuing under the same heading. Thinking- over the question, we decided it had its merits—look at the work it saved us—and besides, as one wit remarked, “Nest is an appropriate place for the eggs you’ll lay.”

“Willie” Williams threatens to take over John “None” Smith’s distinctive title of being “the man who is most likely to foul himself up.” It was bad enough when “Willie” was given a lift to town by the Captain who found him waiting for a “bus” on the Dixie Highway a hundred yards from the nearest bus stop, but when he waved down the disciplinary officer’s car last Saturday night, he was really in trouble. But his remark as he opened the door is a classic: “Oh, pardon me sir, I thought this was a taxi.”
Local members of the C. B. N. D., Confirmed Bachelors of Notre Dame, will be amazed to hear of the marriage of “Honest” John Roth to one of the local South Bend beauties. John who
was a charter member of the group was also a navy man from way back as witnessed by his discharge rating of “galley slave 2yc.”
Don Allbright composed a poem to honor “Honest’.’ John’s entrance into the state of matrimony:
John had sworn to be a bachelor,
She had sworn to be a bride,
But I guess you know the answer— She had nature on her side.
RO’s are talking about:

Oscar Birdbrain, the ideal RO, (yes, he is still with us) is beating a path from his room high atop the tower of Morrissey (the radio reception is wonderful there—he can’t get Bob Whitcomb) to the Administration Building via the acc’t. department, trying to reach the same total successively. Right now he is concerned with the possibilities of getting transferable credit from Missouri Valley for his courses in Elementary Bird Call, and Introduction To Elementary Physical Culture. Oscar is the fellow who bought 22 drinks at a local bar because the sign said, “No one served under 21.”

Inter-American Action Group Competes in
Quiz Match at Toledo
The' Notre Dame Commission on InterAmerican Action (Inter-American Affairs Club and La Raza Club) is now operating like the athletic teams—during vacations. Tuesday, March 12, the Commission sent two teams to Mary Manse College, Toledo, to put on a demonstration Quiz Match as preparation for the National Congress to be held in Philadelphia, Pan-American Day, April 13 and 14. At that time the Chicago Area Commission will send a team of two students, one from Notre Dame and one from Mundelein College, to compete against a Detroit Region team, one student from Mary Manse College and one from Siena Heights College, Adrian, Michigan.
At the match in Toledo the InterAmerican Affairs Club was represented by Vincent Hogan and Jaime Velez, both of the Graduate School, while Oswaldo Arroyo and Temistocles Teran represented La Raza Club. The Referees were Frank Foss and Rolando Duarte. Score Keepers for the match were Patricia Sanders of Mary Manse College and Alfredo Espinosa of Notre Dame. Rev. W. F. Cunningham, C.S.C., Faculty Adviser of both Clubs, accompanied the students and he, with Rev. Raymond Gorman, Professor of Spanish at Mary Manse College, acted as Consultants.
A very pleasant feature of the occasion was the meeting of Temistocles Teran and Alfredo Espinosa with their sisters, Carmen and Mercedes, students at the College. They were joined by Oswaldo Arroyo and another student of the College in holding a reunion of Ecuadorians.
The Quiz Match was attended by both high school and college. There were also three representatives from Siena Heights College present as observers. The audience was both responsive and appreciative. It took a real part in the match by asking penetrating questions on Inter-American affairs of the members of both teams. La Raza Club won the match by a score of 23 to 17.

Fr. Ward Appointed Member of Atomic
Bomb Committee
Rev. Leo R. Ward, C.S.C., professor of Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame, has been appointed a member of the Atomic Bomb Committee established by the Atomic Associates, Inc., at the University of Chicago.
The Committee, composed of six scientists and six religious leaders, will be known as the Committee of Science, Religion and the Atomic Bomb. Chief work of the committee will be educational and stress will be laid on the idea that force or power cannot control the atomic bomb and that only law and a religious conscience may be expected to produce results that are truly human.
Father Ward was appointed a member of the committee at a recent meeting at the University of Chicago when the Atomic Associates, Inc., invited 35 religious leaders to discuss with them the social, moral and religious problems raised by the atomic bomb. Catholics, Protestants, and Jews were equally represented at the meeting.
The Notre Dame educator was a member of the faculty at the Universtiy from 1927 to 1931. In 1934 and 1935 he was abroad and studied at Oxford University in England, and in 1936 he studied at the University of Louvain in Belgium.
He is regarded as an authority on Scholastic Philosophy and has published three books on social philosophy: “The Philosophy of Values,” “Values and Reality,” and “God In An Irish Kitchen.”
