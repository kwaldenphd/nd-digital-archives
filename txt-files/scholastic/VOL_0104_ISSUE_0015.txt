HAIL TO THE DEAN! 
Today let us examine that much ma­ligned, widely misunderstood, grossly oYerworked, wholJy dedicated campus figure-the dean. 
The dean (from the Latin Deanere­to e).l)el) is not, as many think, primarily a disciplinary officer. He is a counselor and guide, a haven and refuge for the troubled student. The dean (from the Greek Deanos-to skewer) is character­ized chiefly by S.)'1Ilpathy, ·wisdom, pa­tience, forbearance, and a fondness for homely pleasures like community singing, farina, spelldowns, and :Marlboro Ciga­rettes. The dean (from the German Deangcmacht-to poop a party) is fond of l\Iatlboros for the same reason that all men of good will are fond of lfarlboros­
because l\Iarlboro is an hon­est cigarette. Those good l\farlboro tobaccos are honestly good, honestly aged to the peak of perfec­tion, honestly blended for the best of all possible flaY­ors. :Marlboro honestly comes in two different con­tainers-a soft pack which is honestly soft and a Flip­Top box which honestly flips. You too \\ill flip when next you try an honest l\Iarlboro, which, one hon­estly hopes, "ill be soon. 
But I digre.c;s. We were learning how a dean helps poor, troubled undergradu­ates. To illustrate. let us take a typical case from the files of Dean S ...... of the 
Uniyersity of Y ........ (Oh, why be so mysterious? The dean's name is Sigafoos and the UniYersity is Yutah.) 
Wise, kindly Dean Sigafoos was visited one day lw a freshman named Walter Aguincourt who came to ask permission to marry one Emma Blenheim, his dormi­tory laundress. To the dean the marriage seemed ill-ad,ised, for Walter was only 18 vears old and Emma was 91. W..'llter agreed with the dean, but said he felt ob­ligated to go through "ith it because Emma had inYested lier life savings in a transparent rainhood to protect her from the mist at Niagara Falls, where they planned to spend their honeymoon. If Walter called off the wedding, what use would the poor woman possibly have for

a rainhood in Yutah? The wise, kindly dean pondered briefly and came up with a brilliant answer: let Walter punch holes in the back of Emma's steam iron. With steam billowing back at the old lady, she would find a rainhood very useful­possibly eYen essential. 
Whimpering with gratitude, Walter kissed the dean's Phi Beta. Kappa key and hastened away to follow his advice­and the results, I am pleased to report, were madly successful. 
Today Emma is a happy woman­singing lustily, wearing her rainhood, eating soft-center chocolates, and ironing clothes ... t\\ice as happy, to be candid, than if she had married Walter ... And what of Walter? He is happy too. Freed 
\\Jert l~ rotc1 dryeYe 111 Yufc1lz 
from his unwanted liaison with Emma. he married a girl much nearer his own age­Agnes Yucca, 72. Walter is now the proud father-stepfather, to be perfectly ac­curate-of three fine, healthy boys from Agnes's first marriage-Everett, 38; Wil­helm, 43; and Irving, 55-and when Walter puts the boys on a lead and takes them for a stroll in the park on Sunday afternoon, you may be sure there is not a dry eye in Yutah. 
And Dean Sigafoos? He too is happy -happy to spend long, tiring hours in his little office, giving counsel without stint and "ithout complaint, doing his bit to set the young, uncertain feet of his 
charges  on  the path to  a  brighter to­

Church-Related Schools 
The fallowing editorial recently appeared in The New Republic. 
L~ HIS February 16 Washington Report, TRB 

argued that state aid to church schools would be 
unconstitutional. The editors have for some time dis­
agreed, and it is perhaps useful to repeat the reasons 
why. 
Those who attend church schools already receive various forms of public aid: free school lunches, transportation, science and foreign language labora­tories. Perhaps most important, church schools are given tax exemptions both on property they own and on contributions they receive. Strict constn1ctionists feel that such concessions are contrary to the First Amendment -that in some sense they contribute to "an establishment of religion." But where does this severe view lead? Are we to say, for example, that stationing traffic policemen outside parochial schools in the morning is unconstitutional because it indirectly contributes to the appeal of the school? Or that a town cannot allow cars to park on streets near churches on Sunday since this frees the church from constructing a parking lot and leaves more money for proselytizing? Once one is committed to opposing indirect subsidies there is no end of things to abolish. 
A more serviceable approach is that the state should legislate for purely secular ends, but that it should not worry if this incidentally helps a church. 
What does this mean when applied to education? The state has an interest in ensuring that all pupils, whether publicly or privately educated, have a mas­tery of certain subjects, from the three R's to history and chemistry. The state can and should pursue this interest by subsidizing instruction in these subjects. So long as the student is mastering them it makes no difference to the state whether his instructors are Jesuits or agnostics, whether his classroom is owned by the Lutherans or the local school board. 
"But," the strict-constructionists argue, "there are no secular subjects in church schools. Every subject, from physics to literature, has a religious significance." That is true, in varying degrees. It is also true that there is a personal element (some call it "bias") in all teaching. Interpretation and be­lief are intrinsic to any instruction. To some extent, all teaching is "slanted." Whether this is good or bad in the case of any given school or teacher de­pends on one's private preferences. 
We cannot emphasize too strongly, however, that the case for public support of private schools depends upon public control over those activities it supports. Negatively, the state cannot and should not subsidize

EDITORIALS 

religious worship. Positively, if the public pays for 
a physics lab, then the public must have the right to 
say how that lab is used -what the textbooks say, 
what the teacher's credentials are, and so forth. If 
the public provides low interest loans to reduce the 
cost of constructing a history classroom, then the 
public, not the churches, must determine what ver­
sion of history the pupils shall be taught. In practice, 
such control would probably be very loose -just 
as state control over what local school boards teach 
is often very loose. What matters is not that every 
last concession to religious feeling be removed from 
every syllabus, but that the recipients of public aid 
accept the public's right to say how it is to be used. 
Churches which are unwilling to accept this principle, 
believing that their independence would be grievously 
compromised, would in effect be saying that there are 
no educational standards which can be agreed to by 
all; that no public interference with subject matter 
can be tolerated; that tn1e education must be "Cath­
olic education" or "Jewish education" or "Lutheran 
education." Schools which feel this way may be right, 
but they have no claim on the public purse. 
A final point. Some who object to any further 
aid to church-related schools do so less for reasons 
of legality than because they believe the public 
school system is a unifying force in a pluralistic 
society, and that nothing should be done which weak­
ens that system. But would the public schools be 
hurt if more children were in Catholic or Anglican 
or Lutheran schools? Wouldn't smaller enrollments 
be better for the public schools? Likewise, would it 
hurt the public schools if the present state-church 
impasse were resolved so that more federal money 
became available to both systems? 
The national interest is in better education for all 
children, regardless of race, creed, or parental in­
come. Nobody needs to send his child to a private 
school; but millions do. No useful purpose is served 
if these children grow up knowing less history or 
less chemistry than children who attend public school. 
Ignorance, not the Catholic hierarchy, is the enemy. 
KENNEDY'S POSITION is, perhaps, not a tenable one; there is fast developing among American legal scholars the position that such aid is not unconstitu­tional. Perhaps the real motive behind Kennedy's position is a political one; he wants to be re-elected and he quite possibly would not be if he were to favor aid to Catholic schools. And we are not going to challenge the political judgement of the greatest American-politician since Franklin Roosevelt. If any­one knows the mood of the American people, it is Kennedy. 
Catholics could benefit by Kennedy's political judgement by not pressing the issue of aid to Catho­lic schools at this time. The American people do not favor it, and to press the issue would simply inspire prejudice and hatred to arise. Make no mistake about 
it, there still exists in America a tension b~tween 
Catholics and Protestants. To press the issue of aid 
to Catholic schools could well push these relations to 
the breaking point. 
This New Republic editorial represents quite a 
switch in editorial policy for that magazine. On 
February 15, for instance, TRB, NR's \Vashington 
correspondent, had ,vritten: "The uses of religion 
have always puzzled us. . . In central America where 
the world's birth rate is extraordinarily high, religion 
forbids birth control, while here in America it means 
that the federal government can't aid the schools. 
\iVe mull it over and we find no ans,ver. It is all done 
in the name of religion, and generally in the name 
of Christianity. What would Jesus make of this we 
sometimes think?" 
At this time, on the issue of aid to Catholic 
schools, we must place ourselves more on the side 
of TRB and President Kennedy than on the side of 
the Catholic hierarchy and the New Republic editors. 
President Kennedy's position is, of course, that aid 
to the Catholic schools is unconstitutional. 

Students and Policy 
To EXPLORE SATISFACTORILY the problems touched upon in our editorial of Feb. 22 and the reply last week by George N. Shuster, requires an appreciation of the merits of criticism. The furor these editorials precipitated indicates how severe the dichotomy be­tween the clerical and lay forces has become. Yet if Notre Dame is to emerge as center of Catholic edu­cation the antagonists must come to a common un­derstanding of the University's goals as well as the most appropriate means to these ends. That a re­joinder rather than a reprisal appeared is an indica­tion of a willingness to open the usually closed chan­nels of communication. · 

Dr. Shuster quite correctly stated that Fr. Hes­burgh could not carry out his function as the sym­bolic leader of Notre Dame's surge to pre-eminence unless he had the power of the presidency behind him. He then added, "But one must not try to make it an impossible task by suggesting that the presi­dent stay home and decide that lights should go out in Freshman halls at twelve o'clock. Surely the reason why deans exist is to cope with that kind of problem." However, this comprehensive, albeit near impossible, control is precisely what we attempted to demonstrate; there are no deans who are em­powered to make decisions on Freshman lights, much less on major academic policy. The president has chosen to reserve such power to himself, even though one man cannot conceivably perform such yeoman duty. Notre Dame might well become just another 
third rate university without Fr. Hesburgh's direc­
tion, but we are rapidly reaching that point in the 
institution's development beyond which it cannot 
advance without some secondary authorities capable 
of making domestic policy decisions. 
What was overlooked in our editorial was a plea for a change in attitude within the Congregation of Holy Cross itself, at least among those of Notre Dame. We did not demand the removal of all priest­administrators from the campus; we do desire a clear line of demarcation between their roles as priests and their roles as administrators. The two roles are not incompatible as long as religion is not equated with discipline, as long as religious authority is not used to justify unlimited control of the acadeP-Iic and social realms. Both conditions now prevail -to the detriment of the spiritual, academic, and social at­mosphere. When we are told, in effect, by priests that "this is O'ltr University/' we cannot avoid the direct implication that students and lay faculty have no right to a substantial share in the direction and shaping of Notre Dame. 
What must be projected is the necessary spirit of f'USion of efjorts by students, lay professors, clergy, and administrators, if we are to effectively and sub­stantially achieve the goals we all share. Perhaps it is easy to forget that a great university must be built on the contribution of outstanding students and proficient and dedicated professors, not solely on the financial contributions of alumni and the Ford Foundation. But this must be overcome. Unless all feel a part of this movement, unless due considera­tion is given to the interests and priorities of stu­dents and faculty, then this fusion will never be forthcoming! It cannot and it will not. No amount of Hesburghian dynamism, alone, will make Notre Dame a Catholic Harvard. 
Dr. Shuster asked students "to wait a while"; all things come in due time. But questions have been asked -why is the University scholarship program virtually nonexistent? Why do professors call the academic council a "sham"? Why are students treated as children to be shielded from all possible error? ­and no answers given! Without answers, without in­timations of changing attitudes, without communi­cation and a common trust grounded in practice, a joint effort is impossible. 
The solution is not revolution, but reform. The students must begin to see their education as more than a vocational preparation for the business world; the faculty must show a willingness to assume re­sponsibility in the formation of academic policy 
(heretofore it has been as docile as the Student Senate) ; the administration must encourage under• graduate development by recruiting better students through extensive scholarship programs and by al­leviating the hovering attitude it projects to the stu­dents. All the human components of the Universit~­demand improvement; only by striving together ir discussion and in action can many of our commor difficulties be resolved. 

A New Look at Ecumenism 
ECUMENICAL CONCERN and the need to relate re­ligion to social and public affairs prompted Cmss C'll,rrents, a leading Catholic quarterly, to col­laborate with the National Council of Christians and Jews in presenting a series of papers on "Religious Freedom in America." Monsignor John Tracy Ellis, Dr. Frederick Littell, and Rabbi Bertram Korn held a joint seminar to discuss the changed meanings of this problem in the light of their respective religions. Though each demonstrated that misunderstandings remain, as a unit they stressed their hope for the growth of the synergistic spirit of ecumenism. All hope that the generosity of this spirit would become the basis for a revived, and united, public support of religious liberty. 
Msgr. Ellis' basis tenet was that the most serious threat to religious liberty comes not from any reli­gious group but from "the gradual but steady dis­integration of the moral sense of the people." Be­hind this tenet lies the rationale that the "Catho­lic ideology reflects the American milieu, even if a certain element among the non-Catholic community have reservations on this score." The problem is pub­lic order, and, as de Tocqueville said, "the best laws cannot make a constitution work in spite of morals; morals can turn the worst laws to advantage." The necessary conclusion that all must draw, Msgr. Ellis emphasized, is that the major religions must uphold each other "in support of religious values," confront­ing in unison the "secularist" advance. 
From the Protestant viewpoint, Dr. Littell ex­amined the difficulties within Protestantism rather than the problems with secularism outside religion. His concern was for internal renewal, something that had been a presupposition for Msgr. Ellis. Dr. Littell traced the historical causes for the lower quality of membership that statistical success has meant for Protestantism, and shunned racism: "to identify Christianity with racism is blasphemy." He dismissed the Protestant worries that Catholism is a danger to religious liberty, and proclaimed that "religious indifference is the most dangerous stance of all." One further point that Dr. Littell made that applies to all religious faiths is "the failure of Protestantism to meet the challenge of metropolis." To meet "the challenge to create an urban civilization," the ghetto mentalities of Protestant, Jew, and Catholic alike must be abandoned. Dr. Littell's belief is that the "public concensus" can only be strengthened through free, informed discussion of public issues among the major religious faiths. 
The Jewish perspective raised other problems. Rabbi Korn admitted that Roman Catholics have suffered far more religious hostility in America but claimed that the legal status of Judaism was "prob­ably a more accurate index of religious freedom than any other." More importantly, Rabbi Korn points to "the contrast between the views of the 'secularists,. and the religionists," always with a view to demon­strating that the progress toward religious freedom has been achieved mainly through the efforts of non­religious elements -"barbarians" to Msgr. Ellis and "infidelists" to Dr. Littell. "Jews do not believe that it is unrealistic or impractical for Americans to hope," that the time may soon come when "secu­larist" laymen are not the sole champions of re1i­gious liberty for all creeds." Rabbi Korn echoed the thoughts of Msgr. Ellis and Dr. Littell with his desire that the organized religious groups themselves "start together in public to defend each other's equality." 
The varying approaches to the common problem of religious liberty seem indicative of difficulties only partially resolved, especially for Catholics. Msgr. Ellis and Rabbi Korn were more introspective and propagandistic in their stress on the efforts of ·their own religions to defend religious liberty. Of the two,. Msgr. Ellis, farsighted among Catholic thinkers, was obviously still closely tied to the defensive· stance of the ghetto; not only did he ignore the problems in­herent in Catholicism but he demanded the united efforts of religion for an attack on an "enemy" secu­larism. Rabbi Korn accepted the "secularists" as friends of freedom, but remained rooted in the belief that Jews had done enough for religious unity; he was merely calling Christians to unite with Jews in this effort. Dr. Littell's self-analysis of Protestant defects, in our opinion, best demonstrated the humble spirit of ecumenism; he stressed the need for Jove, constantly reaffirmed in individual hearts, as the strength of religious aspirations. 
Msgr. Ellis' emphasis on unity in preparation for conflict with secular culture is evidence that Catholic doubts about the power of apostolic love still linger. It indicates that Catholics have a long, and difficult, path to follow towards a mature Christian charity.

ST. MARY'S SPEAKS 

Dear Editor: 
The attitude towards Saint Mary's in Mr. WyTsch's two articles was partly gratifying. It showed an in­terest in Saint Mary's that wasn't always apparent before, especially in his desire for integration. It was a new thing to some of us not to be considered part of that "unspeakably bad girls' school across the road that no self-respecting Notre Dame man would ever take notice of." VVe're glad of your interest. 
But it seems that the criticism was, aside from being far too general and really incorrect in part, an unbal­anced project as well. 
In the first article many of the points were correct. True, most of us don't know about a lot in the world; and also true that to a great extent we don't really care. Any Saint lVIary's girl would let herself be martyred before she would admit she didn't care; but the fact is, if we did, we would know. Vle would like to be involved; we "just don't have time." But a generalization is bad; though it is not true of every stu­dent, nevertheless, it types every one. 
So true, too, about our publications. Cru.?J almost died a week or so ago. It's partly the fault of the students, but there might be more support if our publications were freed from the oppressive shadow of our publicity­conscious administration. Crux is often not interesting enough to read, because the "hot" issues aren't al­lowed to be printed. There is not one student here, I think, who approves this state of affairs. 
And you must see~ you did admit that we are trying to ;emedy things'. But women weren't made for revolu­tions. We're doing it our way, the best we can. 
But the main problem is the im­balance: the articles show only one side of a total situation. Saint Mary's is not an outstandingly bad institu-

tion. Many of our girls' -school prob­lems are found in other girls' schools; many of our Catholic-school problems are found at Notre Dame. Singling us out like this, though it does help us a little bit, blackens us unfairly. And if one of the great problems is the relationship between the two schools, what about Notre Dame's faults? Is the Notre Dame "hero" such a perfect man? 
Saint Mary's could never attempt an evaluation of Notre Dame. What girl would be presumptuous enough to say she knew Notre Dame and the Notre Dame man, even after weeks of talk? That's where your bigness counts for you. But even for one of you, on the inside, the task would be too great. Yet if the criticism stays here, people will forget the whole truth. Saint Mary's isn't the root of all the local evils. I move for more evaluation on your side; tlzen we can work towards something together. You know your problems -or maybe you don't! It's easier to examine an­other institution than your own, and you don't even seem to quite under­stand ours.

HAPPINESS IS AN UNSOLICITED TESTIMONIAL 

Dear Editor: 
Now that lVIcPhee has emptied his mind all over the cover of the SCHO­LASTIC, now that a Jim '\Vyrsch fan club has been established, now that there is an underground movement loose to keep McCabe and Ahern around next year and now that Saint Mary's is aware of her image, I as­sure you that three-fourths of her students are considering re-creating the image complete with velvet glove and cigarette holder, world-worn out­looks and sex-preoccupied minds to meet the frustrations of her hero colony. I further assure you that they will give good and faithful service for four years and be discarded in favor of the innocent gingham "girl back home." 
-St. Mary's College 

(Two answers to this further evi­dence of kindness. Tlze covered irony of IVIcPhee was only that., and if an insult to anybody, the same to every­body. His empty niind suspects a touch upon a tender spot with a not­too-tender yawp from the local tender gender. As for re-creating the image (?) with glove, holder, outlooks and sex, we hope, of course, that you can pull it off.) WM 

MORE THAN A SUGGESTION 

Dear Editor: Just a few words from a last semes­ter Senior -in the past few years, 
the administration has come to re­spect more and more the intelligence, maturity, ana right to independence of the N.D. student. I believe that the next step should be to make it pos­sible for the student to have a more satisfactory social life at N.D., which is much more important to most stu­dents than the clerical administra­tion would like to admit. Look at what the student has to buck before embarking on a date -even suppos­ing he has a girl to take out, he has to go through the sad affair of show­ing his girl the "town" in one of those scarce cabs. The car situation on dance week ends is particularly appalling. 
To get to the point, why not let off­campus Juniors and Seniors have cars? In that way, most on-campus students would know somebody off campus to double with. I think this would go a long way toward better­ing relations with St. Marys. Their new social room indicates their in­terest in this direction. And, if you look into the matter, you'll discover that there are a good number of sharp girls over there who aren't going out -believe it or not. 
-Jim Schilling 
L'ART EST DIFFICILE 

Dear Editor: 
Wbile I wish to thank Messrs. Walsh and Cuvelier for enriching our appreciation of foreign culture by in­troducing us to still another French maxim, I cannot allow their super­ficial, trite, and meaningless "open letter" to go unchallenged. 
Perhaps this pair would care to clarify some rather anomalous phrase­ology: just what does it mean for one to be "too understanding" ? If their "open letter" offers any indication of their own level of understanding (at least of the Editorial) then I am sure no such clarification will be forth­coming. 
These "mature students" (whatever that means!) may disagree with, or reject, the views expressed in the Editorial, but to reject is one matter. to refute quite another; "La critique est aisee mais l'art est difficile." It hardly suffices as counter-argument merely to string together contradic­tory assertions. 
And finally, with regard to the old problem of the few and the many. their claim of majority backing would seem to indicate that they are privy to some esoteric statistics con~ cerning the Administration's popu­larity. If they have conducted some poll, I hope they have not failed tc· consider the absentee ballots of cer• tain recently departed professors.

Result: "Cushion Recoil" provides a 
dramatically smoother ride 


in 1963 Ford-built cars 
The challenge given Ford engineers was to design suspensions that would permit wheels virtually to roll with the punches-not only in a vertical plane but fore-and-aft as well. Conventional suspension systems provide only a partial solution to road shocks by limiting wheel recoil to an up-and-down motion. 
The solution? Exclusive Cushion Recoil suspension design in all Ford-built cars for '63! Cushion Recoil, with cushioning action in a fore-and-aft plane as well as vertical, smothers the jars and jolts of rough roads, adds to your comfort, safety, and driving pleasure. Even the thump of freeway tar strips is reduced, and on deeply rutted roads you experience better control of the car. Furthermore, your Ford-built car is spared the wear and tear of road-induced vibration. 
Another assignment completed-one more example of engineer­ing excellence at Ford and new ideas for the American Road.

This pen can save you money on cartridges. Parker Super Quink cartridges are BIGGER and last longer (each is good for 8 or 9 thousand words). But, even if you didn't save a dime, this pen would be worth the extra price. It's a Parker. 
And only Parker gives you a solid 14K gold point tipped with plathenium-one of the hardest, smoothest alloys ever developed. It should last you for years no matter how much you use it. 
The pen won't leak the way cheap ones do. It has a built-in safety reservoir, and meets most of the tough specifications we set for our $10 pens. 
~If you have trouble saying it, say it with a Parker. 
If you're a little shy and have difficulty saying "I love you" or even "I like you very much"-say it with a Parker. 
The new Parker Arrow makes a beautifully ex­pressive gift and looks as if you paid a small fortune for it. 
The new Parker Arrow comes in black, dark blue, light blue, light gray, and bright red, with a choice of four instantly replaceable solid 14K gold points. Includes five free Super Quink cartridges with pen-protecting Solv-X (49¢ value).

• Much student comment has been raised recently concerning the The­ology Department, highlighted by criticism of the recent registration fiasco. The questions of the capabili­ties of various teachers, the relevancy of the course matter, and the attitude of the department in matters of liber­alism in religious matters have all come up for discussion. 
In a recent interview, the Rev. Robert Pelton, head of the depart­ment, strongly defended the depart­ment in the registration difficulties. "Nobody feels worse about the regis­tration mix-up than the members of the Theology Department." Yet he does not accept exclusive blame for the difficulties. Rather, the falsifica­tion of advanced registration permits, the sale of class cards, and the change into theology of many students origi­nally slated to take philosophy were considered by Fr. Pelton to be the main culprits. In addition, Deans of two colleges failed to submit to the department the number of students intending to take theology. 
To correct these problems, and to guard against their future recurrence, a meeting between the Theology De­partment and the Deans of the vari­ous colleges is slated for the near future. At this meeting, new proce­dures will be worked out to assure an accurate accounting of students and a reasonable arrangement of schedules. 
The question of teaching qualifica­tion seems to be satisfactorily an­swered by the fact that 70% of the undergraduate instructors have doc­torates in theology while the remain­ing 30% have at least attained their master's degrees. A student evalua-

tion of new theology teachers has also been introduced, in which pertinent questions are asked of the student concerning teachers, under the cloak of complete anonymity. 
Yet the question of the relative im­balance of the number of students in the various theology classes still re­mains unanswered. The desirability of the time at which the courses are offered, the integration of the the­ology courses into the studen~s' s~hed­ule, and the "myths" surrounding certain teachers should all be con­sidered before any conclusion con­cerning the reasons for this imbal­ance is made. 
Nonetheless, there is a recognition of certain weaknesses within the de­partment, as must be true of any de­partment in an era of transition. To quote Father Pelton's recent article in the Notre Dame Alumnus on the theology department at Notre Dame: "On the undergraduate level, there have been extensive, yet fruitful, re-


v1s10ns in the curriculum. Experi­mental pains are still being felt, but results are emerging." And the weak­nesses, according to Fr. Pelton, which show themselves during this transi­tion, will be corrected. 
The question of whether the sub­ject matter of the theology courses is adequate in the face of modern chal­lenges to Catholicism finds its an­swer in the same article. Notre Dame recognizes the need for "tighter or­
ganization, teacher training, and the 
writing of University texts, and is 
now correlating its courses more 
specifically with the best of contempo­
rary literature." For example, there 
is no longer a standard text for a 
particular course, which allows the 
instructor to take full advantage of 
contemporary literature. In addition, 
no syllabus has been set up for the 
teachers to adhere to rigidly. Remain­
ing within the spirit of the course, 
the classroom instructor is free to de­
velop his own outline in the areas he 
thinks most critical. While a stu­
dent's personal problems ,vith the 
truths of the faith certainly cannot 
te covered in the class, the theology 
department feels that a real effort is 
being made to acquaint the student 
with the problems awaiting him once 
he leaves Notre Dame. 
The closing words of Father Pel­ton's article best demonstrate the at­titude of the department, the attitude which the members hope the students will accept: "A great part of the work remains before us. We may say with­out hesitation that real dedication is ceing given to the dynamics of a mod­ern Christian Theology. This work takes time, but we will continue to work until we feel that Notre Dame has the finest theology department possible." 
o Notre Dame's debate team made the quarter finals, but then lost, in its own Eleventh Annual National In­vitational Debate Tournament last week end. The University of Redlands defeated ND's affirmative case 3-0. 
In the finals, Georgetown, arguing the negative, beat Brandeis 5-1. John Hempelman of Georgetown and Rich­ard West of Redlands tied in the competition for the best speaker in the tournament. 
The largest in its history, the tour­nament ran smoothly, except for the debates in the preliminary rounds held in the SCHOLASTIC office. The constantly ringing phone and report­ers dropping in were great distrac­tions. 
o At the major event of this year's guest lecture program, the University of Notre Dame English Department will present Professor Lionel Trilling, of Columbia University, in a talk on "The Fate of Pleasure: Wordsworth to Dostoevsky." The lecture is sched­uled for 8 p.m., March 14, in the Law School auditorium.

Arthur F. Carey, executive secre­tary of the California Teachers Asso­ciation, charged organized labor with the determination to capture the teaching profession, either by persua­sion or force. He claims that, "A well­financed campaign of propaganda and promises to cajole or, if necessary, to force teachers into unions, goes on in many parts of the country." But, according to him, the American Fed­eration of Teachers, affiliated with the AFL-CIO, has hardly been worth­while, showing little or no interest in the fields of ethics, research, teacher education, or the improvement of in­struction.

Congressional aides dealing with educational measures are currently studying the trimester system of col­lege attendance to see if federal back­ing could spur greater acceptance of the system. It is important because it is a solution to the problem of in­creasing college enrollments with classroom facilities fast becoming in­adequate. 


The trimester movement began at the University fo Pittsburgh in 1959; since then, many schools have adopted it. Pitt divided an 11-month school year into three 15-week sessions. Un­der this plan, students can graduate in two and two-thirds years with a month's vacation a year, or they can finish in the normal four years, in­cluding summer vacations. Teachers schedule. The trimester system is supposed to save six per cent of the per capita cost of a college education.

BENJAMIN DEMOTT of Amherst sum­

med up an article in Commentary 
about Playboy as "the whole man re­
duced to his private parts." This an­
alysis is somewhat too simplified. 
Playboy has, in fact, been able to 
merge sex appeal with snob appeal 
in all its various enterprises. 
Mr. Hugh Hefner, editor of the magazine, recently found need to enunciate a "Playboy Philosophy" ex cathedra. Claiming that the philos­ophy has not changed during the past nine years, Mr. Hefner says that the present statement of his philosophy is required since everybody else has chosen to write critically of the phi­losophy manifest in his enterprises. 
If the philosophy really hasn't changed at all in nine years, it can be assumed to be unchanged from the time Hefner appeared on a television panel show and explained that he was trying to counter a dangerous drift in America towards homosexuality. At that time the president of Mount Holyoke College accused him of sub­stituting voyeurism for homosexuality after carefully ascertaining that Hef­ner really wasn't running brothels in­stead of key clubs. 
Perhaps as a result of this en­counter, Hefner no longer makes such claims explicitly. After the first four installments of what was to be a four­part editorial, he still hasn't explained what he promised on the "Womaniza­tion of America" and our drift to­wards an "Asexual Society." How­ever, more and more editorials are promised for the coming issues. Hef­ner has chosen to give more prom­inent position in the magazine to each of these installments. By May, the "Playboy Philosophy" should be found on the center fold-out. 
For Hefner, the playboy can be "many things, providing he possesses a certain point of view." For all of its sophisticated disciplines "Playboy publishes some of the finest, most thought-provoking fiction, satire, ar­ticles, cartoons, service features, art and photography appearing in any magazine in America today" . . . ac­cording to Hefner. 
The "Playboy Philosophy" fails to answer any ontological or epistemo­logical questions usually dealt with in philosophy. However, these questions should not even be raised by the play­boy -"He must see life not as a vale of tears, but as a happy time." Thus the "Playboy Philosophy" is con­cerned almost entirely with ethics. A new ethics of style is substituted for the older ethics of good and evil. Hefner condemns the old ethics as "Puritanical." As Hefner says: "This nonsense about the body of man be­ing evil, while the mind and spirit are good, seems quite preposterous to most of us today. After all, the same Creator was responsible for all three and we confess we're not willing to believe that He goofed when He got around to the body of man (and cer­tainly not when he got to the body of woman)." Instead of the old moral questions, a man should seek good in a "car that has style and speed, in his savoring the pleasures of the sense with good food and drink and stereo sound, in his involvement in the decor of his apartment and the cut of his clothes." 
Although Hefner chose to praise God for creating woman, he opposes most religions for their inhibiting man. In Hefner's words: "If you are now weighing the full implications in this criticism of Playboy's 'polished consumership,' along with the church doctrine that lies behind it, you are about to make the disturbing dis­covery (or perhaps you'd already made it) that U.S. religion and free enterprise are, in certain respects, in­compatible." In any conflict of reli­gion with free enterprise, Hefner is firmly on the side of free enterprise. "Religion tends to de-emphasize ma­terial things, discourage a concern over the acquisition of wealth, bless the poor and promise that they shall dwell with God in the Kingdom of Heaven; our free-enterprise system is founded on the ideal that striving to materially better oneself is worth while and benefits not only the indi­vidual, but the world around him." 
Hefner cannot be accused of using the Encyclopedia Britannica as his sole source -although it is his prin­ciple source. Mr. Hefner even shows a close acquaintance with his sources when discussing Horatio Alger stories. He also quotes Life and Time and, in one place, lends Notre Dame's name to his philosophy by quoting Dean Joseph O'Meara of the Law School on the subject of free speech. 
Hefner dismisses Platonic philos­ophy with the single statement: "Socrates, teacher of Plato, and rec­ognized today as one of the great philosophers of history, was accused in his own time of being without fixed principles and sentenced to die by drinking poison hemlock." He also sides with such other uncommon men as Van Gogh, Galileo, and Christ. Of course, it could not be expected that Hefner would give much note to Plato who, in his Symposii,,m, claims that from beautiful bodies, man ascends to the beauty that is in souls until "he must believe beauty in souls to be more precious than beauty in t.he body." 
Furthermore, Hefner encourages a sophisticated indifference towards the souls in a playboy's playthings. He never considers such a thing as love in his philosophy. Consequently, there is a certain emptiness that is the emptiness of necessity-a feeling of waiting for something, of needing something or someone. This forced emptiness which eats away fullness is the "Playboy Philosophy." It hol­lows the moral structure of the so­ciety to which it appeals by making its vicious sort of emptiness attractive in and of itself. The "Playboy Phi­losophy" is really "eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow you may die in a nuclear explosion." 
Playboy conceals the elements of moral decay beneath a glossy veneer. Hefner demonstrates supreme audac­ity by providing a so-called philos­ophy of sophistication designed funda­mentally to justify a deception. 
"The Playboy Philosophy'1 attacks the cultural-historical structure that made its very existence possible. By attacking this it attacks itself. In advocating the debonair, it posits that which is other than debonair; the advocation receives its strength from this other than, and thus seeks to justify an asocial position in an argu­ment that must deny its presupposi­tions; it formulates an argument that could not be so formulated if it were real. 
And not only is it therefore unreal but also ahumanistic and, indeed, evil, in the most readily understand­able sense of the word. Mr. Hefner should be thanked for confirmingwhat everyone has thought all along about his philosophy: that it is empty ma­terialism and cellophane hedonism.

GERMANY: 
AN INTERPRETATION 

IN THE LAST few weeks, consider­able attention has been paid to the prominent position to which Germany has risen since the war. Recent arti­cles that come to mind are Hannah Arendt's fine New Yorker article, the Saturday Review feature section "What is the New Germany?" Time magazine's consideration of a newly vital German literature, and this week's Saturday Evening Post article on the "Revolt of Europe." 
In all of these articles, what has become apparent is the overriding importance of the German spirit and tradition in determining her actions in the coming decades. Germany's actions become unintelligible unless one first understands her cultural background -how her spirit was formed and conditioned by the great literature, philosophy, and political traditions of her past. 
With this in mind, the SCHOLASTIC asked Mr. ter Haar of the Modern Language Department to write an ar­ticle which would try to reveal the German mind and spirit. 
Mr. ter Haar was born in Deventer, the Netherlands, received his second­ary education in Holland, and after the German occupation spent three years in Indonesia. In 1948 he re­turned to Europe, emigrating the fol­lowing year to the U.~. 
He spent a year in New York, was disappointed by its impersonality and busyness, and was glad to have the chance to spend a year at St. Ambrose College in Davenport, Iowa. He re­ceived his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in German language and literature from the State University of Iowa. In 1957 he accepted a position at Notre Dame where he is presently an assistant professor. 
A GLANCE at the map of Europe immediately reveals Germany's geo­graphical position as Europe's heart­land, and it is only logical that ethni­cally Germany has developed into a more heterogeneous nation than most European countries. Until recently, particularism has played a major role in complicating the German political picture. Outside of the completely German countries of Austria and Germany, German was spoken by seg­ments of the population in some nine European countries. Also inside Ger­many there still exist great diversifi­cation and local color. In a very gen­eral way, this can be expressed in the comparison that the North German may state a cause as serious, but not hopeless, whereas the South German is apt to consider it hopeless, but not serious. To be more specific, however, mentality, dialect, dress and customs have, for a millennium and a half, distinguished Austrians, Swiss, Ba­varians, Swabians, Rhinelanders and North Germans. 
Also in the realm of the spirit, Germany, as the "Land of the Cen­ter," has traditionally absorbed and, in the process, transformed manifold cultural influences from neighboring lands to the East and West, North and South. No country in Europe has been as culturally cosmopolitan, as open to ideas from abroad, and its colorful cultural spectrum reflects this openness. Aside from having made significant contributions in the natural sciences, Germany's primary role has been to receive rather than to contribute to the mainstream of Western civilization. Thus, German universality could be considered in­trovert in that it assimilated various elements of foreign cultures for its own enrichment. By way of contrast, French universality could be charac­terized as extrovert in nature by hav­ing been the birthplace of great cul­tural movements and their subsequent transforming effect upon most other civilizations. The French philosopher, Emile Boutroux, in attempting to sum­marize, in one single formu!a, the differences between the German and French minds, saw German thought in quest of the "spirit of totality," and the French mind congenial to the "spirit of unity." In content and form, Goethe's Faust stands out as the per­fect prototype of this Germanic, Promethean striving for universal un­derstanding and for experiencing life in its totality. From the above, it should be clear that the absence of homogeneity and an intellectual com­
mitment that strives for all-embrac­ing comprehension do not facilitate the accessibility of the German mind to the outside world. Nor is the ac­ceptance of German thought pro­moted by the kaleidoscopic complexi­ties of the language which, in its own way, faithfully mirrors the German soul in its Rembrandtesque interplay of mystic light and darkness. 
Having emphasized the assimila­tion of contradictory cultural ele­ments, sometimes referred to with an untranslatable term as Zerrissenheit or inner divisiveness, we can now turn to the Germans' great love which, as "the bond of perfection," creates the indispensable element of cultural unity. This is their predilec­tion for metaphysics as fundamental to other branches of philosophy such as ethics, aesthetics, philosophy of na­ture and political theory. In this con­text, the term metaphysics is not to be taken in its strict ontological sense, for it also embraces the super­natural realm of religion. From the days of Albertus Magnus and his mys­tic pupil, Meister Eckhart, down to contemporaries such as Bultmann, Barth and Guardini, the German language area has produced an un­usually large number of great and frequently controversial theologians and thinkers. Their philosophical en­deavors were concentrated particu­larly in speculative, intuitive and theocentric thought, oftentimes with pantheistic leanings. 
Even the Age of Enlightenment was largely unsuccessful in dampen­
ing German enthusiasm for meta­physical speculation. The young Goethe recoiled in horror from the mechanistic atheism of French Phi­losophes such as Helvetius and d'Hol­bach; and the rationalist, Lessing, wrote that if God were to offer him Truth in one hand and in the other hand the quest for truth, he would take the latter. A French wit, in describing the European scene, saw the land being governed by the French, the British ruling the waves and the Germans (the "powerless" nation of poets and thinkers) con­trolling merely the clouds. It would seem significant that the Germans took this as a compliment. The early 19th century witnessed the travels of the famous Swiss critic, Madame de Stael, through Germany and her por­trayal of the Germans as dreamers who transformed the world into poetry which was then set to music by German composers. As late as 1928, Count Keyserling could write that if two gates existed, one with a sign saying, "Entrance to the Kingdom of Heaven," and the other with a sign reading, "Entrance to Lectures about Heaven," all Germans would crowd through the latter gate. 
Also in terms of European cultural history in general, the metaphysical handwriting on the German wall spells out two significant facts: The Protestant Revolt and Romanticism. Although a number of other countries were directly involved in these re­form movements, there was hardly a European nation whose spiritual soil was better prepared to receive their seeds. Once disseminated, these seeds bore fruit more abundantly in Ger­many than in other lands. In Italy and Western Europe, the Renaissance gave birth to Modern Man and his anthropocentric Weltanschauung. In Germany, however, the birth of Mod­ern Man took place under the aegis of the theocentric Protestant Reforma­tion which, with regard to the Bible, absolutized the Logos. Where the Renaissance had, in a sense, canonized nature, Protestantism's highly spiri­tualized religion anathematized na­ture as the antithesis of grace. Yet, German Lutheranism never lost its vivid sense of pietistic Verinner-

lichung and spiritual sovereignty. Cal­vinism, practically democratic and adaptable to a commercial society, proved more congenial to the West. Being more ethically inspired, West­ern Protestantism developed an urban, realistic spirit and less of an aware­ness of Divine mystery operative in and through nature. The spirit of Lutheranism, amenable to an agrar­ian economy, was not inimical to the typically German mystique of nature, particularly that of the forest, which, having its roots in the ancient Germanic past, never failed to in­spire the masses. 
Romanticism (1793-1830) was like­wise ardently devoted to metaphysical values. It came as a reaction against the syndrome of world-centered "isms" spawned by the Enlighten­ment: the hegemony of rationalism, utilitarianism, mechanistic material­ism and, above all, the threat of atheistic nihilism. Every attempt to define Romanticism is foredoomed to failure because of its mystical quest of the Infinite, the Eternal, of Absolute Beauty and the poetic reali­zation of these noble ideals of this life. Though in Germany its most enduring contributions were char­acteristically made in the arts of music and literature, Romanticism also enjoyed a remarkable longevity in theology, philosophy and political theory. Its thought was character­

ized by an inner dynamism closely akin to the idealism that motivated the mystic and Neoplatonic thinkers. The affinity in essence that exists be­tween mysticism and Romantic thought caused both to strive for a synthesis of the vita activa and the vita contem,plativa, which was to re­sult in a progressive spiritualization of life. It stands to reason that the aesthetic experience as a Divine manifestation through art played an essential role in this process. Roman­ticism never lost its appeal to the German mind; and it is not surpris­ing that contemporary historians have frequently linked Romanticism with the rise of National Socialism as a pseudoreligious movement. However, the Nazi perversion of Romantic re­ligiosity for its own nihilistic dynamics in vacuo does not invalidate the seri­ous, though perhaps at the time un­realistic, Romantic endeavor to re­capture the truly catholic spirit of the Christian Occident as it had once inspired the arts and culture of the Middle Ages. Novalis and Friedrich Schlegel, to mention two leading Ro­mantic thinkers, based this vision of a united Europe on the Latin Chris­tianity of the Middle Ages which spiritually united the Romance and Germanic nations. Recent political and cultural developments have once again made the formation of a United Europe the primary concern of the West. And in this formation, the con­cept of spiritual-cultural continuity, as once envisioned by the Romantic thinkers, still provides the idealistic dimension to the political and eco­nomic exigency of a United Europe as a third force. 
The German image delineated so far is admittedly one-sided and limited to certain influential classes of soci­ety. The other face of the German Janus head bears different features. Instead of gazing to the stars, its sights are set on world affirmation for its own sake; it reflects a strongly developed sense of realism as evi­denced by countless remarkable achievements in science and technol­ogy, as well as great organizational talent. It would seem difficult to de­termine which of the two major as­pects of the German character has borne fruit more abundantly. The lat­ter aspect needs little if any elabora­tion, since it is a universal force in the world today and the foundation of modern technocracy. 
The German soul, in accordance with its own inner constitution, sees the universe in terms of dualities, the dialectic polarization of which con­stantly animates life. Such a vision projects life as an unceasing effort to reconcile polarities such as God and man, time and eternity, nature and the supernatural. As the Middle Ages had achieved a reconciliation of these polarities by viewing life sub specie aeternitatis, it was to this spiritually felicitous period that the Romantics turned for inspiration. Hence, the large number of conversions of promi­nent thinkers to the ancient Mother Church whose universality embraces the· Aristotelian-Thomistic-Latin as well as the Platonic-Augustinian­Germanic syntheses. 
It goes without saying that only a few of the German mind's many facets could be considered here and that they were discussed almost ex­clusively in their constructive applica­tions. On the other hand, we have dealt with genuine cultural values and culture is essentially a positive and creatively human concern. One simply cannot ignore the fact that the German predilection for beauty, pro­fundity and metaphysical thought, much maligned as the German disease par excellence, has also enriched the world with sublime musical creations and with a literature which is as sensitive a barometer of the profound culture it reflects as are the other great European literatures. The truly universal mind looks upon the dif­ferent nature of the German cultural legacy as the necessary complement to that of the more "realistic," "classical" West. 
In conclusion, let the equally neces­sary awareness of the depths into which the German nation could fall, ironically through the diabolical per­version of its noblest spiritual poten­tialities, be duly reflected in this ci­tation of the epitaph on the grave of the poet, van Grimmelshausen, whose Siniplizissimus has so poignantly de­scribed the plight of the Germanies during the Thirty Years' War: 
"Deutsch Volk belogen und betrogen Im Streit um hohes Ideal Durch Not und Elend durchgezogen Aus \Vunden blutend ohne Zahl Ei~fiiltgen Herzens, tief verwildert, Beriihrt <loch von der Muse Kuss Deutsch Volk Du warst, den er 
geschildert Der arme Simplizissimus."* 

*"German Nation cheated and deceh·ed In your struggle for high ideals As you went your way through distress 
and ordeal Bleeding from countless wounds Simple of heart and running wild, But yet favored with the Muses' kiss German Nation, you were, whom he' 
portrayed The poor, most simple Simplizissimus."

PACIFISTS and THINGS 
THERE are many mistaken notions today concerning life in medieval uni­versities. Some people think that the medieval scholar was entirely too serious, spending all his time in scholastic discourse deciding how many angels would fit on the head of a pin. Such a problem actually ap­peared just as trivial in the twelfth century as it does in our modern times when empirical science has proven conclusively that exactly three and one-half cherubim or one and one-half archangels can fit on a platinum pin kept. at the National Bureau of Standards. 
Serious research has revealed that the medieval students spent most of their time writing home for money, drinking, and rioting with the towns­people. Actually, they had a good deal more freedom in rioting with townspeople than do 20th-century students. Lacking such permanent fixtures as golden domes, murals, and power plants, the medieval univer­sities could be moved around from town to town by disgruntled masters and students. 
But the medieval scholar did not spend all his time in the debauchery which we might expect of one with his degree of freedom. He was seri­ous, interested in the problems of his contemporary world. The following is a transcript of a scholarly, extra­curricular discourse held between Omar Scholasticus, a student, and the Duchess of Mignon. 
Omar opens the debate: "Our world today is threatened with de­struction. Christendom cannot long survive in the face of brutal mass de­struction introduced with the cross­bow. Already the Christian princes have stockpiled nearly 40,000. cross­bows of various types from the mini­ature arbalests to terrifying balistae. The wanton destruction of human life which can be achieved with the ICCB (Inter-City Cross Bow) is totally im­moral. 
"Not only is human life directly taken with the crossbow, but there is danger of the total destruction of the human race. The nobility has long been known for wasting all its time hunting. With conventional weapons, great enough depletion of wildlife oc­curred. But with the introduction of the crossbow, there is the distinct danger that all species of birds may become extinct. As an ornithologist I am deeply grieved by this possibility. However, without any birds to eat insects, the world will be plagued with locusts which are not susceptible to attack by the crossbow. Thus, even the supposedly peaceful use of the crossbow must be counted as im­moral. 

"I therefore believe that we must all resolve never personally to use a crossbow; and we must also petition the Pope to demand the disarmament of Christendom before Christendom itself is destroyed in warfare. 
"I might additionally point out that, for many years, most of man's energy has gone into the art of war­fare. This indicates something attrac­tive in fighting a war for a just cause. And in hand-to-hand combat there was room for valor and noble deeds. However, the crossbow is an imper­sonal weapon. A person can be killed, reduced to nothing, in a split second without ever seeing his opponent. 
favor of human killing than the elo­quent Omar Scholasticus. However, I cannot share his grave concern over the use of any crossbow. For one thing, there is a need for small tacti­cal crossbows which, owing to their smallness, can be bent by the force of the body, not requiring a windlass at the side. This type of weapon could be used in limited warfare. The giant balista should not be used ex­cept as a last resort. The stockpiling of balistae can be justified, though, since intelligence reports indicate that the ungodly Saracens indeed pos­sess such weapons. We must never forget that the Saracens do not abide by our standards of morality. They are unprincipled and would not hesi­tate to use such weapons against us except for the knowledge that retali­ation in kind would be inflicted upon them. 
"A certain amount of risk should be taken to preserve our basic freedoms, such as the gold standard." 
Omar broke in saying, "But how can you have freedom without ex­istence?" 
The chronicle relates that at this point the Duchess had Omar seized and burned as a heretic since Exis­tentialism had not yet been invented and Omar was on the verge of doing so -thus ending the Dark Ages.

March 

March is a moment of anticipating months of flowers curled in rockbeds down a roadway through a park. A month that lionlamblike has us twirling thermostats, lifting windows something more than just a crack, exchanging overcoats for no coats or jackets. Thoughts tum to lawns, convertibles, and softball games, and soon T-shirted city men walk newspapers to work in blue very blue blue morning. But if our thoughts race deeper into spnng, eager for those sodabottle childhood days, if our scenes diffuse and circulate around a bowl of peaches, garnished with split ice, there's a fact that breaks the pace of our anticipati~n­-snow . . . March snow squishes everywhere: where it lay fluff and airy a week ago now it's slush and gray, smeared around the lake, through the park: the roads are black ellipses graphing out between the trees a natural algebra: the function of springtime's a shadow, sky's arc's a gray, trees dusty and due. Misted sun flickers down the branch's filigree. Afternoon's a soft sound. Steam's off the wet-slick roofs reaching for the lowing clouds. We tell ourselves we'll bear with Marc~ and watch the days get warmer, watch lawns soften and flex, the golf course soaken ... watch the dusk's damp sun fester orange like a sore healing just beyond the pulpy cloud.

Catholic 



College 
by 
Rev. Joseph Hoffman, C.S.C. 
THE .A1vrnmcAN Catholic college stu­dent stands in a unique position. Most likely he has attended a parochial school and a Catholic high school. He is, perhaps, more than any other Catholic youth in the world, well grounded in the fundamentals of his faith. He has had some acquaintance with the New Testament, some apol­ogetics (not much more than the standard answers to the standard objections), entirely too much moral­istic training, and very little real understanding of the deep mysteries of his faith. He now enters a Catholic college or university "to complete his Catholic education," to quote from the statements of countless Notre Dame freshmen. 
More and more such a student is drawing away from the utilitarian and practical training for business and commerce toward that rather nebulous goal, the liberal education. Within the concept of liberal educa­tion, he certainly expects to find a truly intellectual approach to his faith, an approach equal to that of the other scientific and humanistic 
studies of collegiate level. He has 
had enough of memorization and of 

stock answers to attacks on his faith. 
He wants the real food of theological 
science, even though he is not always 
able to articulate his desire. When 
he does confront an inadequate college 
theology course, he feels that, instead 
of being given bread, he is given a 
stone. 
Consequently, this student can har­bor a disaffection for theology courses. He is disgruntled and his reaction is not merely a personal one, but it is often shared by his fellow students. Soon there is established on campus a student tradition of dissatisfaction with a theology program, a tradition that is not easily dispelled nor ever entirely accurate. Hence the student attitude of ambivalence: a desire for genuine theology, a rejection of theol­ogy as it may currently be presented. He senses that theology is much more than he is getting; he does not know how much more. 
The causes of such dissatisfaction are numerous and complicated. I can only treat of two of them: the faculty and the curriculum. It is no injustice to remark that many college teachers of theology are not themselves theo­logians. This statement appears as a condemnation and I do not intend it as such. I merely ,vish to point out to students across the country an aspect of the faculty problem of which they are unaware. 
The problem of providing scholarly theologians prepared for college teaching has an ecclesiastical and a sociological factor. The ecclesiastical factor is that American theologians are almost always priests who have been educated in a seminary. Now the purpose of the seminary is to train ministers of the gospel, men of God ordained to give men the Word, in sermon and sacrament. The life of the intellect is only one phase of the total apostolate. While the sem­inary will never disavow theological inquiry, its prime objective is a holy and orthodox clergy and the saving 
·, 

of the souls of all men is its ultimate I mission. 1 
'I 

Granting then, that seminaries are \ for ministers and not for scholars directly, let us also recognize that seminaries have developed and still do produce scholars, even though their number be small. The develop­ment of scholars, after all, is bounded not only by the talent and desires of the individual, but also by the needs of a diocese or a religious com­munity. The diocesan seminary is intended to form effective parish priests, and religious orders must supply priests for varied apostolic endeavors. Therefore, it should not be astonishing that the seminary cur­riculum should be so constructed as to provide future priests with that basic theological instruction from which they can go on to further development both theological and pastoral. 
With this end in view a seminary will usually teach dogmatic theology from textbooks whose exposition dif­ferentiates orthodox from heresy, defined truths from opinion, with little or no middle ground between. Sacred Scripture is most often treated in support of the pronouncements of the magisterium, and biblical study itself is far too extensive today to allow the seminarist more than an initiation in it through his course work. The treatment of moral theol­ogy is designed to give the priest the necessary equipment for being an intelligent confessor. It is not often a course in which the priest learns to apply the rich and mysterious life of Christ to daily activity. Rather it is an application of the Decalogue, giving detailed descriptions of the variety and gravity of sins. This is necessary for the confessor but it seldom provides a positive approach to Christian living. 
Add to these staple courses the corollary subjects of canon law, apol­ogetics, Church history, homiletics, liturgy, and perhaps Greek and He­brew, and you have placed a real burden of study on the future priest. For the seminarist with scholarly inclinations, the curriculum merely whets his appetite for further study. And even for the priest who does not find his apostolate in the classroom, a personal program of further reading in theology will soon be regarded as more than just a recommendation of the Holy See. It is the source of fruitful preaching and intelligent spiritual counselling. It is no wonder then that, conscious of his limitation, the priest is the least likely to call himself a theologian until he has spent more years after ordination in the pursuit of theological competence. 
In many Catholic universities, therefore, it is becoming increasingly apparent that ordination to the priest­hood is not an adequate preparation for the priest-professor of theology at the collegiate level. It is not simply a question of gaining an advanced degree in theology in order to give the priest status in an academic com­munity. The priest must be able to speak with the same authority in his field as .do his academic colleagues within their respective disciplines. The demand for qualified teachers in theology far exceeds the number and caliber of men in the field today. Doctors of theology are only now beginning to find their way onto university faculties in any number. Yet they are coming and their num­ber is growing. 
The sociological factor of the fac­ulty problem is that scholarship, whether in theology or in any of the profane sciences, has never been highly valued by our American Cath­olic body. Whatever may be the elements that have brought about this deficiency, and it belongs to competent social analysts to tell us, theology had no part in it. As a norm for all other disciplines, theology does not interfere with the scholar's work in a nontheological field. Only when the scientist speaks about ultimate concerns, or in other words, as a theologian, can theology claim right­ful jurisdiction. There is, however, a religious element in this sociological factor and we ought to point it out. 
Too often theological scholarship has been directed toward the needs of the American apostolate. The rea­sons seem to be, first, an ignorance of what scholarship really is; and, secondly, a desire to defend the faith. 
According as one accepts a mis­conception of scholarship he will use his theological preparation toward some other activity, toward convert­making, toward missions and preach­ing, toward a more vital spiritual life in the laity. These latter are truly noble objectives and are often enough the by-products of theological scholarship. Nevertheless, the inves­tigation and contemplation of truth is itself a goal worthy of one's finest efforts. It is not subsidiary to any other value. Scholarship is neither anti-Catholic nor pro-Catholic. It is simply the noblest activity of man. 
According as one sees theology primarily as a means of defending the doctrinal positions of the Catholic Church, he restricts the progress of theological science. He is content with a safe position and leaves to others the task of updating theology with the incorporation of new insights and developments that have been achieved in other fields, particularly in Scrip­ture and philosophy. He hands down the solutions of the past because they have withstood the test of orthodoxy. He reduces new problems to old and hence they are answerable by the old solutions. He is fearful of every in­novation because of the adverse effect it may have on the faith and piety of the laity. He is neither a reaction­ary nor a conservative. He has simply taken the position of safeguarding what he thinks is the proper level of theological inquiry. 
College students must be patient in this matter of faculty training and with the attitudes toward scholarship described above. Honest self-appraisal might show that they, too, share in them. Moreover, the men and women engaged in teaching theology are doing their best to meet their ob­ligations to scholarship. They are struggling \vith a problem which is unique in the Church: What kind of theology should be taught laymen in the undergraduate pro£ram of a ~beral _arts college? On e;'ery campus, m national conventions, in writings and in discussions, faculties are still probing for answers regarding the content and method of teaching col­lege theology. 
S_ome teachers, desirous of giving their students a scientific course attempt to reduce the seminary prO: gram to capsule form for under­graduate consumption. The four-year seminaristic course is concentrated into brief two-hour courses during eight semesters. Even a competent teacher working \vith the best of texts would find the task impossible. Such a program has two serious drawbacks. First it minimizes the importance of each individual course. Secondly, it leaves the impression of superficiality of treatment and makes any attempt at a synthesis of theology harder to establish. The speed with which dogmatic statements spill out on all sides fails to do justice to the cen­turies of development that have pre­ceded and prepared for our present state of beliefs. Many intelligent stu­dents find such a program difficult to swallow, harder to digest and are discomfited by the mass of informa­tion that lies unassimilated in their minds that demand unity and clarity. 
If college theology leaves the stu­dent with only bits and pieces of a disparate series of courses, then the student is doomed to a dogmatic and perhaps even moral sterility. He ac­cepts his faith as a Ikind of overlay to the rest of his education, not penetrating and enriching his intel­lectual life. His Christian moral life is in danger of becoming externalized and shallow for lack of being ground­ed in intellectual conviction and wilful commitment.

Paternalism and Attempts to Create the Notre Dame Man 
P
ATERNALISM -an often used word on the campus today. "Paternal­ism" -a word brought up from the past to describe a present situation: the relationship between the Admin­istration and the other components of the University. ''Paternalism" -a word used to describe the "beneficient father" who forces upon his somewhat backward "children" the "truths" which the father feels must be im­posed upon the children to protect them from themselves, regardless of the attitudes of the children. Pater­nalism manifests itself here in the rules imposed upon the students, rules which only too often are justified not in terms of the betterment of the community and the maintenance of social order but rather upon the ob­ligation the Administration feels to take the place of the parent. It man­ifests itself in the close regulation of the courses and those who teach them. This last has led to a great docility on the part of much of the faculty. It has permeated every level of life at the University and all those connected with Notre Dame. It has stifled the natural and human growth of men. 
The paternalism of Notre Dame exists for one reason: the group which has the final judgment on all matters of policy regarding the Uni­versity (the Local Board and the upper strata of the Administration) is composed of a coterie of priests of the Congregation of Holy Cross. It is a closed corporation. And two corollaries of this situation which are, I think, direct results of it, are the fact that this group is attempting to produce a type: "the Notre Dame Man" and, second, the fact that they feel no obligation to give to students and the faculty any reasons for their decisions. 

Although there are some very definite problems existing here, and room for improvement in many areas, I do not at this time wish to take issue with these specific problems. Rather, I shall concern myself with the underlying principle which is the cause of many of the problems: the complete exclusiveness of the ultimate power in this University. The basic 
by Thomas O'Brien 

problem is one of composition. 
Let us not be deluded into think­ing that the students or the faculty have at present any real voice in the decisions of the Administration. Stu­dents, the faculty, the Lay Advisory Councils of the Colleges, the Board of Trustees, all may be asked their opinions in certain matters. But all the advice, all the logic in the world, all the consideration of the problems facing us are of no value whatsoever unless accepted by the Administration and the Local Board, who presumably are (at least in their own opinion) the only persons qualified to make such decisions. They are qualified because of their great and compre­hensive wisdom and the fact that this is their University. However, I feel they have not conclusively demon­strated this wisdom in every instance, and in some ways have hindered our development; and too, they fail to recognize that students and faculty have a stake in Notre Dame as well. 
Where, indeed, is the Catholic Com­munity of scholars? Where the re­alization by young men of the awe­some humanity they share? Where is the fellowship, the true interpersonal relationships which men can develop among men? Where (and this is the great shame of our Catholic Univer­sity) is the growing awareness among men of their total dependence on God, the God who became m,an, the per­sonal loving God with whom man can enter into a subjective, personal relationship? Spoon-feeding and re­striction can never produce this. When the Administration attempts to mold the "Notre Dame Man" in p. certain form, one can see almost so many gingerbread men being cut out by a heavy-handed baker. This stifles the members of the University commu­nity; it curtails the spirit of free inquiry; it can lead eventually to stagnation. 
In many ways the University is becorning stagnant. Oh yes, the build­ings are going up, but look more closely. Look at all the students who simply are. Students who are never severely challenged intellectually, whose four years are but a prelude to a degree and leaving the University to become contributing Alumni. If there were but one such student, it would be too many. But thereare many more than one. Look closely at the faculty and see how many teachers once inspired and inspiring are being stifled in their work and being crushed by the size and number of their classes. And where does the money go? Not to hiring more and better teachers. It goes to buildings. How many teachers are leaving us to find areas and colleges where this is not the case? Too many I fear. 
Where everything is some way under the guardianship of any homo­geneous group, and this group has established itself as a body which must form persons rather than estab­lish an environment where the full potential of the individual can be achieved, there will be no great awakening of minds and persons. Where it is felt that students must be told, in that now classic Religious Bulletin, that dogs can't really talk, where in the pulpit the teachings of the Church are equated with the curfew for students, where Student Government is no more than an ad­visory group and a Student Activities Council having little real power to innovate and decide, where the con­cerns of the Administration seem to center on the building of edifices rath­er than on the personal development of those who will live, sleep, learn, teach, and pray in those buildings, something is radically wrong. I will agree that the rules have been changed somewhat in my three years here, but the basic attitude seems not to have changed at all. We are still to be under the ultimate control of these persons who can analyze life in the halls without having been a student in many years, and who as the SCHOLASTIC said two weeks ago, "fuse the function of religious leader­ship with the function of academic leadership." 
Two very concrete examples may suffice at this point as clear examples of the paternalism of the Administra­tion: Last year the Sophomore Class was refused permission to evaluate the Sophomore courses and those who taught them. Fr. Soleta said the stu­dents were not qualified to evaluate their courses and their teachers. He felt this matter was best handled by those who had had long experience in education and not by inexperienced students. I will grant his experience, but Father Soleta is not taking these courses now. 
A second example is the consistent refusal on the part of the Administra­tion to allow faculty members to have any voice in the actual choosing of students to come to Notre Dame and requirements for graduation. Through the American Association of Univer­sity Professors the faculty has con­sistently attempted to gain some voice in those things which directly affect them and in which they are competent. Even the Academic Coun­cil, of which some of the faculty are members, meets not at regular inter­vals but only at the request of the President, often on only three or four days notice (hardly enough time to give any real consideration to a mat­ter) and its recommendations can be discarded at will. In the words of one faculty member of the Academic Council, it is a "sham." 
Students and faculty do not, and cannot, ask to make the policy for all areas of the University. Such things as the investments made by the University are outside our realm of competency. But all areas of deci­sion making are not outside our legit­imate concern. The Administration, 

lUarch 8, 1963 
at present, seems to feel there are no significant areas in which we can make decisions. Herein lies their great error. 
What then would be the benefits of giving the students and faculty a greater role in policy formation? They would be, I think, these three: First, the decisions made would have a broader basis of thought and opinion, and therefore be more com­prehensive in the factors considered. Second, the communication between the decision makers and those affect­ed by the decision would be enhanced because of the very fact of the en­larged base group. At present, the Administration summarily dismisses the opinions of students and faculty without giving a reason. Too often, they act without feeling any neces­sity of explaining their actions to anyone. The establishment of a truly Christian dialogue -a give and take conducted in good faith, with empa­thy and with the realization on the part of all groups that we are all seeking the great good of Notre Dame -would be of great value. Third. the benefit would be the great psy­chological effect upon the students and faculty in the realization that their rightful interests had been rec­ognized and were therefore of some force in the administration and future of the University. The feeling of be­ing under the thumb of a coterie of priests would be eliminated in favor 
of the feeling of being an integral part of this University about which we are so concerned. 
What can be done now? Very little. Life can be made more tolerable for the student, the faculty can become better paid, there can be some im­provements made. But the stifling atmosphere will persist. We must wait for the C.S.C. to have the fore­sight and wisdom to share their power with the other components of the University. Students can express dissatisfaction; better students may choose the other colleges where they feel they will have greater academic freedom; the faculty may leave for various reasons; corporations may refuse to give us grants; the spiritual tenor of the University may crumble and still the C.S.C. will hold the absolute power. Nothing can force them to relinquish it. Nothing, per­haps, except the realization on their part that the University is not exclu­sively theirs-the realization that it belongs to all the members of the Notre Dame Family of which they so fondly speak -can make them change. And they must change; this plea must be heard if we are to be­come the truly great University to which we aspire.

preventive measures, even including hydrogen bombs, if they would stave off ruin, could be directed against military targets even if the concomi­tant killing of civilians were truly· vast in extent. But except as a last­ditch desperation measure, bombing enemy cities to destroy their produc­tive capacity cannot be justified. In fact the principle of double effect holds good chiefly where the good and evil to be done are roughly meas­urable, and here, where the evil done might well escape entirely from our control, the principle may not be ap­plicable. In other words even indirect population bombing, even if intended to prevent invasion and enslavement, may be morally wrong. It is at any rate certain that all forms of direct population b om bing are unjust. Atomic and thermonuclear weapons can be justified only if no other means can probably secure the legitimate self-defensive aims of a legitimate government. This applies all the way from small skirmishes to major wars, and in this perspective Clausewitz's assertion is but a reduction to practi­cal detail of the common teaching of the Church on self-defense (e.g., in Sum:ma Theologica, Aquinas, II Ilae, Q. 40, art. 1 and ad 1). 
What about the morality of deter­rence? Many military analysts think the presence of atomic weapons, and their widespread possession, is itself a deterrent to war. No one, now that 
i 

two countries have each the effective I 
'I 

power to destroy all human life, can ·1 hope for victory in a total war; the incentive to any armed hostility is therefore reduced. The moral prob­lem here is that weapons which are wholly defensive, and therefore ac­ceptable, as a threat, become wholly revengeful, and therefore immoral, if the threat fails and we employ them. So there is no satisfactory solution of the problem of deterrence apart from that of disarmament. There was a good deal of discussion about the connection between these two things, but although several good points were made, I heard no one refute the basic tion center, an atom bomb equivalent in power to 100 tons of TNT is im­moral; a 1 Kiloton bomb, launched against a military installation so big that only a frightful weapon of this 
kind can wreck it, is morally per­missible. 
Can we invoke the principle of double effect to justify otherwise im­moral extensions of the zone of war? Suppose our position in a major war were so poor that we as a people were actually in danger of complete de­struction. Hysterical and savage re­venges and absolute demands still re­main forbidden, of course. But real

and essential idea that the present situation, in which we are protected from destruction by having weapons more numerous and more powerful than we have the right to use, is in­tolerable. 
But the problem of disarmament is simply enormous. There is no way to prevent the storage of atomic weapons, nor to make the location of every stockpile known. Production of fissionable material is easily detected, and skilled inspection can determine how up to 97% of the product is used. But this would still not prevent an undetected increase in military atomic strength, amounting to our own case of 1½ tons a year (estimated). Warn­ing and inspection systems are certain to be incomplete for political and technological reasons; they can, how­ever, develop at least to the point of detei;ting any preparations for total or very large-scale war. If on this basis some arms control agreement is worked out it should include penalties for violation, even accidental, and these must be reasonably clear, pro­portioned to the violation, and likely to be enforceable. At present, tech­nology is at a point where, in event of a general war, it is not likely to stop until one side has exhausted its arsenal. Weapons development and all other military defense aspects must be brought into line with the changes necessary if a negotiated arms control program ever becomes feasible. But nothing can ever change the fact that the more radical world­wide disarmament, the smaller the violation needed to achieve the viola­tor's aggressive intent. On the other hand in a world from which ultimate 
risk can never again be expelled, limited risks may be more freely taken. It is morally -and politically -even more important to reduce in­centives to make war than to reduce abilities. Since we now have nuclear superiority, a limited unilateral nu­clear disarmament program should coincide in our planning with the effort to organize our troops and weapons so that neither side in a future war would stand to gain from drastic escalation of its offensive. Where conflict is unavoidable, clear and public terms for a cease-fire and a return to negotiation must be made known; but this will be impossible in a democratic country unless there is a wide popular consensus in its favor, and this which we must strive to build up. Provided we do all this, an emergency and deterrent stockpile even of thermonuclear weapons, and at least of strategic atomic weapons, is probably not morally wrong. In­deed if our proximate goal is to pre­vent immoral kinds of war our fur­ther aim must surely be prevention of war itself, and such a stockpile 
may promote that. 
In the event of war, what should the individual do? Generally, what he is told. The war, we may be sure, will be fought for a just cause. If, as is likely, some of the means used to fight it are unjust, this will not be at all easy to determine in specific instances, and so unless one has posi­tive and certain evidence against a particular operation, the government must be given the benefit of the doubt. There is, I believe, one terrible ex­ception to this. Although the use of hydrogen bombs may be justifiable in 

March 8, 1963 
very extreme circumstances to avoid total defeat, it is the nation's present official policy to use them as a normal means of attack on selected large targets. The overwhelming proba­bility, therefore, is that a specific use of hydrogen bombs, especially early in the war, would be immoral and the soldier who knows that his orders directly involve the use of such a bomb must, at whatever cost to him­self, refuse to obey. 
Can we do anything to promote peace now? Yes, and we must; in­difference is itself a war crime, the morally effective equivalent of mass murder and suicide. As a nation and individually, dedication to peace will mean a constant and costly responsi­bility for our neighbors, that the life open to them may be of a kind for which they were created. How can we even hope for an end to today's international anarchy when our mili­tary budget is many times bigger than all we spend on economic de­velopment, education, and other con­structive forms of foreign aid? Our conviction that time is on our side will prove valid only if we work for true peace, true justice. Monthly do­nations to CARE, a voluntary income tax of one-tenth of one per cent given annually to the U.N., the study of an oriental language, participation in a sit-in, service in the Peace Corps or the Papal Volunteers, a serious dedi­cation, as members of the armed forces, to understanding the whole defense picture and our place in it­these are concrete things we can do, and probably must do. If most of them are disruptive of our present attitudes and plans and othenvise hard to endure, so is nuclear war. 
Christians believe that God is the Lord of History, that evil cannot final­ly succeed; that in Christ, the first­born of many brethren, all mundane reality is ordered to the good of man and all men brought into true unity, children of God by their Creation, their Redemption, and unless they prevent it by their own graceless re­fusal their glorification. As the Church, therefore, it is our duty first to manifest peace rather than to dis­cuss it. This means ecumenism, pen­ance, the sacramental life; prayer in community and community in prayer; charity for fellow Christians who dif­fer with us, and especially for our enemies, Christian or not. It means unshaken confidence in God, not that He will spare us the effects of sin but that He will deliver us from sin itself, that worst of evils. "Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be re­moved, and the mountains be carried into the depths of the sea." 

Stratigon's bar on South Michigan Street ( just north of the Philadel­phia) was for many years a friendly gathering place for Notre Dame stu­dents. Indeed, Stratigon's was one of the few places in South Bend where Notre Dame students could go and expect to be treated like gentlenien. (In the near future, the SCHOLASTIC will present a com,prelzensive report on Notre Dame-South Bend rela­tions.) A few weeks ago, Stratigon's closed -for good. What follows i.s an interview with its gracious owner. 
M
RS. STRATIGOS let me into the big 
old house. 
''I'm the person who called this 
morning," I said. "I have a sort of 
appointment to interview Mr. Strat­
igos for the ND SCHOLASTIC." 
She led me into the living room, calling ahead of us, "That boy from Notre Dame's here." 
As I approached the living room doorway, I braced myself a little. I tend to expect semifamous persons, even purely local characters, to look somehow different from other people. Sometimes, you feel a faint shock when you are actually face to face with them. But when I saw Mr. Strat­igos enthroned in his easy chair, at the other side of the room, I realized that he was much as I had envisioned him: short, heavy, distinguished look­ing; a man with a face gentle without oversoftness-a European face. I sat down and he immediately began to speak. 
Apparently, he had a complete story ready for me-he told me how he had come to the U.S. when he was four­teen and worked in hotels and restau­rants in Pittsburgh and Chicago. He said that he had really fallen in love with Chicago and had never wanted to move too far away from it and so South Bend seemed then the ideal location to him-not too big a city 

to live in and not too small either­
and the South Shore fare to Chicago 
in those days was only $2.50 round­
trip. He started his business in 1914; 
by the time of prohibition he was 
running a large cafeteria and restau­
rant at the corner of Washington and 
Main Streets, employing nearly fifty 
people. And then came the depression. 
He moved to a smaller location-the 
building where Joer's is now. He told 
me that the only thing that had 
saved him was the student trade. 
"They kept me going," he said. 
He had never kept a bar until WW 

II, since the idea of a bar was dis­
tasteful to him. He started one then 
because he had planned to take on 
a student as a partner and eventually 
give him the business. But the student 
had gone into the service and so he 
continued the bar, moving down to 
the place which we all know so well. 
He concluded his history here, and, for a moment, he was silent. Then he asked me if I had any questions. 
I asked him if he had been born in Greece. 
He told me that he had, that he had been educated by the Capuchins and that he had left Greece when he was fourteen. 
I asked him if he remembered Greece, what it had been like, if he longed for it. 
He paused for a moment, blinking his eyes and turning his head in thought. "Ah," he said, "but when you are young-you know-you don't think, you don't think about remem­bering...." He hold me that he had been back a few times, that Greece was very poor. He and his wife had given very freely to the "children," as she had given away the money from her purse. I hoped that he would eventually find something great or strange to tell me-something to 
place him in the eternal mystery of 
l

Greece-but he did not go any farther 
and I did not press him. 
I asked him about the Notre Dame 
students he had known over the years. 
He told me that they were all good 
kids, nice kids; no more ornery than 
the South Bend kids. 
"I never had one get drunk in my 
place," he said. "Sometimes they came 
in drunk from some place else, but 
never do they get too much in my 
place. I see a boy, he maybe talks a 
little out of turn. So, what I do? 
I don't holler at him; I go over, put 
my hand on his shoulder, tell him 
'So you had enough tonight. Tomor­
row's always another day. As long 
as you have money, there's more here 
for you. Now do me a favor. Go 
home, go to bed. Tomorrow's another 
day.'" 
He went further from the specific question I had asked and began to give me his theories of education and training. He told me that it was an elder's job to instruct, to be positive; to encourage the young to do right, not to restrict. And that it was the 
i

home that was important-he told me l 
i 
i

how he had made a home for his 
children, that a good home produced l good children. I thought of his own i home in Greece for a moment-his i country, his Greek tradition. And I did not really see a Greek tradition in the story he had given me so far. But he went on, swinging back again to the concrete. He told me that the police were much too tough on Notre Dame kids, that he had often told them to take it easy, that they would split South Bend and Notre Dame further apart. He then began to talk about the relation between South Bend and Notre Dame. 
"They used to be much closer long ago, but today everything is too big; too many people. But I always tell the businessmen here in town, we need Notre Dame more than Bendix, more than Studebaker. This is for the mind, this is a place worthy to have here,

The Lion 

PRACTICALLY EVERYONE finds it prop­er, nowadays, to condemn Ameri­can motion pictures, to look upon them with a jaundiced eye. Of course, i American motion pictures are, as a l rule, quite worthy of disparage; they
i i can often be boring, miscast and mis­
l 
directed. A more particular criticismi of American movies, again general­
i 
ized, is that they make no ethical contribution, that they are purely commercial and appeal to the escapist in all of us. But an ethical contribu­tion is not the absolute goal of all good art, and there is a sense in which an appeal to the escapist im­pulse is not always a destructive thing. Some movies demonstrate techniques interesting in themselves, demonstrate good acting, and good photography, and yet have no ethical contribution to make. Such a movie is The Lion. 
It is filmed in Africa; it features real bushmen ; there are real wild animals, most important of which, of course, is the lion, Zamba -quite tame but possibly quite aware of be­ing a lion, which is why director Samuel Engel hired big game hunter Tony Archer to oversee the produc­tion with a rifle and a revolver. The literal bestiality of the picture gives way to a thematic bestiality, and the technique by which this is rendered is something slightly amazing. The story concerns two connected "eter­nal triangles." The first is made up of Tina (Pamela Franklin) an eleven­year-old girl, King (Zamba), the lion, and another lion who is vying 
for King's affections. The second con­sists of Christine (Capucine), her di­vorced husband, Robert Hayward (William Holden), and her present game-warden husband, John Bullit (Trevord Howard). The two focal 
March 8, 1963 

points of the movie are Christine and King. Christine has wired her ex­husband to come to help her convince Bullit and Tina to send Tina away to school before she becomes too much like the animals with whom she is in everyday contact. Once he ar­rives, the dramatic tensions begin. Most obvious is the tension between the two "husbands"; it assumes the nature of a consistent game of oneupsmanship, thoroughly sophisti­cated, humorous, and still adequate in portraying the deeper underlying strife. Moreover, there is the tension created between deserted daughter and father, as Hayward finds him­self face-to-face with a very intelli­gent, bitingly critical daughter, who considers him an intruder. Then there is the appearance of a female 
lion who threatens to steal King away from his daily playmate, Tina. The entire action is set against a social disorder in the local tribe of natives, where a new chief is being prepared for his duties. 
The old chief is about to die, so, in keeping with tradition, the natives take him into the forest to be eaten by the vultures. Hayward happens along and refuses to let the old chief lie dying, takes him to the compound -against the wishes of Tina and Bullitt, who accept the uncivilized tra­dition as an element of life in the jungle. The old chief regains his strength and hurries to his camp, where his son, Oriunga, is reigning as chieftain (and has implicated the white people by choosing Tina for his wife). The old chief proclaims his son false, beaten back by his father's vehemence; Oriunga takes to the 
forest to kill a lion and become a real man. Naturally he comes upon King, who is with Tina. 
Tina orders King to kill Oriunga, and during the following fight -in­volving a lion, a native, and Tina -Bullitt, Christine, and Hayward appear. Bullitt, at the critical moment of the movie, shoots King; but Oriunga is dead. With these deaths, Tina is left alone; both opposing forces of her jungle world have been destroyed, and she is psychologically and sym­bolically ready to leave Africa. 
Thus Tina's bestial impulse is de­fined as the power the jungle had over her, not as her decision, not as the way she interprets and under­stands herself. And in a fine bit of dramatic technique the situation be­comes doubly strong; because Bullitt has killed King, he is alienated from and avoided by Tina, so that, the­matically, Tina rejects everything about the jungle in rejecting her big­game hunter "father." This disposes her to an acceptance of Hayward as her father, which -in a· sense, ironically -he is. 
Meanwhile, the not imperceptive Bullitt realizes that his world of people is his no longer; he makes plans to go hunting again, alone, and send Christine, Tina, and Hayward back to America to fare as they will. He had a choice to send Hayward away with Tina and keep his beauti­ful ,vife, for she had promised to re­main ,vith him if he let Tina go away to school But in a final resolu­tion of spirit he became self-conscious of his nature, and of the exclusive­ness of his way of life. The movie ends, then, on a sentimental note which ties up the only remaining loose end, Tina's hate for the now virtuous Bullitt. On the plane she hears animal noises behind her: two of her pets are on board, a gift from Bullitt. So that out of the two tri­angles come the elements of a happy 
family. Christine, who had, of course, loved Hayward all the while, is freed herself, and has freed her daughter from the somehow nonworld of the jungle. Order is re-established, and beast has been purged from everyone. The jungle has yielded a civilized product and sent it away. 
-JAMES DEVLIN 


The 







Tourney 

WHEN NOTRE DAME meets Bowling Green Monday night at Northwest­ern's McGaw Fieldhouse in the open­ing round of the NCAA Basketball Tournament, the two coaches and the two teams will differ considerably. 
The balding, bespectacled president of the National Association of Basket­ball Coaches will lead Bowling Green's Falcons. Harold Anderson, head coach, has guided the Falcons to an 18-6 season record and their second con­secutive Mid-American Conference championship. 
Bowling Green, however, was plagued by injuries and illness early in the season, and managed only eight victories in its first fourteen games. Flu struck the team at Christmastime during the Quaker City tournament in Philadelphia, with the whole team felled at one time or another; the squad was again crippled when leading scorer Howie Komives missed four games with a throat infection. 
But since semester break, the Fal­cons (much to George Ireland's dis­may) have been unbeatable. The surge has given Bowling Green ten straight wins, topped by its 92-75 rout of Loyola. 
Anderson plans nothing new in the way of strategy for his encounter with the Irish. "We plan to play our usual game," he says, "alternating our man to man with our zone defense as the occasion demands." 
Bowling Green's principal weapon is six-foot-eleven center Nate Thur­mond. Thurmond was selected on the second team in UPI and AP All­America balloting, and rated a first­team spot in the Sporting News tabulation. He scored 16 points in his earlier encounter with the Irish, trailing teammate Komives (who had 
17) for game scoring honors. He also led the MAC in rebounds, but was nosed out by Western Michigan's Manny Newsome for conference scor­ing honors. 
Anderson thinks Thurmond is "the best in the country" and "wouldn't trade him for Ohio State's Gary Bradds." Since it will be Thurmond and Komives who pace the Falcon attack on Monday night, they must be effectively contained. If not, Notre Dame fans will bemoan anew the departure of Larry Sheffield and Ron Reed.... 
As Harold Anderson's Notre Dame counterpart, John Jordan says, "We'll play our regular game against Bowl­ing Green," adding, almost as an afterthought, "and win." Jordan has coached the Fighting Irish through somefat (five previous NCAA tourney teams) and lean (recent) years, and this season came up with some All­America prospects and a 17-8 record. 
Jordan attributes Bowling Green's earlier conquest of the Irish to the fact that the game was played on the Falcons' home floor: "Bowling Green enjoys much the same advantage on their home court as we do here," he says. "We expect to beat them on a neutral court, and feel we can go right on to the championship. That's the only reason we accepted the bid. The team deserves to go to the tournament; the team as a whole finished with a 17-8 record, and these guys don't deserve to lose out on a chance to play in the NCAA tourna­ment just because of the ineligibility of two men." 
The Notre Dame mentor also feels that Bowling Green's Thurmond is much better on defense than offense: "He outstrips Walt Sahm only in strength; and. don't forget that Walt has two more years to develop." Notre Dame-Bowling Green statistics indicate their relative play: Thur­mond had 7 of 17 from the floor, made two of five free throws, and collected 12 rebounds; Sahm sank 7 of his 13 field goal attempts, his only free throw attempt, and pulled down 13 rebounds. Sahm, however, has re­bounded more effectively than Thur­mond in the season's last few games, and was prevented only by foul trou­ble from setting a new Chicago Sta­dium rebound record against Bradley. 
Notre Dame's makeshift squad has won five of its nine contests since semester break, a feat which Jordan labels "creditable." To win against Bowling Green, Ohio State, and Loyola, the Irish will have to play more than creditably, and will need 
what  Jordan  termed  "a. few  long  
sought  after  and  well  deserved  
breaks."  
--Joe Ryan  

SCOREBOARD 
Basketball: The Jordan-men out­
lasted small college power Evansville 
at home, then saw Bradley erase a 
12-point halftime deficit and win 72­
66 before 18,778 fans at Chicago 
Stadium. Finishing the season with a 
17-8 record, the Irish next face Bowl­
ing Green in the NCAA regionals. 
Swimming: Notre Dame's swim­mers closed the season with a 6-6 record, beating West Virginia but losing to strong Pitt. At Pitt, Notre Dame's Rory Culhane and Chuck Blanchard swept the freestyle events; Culhane was clocked at 5:27.9 for 500 yards, setting a new pool record and a new school record. 
Wrestling: Walloping Wheaton, the Irish matmen closed the season and snared their fifth win against two losses and one tie. Fred Morelli, Jack Barry, Ed Rutkowski, and Dennis Lahey all pinned their opponents. 
Fencing: The Air Force Academy boosted their dual match competition winning streak to 41 as Notre Dame fell to the Falcon toilers. The Irish are now 12-2. 
Track: Venturing into the East, Notre Dame's track team whipped Pitt 56-35, with Pete Whitehouse high jumping 6-5. The Salzman-Clark­Conroy-Carver two-mile relay team also took a first place at the Cleveland K of C Relays. 
Skiing: The Irish ski club earned a berth at the national championships as Notre Dame placed first in a ten­team field at the Central United States Ski Association meet.

On Monday a Notre Dame team with little chance of eventual 
success will face Bowling Green in the opening round of the NCAA Basketball Tournament. Even if the Irish can beat the tough Falcons, which seems likely, there is little reason for optimism about their chances in the tourney: they would then have to play the Big Ten champion and Loyola next week end. 
Even the tournament sites seem to be a bad omen: Notre Dame must play Bowling Green at Northwestern, a campus where the Irish have traditionally given high school athletic performances (the latest -last fall's football "game"), and must play the following week end at Michigan State, another favorite spot. All in all, Notre Dame's prospects are about as bright as the Fiesta Lounge on Saturday night. 
"If we still had Sheffield and Reed, we'd have a good chance in the tournament," is a cry which has been heard often this past month, and it's probably true; however, as usually happens in cases of key injuries or ineligibility, the performance of the rest of the team has fallen off. 
The single exception to this has been the play of Walt Sahm. Sahm has developed steadily from the inconsistent sophomore of the early season into a topflight rebounder; he has gained poise and confidence, and has become a steady if not spectacular scorer. 
Even with the improved play of Sahm and the continued clutch play of John Andreoli, this team has become merely a remnant of the squad which showed so much promise during the first sixteen games of the season. Its members have played as individuals during the last nine games; when some of these individuals were hot, the team won, but against tournament competition its basic flaws ,vill become all too apparent. 
All this has caused many people to wonder why, with tournament prospects so dim, Notre Dame accepted a bid: as Moose Krause said only a week before the acceptance, "We will only take a bid if we think we have a good chance for the championship." 
However, I feel that no matter how Notre Dame fares, it was a good move for the Irish to accept the bid, for one reason only: tourna­ment pressure is just what this team needs. This squad is still a year or two from reaching its full potential, and the experience merely of playing in the tournament cannot help but benefit the predominantly sophomore team. Therefore, even though Notre Dame may lose to Bowling Green or, more likely, at Michigan State, the fruits of this experience will be borne next season.

Love is a word which designates a package of elusive, painful, sublime, explosive forces which course untram­meled through psyches, philosophies, and poetries of various sorts. Among the difficulties involved in an abstract consideration of love (insofar as that freedom is given to man), the most persistent arises when the word "love" becomes something more than a word. This was the main defect in Dr. Otto Bird's discourse on love which was part of the Faculty Lec­ture Series 
Love, according to Dr. Bird, has three faces: beneficence, desire, and appreciation. Taken alone, if indeed they ever exist alone, they represent a spectrum ranging from God's love for man to an alcoholic's desire for liquor. Seen as three intersecting spheres, their confluence represents a land of love typified by a man's love for a woman and man's love for God. Several comfortable distinctions were made, such as "wine does not like, or love, an alcoholic," and Dr. Bird deftly dropped point after point into

all the proper slots. Then at the con­clusion of his lecture, having made a rather foggy delay of the self-love problem, he asserted that an indi­vidual does not love himself except in that he appropriates goods, includ­ing love, to himself. In other words, love of appreciation and love of de­sire are excluded, properly speaking, from self. 
The assumption implicit in this as­sertion is that tall men have a simi­lar conception of themselves and that this conception is a comprehensive one. It further assumes that men have meaningful relationships with one another and with the things of meri. But life among a race which has celebrated the death of God is a terribly lonely affair, and every man at one time or another meets a stranger in himself. 
"Alienation," as the term is used today by psychologists and philoso­phers, is a comparatively modern con­cept, though a problem at least as old as the Middle Ages. Self-aliena­tion in one sense refers to the state of an individual whose concept of his self has focused completely on one of its aspects. In effect, what this in­dividual thinks of as his identity operates upon him as would an en­tirely different person. Erich Fromm describes this as the "problem of the pseudo-self." It figures prominently in the work of psychoanalysts like Ernest Schachtel, and Karen Horney. Pirandello and Dostoevsky explicitly describe such characters. Yeats at­tributes the power of art to the ten­sion resulting from the artist's at­tempt to bridge the gap between him and his "other self." 
Do the relationships with the alienated self include love? Perhaps. On the surface, there appears to be no reason why the obsession of an in­dividual with a "self" he desires and supposes himself to possess could not be represented by Dr. Bird's three forces of love. On Sunday he wasted an important opportunity to investi­gate the question, because, as he said, "People don't go around saying, 'I love me.'" 
• Professor Wallace Fowlie, re­nowned critic and scholar of modern French literature, art, and culture visited Notre Dame last week and de­livered the first lecture of the Aca­demic Commission's Distinguished Lecture Series. Through Professor Fowlie's perceptive insight, Paris at the turn of the century, Pablo Picas­so's Paris, the Paris of the painters and poets of Montmartre, of No. 13 Rue Ravignan, was vividly re-created. 
In Paris, the first decade of the twentieth century was a time of ele-
The Scholastic' 

gant beauty, wealth and genius Wagner and Debussy in music, Ana­tole France and Mallarme in litera­ture, Bergson in philosophy; but it was the attraction of new ideas, dreams, and an extreme energy of ex­pression that brought Picasso to Paris. 
The most unassuming, yet leading exponent of a modern art, an art en­tirely his own, a creation of his ver­sion alone, Picasso forced a profound examination of the artistic principles of the nineteenth century, developed a new purity of expression -free, abrupt, and spontaneous. 
"A painter seeks to stir, not to teach," said Pascal. The writer is perhaps a teacher, is classified, ex­amined for a message, categorized simply because he uses words, words that people believe they understand­for they too use words; but a painter, a Picasso, writes without words, seeks only to show, never to convince or persuade. 
It was this time, Picasso's early years in Paris, the years of self­mastery, of the inner struggle to ar­ticulate and find self-expression, that Professor Fowlie pictured so vi­brantly: the wit, burlesque and banter of Max Jacob; the poet of distress, Appolinaire; that unity of purpose and idea of "la bande Picasso" ; their intensity, anxiety, energy and power; the long wall;<s, excited discoveries, individual theories, friendships and revolt -all the "genius of painting and poverty." 

The understanding and intimacy that Professor Fowlie has for these men, that "mingling of poet and painter," his appreciation for their vitality, their art, made his visit a memorable evening of personable and inspiring scholarship. 
• A bit of incidental intelligence: The Washington Day exercises brought warm praise to the University from Mrs. Elizabeth Paepcke, an aide who accompanied Ambassador Stevenson. In a letter Mrs. Paepcke praised Notre Dame seniors for their "ability to address a large audience, their polite­ness, good manners, enthusiasm, rev­erence for something, and sense of responsibility." She also made it known that if such was the result of a Catholic education, she would rec­ommend a Catholic education for all. 
Mrs. Paepcke, apparently, is not just a sayer. She has also sent a check for $500 to the Senior Class, asking the money be used in support of the Senior Class lecture series.

this is a place for the things of the mind." 
He said to me, "What good are you if you don't love nice things? How will you ever get anywhere? I, my­self, am not a college man; but I try to read as much as I can. These are things that count." He told me about the days of the first Father Cavanaugh and old Father Walsh, how they al­ways used to come to South Bend, used to know all the people. They were always ready to help those in need-they knew all the families who were in trouble during the depression. He continued to tell me about those old days with, as you probably expect me to say, a sense of nostalgia, as if he were not really part of this time and his home was in the past. The stories were sometimes stock, like the great trolley-car burning by the students back in the 20's, or the mass student riot which prevented the KKK from crossing the bridge into South Bend. Some of the stories I had not heard before-they were more on the personal side: stories of priests help­ing students in various ways. And as he talked, I realized that his dream of contact between college and city was not the same for the future as it was for the past, even though he did not realize this. The days are gone of the small city on the St. Joe River and the quiet, snow-covered campus where students lived together in dormitories under the gables of one massive old building. Then the University was everything to the city; there was a community, a sort of universal parish where the priests could freely move, gently counselling, watching the people. When both city and University were small, they could be closely together in spirit. And I think that this is what Mr. Stratigos had in mind. And yet, it seemed, as he talked, that he was really think­ing of a sort of economic agreement­perhaps I shouldn't say that-it wasn't really that harshly down-to-earth. But the sense of personality in the rela­tionship would be gone; of necessity, of course. For, as he said, there are too many people, too many students. 
I asked him why, after so many years, he was retiring from business. I asked him if he would not miss the students greatly. 
"Oh, you don't know how much," he said. His relations with the stu­dents over the years had really been a great part of his life; the students were wonderful; he admired and re­spected and loved them. He had been thinking of going into business again

COVER 

Steve Enright's Germany is a conglomeration of symbols and trade­marks, buildings and brows. Enright has tried to capture in his drawing something of the German soul -Volkswagons, eagles, buildings. What he came up with was the conglomeration mentioned in the first sentence.

too old-he had felt pains in his back 
and had dizzy spells. And his family 
then asked him to give up his business 
and retire. 
I asked him what he felt he had 
accomplished in his life. 
His answer was pretty much in economic terms ; this is, I suppose, what is to be expected from one who is, after all, a businessman. But there was more to what he said than just a sense of material achievement. He told me that he had for many years supported his parents and kept them in happiness and comfort. He had sent his children through college; one of them, he said, is an outstanding oral surgeon and the other a lawyer in South Bend. And he had personally helped several Notre Dame students, to whom he had taken a liking, to get through school and set up in business. j

He had always loved to help people; j he had never sent a man away from i >his door hungry. And he gave me this in the form of advice: you must do good to receive good. 
For all practical purposes, the inter­view was at an end. We discussed a few technical details about this article. Then he took me through his house and showed me pictures of some of his friends and relatives, people who had meaning for him. Some were dead, some were still alive; some were young; and some were old. As we went between two of his rooms, I noticed a front page of an old South Bend newspaper-it must have been from the WW I period. There was a headline and a large drawing of the young Mr. Stratigos with a bristling mustache. He apparently had a front page article about the economic implications of the war. 
"Ah, yes," his voice came from behind me, "you know Stratigos in Greek signifies 'general.' " It was a strange detail; I didn't quite catch the full import of it and he did not say much about it. There was a distinct sense of that "Greekness" about it that I had missed earlier; a sort of spell. 
I finally told Mr. Stratigos that it was time for me to be going. He came with me to the door, and as I was leaving, he took a small vase from a shelf and showed it to me. 
"This is what they make on the Isle of Corfu," he said. 
It was small and graceful, and matched labyrinthine patterns circled it in rings. As I went out into the dark and empty street, I heard the sound of music from the ice rink down at the corners.
