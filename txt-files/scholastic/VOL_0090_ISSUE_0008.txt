THE WEEK
By Bob Vierhile
Top of the Week
Massacre of the Northwestern Wildcats.
On Sportswriters
Once again the comparative-score circus is littering the sport pages of the nation’s newspapers. Biggest clown is one Gene Kessler, who performs his antics in the Chi Sun-Times. Using Gene’s act, which, at its best, is no better than Tom Dewey’s, Michigan rates the Geometric National Championship. “Look at what the Wolves did to Purdue,” says Mr. Kessler, “and how about Iowa, Navy, Northwestern . . . ?”
Gene, we know little about football and less about mathematics, but we do know you can’t compare two teams on an adding machine any more than you get sideline seats on the fifty at the New York Curb Exchange. Last week Wil-
liam & Mary knotted North Carolina (No. 3 in the AP poll, you’ll remember) with a 7-7 score. St. Bonaventure knocked off W & M 7 to 6 the week before. That makes St. Bonaventure, on the comptometer, the No. 3 team in the nation and Gene Kessler, in my book, the world’s worst accountant. To the wall with Kessler and his ilk, to the wall!
On Over-Eager Eager
I would be only too happy if this guy Eager would stay within the confines of the Tribune classified section. He almost kayoed this column this week by draping himself all over the preceding page. Next week, he’ll probably be pasted in the J. Paul Sheedy Wildroot ad, for having switched to Cream-Oil because he couldn’t stand the termites in his hair.
Dedicated to a Friend
Beneath the stars he told his love
The color left her cheeks,
But on the shoulder of his coat, It plainly showed for weeks.
Attention. 81st Congress
I’m in favor of a peacetime draft — limited to former sergeants and lieutenants.
Begged, Borrowed and Stolen
Overheard in the Michigan dressing room between halves: “Come on, you guys, get going! You’re playing like a bunch of amateurs.” . . . Notice on the biology bulletin board: “If the student who stole the alcohol in a glass jar out of lab 11A will return Al Capone’s appendix, no questions will be asked.” . . . Said the philosophy major: “Sic semper tyrannis, hell! Get your foot off my neck!”
Bottom of the Week
I never sausage a game.

Problem: To hold down costs, and speed the extension of telephone service.
Solution: High-strength wire whose use allows the span between poles to be increased from 150 feet to more than 300. One pole now does the work of two.
The problem, of course, is a continuing one for telephone people. High-strength wire with required electrical qualities is only one of many things they have developed to help solve the proolem in these days of high construction costs.
In total	developments are the reason
why telephone service here is the best in the world—the reason why a telephone call costs only a few pennies.

Cotillion Sales Soar
As Dance Date Nears
Cotillion ticket sales were booming this week as student interest mounted in anticipation of 1948’s big Sophomore class formal featuring the music of Elliott Lawrence. The neat white engraved bids were snapped up' in surprising numbers in the Dining Hall basement last week as upper classmen started their run on the week-old sales.
As the colorful night of November 26 looms but two weeks away, a great many of the 600 available bids have been secured. The fact that Lawrence’s ever-popular orchestra has been contracted to furnish smooth dance music in the Palais Royale has added an unexpected impetus to the sales. Undecided students with Cotillion ideas are urged to purchase their bids as soon as possible. Sales are still being conducted in the basement of the Dining Hall twice daily: from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., and from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m.
Permissions for the Cotillion night will extend to 2:30 a.m., the Department of Student Welfare announced last week. Students will be granted car permissions Thursday through Sunday, providing the license number of the vehicle is registered in the Student Welfare office. The Cotillion itself will begin at 9 p.m. Friday, November 26, and will extend to 1 a.m. the following morning. As in the past, admission to the dance will be up until 10 p.m., and departure will be optional after midnight.
The Blue Circle will sponsor a Victory Dance in the Navy Drill Hall the Saturday night after the Washington game. It is not a integral part of the Cotillion program, however, and is not included in the price of the bid. Gene Hull’s campus orchestra is slated to furnish the tunes for the evening. As usual, tickets will be sold at the door.
With the music of Elliott Lawrence, his featured vocalists, Rosalind Patton and Jack Hunter, his ever increasing
reputation for popular dance music, and combined with the ambitious program initiated by Co-Chairman Tom Logan and the Sophomore dance committee, a memorable night of entertainment can be expected by all Cotillion-goers come November 26.

Band to Top Navy Triumph With Halftime College Salute
Entering into the spirit of the afternoon, the Marching Band, under the direction of Mr. H. Lee Hope, has planned a colorful halftime show for tomorrow’s homecoming game.
The theme of the proceedings will be musical salutes to the various colleges of the University, five in all. Exact doings are still under wraps, since new ideas have been cropping up almost every day, and Mr. Hope wants to use only the best for a show which promises to better that put on in Baltimore for the Navy game. A running narrative, explaining the action, will accompany the formations on the field.
Biggest Test
Bowl Bound Big 9ers Battle Nation's Best
By BOB LEANDER
Coach Frank Leahy who hasn’t had a good crack at an ulcer since the Pardue game seven weeks ago, will have another go at it tomorrow. Northwestern’s rose-strewn athletes, garlands slightly ajar since a 28-0 trampling by Michigan, figure to extend the local talent for the second and last time this season
Always a scrappy riyal, the Wildcats enter the arena this season aided and abetted by first-rate material. In winning four- out of five conference games and two intersectional tiffs the Purple of Bob Voigts has exhibited a gimmick made famous by Elmer Layden. Saturday after Saturday in addition to displaying fine football the Cats have unloosed an obscure but uniformed competitor who has promptly caught fire.
Wildcat Stars Cause Trouble
Against Ohio State it was flashy John Miller, a sophomore halfback; Syracuse-felt the sting of one Armand Cureau who nabbed four passes for 85 yards and two touchdowns. Don Burson, ar. in-and-out quarterback, had his field day, too. Against a husky Minnesota outfit the 160-pound Burson watched his team lag 16 points behind. Warming up he engineered a 73-yard scoring drive before winging two second-quarter touchdown passes which iced a 19-16 Northwestern triumph.
Joe Zuravleff got off to a sizzling start grabbing seven passes before breaking his arm, but he has recovered sufficiently to resume the number one spot at left end encumbered by a couple of pounds of plaster of paris. Ed Tun-nicliff and Gasper Perricone have also shone brightly on several occasions-However, the greatest threat to Coach Leahy’s health — not to mention that of his minions — is the perennial Art Murakowski who once again leads the Wildcat offense with a total gain somewhere over the • 450-yard mark, an av-

Strange Sounds From the Main Building?
Relax, Lads — It's Only "Milky Way" Rehearsal
By CHARLES DULLEA
With the process of blocking the play now completed, the cast of The Milky Way has buckled down to the long pull ahead before opening night, November 28. One change has been made in the troupe, with James Beymer replacing Dudley Birder in the subordinate part of Wilbur Austin. The arduous grind of rehearsals continues from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday and practice is occasionally held on Saturday or- Sunday.
A casual passer-by outside Room 341 of the Main Building during rehearsal time might well wonder at the weird utterances issuing from within — harsh commands, cries of anguish, hilarious laughter, whisperings of love, and jangling telephone bells. If, throwing all caution to the winds, he entered, he might see something like the following:
The classroom is bare of chairs except a few used for “props.” Those are scattered here and there — four in a row forming a “sofa” in front center. This is the scene of the play, the living room of boxer Speed McFarland.
In the rear left is the phone table where Jack Powell, one of the two Speeds, is catching up with studies now that he is off-stage. Jack Keane and “Doc” Blume, both reporters in the show, are doing their homework in the rear center. In the “front row” sit Leonard Sommer, the director, and his staff. Sommers peers intently at the action, now berating, now cajoling his charges. Cigar smoke fills the room as Ed Goerner, in the role of Speed’s manager, Gabby, pleads with Pat McAteer (Burleigh Sullivan, the wallflower milkman) , to fight again.
Ed drops to his knees beside Pat’s chair and, in a last desperate roll of the dice, gasps that old chestnut, “Money .. . you know that doesn’t matter to me.” But Pat remains adamant: “I’ll never fight again!” (The exclamation point is unnecessary as Pat never speaks loud enough to scare a mongoose).
But with the the appearance on the scene of Gabby’s girl, Anne Westley, played by Martha Jo Harper, Pat has his mind changed for him. From a far corner of the room comes Sommer’s voice: “Play .it to the hilt — this is the real , seduction , scene.” Martha Jo, in brown skirt and snug yellow sweater, perches temptingly on the arm of Pat’s chair and . glides her supple fingers
through his wavy locks. Again comes the voice of Sommer, a figure in shirtsleeves and horn-rimmed glasses — “Be sure you dishevel his hair. Make it stand on end!” As is only natural, poor Pat, victim to a vamp, changes his mind about the fight and sex has done its work.
In the last scene, Pat, now champ, is blissfully contemplating his new business venture — a milk company employing St. Bernards — while the ex-champ’s manager, always the promoter, works feverishly to cut himself in on this new deal.
While the actors are always working against time, no spirit of tension or anxiety prevails. Pat is sometimes so stricken by his lines that he goes into gales of laughter. The cast is also diverted by the antics of Lou Garripo, who plays Spider, the trainer, in finding his correct spot on the stage. Tall, restless Ed “Gabby” Goerner is never seen without the stogie belonging to his part as Director Sommer makes him “kill” three during each rehearsal. This is just one of the director’s many insistences on absolute realism.
And now — on with the play!
Sell-Out Crowd Set For Gay K. of C. Ball
A hundred Knights of Columbus will whirl a hundred of the fair sex around the flooi* tonight in the annual K of C formal dance. Tony Ray, ticket manager, announced that nearly all of the bids had been snapped up by faithful knights and that the dance was a sellout affair.
This year’s dance, which is being held in the Erskine Park Country Club, is scheduled to be perhaps the most successful of all the Knights’ formals.
At the door the revelers will be met by the chairman, Jack Tuitt; Tony Ray; Jack Noonan, Grand Knight; and Bob Sullivan; with their dates. The entertainment at intermission will be in the nature of a wake for the Wildcats of Northwestern and their followers. To further insure gaiety late permissions have been granted to all dancegoers and bus transportation will insure that no one will be stranded at the far southside club.—Dan Brennan
Regilding of Golden Dome To Be Completed Next Week
The Reverend John J. Reddington, C.S.C., University faculty member* in charge of regilding the dome, announces that within a week the work will have been completed.
The unfavorable weather conditions have greatly prolonged the recoating process. Were it not for the recent onslaught of ■ rain and wind, the golden leaf would have already entirely enveloped the drab yellow paint.
After a $15,000 expenditure for 325 rolls of gold leaf and for the services of the R. J. Wolf Company of South Bend, the stately Dome is expected to retain its luster till about 1960.
WND to Air Rally For Stay-at-Homers
Big things are about to happen, even before the game tomorrow afternoon. WND, your campus radio station, will start the ball rolling tonight, with a special broadcast of the pep session, from the field house at rally time, 7:30 pan. Frank Cronan and company will be doing the honors for those of you who will be unable to attend the rally. Don’t forget, if you must be in your cubicle come rally hour, then tune in 630 on your dial at 7:30 for a first-hand account of the greatest, most gigantic rally since the Army game last year.
There has been an unexpected delay in bringing you the proposed morning show, “The Six-thirty Club.” The official word from Frank Cronan has it that WND will be doing the wake-up duties within a very short time, if a feasible program can be arranged amid present difficulties.

Dreamhouses, Clockwinders are Brainstorms As Campus Halls Vie For Decoration Honors
Fantastic and artistic shapes adorn the campus residence halls in celebration of the Decorations game tomorrow. A student’s mind running rampant and the hundred dollar maximum can produce anything from specters to angels and back again. Some were the ideas of a single student while others were the brainstorms of a committee.
Howard Hall takes over the theme: “Mr. Leahy Builds His Dreamhouse.” Pat Stanton suggested the idea of having a half-built house, using the prefab parts labeled the various teams Notre Dame encounters throughout the season. Coach Leahy and the team are the carpenters, painters, and other workers on the project.
Dick McDonald of Lafayette, Ind., won the prize in Morrissey Hall with his idea. Theirs will be the theme “Wind up the clock and put out the cat.” The cat of course is the Northwestern wildcat. The clockface will have the opponents’ names as the numbers.
A committee in Badin Hall makes use of the recent elections in their work. Taking a dig at the polls they have the Notre Dame team surrounded by unfavorable polls calling up Mr. Truman for some advice on “how he did it.” Even the Chicago Tribune will be represented featuring a wildcat victory.
CAPTAIN DANIS AND FATHER CAVANAUGH
Walsh Hall is having a robed religious along with Clashmore Mike treeing the Northwestern wildcat. This is the mental product of Bob Raley.
Bob Lynch of Winchester, Mass., designed the Triumphant Arch to be used by Dillon Hall. The Arch should be about , twenty-four foot high and will be placed over the walk in front of the hall.
Alumni Hall is undecided. Their plans include either a steam roller running over a wildcat or a bowling alley with the wildcat team as the pins. The final decision remains to be seen.
Over on the east side of the campus the decorations are just as imaginative. The freshmen in Farley have borrowed the barrage balloon that flies over downtown South Bend and have worked that into their scheme. The basket underneath the balloon contains the National Championship and the ones holding it down are the teams Notre Dame has yet to play. The beaten ones lie on the ground. This was the work of a hall committee.
Farley’s next door neighbor, Breen-Phillips goes mechanical as they construct a machine which accompanied by blinking lights and noise converts the Northwestern team into links of sausage. Riley Lohr of Evanston, HL, dreamt this one up.
Cavanaugh Hall, too, has been un
decided. Their two alternatives are “Moose” Fischer blowing bubbles containing the past season’s scores, or a boiling pot fired by the Irish team with a smoke bomb in the fire.
And last one on the list is Zahm Hall with a building high football player strangling, a wildcat.
Managing Editors Adjourn Meeting to See ND and Game
An influx of more than 300 managing editors of daily newspapers will converge upon the campus tomorrow afternoon, following the annual meeting of the Associated Press Managing Editors’ Association in Chicago. .
The editors will be the University’s guests for the Northwestern game and also will be taken on short tours of the campus with journalism students acting as guides. They will be greeted officially by the Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., and other University officials.
NROTC Breakfas+ers Hear Fr. Cavanaugh
Highlighting the first annual Communion breakfast of the Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corps last Sunday morning was the appearance of Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., as guest speaker. Father Cavanaugh stressed the friendly relation between the Navy and the University in his “fireside chat” with the assembled middies.
Father Cavanaugh lauded the work of Captain A. L. Danis, the Commanding Officer of the Unit, and the former C.O.’s, who have made the Notre Dame NROTC Unit the top unit in the country for the past few years. He attributed part of this success to the fact that the spirit of discipline of Notre Dame and that of the Navy coincide very closely.

In the passing department where Frank Tripucka completed seven out of nine last week to boost his average near the .600 point, Northwestern has connected on 37 of 87 pitches for a .425 record. Of more significance perhaps is their opponents’ dismal aerial showing, 33 of 101 for a .369. It would seem either the opposition has been throwing left-handed or Capt. Alex Sarkisian is spearheading a tight pass defense. Sarkisian, several times on the verge of All-American acclaim only to sustain injury, is winding up his collegiate career with a final and very convincing attempt to crash the Glory team.
The least that may be said for the invaders is that they’re loaded. Their forward wall averages 204 pounds and their backs entirely too many touchdowns an afternoon.

As for the Irish, their passing attack never looked better this season than it did last week against Indiana. Tripucka hit both Wightkin and Gay with long arching touchdown aerials. His ground attack was somewhat hampered when Mike Swistowicz was heaved by the officials on the first play of the ball game following harsh words with a Hoosier. However, as a fast look at the final 42-G count will prove, Frank Spaniel, Dick Cotter, Jack Landry and Leo McKillip teamed with Gay and Panelli to give the Irish an easy, though not painless, victory.
Emil Sitko suffered bruised ribs, Marty Wendell a recurrence of his shoulder injury and Bill Higgins, who broke into varsity ball for the first time replacing Wendell, limped from the field after the Hoosiers held a parade over his left knee. Whether Ernie Zalejski, the Notre Dame myth, and Terry Brennan will be able to play remains for the late editions of the South Bend Tribune to make known.
DON BURSON ... Star for a Day
By JIM HOWARD
For the second consecutive week, Notre Dame will play host to one of the nation’s top cross country contests when the Central Collegiate championships are held here tomorrow at 11 a.m. over the Irish four-mile course. The battle will be the last home affair for the Notre Dame harriers before they compete in the nationals at East Lansing on November 22.
In addition to Notre Dame, six other schools are sending teams to tomorrow’s meet which unofficially decides the top mid-western cross country team outside of the Big Nine. The list of contestants is headed by a Michigan State squad which has wreaked havoc in the cross country duels held to date. The strength of the team is tempered by the fact that the Spartans are striving to do the impossible. They are splitting the team into two groups, sending one to the IC4A championships in the East. If the Lansing aggregation can win both of the runs they will be top favorites to capture the national title over their own course. Other teams competing are Drake, the defending champions, Marquette, Michigan Normal, Western Normal, Western Michigan, and Bowling Green of Ohio.
Drake won the C.C.C. title last year when the Irish were delayed by a train wreck on the way to Des Moines. The Irish were top favorites to take the title last year, and because of the Michigan State squad split, they may be able to accomplish the feat this year. This will be the first time the four-mile grind has been held at Notre Dame.
Notre Dame surrendered their Indiana Big State title to Indiana U. in a fierce struggle over a plodding rainswept N.D. course last Friday. The Hoosiers scored 36 points in winning, to 48 for Purdue, and 67 for the Irish. Dave Dewitte led the triumphant team by win-

As Told to Jack Williams,
Daily NORTHWESTERN
I am Willie the Wildcat. I live in a stadium on the shores of Lake. Michigan deep in the wilderness of the metropolitan jungles of northeastern Illinois.
I have been asked to predict the outcome of the football game between my masters and the masters of Clashmore Mike II, some insignificant little pup. These men live in a far off land about 85 miles from my home via the South Shore line. They go to a school called Notre Dame, which translated into English means “Hall of Football.” It is said that these men are the fighting Irish— but I doubt it!!!
I have already clawed up some Uclans, smashed some Boilermakers and chewed up the Golden Gophers this year. 1 also blossomed the Orangemen from Syracuse, cracked some Buckeyes, and dug up the Badgers. One day, however, I was hunting more victims over on the side of Lake Michigan and a whole pack of Wolverines attacked me by surprise, so I lost that game.
Tomorrow I will satisfy my long-frustrated appetite for Irish stew. I only hope I don’t get indigestion from Swistowicz, Zmijewski, Panelli, and Tri-pucka, some of the Irish flavoring in the stew, because I want to be particularly vicious when I go to Pasadena on New Year’s Day to see my masters win the Rose Bowl game.
{Editor’s Note'. Clashmore Mike II, is still AWOL and could not be reached for a comment on Willie’s routings. The Athletic Office refxised to comment on reports that Mike is doing some undercover scouting of the Washington Huskies.)
Shy Little Violets
Now that we have lulled the basketball schedule makers into a false sense of security with words of thanks we will slip in a few complaints.
We will admit that the home schedule this year is the best in three years. The Notre Dame Barn, alias the Fieldhouse, will feature Illinois, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Denver (and Boryla) and St. Louis (and Ed Macauley). This is a tasty menu of premium basketball.
But how come:
1.	NYU won’t leave its Manhattan environs to meet the Irish at home? There is nothing better than fresh country air for smog-choked city lungs. We outlanders are just as anxious to see the big city boys perform as the New York alumni is to see the Irish. Couldn’t an alternating schedule be arranged with NYU and one other New York college so that the Irish would play each year in the Garden and at the same time we could see one of the metropolitan teams in action? We will even pipe stale cigar smoke into the Fieldhouse to make them feel at home. Or we could play host at the Chicago Stadium and we wouldn’t have to pipe in the smoke — but arrange the schedule so the students can get to Chicago for the game.
2.	BOTH games with Northwestern
SPLINTERS from the Press Box
By Harry Monahan
are being played in Chicago? The reluctant Wildcats are the only team which the Irish play twice that doesn’t put in an appearance on the local court. It looks like the promoters at the Chicago Stadium have sold the Irish a bill of goods and are hoarding some of the best basketball games of the year.
Musings at Halftime
Michigan 35, Navy 0. Hmmm, seven from 41 equals, well, what do you know, 34! What happened, Benny? You can try again this week against Indiana.... Despite all the advice from the press Coach Leahy is doing his own schedule making. Tulane will be back next year, SMU will sign in either ’49 or ’50. There is no need to worry about USC getting cold feet and dropping us because UCLA is just waiting for the chance to reap the profits of a stadium packed to see the Irish. . . .
Prediction of the Week
It looks as though Northwestern will be the guinea pig in the national grid race this year replacing the Trojans. No Northwestern-Notre Dame game is complete without rain, wind and a slippery field, but the Wildcat is going to be more than water-logged when he slinks back to Evanston. Notre Dame 35, Northwestern 6.

Cavanaugh Rolls Over Zahm, 30-0
Showing overwhelming power and speed, Cavanaugh Hall dumped Zahm out of the east-side championship contention. Precision passing, and devastating down-field blocking marked the winner’s play in a 30-0 rout.

yard end-around dash behind perfect blocking. In the second quarter Cavanaugh cut loose through the air, and Bob Barrett hit Bill Eggers with a pass in the end zone.
Cavanaugh scored three times in the last half. Bob Culligan went twenty yards, “Augie” Gentilucci fifteen, and Fred Bove scored on a ten-yard pass from Bob Barrett. Jim Driscoll, a guard, lost a chance to break into the scoring column when his 30-yard pass interception run-back was nullified by a clipping penalty.—Bill Riley
Morrissey. Lyons Battle to Scoreless Tie
Playing on a muddy field in a driving
rain, Morrissey and Lyons vetoed each others bid for their first victory of the season by battling to a scoreless tie.
Besides its first victory, Morrissey was attempting to rack up its first touchdown of the season. Late in the second period, it seemed as if Morrissey would achieve one of its goals. After recovering a Lyons fumble on the enemy 30, it put on a concerted drive downfield, only to be stymied on the 10-yard line by the gun ending the first half. This was the closest either team came to registering a tally.—J. Meaney
Walsh Drops St. Ed's in Close Game, 12-0
Playing in a driving rain, Walsh Hall kept their championship hopes alive by toppling St. Ed’s Hall 12-0. This was Walsh Hall’s third consecutive victory and it places them in a first place tie with Cavanaugh Hall.
Walsh was on the offensive most of the first half but it was not until late in the second period that they could score. Taking the ball at midfield they drove down to St. Edward’s 15-yard line. Bill Nolden swept around end for the score. The try for the extra point was blocked.
The third quarter found Walsh on the move again. . This time they went 60 yards for a score with Don Jost carrying the ball the last four yards.—Frank Ronnenberg -
Puritans Cop Volley Title
Sweeping through their- schedule without defeat, the New England Club annexed the campus volleyball championship. Runner-up honors went to the Rhode Island Club to make it a clean sweep for that section of the country.
Neither team had trouble in disposing of Breen-Phillips, Cavanaugh, Farley, and Sorin and both were undefeated when they met for the championship. In this all important game, the New England club managed to score one more point than the boys from Little Rhody, winning by a score of 2-1 to clinch the title.—Jack Meaney
Loyal Cafeteria Prophets Foresee Wildcats' Demise

Don Atkinson, Hempstead, N. Y.— N.D. 27, N’western 14. “Northwestern will score twice: once against the regulars and once against the reserves.”
Don Lee, Poughkeepsie, N. Y. — N’western 33, N.D. 12. “The Irish might score against the Wildcat second team. Everybody thought Dewey would win, too.”
Harriers Face the Best

Jim Kittell was the first Irish scorer, finishing in seventh position. The other Notre Dame finishers were Bill Leonard, eighth; Lou Tracy, 15th; Lou Lepry, 16th, and Tony Da Damio, 21st.
In the Little State competition held at the same time, Ball State Teachers of Muncie was victorious with 27 points, Anderson was second with 50, and Manchester took third with 104. The field of approximately 70 runners was the largest ever to compete in the affair.
Jim Kelly of the Irish ran for the first time this season in the Indiana run, and although he finished out of the scoring, he was close enough to the top to cause Coach Elvin R. Handy to harbor hopes for a good showing in the Central Irish will again be represented by Jim Collegiates. In addition to Kelly, the Murphy, Jim Kittell, Bill Leonard, Lou Tracy, Lou Lepry, and Tony Da Damio. —Jim Howard

Hall phones have been a blessing to the student but a plague to the University switchboard operators who must answer the queries for the numbers of the phones. Therefore, to ease the burden of Mr. Bell’s subjects, the Scholastic offers this list; clip it out and, in the future, refer to it instead of asking the operator for a number.

Senior Class Maps Plans For January Grads' Formal
At a meeting of the January Seniors last week, plans were laid for a revolutionary winter formal, believed to be the first of its kind ever held at Notre Dame.
According to present plans, the midyear graduates will dance to the music of a yet-to-be-decided orchestra in the Palais Royale’s spacious ballroom on the night of January 28. That would be the Friday night just prior to the weekend of graduation ceremonies.
John Fogarty has been named general chairman of the dance. Assisting him with the dance preparations will be the following seven committee chairmen: Orchestra, Charles Boult; Tickets, Dick Hamilton; publicity, Joe O’Brien; program, Tom Healy; housing, Norm Gardner; decorations, Tom Barber, and business manager, Tom Brown.
One of the principal objectives of the dance committeemen is to hold the price of bids to a minimum. “Under five dollars,” according to Joe O’Brien. The dance itself is designed by experienced hands at Notre Dame social functions to provide a pleasing send-off for fellow classmates. More definite plans will be forthcoming.	•

Conference Presents Elijah
Rehearsals for the choral presentation of Mendelssohn’s Elijah are to be held November 16, in Room 108 of Central High School, from 7:30 until 9:00 p.m. Notre Dame students are invited to attend and join the proposed 200-voice chorus, directed by Dr. George Tenney.
The Elijah will be presented at the Palace Theatre, on February 24, by the South Bend-Mishawaka Round Table of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, as a feature of the local observance of Brotherhood Week.
Final audition and general rehearsal to choose soloists will be held at the South Bend YMCA on December 5th at 3:00 pan.
Losses Greater Than $1300 As Student Trip Dance Flops
Some scattered returns had still not been taken into account this week, but it was fairly certain that the Student Relief Victory Dance in Washington over the Student Trip week end had resulted in a loss of $1300.
Reasons for the financial failure of the ball were attributed to various sources. According to one official of the Washington, Maryland and Virginia club, expenditures were far greater than had

been expected. Although about 1,000 couples attended the dance (estimates by the club and unofficial guesses by the management of the Uline Arena differed somewhat), a much larger number would have been needed to clear expenses.
Various opinions were offered on the reason for the comparatively small turnout. Thick pea-soup fog kept dance patrons from Baltimore and other near-by cities at an absolute minimum. Also, long distance planning of the affair resulted in some confusion among several colleges as to the purpose of the dance.
According to the sponsors of the dance, the losses will be underwritten by the NFCCS.

They said, "You can’t do it!"
But Du Pant scientists developed a synthetic rubber with superior properties
‘'Synthetic rubber is an impossibility at any price!” declared a noted European scientist a number of years ago. And most people were inclined to agree because for more thana century chemists had been unable to duplicate natural rubber.
Du Pont scientists knew that all rubber had bad qualities as well as good. "Why struggle to duplicate its faults?” they asked. "Why not find a new chemical compound with all the good qualities of rubber, but none of the bad?”
They took as their starting point a discovery by Dr. J. A. Nieuwland of Notre Dame in connection with the polymerization of acetylene. By modifying this process, they made monovinyl acetylene. Adding hydrogen chloride, they made a new chemical compound called chloroprene— a thin, clear liquid at low temperatures. Like isoprene, it polymerized to form a rubber-like substance. But the new material, now known as neoprene, required no sulfur for vulcanization and was superior to rubber under many service conditions.
Today neoprene production is measured in millions of pounds a

year, even though it is priced higher than natural rubber. Hardly an industry is not now using it, for such good reasons as these: neoprene products resist deterioration by oils and greases. They stand up under exposure to direct sunlight. Their aging and flame-retarding properties also are superior to those of rubber.
Three types of Du Pont research Modern research involves time, money, manpower. To develop neoprene, for example, took six years of laboratory study, a research and development expenditure of millions of dollars, plus the work of skilled research chemists,physicists,engineers, and other scientists.
AtDuPont,researchis continuous. Some of it is designed to develop new products or processes; some to improve existing products or processes; and the balance is fundamental research to uncover basic facts without regard to immediate commercial use. Each of ten manufacturing depart-mentshasits own research staff and is operated much like a separate company. In addition, the Chemical and Engineering Departments, which are not engaged in manufacturing operations, conduct research in the interests of the Company as a whole.

may include physicists, chemists, chemical and mechanical engineers, eachofwhom brings specialized training to bear on a specific phase of the subject. The man who joins one of these teams finds himself associated with some of the ablest minds in the profession and receives the opportunity and friendly support needed to make fullest use of his capabilities.
