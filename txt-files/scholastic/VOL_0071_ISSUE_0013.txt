ENGINEERS PREPARE ANNUAL BALL
•
The Engineers, on Feb. 4, will set aside their slide rules and drawing boards to attend the annual Engineers’ Ball. The place for the dance has yet to be determined. However, it will be held at either the Palais Royale or at the Jefferson Plaza.
George Schlaudecker, president of the Engineers, has appointed Raymond Fiedler as general chairman of the affair. Schlaudecker has also appointed chairmen to the other committees which are now actively preparing their respective assignments.
The music committee, under the chairmanship of Bill Mehring, will soon announce the orchestra chosen to play at the Ball. Assisting Mehring on the music committee are Don Duffy, Dick Hennessey and Charles Metzger.
John Poore is chairman of the ticket committee and assisting him are Clark Keen, John Wilson, and Walter Monacelli. The patrons committee is headed by Charles Welsh with John Ward, Melvin Lambrecht and Felix Toner aiding.
Those responsible for the decorations of the hall are Chairman Charles Slyngstad, Frank Kirchman, Clayton Jodon and Richard Steuve. The publicity for the dance is being handled by Chairman Abe Zoss with Bob Reilly, John Goncher and Robert Witcher helping him. Frank Kesucke is in charge of the program committee. Those serving with him are Lawrence Eby, John Berteling and Thomas Fitzgerald.
New Year's Eve Story
Anxiously awaiting a summons to court up in Wisconsin is one of outnumber as a result of his witnessing a policeman bat someone over the head at a night spot on New Year’s Eve. The person hit has lost his memory, and if he doesn’t regain it soon there will be a trial. Out-friend’s position is that of life-long friend of both assailed and assailant. The policeman asked him to come to court, but he hastily packed and left for school, arriving here a day early. He’s bemoaning the possibility that the trial may be set for Jan. 26-29, in which case he will have to postpone his semester examinations.
GROW, CASTRO DISCUSS PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNMENT AT POLITICS SYMPOSIUM
By Fred E Sisk
Politics claimed the attention of the University Tuesday afternoon in Washington Hall with a symposium on the subject of good government. Participating were Commander H. B. Grow, U.S.N., retired of Detroit, Mich., and Hon. Hector D. Castro, minister to the United States from the Republic of El Salvador.

Presides at Symposium.
Glee Club to Chicago
The Grand Ballroom of the Palmer House, Chicago, will be the scene of the University Glee Club’s first concert in the second semester, on Jan. 23. The concert will be given for the Chicago members of the National Council of Catholic Women. The public is invited.
The second appearance, on Feb. 4, will be at Culver Military Academy, Culver Ind., according to James Murphy, business manager.
Plans for the coming band trips will soon be announced.
New Lungs
At long last dear old Washington Hall has become the recipient of a heating system worthy of the name. New ventilators were installed during the vacation, and their efficiency was proven at the performance "Spotlight Sketches.”
Commander Grow chose as his subject, “The Divine Significance of the Constitution,” in which he asserted, “The Constitution was inspired by God so that we could live in peace and harmony, and the only one element in which we can be united is in the spirit of God.”
He explained that the same problems of government are present under any system of government in any part of the world. Continuing, he traced the history and growth of constitutional government in the Unitea States and in the countries south of us in Central America. By quoting several passages from the Constitution the speaker showed that this document meant a government for the people, and further, that such rights have been guaranteed to the body politic by the Bill of Rights.
In the formation of the Declaration of Independence and of the Constitution Commander Grow singled out several incidents that seemed to indicate that divine aid was helpful in the completion and application of each. “As long as the people in America observe the principles of God,” he concluded, “this country will remain; if we abandon them, our nation will vanish.”
In his discussion of the topic, “Materialism—the Enemy of Peace,” Dr. Castro said, “Materialism is in itself a cause of war, because it incites the passions of men instead of restraining them. Materialism is a school of thought that has. a bearing in all human affairs. It does not take any pains in proving its premises, and it aids in the fall of religion.”
He showed the concrete influence of materialism in our modern world through education, radio, the movies, and literature. In connection with education he warned. “In some cases, through the secularization of educa-cation, education has gone contrary to religion and produced a degree of ■ (Continued on Page 23)

FORTY OPPONENTS SCHEDULED FOR VARSITY DEBATE SEASON STARTING NEXT MONTH
By Graham Starr
The varsity debating schedule for 1938, announced this week by Coach William J. Coyne, conforms with the recent “tough schedule” policy of the University in athletic lines. A group of at least 40 debates are booked for a two-month period beginning Feb. 24.
teams as Michigan State, Princeton, Holy Cross, Villanova, and Vermont. On Feb. 25 and 26 the Manchester tournament will provide as opponents 12 different teams from all over the country. Last year, the Notre Dame squad won nine of the ten engagements at this tournament. About eight more teams will be met at the University of Iowa tournament on March 3, 4, and 5.
The varsity teams, both “A” and “B” chosen by elimination tryouts before the holidays, consist of Albert Funk, Frank Fitch, Charles Colgan, and Frank Parks, affirmative; and Tom Mulligan, Charles Osborn, Milton Williams, and Frank Brame, 1 negative.	I
The question for debate is:
“Resolved: That the National Labor Relations Board should be empowered to enforce arbitration of all industrial disputes.”
“The wording of the question makes it necessary that debaters be prepared to meet different interpretations,” Mr. Coyne stated in discussing the fine points of the question.
The present team has a large order to fill in following the footsteps of veteran debaters Robert Schmelzle, and Dick Meier, who graduated last year. Both served on the varsity for three years.
The schedule:
Feb. 24—Villanova College (here, tentative).
Feb. 25, 26-—M a n c h e s t e r College tournament for both A and B squads (Manchester, Ind.)

"Dome" Staff Continues To Take Pictures
With the end of the vacation period the staff of the Dome, under the direction of Editors Frank Reppen-hagen and James Raaf, has resumed its task of preparing the 1938 yearbook for publication.
Not all of the seniors have had their pictures taken for the Dome as yet, according to Reppenhagen. Senior photographs will be taken on Feb. 2 and 3 in the basement of Walsh Hall at the usual time, and all seniors who have not yet been photographed are requested to reserve some time for an appointment on one of these days. Notices will be placed in the halls at that time, and a representative of the Dome will also call on those wishing to make appointments.
Some time early in February the Dome staff will begin the task of taking the pictures of the various campus clubs. The presidents of all the clubs that were active on the . campus last year will receive notice soon through the mail, while the presidents of all new campus clubs are asked to get in touch with Robert Parks, at 337 Dillon Hall, concerning their . club’s pictures.
BAND FORMAL TO BE HELD TONIGHT
•
It’s top hat and uniforms as the Notre Dame Band swings out for its first formal dance in ten years, at the Columbia Athletic club, from 9 to 12 tonight. Bob Widmar’s radio broadcasting orchestra of Law Ball fame will produce the strains, sweet and low, for the vacationing band-i sters. The Widmar organization is a j favorite in the colleges and universi-; ties of this section of the country.
। Price of tickets is $2.00, and all j juniors and seniors are invited to attend. Corsages have been banned. Managers of the dance are Robert Holtz, drum major, and James M. Murphy, band president.
Arthur Davidson, Greenville, Miss., has written a theme song especially for the event.
Committee heads for the dance are: Tom Sheils, publicity; Leo Boyle, patrons; Robert Richards, program; William Jordon, music; and Henry Theis, dance committee.
Engineers Show Film
Tonight at 8:00 o’clock the Civil Engineers’ club of Notre Dame will present ' an educational sound film concerning the construction of the “Golden Gate” bridge, which was recently completed at San Francisco, California.
A great deal has been written and said about this magnificent structure. One of the most publicized features was a “safety net” which reduced greatly the dangers inherent in construction work of this type. The net justified itself on several occasions, saving the lives of many unfortunate workmen who would otherwise have plunged to their deaths in the waters of the bay.
The Engineers have a special interest in the bridge, a marvelous feat of engineering skill. The Civil Engineers’ club urges all of the students in the School of Engineering, especially its own members to be present. Because the lecture included in the film is of a non-technical nature, all other students who wish to see the picture are most welcome.
The film will last approximately 45 minutes and will go into minute detail concerning many unique features of this gigantic span. The showing will begin promptly at 8 o’clock in the auditorium of the John F. Cushing Hall of Engineering.
Circulating Library
Chester P. Sadowski, St. Edward’s Hall, has organized an informal circulating library for his hallmates. Subscribing to several magazines, he stamps his name and address on each one, and then gives them out. After passing from friend to friend, they are eventually returned to the owner.

N. D. Colors Honored
For the first time in many years the state of Indiana will deviate from its policy of alternating its automobile license plate colors from the cream and crimson of Indiana university to the black and old gold of Purdue, when the Notre Dame colors of old gold and blue come out on the license plates for 1939. Announcement of the selection of the colors was made recently by Governor M. Clifford Townsend and Frank Finney, head of the automobile license division of the state.

Colored Pianist Gives Hall Performance
•
“The University of Notre Dame presents Tourgee DeBose, pianist.” This statement stated simply the announcement of the most significant piano recital presented at Notre Dame in the past few years. The few students, who were present at Washington Hall last Monday evening, were aware of the human interest element in the recital, given by Mr. DeBose, a Negro pianist.
Mr. DeBose, a short, thin, slightly round-shouldered man, strode across the stage promptly at eight o’clock, and began an excellent recital. Mr. DeBose had been preceded by critics which stated that he is the only member of his race to approximate a fine artistry in his playing. Those present Monday night were well aware that Mr. DeBose at least had attained the “fine artistry.” As a pianist Mr. DeBose has advanced far, and in doing so has increased the prestige of his race. On this score Mr. DeBose is to be congratulated and encouraged.
The recital itself was very well received. The program follows:
Impromptu in F Sharp, Chopin; Etudes, F minor, F major, Chopin; Preludes, Nos. 21, 22, 23, Chopin; Idyll, MacDowell; Reflets dans leau, Debussy; Barcarolle, Op. 47, Liadow; Prelude in A minor, Debussy; Scar-bo, Ravel; Gondolier, Liszt; Un sos-piro (A sigh), Liszt; Hungarian Rhapsody No. 8, Liszt.
"Scrip" Out Next Week
The deadline for the submission of all material for the next publication of Scrip has been set for Jan. 16. This year’s second publication of Scrip leaves the press on Friday, Jan. 21.
As has been the custom during the past few years, a section will be devoted to freshmen sketches. Charles Nelson, editor of Scrip states, “Freshmen contributions are always distinctly encouraged.” Articles to be featured in the issue were not announced by Nelson.
was witnessed by more than 1,000 guests who came from all parts of the country to pay tribute to the Fighting Irish leather-luggers of 1937.
Warren Brown, sports editor of the Chicago Herald and Examiner and dean of the after-dinner speakers, made his third appearance as toastmaster of the occasion. He was introduced by Louis Chapleau, president of the St. Joseph Valley Notre Dame club. Brown, master of oratorical quips and quibbles, presented a program featuring many national sport and civic notables.
Speaking honors went to Rev. Robert J. White, former football player at Boston College, Harvard graduate, and present dean of law at Catholic University. Notre Dame was repre-

PHOTOGRAPH BY ALUMNUS IS FEATURE DISPLAY IN ART DEPARTMEN'S PICTURE EXHIBIT
SPOTLIGHT SKETCHES WIN APPROVAL
By Vernon Sneider
A photograph by a Notre Dame alumnus, Frank Oberkoetter, ’32, of Peoria, Ill., is one of the works in the Photo Exhibit now on display in the Catalogue Room of the University library. The exhibit consists of the works of the members of the Photographers Association of America. This association
draws is members from the outstanding professional photographers in the country and deals with Portrait, Commercial and Illustrative photography.
Among the pictures on display are several by internationally famous photographers. Sweden is represented by several fine portraits by Curt Gbt-lin and Edward Welinder. Japan is represented by an outstanding child study. There are also numerous works from Canada and Holland, as well as, several American pictures which have won national contests.
Several examples of Commercial, illustrative and industrial photography are on exhibit. One of the most striking industrial photos is a scene taken from the steel mills. Commercial photography is represented by professionally posed pictures, which may appear later in national magazines.
The student is afforded the unique opportunity to view these photographs through the University Art department. The Art department is affiliated with the Photographers Association of America and thus has the privilege of exhibiting the pictures. The exhibit, which is on display until Jan. 18, rounds out completely all types of work done by the organization. It is the hope of Professor Stanley Sessler to have a similar exhibit of landscapes, seascapes and still life some time in April.
"Gator" Men Form Club
The most southern group of the southern boys at Notre Dame have formed the Florida Club. About 20 men form the membership, and the charter is in the process of being acquired. The aim is to give Notre Dame a big “blow” in Florida.
The inaugural meeting saw plans of organization carried out. Frank Kelly, junior of St. Ed’s, was elected president; Al Kiefer, junior of Howard, was selected as vice-president; Al Burns, sophomore of Badin, was chosen secretary. Christmas activities were considered, and plans were made for a dance and Communionbreakfast. The Miami group of this club plans to see Fred Snite and Dick Swisher, who are in the Miami area.

A.S.M. Hears President Give Tool Talk
On Wednesday evening, Jan. 12, the University was privileged to have present at the chapter meeting of the American Society of Metals, Mr. George B. Waterhouse, national president of the society.
Mr. Waterhouse was bom in England, and received his early training at the Sheffield Technical College from which he graduated in 1903. He came to America on one of the “1851 Exhibition Scholarships” and took graduate study at Columbia University until 1905. In that year Mr. Waterhouse became associated with the Lackawanna Steel Company and remained with the company until 1922 when he was elected to the Chair of Metallurgy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1907 and was later distinguished with an honorary degree of Doctor of Metallurgy from Sheffield College.
Mr. Waterhouse has been a frequent contributor to the metallurgical literature of the last quarter century, being chiefly concerned with the metallurgy of carbon and alloy tool steels, the subject of his address Wednesday evening. He briefly reviewed the historical methods and properties of tool steels and discussed the heat treatment and high-frequency electrical furnaces, the details of which were further illustrated by pictures.
Emblazoned by the ray of a powerful spotlight against the somber background of a large dark curtain, John McMahill and his talented 14-year old protege, Jeffrey Mongerson, last Friday night enacted a new kind of drama before a large audience in Washington Hall.
The unusualness of the Spotlight Sketches did anything but detract from them. Short, dramatic, witty and well - acted, they delighted the audience and proved that they deserve a special niche in the theater.
Although a plain background is not new in the theater, Mr. Mc-Mahill’s use of the spotlight, almost complete absence of stage properties, shortness of the sketches and his clever use of dialogue, added a quality that made up for any lack of imagination that a person could have.
Together, Mr. McMahill and Mr. Mongerson enacted six sketches, ranging from heavy drama to the lightest comedy, while the seventh was played by Bobby Boswell who will replace Mr. Mongerson next year.
By far the best sketch of the evening was the “Death of a Dope Addict,” which was enacted almost en-timerly by Mr. McMahill. Five days in London’s Chinatown and a month of writing was the penalty paid by Mr. McMahill for producing this sketch.
In introducing the program, Rev. Eugene Burke, C.S.C., expressed the hope that the University Theater would be able to produce like sketches written by undergraduates later in the year.
Labor Talk Opposed
At the last meeting of the Academy of Politics held before the Christmas vacation, Joseph F. Nigro, senior in the course of Political Science, delivered a paper on the “Potential American Labor Party.” Nigro is the son of a prominent labor leader and is qualified to speak on the strength of such a party. The other members of the club did not agree with Nigro’s policies and gave strong criticisms of his reasoning.
“Local Organization in Practical Politics” is the topic chosen for discussion in the next meeting to be held January 18th. During the next semester the club will hold its meetings on the first and third Tuesdays of every month.

f Music Notes
X_____________.___—---------------/
Last Monday evening, Tourgee De-Bose, an outstanding negro pianist, presented an unusual program in Washington Hall, ranging from the classical to the very modern. At the present time, Mr. DeBose, who is a graduate of the Fiske University, is engaged in developing music at the Talladega College. His musical training includes study under Paul Fried-burg, the Julliard Institute in New York, and Cortot’s famous school of music in Paris.
Mr. DeBose gives splendid evidence of the potential artistry of his race. His interpretation of the varied type of numbers on the program was highly sensitive and exacting, without the meaningless gestures and idiosyncrasies which some contemporary artists presume necessary to acquire.
The conceit opened with a series of preludes and etudes by Chopin, performed with fine precision and nicety. Jhe second group consisted of works from the American composer MacDowell, Liadow and Debussy. Little imagination was needed to determine, shall we say, the “inspiration” for one of the current efforts by an American composer of some following, after listening to Debussy’s “Prelude in A Minor.”
From the suite “Gaspard de la Nuit” by Ravel, Mr. DeBose chose the little known work “Scarbo,” and read the poem of the same name by Aloysius Bertrand which inspired its composition. This number, as an example of the modern school of extreme impressionism in music, was easily the highlight of the program, as it was evidently intended to be. After the concert, Mr. DeBose was greatly interested in the reaction of his audience to this piece, because with the exception of a very slight notation recurring in several places, the work seemed on first hearing to be utterly lacking in form or thematic construction.
Mr. DeBose admitted the lack of evident construction, but added that a thorough study of the piece in committing it to memory convinced him of the suggestion of the sonata form running through it. The immediate thought of the “Moonlight Sonata” in the same category as “Scarbo” brought forth an animated discussion, which Mr. DeBose obviously enjoyed.
The transition from Ravel to Liszt was rather a strange one, from the standpoint of program construction, but after the first two minutes the audience was prepared for the brilliant Eighth Hungarian Rhapsody by Liszt which concluded the program.
Saturday’s opera broadcast from the Metropolitan—Puccini’s “La Bo-heme” with Grace Moore.

No room changes will be made before or during the registration period; they will begin Wednesday, Feb. 9 and continue through Saturday, Feb. 12 in the Office of the Secretary. The enrollment expected for the coming semester is estimated by Mr. Kenneth Oliver, secretary of the University, to be 3,000 students, only slightly less than the first semester.
Registration for students in the graduate school will be held at 3:45 o’clock, Tuesday, Feb. 1, in the General Offices. No student will be per-mitter to register for the second semester, however, who have past due balances unpaid, and no certifications will be issued until payment of the account for the second semester has been arranged.
much stirring fiction was a quiet ap-* pearing, gentle speaking man. He
lived a sequestered life in his Hollywood home.
Mr. Spearman was born in Buffalo, N. Y., Sept 6, 1859 and was educated at Lawrence College, Wis. Because of the death of his parents Mr. Spearman’s college career was cut short in 1878 and he left school for Chicago where he joined his older brother in the wholesale grocery business.
The novelist married Eugenie Lonergan, daughter of a Chicago pioneer, in 1884. They had six children. After his marriage he returned to Appleton, Wis. and lived there two years. His health forced him to move out west and he went into Nebraska where he opened a small bank and started his writing.
His first stories and articles were sold to Harpers Weekly and Harpers Magazine. After regaining his health he returned to Chicago and took up fiction writing in earnest. In rapid succession he produced the following novels, most of which are well-known, some of which have won distinction in contemporary American literature:
Nerve of Foley, Dr. Bryson, Whis-pering Smith, Held for Orders, Robert Kimberly, Mountain Divide, Nan of Music Mountain, Marriage Verdict, Spanish Lover, Hall’s Desert and Gunlock Ranch.
Mr. Spearman was awarded the degree of doctor of literature by Notre Dame, Santa Clara, and Loyola universities. The citation read at the time he received the Notre Dame Laetare Medal follows:
“Frank H. Spearman has been selected by the University of Notre Dame as recipient of the Laetare Medal for 1935 in recognition of his distinction as a Catholic layman and of his service to the country in the volumes of interesting and wholesome fiction he has provided through many years for a large reading public. This award will have the hearty approval of all who are acquainted with the work of this manly American novelist.”
Brotherly Love
Dick Anton invited his younger brother Bill over from Chicago recently during a high school vacation. While Dick went to classes, Bill, a good typist, worked his collegiate brother’s class notes into shape for him. Oh, for a brother like that!

LECTURER USES MATH IN ECONOMICS TALK
•
A blackboard demonstration of the reduction of economic reasoning to mathematical formulas was presented by Professor Griffith C. Evans, head of the department of mathematics of the University of California, in the auditorium of the John F. Cushing Hall of Engineering on Wednesday evening, Jan. 5.
Through mathematical equations illustrated on a small blackboard Professor Evans demonstrated the method employed in the reduction of quasi-theoretical economics of demand to the more exact science of mathematics. He failed to emphasize, however, whether this reduction would result in a sounder and a more basic planned economics that could be able, by means of statistical data, to avoid economic disturbance and catastrophes.
As one of the outstanding mathematicians of the United States Professor Evans is particularly known as a leading authority on potential theory. At present he is vice-president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
Some years ago he-became interested in mathematical economics and wrote an introduction to this branch of science which has since become one of the best known books in this field. It covers such topics as the theory of competition, prices and production.
Boston Dance Success
The Bay State can do the “Big Apple.” With guests from many states the annual Boston Club dance, held in the fashionable Hotel Kenmore, proved to be a social and financial success. The dance held unusual attraction foi' the people of Boston and vicinity as was shown by the fact that 65 couples attended.
Harold Kiley and his well-known New England orchestra provided the music. A novel football atmosphere was provided by a large Notre Dame blanket decoration. Surrounding the blanket were pennants of Notre Dame’s ’37 opponents. The scores of each game were placed on each pennant respectively. This unique and colorful emblem received much favorable comment from the dance lovers. The highlight of the evening was the presentation of Elmer Layden’s football autograph.
The men responsible for the success of the dance were the co-chairmen, Joseph Corcoran and Vincent Duggan.

O'TOOLE ANNOUNCES "PROM" DATA
•
Paul J. McArdle, president of the Junior Class, announced that Bartholomew D. O’Toole would be the chairman of the Junior Prom. “Bart” lives on Chicago’s South Side, and is a junior in the College of Arts and Letters, majoring in economics.
When interviewed about his selection O’Toole divulged his selection of committee chairmen and current plans for the annual prom.
“We’re doing our best,” said O’Toole, looking up from a list of the country’s “name” bands. “As you know, there will be no basketball game that Saturday night, so we are planning a dinner dance for that day.”
Frank Reppenhagen, chairman of the publicity committee, has billed the Prom as the “High-light of the Winter season,” or as O’Toole would have it, of the entire year. The dance will be held at the Palais Roy-ale on the 25th of February. The students will be allowed the use of automobiles for that weekend, but must be sure to register these with the Prefect of Discipline.
Cooperating with Chairman O’Toole to make the weekend a success will be John J.

Great to be back.
Great to be back, isn’t it? Great to pile out at six in the morning. . . much healthier than lying in bed till all hours. Great to hear those bells in the morning. . . if you listen to them long enough you appreciate their rich and full melodic tone. Great to be back in the dining hall. . . sort of missed that food with the barrelled gravy taste. Great to sit in class again for fifty minutes at a crack. . . these profs are sure interesting when they tell how their sons cut-up when the old man broke the electric train Christmas morning. Great to tramp over the frozen tundra of good old Indiana. . . aren’t we lucky to have this snow, ice, and sleet, until May or June? Great to come in at a decent hour and go to bed at a decent hour . . . sort of missed that signing in at home.
Great to be back, isn’t it.
Mathematical Economics.
The first day back we noticed a bulletin which announced a lecture that evening in the Engineering auditorium by G. C. Evans, of the University of California, on Mathematical Economics, at which “all students of the College of Commerce and the Department of Economics are urged to attend.” We got to wondering how well the fellows would respond to a lecture the first night back, especially a lecture on Mathematical Economics. We went over that evening to investigate and found, much to our surprise, a full house.
After the lecture we wanted to interview the Professor and find out what he thought of the Rose Bowl game, but he got away before we could say “differential calculus.”
•
Blown off.
It was long about three o’clock on the afternoon of December 18. The afternoon shadows were deepening fast and the few fellows still on campus were preparing to call it a day until Jan. 5, 1938. A dejected, world-weary looking fellow with a suitcase under each arm stumbled up to a campus jewelry salesman and mumbled, “How about a refund on this bracelet, Buddy? I’ve just got word that I’ve been blown off by the girl friend back home.”
Miller Mallet, II.
We’re not sure, but we think there is a fellow on campus who is a successor to the great Miller Mallet. We haven’t met the fellow yet, but from what we’ve heard he’s written a
novel, been swindled out of §30,000 (by the way, has anybody ever heard how $50,000 Costello made out against Sears & Roebuck?), piloted the Ranger for a trial spin in the ’37 Cup Races, graduated from high school with a 99 plus scholastic average, and rescued, of all people, Miss Ina Ray Hutton from some sharks in the South seas. He’s done lots of other things but they sound fantastic and exaggerated. We’ll look him up and if he has anything on the ball you’ll learn about it.
And if he really did rescue Ina Ray from some nasty old sharks we’re going to see what he can do about getting her at a reduced rate for the Senior Ball.
Arnold Lunn.
In the December 25 issue of The Tablet, a weekly newspaper and review, published in London (six pence a copy) in a column called “Talking at Random” there is a long letter from Arnold Lunn. This long letter is well worth reading because it gives Mr. Lunn’s side of that now famous speech of his at the University of Washington last month. Mr. Lunn, in characteristic fashion, clears up the situation in a few words and at the same time points out, obliquely, how stupid the other fellow was. He clears it up just as well as he cleared up the Spanish situation for us last Fall. The first part of the letter doesn’t pertain to the speech but we ■will quote it because it brings out something most of you don’t know.
“Seattle is a great ski-ing center, and the ski-ers were prepared to give me welcome. One of the Seattle papers dispatched enormous headlines, the general effect of which was to imply that but for me nobody would be ski-ing in America today. One soon reconciles oneself to these exaggerations when one begins to discover that nobody takes publicity serious.” Then follows Mr. Lunn’s version of the speech and the reverberations. The letter is too long to reprint, and to quote from it would be unfair to all concerned. If anyone cares to read the letter the magazine can be found in the periodical room of the library.
At the end of the long letter there is a little note by the editor which goes something like this, “Plainly Arnold Lunn is one of the most valuable exports we send America from time to time, not an invisible and still less an inaudible export. But the home market is more important. I shall start a ‘Lunn for England’ club.”
Many Notre Dame architecture students took awards in a recent contest of the Beaux Arts Institute of Design in New York held before the Christmas holidays it was announced by Professor Francis W. Kervick, head of the department of architecture.

Scions
Via the Plagiarism Pfd. column in The Hoya we hear of the doings of the “United Scions of the Aristocracy” at Swarthmore College down in Pennsylvania. The U. S. A. have some startling planks in their platform. They suggest such reforms as: Establishment of the AAA—an Adolescent Agitator Administration to plough under every third youthful radical; constitutional amendment to legalize the granting of titles of nobility; redistribution of wealth—elimination of the gross equality now existing; social security program— appropriations for indigent debutantes, liberal pensions for retired capitalists, sinecures for sons of the wealthy, and subsidization for all country clubs; relief program—free caviar and champagne for once affluent socialites.
Club's Meet Postponed
Joseph Leising, secretary of the Propeller Club, has announced that all meetings of the club will be postponed until after the semester examinations.
At the next meeting, which will be held the first Thursday after the examinations, booklets of the National Convention will be distributed to the members. The booklets are the yearbook of the National Propeller club.
Club pins and membership cards for the new year will also be distributed at the next meeting.
APODACA TAKES POST IN WASHINGTON
A quiz was in progress. Heads were being scratched, and finger nails were being bitten. Although the bell had rung, most of the boys were still in their seats. Seated at the teacher’s desk was a dark young man. He persistently refused to talk about him-

self or about his new position as assistant economist in the bureau of agriculture of the United States. The young man’s name was Joseph L. Apodaca.
Finally he admitted that he had made a specialized study of agricultural economics. In his own words his new duties are, “to aid in directing, conducting, and interpreting economic research of a statistical and historical nature having to do with marketing and financing of farm commodities.”
The University has given Mr. Apodaca a six month’s leave of absence to allow him to complete his work. Mr. Apodaca was graduated from Notre Dame in 1930 with an A.B. degree. In 1933 he received an M.A. degree in business administration from the University of Northwestern. He recently completed formal studies prerequisite for a Doctorate of Philosophy and Economics. Mr. Apodaca will depart for Washington on Jan. 17.
Notebooks Important?
Notebooks are all important to the Notre Dame junior according to this foreword written in Vince Geisler’s book of notes:
“Notice to Finder: This notebook represents my very existence as a junior in college. Without it I will lose hundreds of dollars and fail in my courses. Please have the good, Christian kindness to return this immediately. I will give you the price of a new and better book if that is what you desire, and I will still profit by the transaction. Thank you a thousand times.—Vince Geisler.”

Chicago Dance Praised
President John Buckley and Chairman William Riley deserve credit for one of the most successful dances in the history of the Chicago club. Well earned compliments have been earned by the organizers and they wish to thank all who gave the support necessary to make the dance a high-light of the Christmas season.
The Gold Coast room of the Drake hotel was the background not only for an entertaining evening for the members of the club but as a reunion for alumni members from the Chicago area. The regular floor show from the Drake hotel, considered one of the best in the city, assisted Jack Russell’s orchestra in entertaining the guests.
The next event to be undertaken by the Chicago Club will be a handball tournament early in the coming semester. Details will be discussed at a meeting of the club tentatively scheduled for a date soon after the exams.
Tuition as Prize
The recently opened “Catholic America” contest sponsored by Our Sunday Visitor offers for its third prize one year’s tuition at the University of Notre Dame or $300 in cash. The contest consists of 50 multiple choice picture-questions on principles of faith and Catholic historical activity in America. Grand prize is $2,000.

The Aftermath.
They’re all back. . . . Tall tales are rampant. . . . From Beach Haven, six miles off the Jersey coast, Bub Crowley brings back his usual assortment of Yuletide reminiscences that put the rest of the lads to shame. An added citation goes to Bub because he is handicapped by the fact that he has to build his tales around a summer resort in the middle of the winter. If you’ve seen a summer resort when the January winds are blowing you know what we mean. . . . From New York Vic Mercado brings back the haircut that is the thing along Broadway. Known as the “Mouse Cut" its outstanding features are a gradual increase in the length of the hair, starting from the forehead and going back to reach a peak, short slipped on the sides, and alternate patches that stick up here and there. We don’t know whether a certain bald- spot is included in the cut but it lends a touch that gives one that “I don’t give a rap” look. . . .
The reactions of the different classes are interesting. The seniors, to speak with reservation, are calfeyed. The juniors have that beaten look that comes with knowing that they have another “After Christmas return” coming to them. The sophomores were the last ones to return. They learned a valuable lesson last year and saved all their cuts. They have the most beaten look of the bunch. Their futile attempt to beat the rap, by staying until the last possible moment, took its toll and dragging steps and a hangdog attitude give them away. . . . The freshmen make up that bouncing, effervescent bunch you’ve heard prattling in the caf, for example, “She said a letter’d be waiting for me when I got back.” They’re the kids who had all kinds of attention showered on them—college boys, and all that, home for their first vacation. Tsk, tsk, what a future! . . . An invitation to Hal Wardell to have turkey dinner at your home is a sure guarantee that you won’t have turkey hash afterward, according to a report from Philadelphia. . . .'
Irony: Dick Moller gets hay fever from fir trees. Picture Richard’s reaction upon receiving an invitation to see someone’s Christmas tree! . . . Jim Cruice broke into Detroit’s debutante circle and is “just darling” to one of them. . . . “Bie Mir Bist du Schoen” carries on but the Christmas electric razor gifts eliminate hearing radio programs to the point that you have to stay away’ from meals if you want to hear an uninterrupted program. The boys work on a stagger
system and time themselves perfectly so that there is a constant whirring in the hallways. We’re anticipating an editorial from the editor on this latest phase of torture. (Unless he received one too) . . . But time goes on m’lads and to make the “Welcome Back” more heartening we remind you of those finals rearing up a couple of weeks hence. Of course none of you opened those books you took home with you—and are the professors going to find that out?—we’ll ask you later.
Black and White Soliloquy.
Chester captures bandits bold on Sunday,
While heart throbs bother Uncle Bim all week.
Sunday, Popeye trims a Goon onehanded,
Daily battles then leave him weak.
Sunday brings Buddy and Alura;
Week-days Buck and Wilma conquer all.
Sunday brings us all the Teenie-Weenies.
“For the last time NO! You can't all be odd'”
(A Teenie-Weenie’s just two inches tall).
Colored strips and daily strips all different—
Really, it’s so hard to concentrate!
If I could be dictator of cartoonists,' I’d make them keep their comics
straight.	—Charmanel.
Overheard.
“Is Notre Dame coeducational?”
“It must be. I know a fellow who goes there and he says that you can get any kind of a course you want.”
It’s queer how so popular a place as a candy store can slip out of existence on a campus like this without being noticed by more than a few. But that’s what happened. To seniors, juniors, and sophomores, tradition says that it still is the candy store, but to the enlightened few, and those who know no tradition, it is “The Huddle.” Look at the name sewn on the soda jerkers’ jackets.

"On” and "Off”
QUITE recently a leading broadcasting company sponsored an afternoon program devoted to interviewing fifteen or twenty college graduates, now in business, about their college days. The number represents colleges from every section of the United States and includes graduates of engineering, commerce, liberal arts, and practically every other department found in the American college curricula. One of the key questions was, “Do you think college has been worth while for you?” The uniform answer was, “I have learned twice as much since I have been out of college.”
Almost simultaneously, a leading eastern university announced plans for instituting a “rehabilitating school.” The plan offered that an employer accept their graduates, and if the person was found to be incapable of handling
the assigned work, the college would take the graduate back and attempt to correct his deficiencies.
Both of these current events suggest the reoccurrence of the ever-popular question, “What is the value of a college education?”
While a degree from Notre Dame does not guarantee a position after graduation, the educational program developed here offers the student complete facilities for attaining sound material success without sacrificing moral standards nor the proper realization of his own ultimate end.
In the same vein of thought, let it be granted that many things are learned in every profession after graduating from a university or college, but at the same time it is not a mere guess to conclude that nine out of ten of those who “learned twice as much since they have been out of college” were forced by a case of necessity to learn it there, because they had failed to do so in college. If any New Year’s resolution are forthcoming, we should first take an inventory of ourselves and lay down a firm principle to get college courses “on” rather than “off.”
Why Not?
A FEW WEEKS ago an article appeared in the Saturday Evening Post on 150-pound football in the East. At that time the question was brought up—why doesn’t Notre Dame have a 150-pound team? We would like to know just that—why doesn’t our University have a 150-pound team!
We believe an outstanding lightweight team could be organized at Notre Dame. And here are a few facts to back up our statement: An inquiry was made in one hall and it was found that the majority of eligible candidates have played high school football. Thus, they have a knowledge of the fundamentals of the game. The only reason a number of them aren’t out for the Varsity is lack of weight.
But the question arises—how do you know they can play football? This can best be answered by watching the group of students who play almost daily by Badin Hall. We have seen fellows weighing 140 pounds, punt 50 to 60 yards—and in tennis shoes, mind you. We have seen these same lads pass just as far. We have seen them run, and know for a fact that some were high school track stars. They can play football, but lack the all-important factor of weight.
These boys want to play football for the fun of playing. They aren’t fussy about a schedule. They wouldn’t mind scrimmaging the local high schools or even the small college teams. They just want the chance to play the game. And we sincerely hope they do get the chance.

'team Table
By Paul R. Locher
“Hi, Mathilda ! Gee kid, I thought I’d never get here this morning. It was four o’clock before I got to bed, and getting up again at six sure gets you down. Who was he? Ha, ha, can’t fool you, can I? Now don't let it get around. He lives off-campus and is supposed to be in by twelve like the rest of the fellows around here.
“Griddle cakes, eh? That’s the fellow the doctor put in here because of his stomach ulcers. Stomach ulcers, that’s a hot one!
“It was that real good-looking fellow I pointed out to you last night. The fellow that had the steak practically burnt to a crisp. . . . I’ve seen you talking to him several times.
“Look, here comes that graduate student who thinks if he gives you a big smile you ought to put a couple more sausages on his plate. Only four sausages to an order, sir. What did I tell you? I knew he’d pull that one again. He makes me sick.
“Well, as I was saying, when I handed him the steak on the plate, he stopped there a minute, like he was trying to make up his mind what else he wanted, and then he said under his breath, ‘How’d some beer go about ten o’clock?’ Boy, do I love beer, and was I thrilled? He’s very good-looking, and Scrap says he’ll be on the first team next year maybe, if he keeps his eye on the ball. I don’t know what he meant by that. But I knew what to do, you can bet your life. I follow this lady with the white hair who has a column in the Tribune. She said once not to jump at them, but to act ‘retifcent’, or something like that. Aw, it means not to sound like you want to go, and they become very intrigued because you’re hard to get.
“Here’s that dope back for some more cereal. Why doesn’t he try eating something like bacon or sausages, instead of all eggs and cereal and toast and fruit. I bet he’ll have T. B. some day, mark my words.
“So I said to Rodney. Of course, that his name. Well, I don’t care if the other fellows do call him Jim. That must be his nickname. He distinctly said Rodney, I know, because I was calling him ‘Roddy’ all night, and he thought that was cute. He said so. Well, anyway, I told him I thought I had other plans, but he insisted. Of course, it was only the boy friend Gus. I figured he wouldn’t
mind playing checkers with Dad for a while, but I didn’t count on staying away so long. These Notre Dame fellows want to stay up all night for no reason at all, I guess.
“There goes that toast, again. Yesterday that smart-alec blonde said he bet we burnt more toast than we buttered. That’s his idea of being funny. A lot he knows about making toast. Where’s the knife, Matilda? We can scrape off most of the burnt part, and they can eat the rest. Gee, did you see the dirty looks we got just then. What do we care? Just stare them down — that’s my motto — if they don’t like it, they can lump it. Say, that’s a swell pun, don’t you think? Rodney told me last night a pun is the lowest kind of humor, but I like them. They kind of exercise your brain, I figure. That’s why they take Geometry and Math, this fresh -man told me the other day, whatever Geometry is.
“Judas, here comes that new English prof again, with the soulful look in his eyes. He’ll want eggs too. ‘soft-boiled like a float of down,’ didn’t he say last time? What a shame! He knows all kind of romantic verses, they tell me, about your hair, and your lips, and your eyes, but what good does it do him, I ask you? What good does it do him? Rodney doesn’t know any poetry, but he told me I must be something from heaven, and that’s good enough for me. Those poets were a flighty bunch anyway. How do I know? Why the last week’s Sunday paper said so in the magazine section. You know, the section that has the picture of the sultan and his harem, with a serial story running about it. Oh, I always read it. You can learn lots from reading that deep stuff. Why a fellow wrote in there a few week’s ago how they build up whole groups of people in a museum, just like they used to be living millions of years ago. They figured it all out from a bone in your knee and a jaw-bone the man had. Gee, I’m glad I wasn’t living them. There must have been some horrible brutes in those days. Imagine Robert Taylor, he’s beautiful, don’t you think? . . . and Rodney looks something like him, if his hair was darker, and his nose wasn’t kind of hurt from football. Well, maybe his forehead should be straighter, but the resemblance is there just the same. He told me others thought so too. But anyway, just imagine Robert Taylor descending from a mon
key. Doesn’t seem possible, does it? But it’s so—the article in the paper said so—the man who wrote it had a lot of fancy letters after his name, so he must have known a lot about it. You know, those funny, letters like that philosophy professor has after his name. Oh, I don’t know what they cure. It’s not like the kind that gives you pills, but they’re doctors anyway. Your eggs are done, sir.
“Mathilda, don’t look now, but Rodney just came through the side door. Darn it, just when my hair is all stringy from this steam. I’d better get a permanent tonight. I think I’ll try that new place over on Sample Street—Clara’s Parisien Salon, they call it. I shouldn’t change my hair though—Rodney likes my hair this way—he told me that last night when we came back in the bus. We were sitting way in the back-seat. There wasn’t anyone else in the car except the driver. It was just like having your own car. Anyway, he sat up a little and looked back at me sitting there kind of snuggled against his shoulder, and then ran his fingers through my hair. His voice was choked up a little and he seemed serious, I thought he was going to ask me to go to the Junior Prom next Friday night, but it seemed that he just wanted to kiss me.
“Mathilda, who is that girl just behind him? You see, the one he’s turning to speak to. Oh, I know now, that new girl in the library. They seem to have a hard time getting anyone to stay there very long. The last three have met seniors who are graduating for a change, and they fell in love, and were married down in the Log Chapel. I want to be married there, Mathilda, it’s so peaceful and romantic—sh-h-h, here they come. Let on you don’t know they’re coming, like I am. I can’t wait to see his eyes light up when he says ‘hello.’ That’s the nicest thing about him. He is always so friendly and pleasant; never snobbish like the rest of these drug-store cowboys.
“Humph! ‘Roast beef, please,’ and ‘thank you, please,’ and never so much as a smile. Why Mathilda, he looked as though he didn’t want to even say ‘hello,’ when I spoke to him. It couldn’t have been because she was along, do you think? Those girls in the library—just because they have a high school education—why I have a cousin by marriage who spent (Continued on Page 23)

The Week in Sports
SCHOLASTIC TO SPONSOR SEVENTH ANNUAL ^BENGAL BOXING TOURNAMENT. MARCH 18 ‘	By Charles Callahan
The lid is off! The battle is on! The Bengal Boxing tournament of 1938 is on its way. The tournament this year is the seventh Bengal Boxing Tournament. Each annum has seen the affair grow. The skill of the contestants has improved, and last year’s bouts were the most thrilling ever seen at Notre Dame.	.
The preliminaries will be held on the preceding Thursday, Friday, and Monday, or on March 10, 11, and 14.
Two Bengal fighters of other years mix it tip.
This is a departure from other years, for in the past the preliminaries were always held on the three days just previous to the finals. The result was that many of the boys, after having fought on two and sometimes three successive nights, went into the finals in anything but good condition. With four days of rest, such a situation will not exist this year.
Of last year’s title-winners only four will be back. They are Tom Leahy, light-heavyweight; Oliver Holland, welterweight; Jim Brown, junior-welterweight; and Russel Dolce, bantamweight.
From this you’ll derive that the opportunities are great for newcomers. Last year, six of the finalists were freshmen and it is expected that the present crop of first year men will do equally well. Boxing classes under a competent instructor will begin within a week. To receive instruction does not mean that you have to take part in the tournament.
If you decide to enter, remember that there are sweaters awaiting the

HALL CAGE BATTLES START SUNDAY
•
The interhall basketball season will get under way next Sunday, Jan. 16, with the Brownson Hall eagers out to defend then- title in the heavyweight division, and the Dillon hoopmen ready to protect their lightweight crown. The season will extend from January 16 to March 6, on which date the final championship games will be held.
Last Sunday the final practice rounds were completed, and the coaches have prepared their starting lineups for the opener. There was an unusual amount of interest shown in the tune-up games, and Mr. John A. Scannell, head of the department of Physical Education is looking forward to the greatest season in the interesting history of this diversion.
As in former years, the interhall games will be played on Sunday. Each team in Group I will play six games, while each team in Group II will play seven games on the regular schedule, after which the survivors will meet for championship honors.

SWORDSMEN OPEN AT PURDUE TOMORROW
By Ed Huff
Captain Jack Zei-bst, senior sabre star, and Salvatore Scarlata, junior sabre man, are the only monogram winners available for this season’s arduous schedule that begins tomorrow at Lafayette, Ind., against Purdue.
So as to give every man the baptism of competition, Coach de Lan-dero will suggest that tomorrow’s match consist of 27 bouts — 9 each with the foil, sabre, and epee — whereas the official match consists of only 17 bouts, 9 with foil, 4 with sabre, and a like number with the epee.
The Irish go into tomorrow’s contest with a record of 24 wins and only 8 losses during the past seasons.
John Gavan, sophomore, will probably supplement the monogram men in the sabre event. The foil section will be composed of Vic Mercardo, senior; Joe Leising and Bud Mc-Enearney, juniors in their first year of competition; and Russ Harris, a sophomore.
The epee candidates prominent in early skirmishes are Bill Mahoney, a senior making his first try; Charley Colgan and Jim Graham, juniors; and Hal Guerin, a sophomore.
If a tentative date, February 12, is filled, Notre Dame’s fencing schedule for 1938 will be the most pretentious ever attempted by the Irish swordsmen in the five-year life of the sport on the campus. In only two of the foui* previous seasons have as many as nine matches been fought.
Prof. Pedro de Landero, who introduced the sport to the campus, wil begin his fifth season as coach when he takes the varsity squad to Lafayette, tomorrow, to oppose Purdue in the campaign inaugural.
The schedule announced by direc-' tor of athletics, Elmer F. Layden, is as follows:
Jan. 15—Purdue at Lafayette
Jan. 22—Detroit at Notre Dame
Feb. 4—Chicago at Chicago Feb. 5—Ohio State at N. D.
Feb. 12—Pending

KENTUCKY. PITT. BUTLER, ST. LOUIS. IN RAPID SUCCESSION KEEP CAGERS BUSY

“’On down the line!” — the Notre Dame basketball team plays Pitt on January 19th and Butler on the 22nd. After running into two stumbling blocks, namely Illinois and Minnesota, the Keoganites look to a future that’s none too bright. First the Irish travel to Pittsburgh. The Panthers have found it hard to get going. Flashes of form, such as when Northwestern
PENN AND CANISIUS LOSE TO CAGERS
•
After a rather disastrous holiday season during which two games were dropped to Illinois and Minnesota, the renovated Irish basketball team came back in the past week with two overwhelming victories. Last Saturday night the Irish defeated Pennsylvania in Philadelphia for the tenth consecutive time, 45 to 25. Two days later the netmen swamped Cani-sius at Buffalo, 57 to 33.
The defeat handed the Penn eagers was one of the most decisive they have ever suffered. After the first few minutes of play, the Irish took the lead and were never threatened. At the end of the half they had a 14-point lead. They widened this margin in the second half when, while scoi-ing repeatedly themselves, they held the Penn netmen 12 minutes without allowing them to sink a single shot. Dougherty, who led the Penn offensive with four field goals, finally scored with two minutes to play to break the air-tight Irish defense.
The sparkplug of the Irish attack against Penn was battling little Ed Sadowski, who scored 16 points with seven field goals and two fouls. Following Sadowski in scoring was Paul Nowak with five points.. All-American Johnny Moir, playing only in the second half, was held to three points.
Moir finally found himself in the game with Canisius and led the team to its 57 to 33 victory. His eight field goals and three foul shots accounted for one-third of the Irish points.
Just as in the Penn game, the Irish took the lead after a few minutes of play and were never headed. As the score indicates, Moir wasn’t the only one who was on against the Western New York Conference champions. Tommy Wukovits and Earl Brown, playing the guard position, and center Paul Nowak each tallied eight points. Eleven of the Irish points were scored on free throws. Sure of the outcome of the game after the middle of the first half, Coach Keo-gan substituted freely, using 13 men in the game.
was beaten in the opener, have been followed by poor exhibitions against Wisconsin and Butler. The big handicap is a lack of reserve strength. Only one sophomore, Bobby Johnson, II, has shown enough promise to warrant seeing action. As a result, the starting senior array has found the going rocky, with the 2 O-minute halfs and the elimination of the centerjump wearing the men down.

All Doc Carlson’s boys are local talent. About ninety percent of his material in the last ten years came from within ten miles of the University. Carlson is a firm believer in ice-cream as a steady diet for his five. Each player has a pint of cream at each practice session and one after each game. He is unusually optimistic, each year predicting that the Panthers will “Win ’em all” —and he’s not far off.
The Carlson system is popular among the fans because of the manner in which the Panthers keep the ball moving. The players are constantly on the move, and thus Pitt’s famous “figure eight” offensive has become famous the country over.
The Pitt five lost Captain Jesko and lettermen Frank Loucks and Luke Rowe by graduation, while Joe Fabel, the regular guard, has dropped out of school.
The sophomore contribution to this year’s squad includes two six-footers, Charles Wolbers from Pittsburgh, and Bill Edmunds. These youngsters are both plenty fast and make a fine passing combination.

INTRODUCING
IRISH WIN TWO. LOSE ONE DURING RECESS
By Mark J. Mitchell
He’s a tall blonde lad with a bright friendly smile and a soft voice, but when you’re looking at him from the business end of a saber, you forget all these things. At least for the past two years, his opponents have failed to appreciate his personal qualities when they met him on the rubber mat which constitutes the battling ground of the swordsmen. That is why John R. Zerbst of Kansas City, Missouri, is the man who this yeai* will lead the Notre Dame fencing team	*
through its arduous nine-meet schedule.
The Irish basketball team went into its brief Christmas vacation with its 18th and 19th victories in a row, defeating Northwestern at home on Dec. 18 by 30-27, and on Dec. 22 beating Clem Crowe’s Xavier team at Cincinnati by 45-26. Immediately after their return, however, the Irish travelled to Uurbana-Champaign and dropped their first important away game to Illinois in overtime, 33-32.
Jack is nonchalant almost to the point of being blase, which is a very good reason for his success as a fencer according to Coach de Landero. He is supple and relaxed in a sport in which tenseness is one of the greatest sins. Thus, to see him wield a saber would remind one of a swashbuckling movie hero, and yet he has the practical skill which the Douglas Fairbanks type lacks.
Since fencing was not included in the extracurricular program at Northeast High in Kansas City, Jack’s athletic activities were confined to football and basketball. In these sports he successfully warmed the bench. However, he was president of his graduating class, and relaxed so much in that capacity that he forgot his speech on graduation night.
He also edited the high school paper, and we tremble when we consider his possible criticisms of this column, since he once wrote an editorial which was awarded first prize in statewide competition by the Missouri Press Association.
When we came to that stock question, “Why did you come to Notre Dame,” Jack was right there with an answer. It is so like him that we quote it verbatim: “ ‘Men of Notre Dame’ sounded pretty good after high school (Italics
ours).” In response to a query about outside interests, he yawned and replied: “Women amuse me.”
His fencing exploits are well enough known that they need little reiteration. He was not unusually successful when he first went out for the sport here. In face he was very mediocre, and lost a good many of his early practice bouts. In spite of his lack of promise, Coach de Landero saw in his 6 feet 2% inches and lackadaisical attitude the material for an excellent swordsman. Last year Zerbst justified the coach’s faith, and proved himself one of the mainstays of the team.
Foreign Commerce is Jack’s chosen field. He hopes that some day, after he has packed up his Ph.B. and moved out into the big cold world, he may sell enough of something to somebody to enable him to fulfill his ambition of seeing the world.
In any event tomorrow he will lead the Irish squad against the Boilermakers and attempt to carry on the work that was started some five seasons ago by a small group of Fighting Irish. He has (to attempt a bad pun) his work cut out for him.
Against Northwestern, Notre Dame slopped around in poor form, led at the half by six points, at the finish by three. The ragged play of both teams roughened up the game, and 29 fouls were called. Seven points was the top individual score for the night, Moir, Nowak, Wukovits and Captain Trenkle of Northwestern all hitting three field goals and one foul. The Irish began their foul-shooting slump — which lasted till Monday’s Canisius game—by scoring on only 8 out of 19 attempts. But Northwestern had an equally bad percentage— 7 out of 16 — and became Notre Dame’s 18th straight victim.
As was expected, Notre Dame took Xavier rather easily. The Irish had a 24-14 half-time lead, stretched it by nine more points, and ended with the third stringers and a 45-26 victory. Nowak scored 12 points on six field goals, making himself the game’s high point man, while Moir and Kucia of Xavier followed with nine points apiece. The Irish made five foul goals to Xavier’s 6, and dropped through 20 field goals to 10.
The exasperating inability of the Irish to make good on their free throws brought their 19-game victory run to a fizzling end against Illinois. The Illini clicked off only 11 field goals to Notre Dame’s 15, but outscored the men in blue and gold by 11-2 from the foul line. The latter missed six of their eight free throws Moir being the most deficient with four shots and four misses. The accurate Illini only missed two trys all evening.
Paul Nowak distinguished himself by being the first Notre Dame player to commit four personal fouls in a game this season. He and his substitute, Rex Ellis, presented Pick Dehner, Illinois center, with four free shots in the second half, three of .which were made good.
In the last 25 minutes of the game, Captain Lou Boudreau and Dehner did all the scoring for Illinois, while Brown, Moir and Sadowski split Notre Dame’s last 17 points. Boudreau, I Dehner, and Irishmen Eddie Sadow-! (Continued on Page 18)

CAGERS DEFEAT CATS LOSE TO GOPHERS
•
Coach George Keogan and his Irish basketeers were the honored guests of Northwestern’s Wildcats at a New Year’s Eve party in Evanston, and as guests usually do, they walked off with the prize in the form of a 40-29 victory over their hosts. The boys returned to the campus, took time out for a few New Year’s resolutions and then treked to Minneapolis where they encountered the Minnesota Gophers on January 4. The Big Ten entry, intent upon atoning for the stinging defeat which they suffered at Notre Dame last year, trounced the invaders 37-24.
Against the Wildcats the Irish started slowly and trailed at halftime, 25-17. After the intermission the Irish defense tightened and held the Purple to four points while they went on a scoring spree which netted them 23 points. The shooting of Johnny Moir featured this last half attack while Smith was the top performer for the vanquished.
At Minneapolis the powerful Gophers swept into the lead at the outset of the battle and maintained it throughout the contest. They held an 18-12 advantage at the end of the first 20 minutes. The Irish sunk two quick shots immediately after the first stanza got under way but the home team called “time out,” pulled themselves together, and went on to win by the convincing score of 37-24.
on the side, disspelled any stigma of ignorance on our part when he said the sport was only approaching its fifth birthday on the campus.
Prof, de Landero, Notre Dame, ’ll, would not recount the complete tale of his prowess with the sword. His father introduced him to the sport, he said, and he was developed down in Mexico by the famous swordsmen, Lucien Merignac, a Frenchman; and Romolo Timperi, an Italian.
And there you have the sports oddity of an American of Spanish ancestry learning an art in Mexico, that seemingly was begun in England, being taught to him first by a Frenchman, then by an Italian, so that the Spanish - American could coach a cosmopolitan group called the Fighting Irish.
It was 36 years ago that Prof, de Landero first thrust the fencing science around here, and it came about accidentally. A couple of fencing proponents from Sorin Hall arranged a little bout and the-then-student de Landero was called upon to judge the contest. To judge a fencing bout is arduous work, however, and Prof, de Landero foresook the difficulty in favor of the more pleasant work of instructing.
While he hesitated to enumerate his personal conquests with the sword Prof, de Landero acknowledged his instructors, Merignac and Timperi, to be among the best that the game has produced. The were “all-Americans” by his judgment. He admitted, too, that he had coached some very good swordsmen.
Prof, de Landero’s sons, Carlos and Telmo, were two of the finest duelists coming out of the mid-West in recent years. Carlos won the mid-western sabre title in 1936 when he co-captained with Red Kehoe Notre Dame’s second undefeated fencing squad and unofficial mid-western champions. He previously had led the ’35 squad to an unmarred campaign of victories.
The younger de Landero, Telmo, followed his brother by winning three monograms also, and he captained the team as a senior last year. With McAuliffe and Seco, Telmo de Lan-dera defeated all collegiate competition in a tournament at Chicago last spring, losing only to the American Olympic team.

( SPLINTERS FROM THE PRESS BOX }
By John F. Clifford
Football was ruled out for the year at New Orleans and basketball was definitely ruled “in” at New York over the holidays. And not the least responsible for the sudden surge in national popularity of basketball has been one Angelo Luisetti — better known as “Hoopster Hank” — popular forward on the Stanford outfit, who violated Horace Greeley’s advice and came East to reach stardom. This flashy Italian, over six feet and well set-up, is as lithe as a big cat. He is an equally deadly shot with either hands, a spectacular dribbler and passer and a defensive genius. A unanimous All-America forward for two years, Hank is the first player, the promoters say, who has packed the Garden on his own account since basketball became “Big Time” in New York. And that’s where the dig comes in.
Since George Keogan first introduced his Irish quintet to the Eastern fans via Ned Irish and Madison Square Garden several years back, Notre Dame has had a theoretical monopoly on the S.R.O. sign of that sport’s emporium. They made New York really basketball conscious through their series with N.Y.U. Rabid basketball fans —18,000 strong — jammed the Garden and named the Irish as their favorite court squad from the West, primarily because they showed the fastest breaking and passing outfit seen in that locality in a long, long time. Each successive year Notre Dame became a more popular Western visitor to Gotham. .
But that was before Luisetti. The guy has to have something on the ball when he can add 50 points in one game to a two-year aggregate record of 826 points. For all-around class Johnny Moir B.S. (before the slump) took our money. That was before the “National Champs” hit a recession after enjoying too much prosperity. Their defeat of Canisius Monday was not impressive, per se. It did show, however, that Moir has indicated his come-back ability. N. B. George Keogan is hoping it will last.

It is traditional for this corner at this time of year to foster some kind of competition, interhall or otherwise, in hockey. Plugging for more local interest in this favorite winter sport has met with little success during the past few years, in spite of the fact that the Athletic Board constructed a regulation rink on St. Mary’s lake to further the student participation. A few pick-up games were played last year, and the class of hockey exhibited in these games indicated that there are plenty or rough-tough ice men on the campus to warrant some sort of interhall league. If and when Director of Athletics Elmer Layden announces his winter sports program that proved so successful last year in bowling, handball, and billiards, the inclusion of an interhall or interclass hockey schedule should prove the needed incentive for a greater interest in the sport at Notre Dame.

Just a note about the Bengal Bouts, whose formal announcement on page 14 sets the date on March 18. For all you would-be bantams, lightweights, and heavies, now is the time to get into condition for those prelims that come off a week or so before the finals. No Buddy-Baer-battles, these preliminaries; there is plenty of rugged punching in every round, and condition is fifty per cent of the battle.
ILLINI GAME (Continued from Page 16)
ski led their teams with 13 points apiece.
The score at the half was 15-15; at the end of the regular playing time it 'was 30-30. Sadowski then slipped in a basket in overtime, but Dehner
and Boudreau hit a foul and a field goal to win. It was the most disappointing game of the year for Notre Dame, for the Irish outplayed the mini on the floor and limited the rushing Orange and Blue offense to 22 points from the field, only to beat themselves with their foul-line im-potency.
FIRST TRACK MEET IN THREE WEEKS
•
Although the first track meet is only three weeks away, Coach John P. Nicholson is molding his team into shape very slowly for the season is long and the schedule is tough. Beginning with the Marquette meet on Feb. 4, there will be seven successive week-ends of indoor track meets; then, after a rest of a mere month, the Quadrangular Relays with Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio State will begin a seven-Saturday grind of outdoor competition.
Although “Nick” has a great deal of respect for the Marquette and Illinois teams, a dominating revenge motive is making him point particularly for the meets with Indiana and Drake, the only two meets which the Irish dropped indoors last year. Both of these meets are held in foreign fieldhouses, a distinct disadvantage for Notre Dame because of the differences in shape and length between these tracks and Notre Dame’s track.
“Nick” expects to have a very good dual meet and relay team this year, but he gets jittery every time he thinks of the brittle tendencies of his present squad, the most easily-injured group of track men he has ever coached. At present, the only serious loss is shot putter, Bill Faymonville, the most rugged-looking member of the squad who was kept from returning to school after the Christmas vacation by a bad strepto coccus infection in his throat. However, three football players, Ed Beinor, Ed Sim-onich, and Mike Mandjiak seem to be taking adequate care of the iron ball department. The team did little more than jog during the first half week after vacation, but early this week the intensive work-outs began. Greg Rice proved that he still reigns supreme among Notre Dame distance runners when he was clocked in a very good early season mile of 4:33 last Tuesday. After the “little fellow” had coasted through a 2:19 first half, he gritted his teeth and barreled through the final four laps in 2:14. Veteran Johnny Francis has been showing his usual “picture-runner” form, and he promises to be one of the leading half milers in the Middle West this season. Sophomore Hank Halpin adds a fighting heart to his natural ability in the quarter mile. A whole parade of promising sprinters, one that includes Bill Clifford, Tom Shields, Bill Tucker, Jake Wolfe, and Steve Coughlin, keeps bolting from the Nicholson starting blocks every afternoon.

praised them as the best team he has coached. “They were on the floor at the beginning, but not to stay,” he said. “Playing the game the best they knew how, they came back with a great finish to end successfully the toughest schedule ever assigned to a Notre Dame team. I hold the deepest respect and admiration for all of my boys.”
Football coaches on the speaking program included: Mal Elward of Purdue; Jimmy Conzelman of Washington University (St. Louis); Gar Davidson, retiring coach at Army; and Bo McMillin of Indiana. Thomas L. Hickey of South Bend was the general chairman of the banquet committee.
As a grand finale the Notre Dame band under the direction of Prof. Joseph J. Casasanta played the “Victory March.”

Captain Bob Johnson, I, and Miles Zeleznik as forwards, Joe Garcia at center, and Mike Radvansky and Ed Spotovitch at the guard posts.
And then Butler, whose Coach, “Tony” Hinkle, has one of the outstanding all-time records in the country, invades the local field house. Since 1926, when he became coach, two of his teams have won three state championships, two Missouri Valley championships, and one National title.
Last year the Irish beat them on two occasions, 25 to 24, and 42 to 17. The first of these was one of the most spectaculai' ever played on the home' court.
The Butler squad is composed of veteran stock. The starting guards will be Laurel Poland and Bill Gey
er, with Chester Jaggers and Art Cosgrove in reserve. Either Bill Merrill or Don Waggener of Indianapolis will be at center. Forwards include William Fawcett, Byron Schofield and Jack Naylor.
Most of the boys are lettermen, all of them being veterans. Of the twenty-five men on the squad, nine are from Indiana, so they should feel to home at Notre Dame.
Finally, on February 1, St. Louis University journeys to Notre Dame, to provide after-exam entertainment for the Irish basketeers. The St. Louis lads are rated as a strong team, and may well be the source of much trouble before they depart.
The Wildcats from Kentucky, 1937 Southeastern Conference champions, invade the Notre Dame fieldhouse tomorrow night in an attempt to avenge the defeats they have suffered in the past two years at the hands of the Irish.
Last year the Keoganmen triumphed in a game played in Louisville, 41-28. The year before Kentucky came here to be defeated 4120.
