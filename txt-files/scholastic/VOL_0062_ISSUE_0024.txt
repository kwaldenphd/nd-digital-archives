Thomas Keegan, an editor and an institution, is also an optimist. Institutions may be optimistic, editors have to
•	be altrustic. Tommie has hopes of getting Domes for the Seniors by the tenth of May, and of obliging the rest of us by the fifteenth. He is, moreover, an editor who believes in the broadening influence of travel, for the scenic section
_ of this year’s Dome was rotograved in Europe. A yearbook coming from a foreign land, and with a lineage of peers behind it is something to bequeath to your heirs. Heirs are
•	that way—they want everything. And so, like a true Notre Dame man, like an altrustic editor, and like the collector of rare editions that you are, buy several copies of this year’s Dome. That is the only way to keep your children from fighting over the legacy. Providing, of course, that they do not have to sell the book to pay your debts.
The freshmen of 2229 will blush and snicker when they
*	see our portraits in the historic Dome of 1929. They will hold-bull sessions in an effort to determine how humanity f ever suffered itself to be swathed in idiotic bundles of clothing, or how it ever endured the dandruff breeding nuisance of a head of hair. Looking at our race in an evolutionary light, a method going out of vogue, you must grant that
•’ within three hundred years enlightened mankind will not be bothered with any clothes, and will efficiently shave the top of its scientific head. For retrospective evidence you
_ might see the pictures posted over in the Library. The winning crews of 1893 are depicted in acrobatic attitudes of . indifference. Some of them have whiskers, and all of them wear elongated flannels and a self-conscious nonchalance. A ' few students, following in the soggy tracks of our aquatic ancestors, took the posting of these relics as a hint from the authorities that a revival of water sports is in order. Impetuously, the modems dived into the same waters that had soaked the ancient flannels. Excuse my inspiration, philosophers, it may not be the same water. But it is as wet as ever, and much too cold for the Howard Hall boys.
’ Some people believe everything they read. Fortunately, such pople do not read very much. But for their sakes proofreaders and the Index have been established. Now when ■ the Marines invite us to join them and see the world it is well to inquire just when our proposed excursion is to start. And when makers of aluminum ware beg us to accept summer positions as their high salaried salesmen it is well to
3 ask for a reference from some well known clergyman. As for those booklets depicting the glamour of national parks and dude ranches—well, they read like an unauthorized attempt to sell fresh air at Log Cabin prices. Any Irishman knows that the air belongs to the rest of us, and is, therefore, not to be commercialized by asthmatic Westerners. Mohammedans probably think that the air belongs to Mohammed, but then they are Mohammedans and never argued the question with the English. Anyhow, before you sign for one of the escorted tours request an interview with your particular escort, and with at least one satisfied tourist. And if you have any respect for that ancestor who shoveled coal to work his way over on the Mayflower, refuse to allow anyone to call you a dude rancher. A dude rancher is neither a rancher
nor a dude. For a dyed in the moustache dude does not at all . like the nasty smell of horses, noi" does a true rancher make his Whoopees with a cocktail shaker.
Chicago is one of the suburbs of Notre Dame. When we want to preserve the sacred quiet of wisdom on the campus we send the cheering crowds to that noisy district and let them romp all over the town. Our games are a big thing for the city of the windy, and the three which we are to play there next year will enable several of Chicago’s Jews to buy new flints for their cigarette lighters. Chicagoans have always appreciated Notre Dame, and now Notre Dame is going to try to appreciate Chicago. The new football schedule provides for everything but a home game, unless, indeed, we " can say that Chicago is adopting our homeless team. The present sophomores will be the first class to enjoy the senior reserve section in the new Stadium. They ought to consider that, and show their gratitude by overcoming their present pessimistic attitude. This attitude is brought on by too intense a mental effort to figure ways and means of spending the three week-ends in Chicago next year. One possible solution is that you quit school and get a job powdering doughnuts in a Loop restaurant.
Students now consider it as necessary to have .a Tuxedo as it is to have a toothbrush. But does this not prove that a Tuxedo is as essential as a toothbrush, or that either are necessary. The Missing Link, who is still missing, though not greatly missed, had neither. Consequently he missed out on formal dances. Tonight the K. of C. formal will fill the Palais to an uncomfortable degree. Uncomfortable, because it will probably be overcrowded, and because the men will be crowded into the conventional Tuxedo. Someone recently , wrote to 0. 0. McIntyre and informed him that the wearing of white vests with Tuxedoes had been condemned. And McIntyre happily answered that tan shoes were also out of place with formal wear. Anyhow, we men are restricted in what we wear. If we go to jail, join the army, or attend a dance we are obliged to don a uniform. A tuxedo is proof of the masculine belief that all men are born equally subject to convention. Some girls’ schools enforce the wearing of uniforms as being the easiest way to promote modesty and democracy. Nothing encourages democracy among women more than the horrible realization that they are all dressed alike. Did you notice the natty uniforms on the nonchalant Vikings who paraded the South Bend streets last week? Emil Telfel thought they were a reformed sort of Ku Klux Klan, though I maintained that they were merely soliciting students for Culver.
A general tendency to procrastination, discussing prospects for the summer, lying about in the shade, writing home for pre-registration money, and a decreasing interest in Wednesday afternoons—all these are evidences of the passing of the last quarter. Everyone seems to be waiting for something—freshmen for home, sophomores for summe>- jobs, juniors for better dates, and the seniors for what tney can get. There are only six weeks left—treat yourself to another cigarette, and contentedly muse over that.	—A. H.

Burns, C.S.C., provincial of the Congregation of Holy Cross.

7 K. OF C.’S EXEMPLIFY SECOND AND THIRD ’ DEGREE TO FORTY-SEVEN MEN
The Notre Dame Council of the Knights of Columbus initiated 47 members into the Order at an impressive ceremony held last Sunday afternoon in the chambers of the South Bend Council. Several of the candidates had received their first degree just previous to the Easter vacation, while t the others received it Thursday, April 11.
Immediately following the exemplification of the degrees a banquet was tendered to about one hundred and fifty members, including the newly initiated, in the spacious banquet hall and ballroom of the South Bend Council. Members from the Notre Dame, South Bend, Minneapolis, and Chicago Councils made up the gathering. The Reverend
Eugene Burke, C.S.C., acted in the capacity of toastmaster, and his witty remarks kept the assemblage in a jovial mood.
The Reverend James M. Reardon of Minneapolis, Minn., one of the few members of the clergy who hold the office of Grand Knight, was the principal speaker of the evening. He spoke on “An Ideal and a Challenge,” and in his talk stressed the history and purpose of the order from its founding. He concluded his address with a short resume of the work done by the Knights of Columbus in the United States in propo-gating the Faith.
Other guests and speakers of the occasion were Arthur Bidwell and Robert Irmiger, both Past Grand Knights of the Notre Dame Council, and Mr. Edmund A. Wills, of South Bend, past District Depuyt.

UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS 0. K. FINAL PLANS; WORK ON NEW STADIUM TO BEGIN SOON
Cartier Field—the stamping grounds of the “four horsemen and seven mules,” the gridiron battlefield immortalized by the Gips, the Salmons, the Edwards, the Walshs, the Farleys, the Smiths, and the Millers for the past quarter of a century, and one of the most noted football fields in the country has witnessed its last major gridiron attraction.
According to the final plans, which were approved by the University authorities at a special meeting held last Friday afternoon, the University will begin actual construction on its new §750,000 football stadium sometime within the next two weeks. The keynote to the building of the proposed stadium was first sounded by the Very Reverend Charles L. O’Donnell, C.S.C., president of the University, before the members of the Notre Dame Alumni Club of New York City last March.
The new athletic plant, which has been designed to seat between 50,000 and 60,000 spectators, will be built east of Eddy street and north of the short road which connects Eddy street and the Edwardsburg highway. A portion of the present Cartier field, regarded as. one of the best playing turfs in the country, will be utilized in the construction.
The type of stadium contemplated by the University officials has not yet been definitely decided. However, fortified by the experiences of a score of other major schools in the building of huge outdoor athletic stadia, Notre Dame will open her 1930 football season with one of the most modern and scientific structures in the country. Several members of the faculty board of athletic control, of which the Reverend Michael A. Mulcaire, C.S.C., vice-president of the University, is chairman ex-officio, are known to favor the University of Nebraska’s athletic structure, which consists of two stands on either side of the field, permitting the additional construction of seats at one or both ends, thus giving it the appearance of a horseshoe, or bowl. Steel with brick facing rather than a solid concrete structure, probably will be used in its construction in view of the latest engineering designs.
Announcement of the type of the new Cartier Field stadium will be forthcoming after plans for its finance are completed by University officials. The committee which is working out the financial details for the project is composed of Knute K. Rockne, director of athletics; the Honorable Gallitzin A. Farabaugh, ’04, prominent South Bend attorney; J. Arthur Haley, business manager of University athletics, and Herbert Jones, assistant busiriess manager. It is also expected that the University officials will announce the architects and the building contractor sometime before the present stadium is completely demolished. Workmen have already begun to raze the old structure, while others are sowing grass seed on the site of the proposed gridiron.
The present gridiron of Cartier field will be utilized in the future for scrimmage by Rockne’s football warriors, while the baseball diamond and the running track, scenes of many classic and epic struggles, will continue to be used for varsity contests in those sports.

PROF. PHILLIPS ADDRESSES TWO STUDENT BODIES ON “SILENT FRIENDS”
Professor Charles Phillips of the English Department of Notre Dame, addressed the students of the Notre Dame College of Cleveland in that city Thursday, April 11, on the subject of “Silent Friends,” a discourse on books and authors. Mr. Phillips also addressed the students of the Notre Dame Academy of Toledo last Monday, April 15, using the same subject.
UNIVERSAL NOTRE DAME NIGHT TO BE * OBSERVED ON CAMPUS
Arrangements for the annual observance of Universal Notre Dame Night with a banquet and a special program in ' the University Dining Hall next Monday evening have been completed by members of the Notre Dame alumni club of St. « Joseph Valley. This celebration will be attended by alumni ; members on the campus, in South Bend and the surrounding towns.
Many prominent campus celebrities are on the program to deliver talks. Knute K. Rockne, Director of Athletics at the University, will preside as toastmaster, and will introduce the R.verend Charles L. O’Donnell, C.S.C., president of < the University, and the Reverend John Cavanaugh, C.S.C.,	-
past .president of the University, as the two notable speakers of the evening.
Musical selections and songs will occupy a large part of b the program, with Joseph Casasanta’s orchestra and novelty groups featuring. Coach Tom Mills, who is noted for his dramatic ability in addition to his athletic interests, will 5 deliver a reading.	:
This sixth anniversary of Universal Notre Dame Night will find gatherings of alumni in all parts of the world, hotels and clubs in cities of every size being the scenes of the celebrations similar in detail to the program here.
Radio stations have been enlisted in the celebrations and more than a dozen stations will broadcast Notre Dame 0 programs.

COACH KEOGAN ADDRESSES SOUTH BEND KIWANIS CLUB
Coach George Keogan was the featured speaker at the reg- ' ular meeting of the South Bend Kiwanis club Thursday noon, April 11, at the Oliver Hotel. He was introduced by Coach Rockne, who was chairman of the meeting.
Mr. Keogan said that many lessons learned from athletics are applicable to business and professional life, and qualities essential to success in each are parallel.
Sportsmanship and courage are two of the greatest les- v sons to be learned from athletics. He suggested that business men apply principles of sportsmanship—that they can recognize being practiced or violated in athletics—to their own business, and see if they are really being sportsmanlike in all of their dealings.

§ § § PUBLICATIONS DINNER DANCE DATE SET * FOR MAY 16
The date of the first Publications Formal Dinner Dance has been definitely set for May 16th in the Faculty Dining Hall of the University.
Plans for the affair are progressing rapidly and it is ’ expected that the dance will be one of the foremost formals of the spring term. The dance, which is restricted to members of the staffs of the Juggler, Scholastic and Dome, will be the first of its kind ever to be given at Notre Dame.
Harley L. McDevitt, Business Manager of the Scholastic and General Chairman of. the dance, has called a meeting for	/
this Sunday morning of the various Editors and Business	*
Managers of the Publications to make final arrangements for the affair.

COLLEGE OF ARTS AND LETTERS NOTES
Charles C. Miltner, C.S.C., Ph.D., Dean
Heads of the various departments of the College of Arts • and Letters at the University addressed the members of the < sophomore class, who are in this college, Friday, April 12. The speakers were the Reverend Charles Miltner, C.S.C., dean of the college, who spoke of the departments of Philosophy; history and economics; the Reverend Murray, C.S.C., head of the department of sociology; the Reverend John Margraf, C.S.C., head of the department of ancient lan-• guegas; the Reverend Vincent Mooney, C.S.C., head of the department of physical deucation; Professor John M. Cooney, head of the school of journalism; Professor Ernest Thompson, head of the school of fine arts; Professor Aguustine Confrey, head of the school of education, and Professor Antonio Provost, head of the department of modern languages. Each spoke on the purpose of choosing a major in his de-• partment.	.
The sophomores in this college are urged to acquaint themselves with the requirements of the department in which they expect to major and to consult with the head of hte department. This will diminish the delay which usually accompanies preregistration.
Next Friday, April 26, has been designated by Father • Miltner as the preregistration date of all Arts and Letters students.
• Announcement was made this week of the work of the department of Sociology for the coming year, by the Reverend Raymond Murray, C.S.C., head of that department. The , j information is necessary for sophomores who intend to major ! m that subject.
! Three programs will be offered in the department: (1) ] - the traditional plan, in which the student chooses his courses, taking a total of 20 hours in the junior and senior years; (2) a special pre-legal program arranged for the students who intend to follow the six year law plan; (3) a new Pro-v bation Work program to be followed during the junior and L senior years with a requirement of 27 hours in the sociology | major during these years. In the latter course, in addition to v	the B. A. degree, a certificate of Probation will be granted
(	to the student if he does two months of field work in some
' large city during the last summer vacation.
J In the elective courses for Juniors and Seniors (first semester) a new course has been added, “Independent Reading , in Sociology.” The purpose of this course, according ot the \ announcement, is to “give the industrious student an oppor-. tunity to pursue independent study in the sociological field.” ; Each student will select some problem in which he has a special interest for intensive study during the period. At , regular intervals he will submit a written digest, along with a plan for future readings. This latter course is open only ; to seniors whose class average during the Junior year in so-।	ciology was 85 or over. It will be conducted by Father
’ Murray.
The issue of America for April 13, devotes considerable S space in its column, “With Script and Staff,” by The Pilgrim, r to the course in Pastoral Sociology, which has been added to ‘ the curriculum for the summer school work at Notre Dame. The article remarks:
“The plan for a course in Pastoral Sociology or Parish Activities to be instituted this summer at the University of Notre Dame seems to be based on the idea that, just as the task of preaching demands some sort of special preparation
over and above that of theology, so too special preparation is needed for certain practical tasks. “The Pilgrim commends the University in having the course on the campus rather than at a seminary, ‘recognizing that the Catholic college is the natural meeting ground of priest and layman for problems concerning both.’ ”
Action taken recently at conventions held at Marquette and Loyola universities and the announcement of a similar course at Fordham university, indicates, according to America, the realization of the need for this special kind of training.

And now the Poetry Number! Elsewhere we have commented on poetry at Notre Dame. Here let us glance at those who have made this number possible.
“The End of Labour,” by Murray Young, a senior in the College of Arts and Letters, winner of the first prize in the
MURRAY HICKEY LEY Literary Editor, Scholastic.
Scribblers Poetry Contest, has been accepted by Poetry, a magazine of verse published in Chicago by Harriet Monroe; acceptance by this magazine being the highest honor that can come to any young poet.
Mr. Young’s poetry is distinguished by the manner in which it mirrors intense emotion in coldly chiselled phrases; the depth of feeling never suffering at the hands of his preciosity, but rather, gaining therefrom.
Brother Emil, C. S. C., in “Post Communion,” second prize winner in the
Scribbler contest, gives us a beautiful picture of the soul after reception of the Eucharist. His “Colors” is a delicate pastel, charmingly done.
Cyril A. Mullen, a junior in the College of Arts and Letters, draws some vivid portraits in his finely done “A Man of Imagination” and “In a Doctor’s Office.” He, too, is sparse in his words, but every one tells and the cumulative effect is striking enough; reminiscent, in a way, of- Edgai-Lee Masters, in “Spoon River.”
Murray Hickey Ley in “After Hearing Mischa Elman Play” again makes use of his favorite form—free verse. His poetry stands or falls by its imagery and critical judgment on it must take this into account. Mr. Ley is a junior in the College of Arts and Letters.
John de Roulet, a senior in the same college, handles well one of the oldest subjects of poetical encomiums—Dante. His “Song” reveals well disciplined emotion caught in equally well disciplined word nets.
“When Savants Gather For Their Port” is a rollicking affair, overflowing with high spirits.. But its author, Philip de Roulet, can also be serious enough, as he reveals in his fine “Song to Siva.” Mr. de Roulet is a sophomore in the College of Arts and Letters.
Louis L. Hasley contributes the only strictly indigenous poem in this collection, “Winter Evening at Notre Dame” and manages to give us an excellent little picture. His “The Door” is an admirably poignant piece of verse.
John L. Nanovic, one of our most faithful contributors, has submitted two delicately cut cameos, and well does their fragility repay close reading.
Both Mr. Nanovic and Mr. Hasley are juniors in Arts and Letters.
Charles M. Carey, C. S. C., has penned some fine lines in “At Bethlehem.” One of the judges in the recent Scribbler Contest considered it by far the best of all poems submitted.
“Awakening” by J. W. S., C. S. C., is an argent drop in thia collection of many moods; and, despite its lengthier companions, it still shimmers with a light all its own.

ALL RETURNING STUDENTS MUST DEPOSIT RESERVATION FEE AND REGISTER
BEFORE MAY 20
In order to avoid the misunderstanding which occurred last year regarding pre-registration and reservation, the attention of students is directed at this time to the following important matter:
The enrollment at the University is definitely limited. < This means, among other things, that only a limited numbei" of new students can be admitted next year. The number of new students who can be admitted next year will depend first of all, on the number of students who are graduating, and on the number of those who will not return to the University. It is very necessary that the registrar’s office know before the close of the school year how many students intend to return next year.
For this reason there is a University regulation to the effect that ALL STUDENTS who intend to return next year, campus and off-campus, (including those whose homes are in South Bend) are required to deposit a reservation fee of $25.00 at the office of the Secretary and registei’ with the Registrar before May 20th. Only one fee is required and this fee will serve as a deposit on a room for those students who secure a room on the campus for next year.
This is a matter entirely distinct from the pre-registration for classes, which will be attended to by the respective Deans. The reservation fee of $25.00 should be paid as soon as possible, as the Deans are now preparing to pre-register students for classes for next year, and no student will be pre-registered without presenting a receipt to the Dean showing payment of a reservation fee.
In the settlement of final accounts at the close of the school year all checks on local banks must be certified before presentation at the Students’ Office.

PROF. JACQUES TO SUCCEED PROF. THOMPSON AS HEAD OF ART DEPARTMENT
Professor Ernest Thorne Thompson, head of the department of art at the University, has resigned his position, according to word received from the Reverend Charles L. O’Donnell, C. S. C., president of the University. Professor Thompson has accepted the position as head of the art department of the College of New Rochelle, New Rochelle, New York.
Professor Emil Jacques, one of the leading contemporary Flemish painters, will succeed Professor Thompson at Notre Dame. Since coming to America in 1923, Professor Jacques , has been teaching painting at Columbia University, Portland, Oregon . He is a member of the Chicago Art Association, and the Chicago Art Institute has placed his paintings on permanent exhibit. Many of his well known paintings are also on exhibit in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and other Western cities.
Some of Professor Jacques’ better known paintings in- < elude “After the Angel Departed,” “Remorse,” and “The Tobacco Pickers.” Steel etching and portrait painting are also in his line of endeavor. The series of sketches he made at Ypres before the War are now considered as historical documents since they depict the Belgian life that was destroyed by the World War.
Professor Thompson will continue in his favorite medium, < etching, at the College of New Rochelle. He has written several articles on etching and wood-cutting for magazines, and in 1927 received the John McCutcheon prize for his woodcuts. Last year he was awarded first prize in the Hoosier Art Salon held in Chicago for his effort entitled “Florence,” an etching of his wife.

English is a subject of prime importance in the curriculum of any university. The educational institution with an inefficient English department is fundamentally weakened,
for English, besides being so vitally important in itself, is the natural complement of all other studies. It is therefore essential that the English courses be under the leadership of a man whose abilities are such as to insure an ever stronger' department. In this matter Notre Dame is especially fortunate, as our English school has long been under the thoroughly capable and efficient guidance of the Reverend J. Leonard Carrico, C. S. C.
REV. J. LEONARD CARRICO, C.S.C. The sincerity and competency of Father Carrico bring him the respect and friendship of all who come to meet him. He discharges the endless duties of his department in a quiet, serious manner born of ability and experience. In all he does Father Carrico maintains a sense of humor, likely at any minute to manifest itself in some delightful form., His knowledge of English in all its phases is extremely broad, and his success in expounding this knowledge to students is exceptional.
In 1902 Father Carrico received his A. B. degree at St. Mary’s College in Kentucky and the following year he received his Litt. B. from Notre Dame. During this year at 'J'otre Dame he was awarded the Meehan medal for the best essay in English.
After a year spent in St. Joseph’s Novitiate he studied for four years at the Catholic University of America, where he combined the sacred study and the college course in earning his Ph. D. His thesis, prepared under the direction of Maurice Francis Egan, was entitled “The Ethics of the Present Day Drama.”
Father Carrico was ordained in June of 1908 and since that time has been teaching at Notre Dame, with the exception of a part of the year 1923 which he spent at St. Edward’s University in Austin, Texas.
For many years he has been head of the English department of the University and for a time he was also dean of the College of Arts and Letters and dean of the Graduate School. Although his greatest efforts have been in the field of English, he has also taught certain classes in Philosophy for several years.
His work has not been confined to Notre Dame alone, for he has taught regularly at St. Mary’s College during the past nineteen years. As at Notre Dame, he has been a professor of both English and Philosophy at the neighboring school for girls.
He was supervisor of the Scholastic for a period of almost ten years and likewise served as faculty advisor of the Juggler for several years.
Under the able guidance of Father Carrico the English department at the University has grown from comparative insignificance into the splendid department it is today. He believes that the work of the English students is improving,
primarily because of a better attitude on their part and also as a consequence of the qualification examinations for those who wish to major in English. He says that the practical importance of English in any profession is very great, and he believes that every effort should be made to develop in the student the power of effective expression. Matter, he says, is primary in expression, but form is certainly essential.
In fine, it may be said that he well typifies the teacher of a subject whose center is everywhere and circumference no where.	—m.h.l.

After a hiatus of one week, which was spent in scouring the campus for a personality, (they are getting somewhat scarce) Campus Personalities once more makes its appearance, thus relieving the minds of many anxious readers. We were forced to leave the campus before we finally tracked a personality down; but we succeeded in getting a very worthy one.
John N. deRoulet is the lucky lad (or “Luckless Lad”). That’s a pun, as you will discover by reading further. John is a poet, and very fittingly graces the Poetry Numbei- of the Scholastic. His poetry is exquisite, and of a high grade rarely seen in the work of campus writers. In his sophomore year he won second prize in the Scribblers’ Poetry Contest. Since then, he has competed in all campus literary contests with more or less success. (Which is a nice way of putting it.)
He is an active member of the. Scribblers, although the Scribblers are not aware of this. He was at one time liter
ary editor of the Scholastic until pressing business and a “Nihil Obstacle” forced his resignation. (Which is also a nice way of putting it.) At present, he is associate editor of the Juggler. He has been on the staff of one or more of the various campus publications for the past three years. Besides contributing various efforts signed “John de Roulet” he has also written under the following pen names: Pathological Peter, the Problem Child, (apt name that!); Eightball; and the Luckless Lad.
John is a Chicagoan by nationality and is a senior in the College of Arts and Letters. In his weaker moments he is a golf fiend, which detracts from his active membership in the Scribblers. In order to be near the course he lives off-campus, at 407 N. Michigan Street. (Call 2-8730 and ask for “Daisy.”)	— E.L.T.

2.	She must not be stingy with it.
3.	She must look like Vilma Banky and Joan Crawford combined, if you can imagine such a combination. We are not equal to it.

5.	She must have plenty of cash.
6.	She must not neck anyone else when I am around.
7.	And did I say she must have plenty of cash? Well, she must.
8.	She must think I’m a god, and she must have plenty of cash.
At Purdue university a plan has been inaugurated which allows the students to grade their instructors as to neatness, presentation of subject matter, and other qualities which make for good teachers. Since the undergraduates will hand in these ratings unsigned, it is expected that the criticisms will prove beneficial to both instructors and students.

The Tar Heel, University of North Carolina paper, suggests the following as a summer job for students:
“Pushing hoops is a well founded American occupation. One goes to a ten cent store and buys modest looking hoops— solitaires and the like. These hoops or rings, as they are called by the public, should be stamped ‘10 K’ to plainly show their origin—ten cents—from Kressge. After a little practice one becomes quite proficient, using the corner of a small chisel, and a light hammer. Some operators have stamps made, to expedite the work. Then the hoops are well polished in flour, which gets into the set and improves the lustre of the stone.
“Then one puts on old clothes and entrains for the corn and cotton belt. One approaches a gullible and prosperous looking hayseed on the sidewalk at night. It seems that one has lost one’s job, has tubercular sisters and has been robbed. All but the family ring, worn around the neck on a string, has been taken. It is necessary to leave town immediately to take a good position. The hoop is carefully manipulated, and under a street light should look promising. Sell it for what the buyer will give. Even such a ridiculously low figure as twenty-five dollars will do. After all, one has more hoops.
“This is an ideal occupation for a college man, well versed in the intricacies of psychology. Operators report that they travel extensively and that the work keeps them on their toes.”

Hoteldom’s unique institution, The Ezra Cornell, student hotel-for-a-day, will celebrate its fourth annual opening this year on Friday, May 3. The Ezra Cornell has the distinc
tions of being the only hostelry that is operated for one day each year and the only one for which students make the plans, float the stock issue, and develop the clientele. The social center on the Cornell campus, Willard Straight hall, is transformed into a modern complete hotel and is operated by the students alone in a metropolitan fashion.
We are indebted to the Daily Princetonian for this novel idea:
“Last week in chapel we were meditating. It is with regret that we say this, because we really do enjoy Dean Wicks. But even the most stimulating speakers cannot hold the attention of everyone all the time. Unfortunately we could not concentrate very well upon our air castles, because we were disturbed by the incessant coughing. How to end that nuisance became the problem.”
“Finally we hit upon the idea of installing at every seat a hollow tube, like a speaking tube, put there to be on the receiving end of all coughs. An integral part of the tube would be a muffler device, and that chronic invalid could cough to his heart’s content. The germs could be drawn by a vacuum to a large container in the lower regions, and contagions would be at an end. And think of the benefit to the country in war time; these germs that had been collected for years could be turned loose on the enemy, killing them by thousands.”

The Missouri Student tells this story of a flighty co-ed’s telephone call and its effects:
“Third alarms and still alarms are not unusual in the day’s routine of city fire departments. In the villages the volunteer fire department piles out behind the doughty chief at the sound of a cracked bell. It was a student at Hendrix Hall, in quest of a cab, however, who gave the local fire department an early morning airing Saturday and brought • upon herself the same feeling experienced by Noah when he prayed for rain and got a flood.
“The simple matter of mixed signals in the act of calling a taxi is best presented in the original dialect.
“Hendrix Co-ed (very much in a hurry) ‘633 please.’
“Other end of line (apathetic from a bad attack of spring fever) ‘Mumble—mumble.’ ”
“Hendrix Co-ed: ‘Hendrix Hall, right away!’ (Enter two red wagons and a man with a ladder on his back.)
“By way of a moral it is safe to bet that this makes at least one case on record in which a hurried patron completely forgot to grumble at the efficient taxi service of Columbia.”

♦..................BOOK REVIEWS	❖
HOW THE OLD WOMAN GOT HOME by M. P. Shiel: Macy-Masius, New York, 1929. 434 pages. §2.50.
Ordinarily we have but little concern with that type of fiction known as “mystery or detective” stories; life is too short and the leisure it allows too limited to permit of anything but the best in any field of human endeavor, and especially in art; and so our attention is usually engaged by those gentlemen sometimes forbiddingly referred to as the “masters.”
However, in one of our idle moments, one of our weakened interludes, a copy of this book was placed in our hands ; we opened it, casually, to find a series of racing sleuths and grim-jawed policemen facilitating the return of an elderly gentlewoman to her snugly comfortable domicile.
Somehow, we read through the first page, and then (pausing only for dinner and supper) rushed pell-mell through the book to see how and why Caxton Hazlitt, the hero, became rich over-night, and how and why his mother left and returned home.	'
But, though we say it at the risk of being charged with a pitiful attempt to find an “alibi,” we must say that it was the style that really elicited our breathless attention.
Mr. Shiel’s style is one of the puzzles of present-day literature; he grasps metaphors of blue ice from the slim white columns of the air, similes of cinnamon and nutmeg from his cake of earth and then proceeds to perform the most astonishing feats with his booty.
He tosses words in the air, jumps on them, sits on them, falls on them, twists, turns, and bends them, rubs them between the hands of his brain—and lo! We have a style that outrages all known canons of writing and yet, is pleasing! And a style, also, that still manages to tell us, between hectic giant-like gaspings for breath, and mighty flingings of foursided triangles of beauty, just how the old woman got home.
Because, eventually, she does return—and then; but that would be giving away the story!	—M. H. L.

MIDDLETOWN: A Study in Contemporary American Culture by R .S. and H. M. Lynd. New York, 1929; Harcourt, Brace and Company. 550 pages. S5.
While in college, we are, presumably, preparing for the usually serious business of life; we learn much and forget much; but, ever before us is the fact that, sooner or later, we must emerge into the world and take our places in the ranks of those “earning a living.”	.
For great numbers of us this rather considerable job of “making a living” means entering into the field of business in an-average town, in the midst of average people. We may consider ourselves slightly above the average, but the fact remains that our “daily bread” (which, generally, presupposes—“daily money”) will come to us only by virtue of our ability to adjust ourselves to the average way of things.
Certain it is then, that some full sized delineation of averagedom would be of value to us potential workers in the average (if we'are not already in that group.)
And in “Middletown” we have this picturing; a group of trained scientists studied a typical small American city of some forty thousand inhabitants, with the detached objective methods of anthropologists studying a newly found tribe in the depths of Africa; and their findings, as set forth in this book, are at once illuminating, amusing, and instructive.
We learn that forty-three out of every one hundred people in this typical “American city’ are mainly concerned with getting the living of the entire group; twenty-three out of this hundred make the homes of the city: that, among the working classes, much uncertainty as to “job holding” prevails: that a typical attitude on education seems to be, “I don’t know how we’re going to get the children through college but we’re going to. A boy without an education today just ain’t anywhere!”: that an overwhelming majority of the students in the upper three years of high school did not think that a citizen of the United States should be allowed to say anything he pleases, and did think that the Allies were wholly right in the World War: that the working class reads hardly at all, and the business classes barely a little more, and what reading in this latter group is done, is almost all accomplished by the women: that one in five of the 9,200 homes in the city received the American Magazine, and one in six the Saturday Evening Post—and that out of the same number of homes (9,200) fifteen received Harper’s and three the Dial: that in the main, people tend to spend their leisure time in groups rather than singly—that lodges as means of spending spare time are losing their position (men join for business reasons: that practically two-thirds of the space in the town’s leading morning (!) paper- is given over to advertising; that “the hour you get in at night” was the greatest source of disagreement between parents and their children: that the average sized family numbers six to seven: that 83 percent of the books borrowed from the Public Library are works of fiction, 2 percent of literature, and 0.90 percent of religion: that there is much room for improvement in the machinery of local government and that birth into a particular family usually determined a person’s political status: and finally, as an anti-climax, that there are homes without bathrooms or sewage facilities whose owners possess automobiles !
The record is an immensely interesting one; a person may learn much of the people with whom he is going to deal, and, even, of himself. I cannot urge too highly its immediate and careful reading, upon anyone at all interested in the present day American scene.	.	—M.H.L.

ACADEMY OF SCIENCE
Peter A. Burkhart, of Marr, Ohio, and Stephen C. Bocs-kei, of South Bend, seniors in the College of Science at the University, spoke before the Academy of Science at a regular meeting last Monday night. Both men coordinated their papers on a general discussion of astronomy, dealing principally with the planets and the moon. A select number of slides were projected on a screen to assist the audience in visualizing the subject matter presened. The meeting was one of the longest of the year.
The Rev. Francis Wenninger, C.S.C., who organized the Academy will soon return from a two years’ study in Vienna, and the Academy decided to have a large delegation greet him on his return to the University. Definite plans were not made inasmuch as the date of Father Wenninger’s arrival is not yet known.
Although it is customary for the Academy to close the year with a banquet, it is unlikely that such an affair will take place this year. A committee is considering the matter. Indications point to an open meeting instead, with Father Wenninger in all probability as the principal speaker.
George Paff and Philip Hemming will speak at the next meeting, April 29. Mr. Paff is an instructor in the Biology Department and Mr. Hemming is a senior student in premedicine.
ARCHITECTS
Setting a precedent, which in all probability will soon be followed by the majority of Campus Clubs, the Architects are conducting a handicap golf tournament. Much interest and keen rivalry has been displayed in the qualifying rounds and before the tournament ends the finalists are bound to have a large following.
Qualifying rounds were held Tuesday, May 16, at the Erskine park golf course. Those qualifying were: Robert ' Bracchel, Lawrence Cotter,, William Craddick, Joseph Drin-ane, Everett Jewell, Joseph Lauber, Thomas Listzwan, Charles Pahl, Richard Zimmerly, and Lawrence Moller. Incidentally the last named golfer is among the first ten golfres in the ranking of the National Amateurs Association.
The qualifiers have been matched and play will begin next Tuesday. A loving cup will be awarded to the winner. The cup will be presented at the annual Architects farewell dinner, given the latter part of May.
WRANGLERS CLUB	.
The Wranglers Club held its regular weekly meeting Sunday morning, April 14, in the Organizations’ building: The meeting was conducted by Joseph McNamara, club president.
The main business of the meeting was concerned with the election of new members. To be eligible for membership in the Wranglers on must have an average above 85% in his studies and must have participated in at least one recognized forensic activity while at Notre Dame. As a result of the election two new members were voted into the club. George Beamer, a senior in the College of Law, and Patrick J. Ryan, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Letters were the two men honored with membership to the Wranglers.
Edward Phelan, a sophomore member, delivered the principal address at the meeting. He gave an interesting and well prepared speech on, “The Practice of Usurpation in the Courts of the United States.”
CALIFORNIA CLUB
Approximately thirty-five members attended the meeting of the California Club which was held in Badin Hall “Rec” room last Tuesday evening. The main business of the meeting proved to be the election of officers. The following men were elected to fill the respective offices of the California Club for the school year 1928-29: Larry “Moon” Mullins, president; John O’Brien, vice-president; Robert McDonald, treasurer; and Roy Bailie, secretary.
MINNESOTA CLUB
There will be an important meeting of the Minnesota Club Tuesday, April 23, at 6:30 p. m. in Badin Hall “Rec” room. At this meeting an election of officers for the school year 1928-29 will be held.	,

Ah, Madam, how grave thy thoughts that crimson morn As trundling on to death along the crowded ways, Thou alone stood firm amid the storm Of hatred, such as only death allays.
Of Royal Louis didst thou think, and Antoinette? Of follies proud long ere the Terrods reign?
Or didst thou feel a ivelling tenderness For those who blindly stab in Freedom’s name? Mayhaps, oblivious to all, sweet memories surged, Of the Tuilleries, and Versailles soothing calm, Of violet scent amid the gathering dusk And freedom ere the tumbril’s fierce alarm.
Ah, the tumbrils, ■ The wild peasant tumbrils, Swaying past the rabble ’midst the giddy shout; Gold lace, fine point, Silk pumps, silver buckles— E’en the life of majesty must grandly flicker out!

It is now well past the middle of April and as it is too late to spring any more April first gags; suppose we get serious for a change (Yes do! Any change would be an improvement) and consider some of the things we have tried to accomplish in this page since the time we took over the management. In the first place we tried to provide an outlet for the light verse turned out on the campus (if you’ve been contributing and did not think that you wrote light verse kindly look the other way for a moment please) and now and then we have even published some serious verse (there, that’s better) and at the same time we have tried to provide a farce flash act (as Billboard would probably call it) because we thought you might like it.
Of course it is true that this column is not conducted by Ted Cook, Bob Benchley, Corey Ford, Donald Ogden Stewart or any other of the countries prominent humorists, and so if we have not succeeded as well as might have been desired remember that we have been humbly following in their footsteps. Don’t forget the heartache behind the printed smile and just in case we should amount to something some day you can say you knew us way back when. But what we wanted to say was that we are now in the market for a few high class contributions and would be glad to see what you have to offer.	Yours very truly,

TWELVE years ago this summer, on June 10, 1917, to be exact, Bourke Cochran, whom Father Cavanaugh has called the “last of the classic orators,” stood on the steps of the University Library at its dedication and delivered the oration of the day. “His head and'face like those of a lion,” according to the records of the Diamond Jubilee of that year, the speaker said, “I do not know how this monastic library can be dedicated to the spread of learning more effectively, than by showing that so far from being hostile to Democracy or constitutional freedom, the Church is herself the source of both.”
Such a dedication could not but leave its mark upon the future of the
building which was dedicated. Under the direction of several librarians, through a span of a dozen years in the history of Notre Dame, the Library has represented growth and stability at the same time. It contains in its many stacks of volumes, the histories of the champions of the Church and the nation for years past, the facts and statistics which have proved the true and destroyed the false. Classical, medieval and modern literature have found their way into its shelves. Its stacks, with a capacity of 600,000 volumes are constantly being-added to, at the rate of about sixty books a week. Outwardly, an impressive building of Bedford stone, the inside a store-house of knowledge in systematic arrangement, the Library stands as an imperishable monument to Notre Dame’s progress in building and learning.
THE “OLD. LIBRARY”
To the student of today, accustomed to the -facilities of the present Library, ‘“Old Library” is unknown; to the men who knew Notre Dame before 1917, it is a memory of an inadequate store-room of thousands of miscellaneous books in the Main Building. Yet here, the nucleus of the present collection was formed and the “Old Library” disappeared when progress demanded a new building, more practical methods of cataloguing, and increased facilities for reference work.
The “Old Library” was located on the third floor to the front of the Main Building, where the boys of the St. Thomas’ dormitory of Brownson hall now sleep. The shelves were arranged in two tiers with a gallery around the room to make the books accessible; at either end was an alcove, one called the Lyon’s Alcove, in honor of Professor J. A. Lyons; the other, McMaster Corner, in memory of James A. McMaster, at that time the editor of the New York Freeman’s Journal. In June, 1890, there were 40,000 volumes on the shelves of the library. This number had grown to 100,000 by 1917, when the present library was dedicated.
During thirty-two years, from 1879 when a disastrous fire destroyed the books which had been collected from various societies and professors of the University, until 1911, the Library was under the direction of Professor James Farnham Edwards. Appointed by the Reverend August Lemonnier, C.S.C., in 1874 to gather the books of smaller collections into more accessible form, he proved, in the years to come, an enthusiastic and untiring librarian. Although at times bis passion for collecting rare documents and objects, interfered with his management of the Library, it was he who made the Library a depository for many tilings which have perpetuated the memory of the early Catholic hierarchy of America. He gathered books and relics until the small apartment on the third floor was overcrowded and thus the foundation was laid for a later and more practical library.
LIBRARY DESIGNED BY EDWARD L. TILTON
Professor Edwards died in January, 1911, and was succeeded by the Reverend Paul Foik, C.S.C. During his term as librarian, the present building was built. The

The periodical room offers great possibilities for reflection and retrospect. The Edinburgh Review has been bound since 1802, over a century of reading matter. Blackwood’s since 1817, and the Dublin Review since 1836, offer the opinions of writers and the records of events for scores of years. Here will -be found the Ave Maria published here on our own campus since 1866; the Catholic World with sixty-four years of the Catholic annals in America; Harpers, Atlantic Monthly and Century present inexhaustible reading with the foremost American authors as frequent contributors—Twain, Emerson, Whittier, Thoreau, Bry-
ant, and others. Altogether there are 365 periodicals in this room, many of them
dating back to the time of their opening publication.
The library contains, in all, according to Mr. Paul Byrne, librarian, over 150,000 volumes. Of these, special collections of books related to a certain topic, form an important part, particularly in research. It is a well known fact that the Dante Library with its 2850 volumes is one of the best in the country.. The renowned Dr. John A. Zahm, C.S.C., left his entire Dante Library to the University, including several originals as well as translations and expositions by. numerous critics. The excellence of the collection lies in the number of rare and costly editions of the “Divine Comedy” itself, in almost every language dating from the first yeai- of printing. The collection is devoted closely to the “Divine Comedy” and its related works, excluding other works by this great Italian. The Hibernian collection includes 3000 books, containing the history and literature of Ireland as well as valuable genealogies and biographies. It was begun during the time of the World’s Fair at Chicago as the Irish National Foundation. After the exposition, it was deposited at Notre Dame, where it is recognized as an outstanding collection of Hiberniana. Nev,- books and copies of ancient records dealing with the “Land of Saints and Scholars” are added continually to this, collection.
7,000 VOLUMES ALONE IN BOTANICAL LIBRARIES
The Botanical Libraries are shelved in two groups in rooms on the third floor of the Library. The collection of the late Dr. Edward Lee Greene consists of 4,000 volumes and a herbarium of 100,000 specimens. Dr. Greene was for several years a member of the Notre Dame faculty of Science. During this time
^served the students from 187Q-1917.

Nieuwland, C.S.C., head of the department of chemistry at the University, contains about 3000 volumes on botanical subjects. These collections are for graduate study only.
The South American Library with 1500 volumes was established and donated to the University by the late Dr. John A. Zahm, C.S.C. Besides the books which pertain to the life, custom and geography of the countries in the southern continent, there is a supplementary collection of maps and photographs gathered by Dr. Zahm while he was writing on various South American topics. The Science Library now numbers about 3,000 works dealing exclusively with scientific subjects.
The care of a library, especially one which is devoted to the interest of a group of 3,000 students, requires the direction of a man with capability and foresight. At present Mr. Paul Byrne, Ph. B., B.L.S., is head librarian. A graduate of Notre Dame in -1913, he returned in 1922, after his graduation from the Library School of the State University of New York at Albany. He succeeded the Reverend Lawrence Broughall, ■ C.S.C., as librarian. The Reverend Paul Foik, C.S.C., who held the position from 1912 until 1924, was librarian at the time of the dedication of the Library. Under the direc- . tion of Mr. Byrne at present are twenty assistants, thirteen of whom are students.

POETRY AT NOTRE RAME
In the Atlantic toss of man’s mind the ships of trade launched by the pressing demands of everyday life loom blackly against the horizon of his soul, and crowding them round, are the yachts, of private cares and worries; but, far off on the horizon, again st which these vessels are but dark bits, lie the hidden isles of acceptance; portions of green earth over which hover the wild, white gulls of beauty.
Most of us, during our lives, are conscious of the presence of these air-strung creatures; but few of ’ us can tell anything of what they are saying; and it is precisely the degree in which man hears and knows the cries of these fierce birds, catches their message and tells his fellows of it, that he is a creator, a poet.
We are told that genius always rises above its environment; that a great poem will come out of the slums if it is to come; perhaps, but is it not true that a favorable environment is far more conducive to , the creation of truly fine work in any field of Art than one altogether unfavorable?
Certainly we have here at Notre Dame a favorable environment: Professor John T. Frederick, Editor of the “Midland,” has declared it to be, in his opinion, one of the finest in the country.
And yet, despite this, the poetic output at Notre Dame is actually small when one considers the enrollment and the manifold opportunities for writing.	<
True there is a certain small group on whose islands of acceptance the white gulls of wonder and beauty have taken temporary rest, and these men are doing their best to tell us what their visitors have to say, but, as we have said, they constitute only a small group; and only too often are their efforts met with that reception which is far worse than censure or laughter—silence.
And again, being only human, they produce, many times, poetry that is of no very high value, ’ and it seems that, whenever their work does chance to be the subject of comment, it is on the basis of these rather questionable efforts that it is judged.
. Again the attitude which finds, perhaps, its best expression in the phrase, “I can’t understand it; therefore it’s no good, has no meaning,” is too frequently assumed by critics who are, with equal frequency (and confidence) self-appointed.	;
The poems in this, the Poetry number of the SCHOLASTIC, are all worthy examples of their creator’s work. Taken in the main, they reveal a fine grasp of the fundamental principles of metre, a delicate feeling for words, and a clear understanding of the material.
What we desiderate, however, is a certain intensity and power of imagery, a certain driving force that lashes on the metrically disciplined horses of speech into symphonies of words that cannot but echo , perfectly the cries of the gulls.
And everything that is beautiful in the world speaks to the poet in gull cries that are heavy with the golden weight of their message; while he, poor fellow, struggles to put in words some of the gold deposited on those far and secret islands of the soul ,that are, after all, more truly himself than any-thingelse.
■ <
I
Again we say the poetic output here, viewed in relation to what it might be, is, frankly, disappointing; that that poetry which is written is, in the main, good; some, very good; but, above all, that the hopes for increased work in that field of Literature which echoes the very footfalls of the eternally walking soul, are, like the white silver lake platters round about us, shimmering and shining indeed.

The unbearably divine strain zoning frozn the

Leaps upwards, ever upwards, flies over the cloud zoalled battlements of Heaven,
Hurtling even to the tessellated foot of the Supernal Throne, Where eyes like crimson suns Soften in remembered compassion.

Weave me, Oh singer, a song of sadness, Warp of tears and woof of gladness— That I may be sad yet glad in my madness
For night is embracing me;
Nirvana is beckoning me.
Sing it of sounds of a mother crying,
Mingled with laughter and passion and sighing, That I may'laugh softly yet cry with my dying,
For night is embracing me;
Nirvana is covering me.
Sadness is stealing my reason away—
Gladness is setting emotion at play—
Madness is finding a weakling for prey—
For night is embracing me;

Amused their guests with foolish boasts
Of all the things they sold.
What naughty stories would be told
About the King and Court!
For English hosts grew very bold
When savants gathered for their port.
When Burke and Garrick made the toasts Their glasses would, uphold, And song there’d be to raise the ghosts Of poets dead and cold.
When old Sam Johnson rose and drolled A speech, his fav’rite sport,
His dry reflections he’d unfold When savants gathered for their port.

Ah where such scenes can one behold?
Where can one find the clever sort That met in English tavern old,

Winter (Sbening at ^otre Dame
High in my room above the silent paths, I fling the window open and look down Like God from Heaven. I see the scattered lampi Hanging like planets in an infinite space of snoiv. These are my worlds. I count them one by one: “Here is fair Venus; there tumultuous Earth, Old Jupiter, ringed Saturn, there bold Mars, Uranus, and swift Mercury of old. Neptune is hidden deep) below a sea Of phosphorus.”
But over there! There!
A steepled silhouette with lighted disc
And two black pointers like the grim, thin fingers Of a brief forgotten Fate.
Alas! My wings
Fall limp and I am back in time and space.
I see the clock high in the church tower Pointing relentlessly. The air grows chill. Down on the path mute pilgrims crunch the snow.
Qfyt Door
Softly your slim, white hands have closed the door And your tearful face has faded from before
My dim, beseeching eyes.
And hope, once kindled, dies
And sifts its dull, gray ashes at your feet.
Noto in the night, grown desolate I stand With stricken pride. My empty, outstretched hand Hangs meaningless in air, And only points to where
The door has shut me from you evermore.
Here in the dark your parting word returns To haunt me in my heart, where slow it burns, A candle without light: For when I said “Good-night?”
You suddenly sobbed “Good-bye” and turned away.

1929 Football Schedule Announced
All Nine Games to Be Played on Foreign Fields
According to a recent announcement of the Athletic Department, nine strong elevens are slated to face this year’s gridiron machine, all of whom have met Notre Dame football

teams in the past. Seven of the nine opponents of the 1928 team will again be found on next season’s list, only Penn State and Loyola having been dropped from the roll-call. Their places have been taken by Indiana and Northwestern.
From this it would appear that nothing in the way of novelty will mark the 1929 menu ; however, the fact that all games are to be played away from home renders this a very unique schedule in col
lege circles. Soldier Field, Chicago, is to be the official . “home” grounds of the fighting Irish next fall. This radical departure from the customary practice of playing the usual number of contests on historic Cartier Field was necessitated by the construction of the new stadium, soon to begin.
The Western Conference will be ably represented by three of its strongest teams, Wisconsin, Northwestern, and Indiana. The Badgers are still glorying in the 22 to 6 drubbing which they handed Notre Dame last year, and they appear confident of repeating that feat again during the coming season. Both Northwestern and Indiana are eagerly lying in wait for the opportunity of registering victories over the eleven which Rockne will send upon the gridiron next fall.
SCENE OF DRAKE GAME IN DOUBT
Definite arrangements have ben made for all the games with the possible exception of the Drake contest. The setting for the annual Drake affair has been tentatively set for the Bulldogs’ lair at Des Moines; but it is quite possible that this battle will be waged in Chicago, raising the total of games played in the Windy City to four. Last year, it will be remembered, Drake played a number of its games at night under flood-lights, and there have been many rumors abroad that th^ Drake-Notre Dame game would be played under the same conditions. However, this is still highly improbable.
The schedule is replete with grudge games. Wisconsin, Carnegie Tech, Georgia Tech, and Southern California, all of
whom defeated the Blue and Gold last fall, will be the chief objects of Irish indignation this season. Northwestern and Indiana have always been favorite playmates of Notre Dame, while Army and Navy are fiercely awaiting the opportunity to avenge last year’s defeats.
As usual, every section of the country will be represented on the Notre Dame schedule—Army, Navy, and Carnegie Tech from the East; Wisconsin, Northwestern, Indiana, and Drake from the Middle West; Georgia Tech from the South; and Southern California from the Pacific coast. Should the Rockmen emerge undefeated from this series of conquests, there can be little doubt regarding their claim to the national championship, however mythical that honor may be.

SPRING FOOTBALL SQUAD IN FIRST SCRIMMAGES
Last Saturday afternoon found practically the entire foot- . ball squad—six full teams in all, exclusive of substitutes—	'
engaging in a long series of scrimmages. Of the six teams ; which saw service, three were composed of varsity men, while	'
the three which opposed them were dubbed respectively	|
“Carnegie Tech,” “Wisconsin,” and “Indiana.” All the contests were waged on Cartier Field behind closed doors, it being the wish of the coaches to keep the practice sessions as secret as possible.
As was to' be expected at this early stage of the spring । training period, no brilliant football was displayed by any j of the outfits which took part in the scrimmages. In fact, the playing as a whole was rather ragged, and there is ample	g
room for improvement. However, during the next few weeks	|
it is quite likely that considerable progress will be made, and several smoothly-working elevens will be ready to take the field for next fall’s campaigns.	f

BASEBALL PROVES POPULAR INTERHALL SPORT IN OPENERS LAST SUNDAY
Any doubts as to whether baseball would supplant football in popular favor were dissipated last Sunday morning and afternoon when large groups of teams took the fields in the opening struggles of the interhall- diamond sport. Ten games in all were played; Off-Campus and Lyons forfeited their minor team games to Freshman and Brownson, respectively, by reason of non-appearance.
• Large scores piled up by the victors were noticeable, but as soon as the teams are better organized the competition is expected to become keener and very exciting games should
be seen within the next few weeks.' Corby and Walsh won. the honors for high scoring. Corby went on a rampage against the major team of Howard and trounced them, 22 to 4. Walsh took in the Morrissey minors, 22 to 3, in another walkaway victory.
Results of Interhall baseball games played Sunday, April 14, were as follows:
Major—Corby 22, Howard 4; Sophomore 14, Sorin 2; Badin 7, Carroll 6; Morrissey 8, Walsh 2; Freshman 11, Off-Campus 7; Lyons 5, Brownson 2.
Minor—Corby 10, Howard 4; Sophomore 5, Sorin 2; Carroll 15, Badin 4; Walsh 22, Morrissey 3; Freshman 9, Off-Campus 0 (forfeit) ; Brownson 9, Lyons 0 (forfeit).

ELDER TO FACE STAR DASHMEN TOMORROW AT KANSAS
- Captain Jack Elder, sprint star of Notre Dame, will race against a great field of dashmen when he toes the mark in the 100 yard dash at the Kansas v Relays tomorrow. Elder is the defending champion ■“ in the century event at Kansas having won last year 5 in the fast time of ten seconds flat.
In view of the remarkable success Elder has had during the indoors season, and the fact that he holds ( a victory over the Olympic champion, Percy Wil-• liams, the hundred yard dash event will attract con, siderable interest this year.
v The field this year will include Easter of Nebraska, who finished second in the Relays last year, and Parke of Drake, Missouri Valley Conference champion, who copped third place. Besides these, such . sprinters as Tolan of Michigan who placed second ’ in the Western Conference indoor dash, Meier and Engle of Iowa State, Shafer of the University of - Detroit, Rosenheim and King of Missouri, Wilcox of Kansas, Rhea of Minnesota, Gordon of Indiana, Treps of Marquette, Barron of Creighton, Addison of Oklahoma, and others from Texas, California and a few other states, will compete.
The record for the 100 yard dash at Kansas is 9.6 seconds and is held by Roland Locke of the Uni- versity of Nebraska. It is thought by many sport writers that with the strong field entered in this event that the record may be shattered this year.
Coach John P. Nicholson has also entered several relay teams in the competition: Elder, Boagni, Nichols and Rourke or Redgate will run on the s quarter mile quartet, while a four mile relay team, c composed of Bill and John Brown, Bob Brennan and ; Pete Morgan, will also compete.
; An added feature of the meet this year is the , half-mile relay for backfield men of the various competing schools. Only football men are eligible y for this race. The runners will carry a football in-
. stead of a baton. Jack Elder, Jim Brady, Fred ' Collins and Jack Chevigny wlil represent Notre ” Dame in this race.
The Kansas Relays is one of the most prominent athletic events of the year. In the meet this year one hundred and eighty-four universities and high schools will have two thousand athletes competing, q The two days of track and field activities begins * Friday morning, April 19, with the preliminaries for * the high school divisions, and in the afternoon the finals and the first five events of the decathlon for university and college athletes will be run off. Saturday morning, April 20, the last five events of the decathlon are scheduled, with the twenty-seven events of the Kansas Relays program set for the f afternoon.
'' Approximately forty schools will be represented by nearly 500 athletes. This will set a new competition mark for the meet.
Some of the prominent universities which will be represented are Colorado Aggies, Creighton, Drake, Chicago, Grinnell College, Iowa State, Kansas State, Marquette, Northwestern, Notre Dame, Texas A. & ’ M., University of Detroit, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, ■ Texas, and Washington University of St. Louis. It is probable that Notre Dame will enter several relay teams as well as ath-_ letes to compete in the various field events.

WABASH INITIAL NORTHERN OPPONENT ON CARTIER FIELD
Coach Tommy Mills’ Notre Dame baseball team was scheduled to stack up against Coach Pete Vaughn’s scrappy Wabash College nine this afternoon on Cartier Field in the inaugural home contest of the season. Fresh from a successful Spring trip during which they captured six out of seven games played, the Blue and Gold players have been meeting the Freshman aggregation for the past few days in preparation for the conflict and are in mid-season shape.
Either Jachym or Rust will start the game for Notre Dame with Lordi on the receiving end. The Little Giant battery had not been announced at a late hour this morning by Coach Vaughn.
SPLINTERS FROM THE PRESS BOX
It looks as though Ky Ebright has developed another wonder team at California. Any crew that beats a Washington boatload has to row. Skeptics will say that Ebright ought to have a great crew with seven of the nine men who composed the Olympic champion crew back. But this does not necessarily follow. What was a great crew or team one year may be mediocre the next. Columbia had practically all of her great 1927 crew back last year, but the Lions were by no means as successful. Brown’s Iron Men team of 1926 were the door-mats of the football world in 1927. So it is easily seen that a team that was great one year is not necessarily great the next. In fact any coach that can repeat the great performances of one year with the same group of men has a real job on his hands, considering that he has to contend against cockiness and swelled heads as well as other things. More credit to Ky Ebright if he repeats his great success of last year.

After having been opposed to each other for years the A. A. U. and the N. Cl A. A. have finally decided to bury the hatchet. It is about time that these two organizations, who between them control the amateur athletics of the United States, were reconciled. Their former attitude was hardly in keeping with the spirit of friendliness and goodfellowship which amateur sport is supposed to foster.

DREAMS THAT COME TRUE
I am sitting alone in my room tonight, Dreaming and smoking my old cob pipe;
I smoke and dream, and dream until I get a plot, and get a thrill.
I am in the writing game, you see;
And the pipe-dreams softly bring to me Scenes of carnage where the red blood ran,
And the dreams all come from a bright Blue can.
It’s just a can of Edgeworth-cut— Fragrant as flowers—sweet as a nut; Of all Fate’s kindly gifts to man
Is this gift of dreams from the bright Blue can.
I sit me down at eve, to smoke;
And soon am wrapped in amagic cloak;
It has banished trouble, it has banished pain,
And the sad old world is young again. J. H. Rockwell
