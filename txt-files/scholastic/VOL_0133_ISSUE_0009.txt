Happy Halloween!
Before you run off to those various gouhlish fests read on
Back from fall break and already traumatized with the first week back to classes ... Had a grand time back home — the ‘rents were great for the first three days at home (and so was the food)—but then you longed for college “freedom” ... Guess what? Another football weekend is coming up (TGIF!)!... But the ‘rents are visiting too!
Our Campus Life staff has put together a strategy to get the most out of ND’s first-intwenty-odd-years Official Homecoming Weekend. It’s sure to be a memorable time as the Fighting Irish once again sink the Navy “middies.” (Jon Paul Potts previews the action on page 14.) Leave ybur parents at the float-filled parade, get your dad that valuable Rocky Bleier autograph and do your bonding with family and old alumni friends at the dessert reception. (See the calendar of events on page 11.)
While this is the first official homecoming in years, it’s not the first ever. Copy Editor Anne Mary Klem “glances back” to past homecoming celebrations on page 22. ■

Why not here?
“Notre Dame students and student organizations are free.to examine and to discuss all questions of interest to them, and to express opinions publicly and privately.”
-	du Lac, page 75
“To be considered an official University recognized student organization, a club’s purpose must be consistent with the University’s mission, whether it be spiritual, moral, intellectual, cultural, social, athletic or recreational. No organization, or member of any organization on behalf of the organization, may encourage or participate in any activity which contravenes the mission of the University, or the moral teachings of the Catholic Church.”
-	du Lac, page 72
u Lac is an amazing document. Looking at the £7 passages at left, student organizations are simultaneously both free to examine and express opinions on all questions, and at the same time their purposes may not conflict with the university’s mission or encourage any activity contravening the teachings of the Catholic Church. For those of you scoring at home, that’s a Catch-22.
National opinion polls show that a majority of Americans favor legal abortion. Presumably, at least a few students at Notre Dame share that opinion. A Pro-Life group already exists at Notre Dame; Would a Pro-Choice group be given the university recognition that would enable it to hold on-campus meetings? Shouldn’t those students have the right “to express opinions publicly and privately” even if their views go against the Church?
Official Church doctrine is that only men may be ordained as priests. The university allows the existence of a group calling for the ordination of women. But isn’t such a group contravening the teachings of the Catholic church?
What about political groups on campus whose national party platforms support legal abortion, or birth control? Their partisan stances are against Church teaching; why does the university allow them on campus?
WhatabouttheBaptistStudentUnion? Whatabout an Atheist Student Union? Who gets recognition? How can you decide which groups pass muster and which must exist as unofficial, underground clubs?
The university’s open speaker policy states that “Notre Dame students may invite and hear any person of their own choosing” — that’s it; no restrictions on what the speakers may advocate. Do Notre Dame students have less freedom of speech on their own campus than visitors?
The core of the debate over recognition for Gays and Lesbians at Notre Dame I Saint Mary’s College is not about homosexuality and sin. It’s about civil
rights — the freedom of speech and the right of assembly.
The debate is about letting people you may not agree with have their say, not because it’s legally required (Notre Dame, as a private institution, isn’t bound by many of the constitution’s strictures), but simply because it’s the right thing to do. It’s about allowing an occasional “heresy” because inquiry, questioning and disagreement are vital parts of the learning process which can lead to an informed faith.
The university is comfortable with a simple disclaimer in its open speaker policy: “Sponsorship of guest speakers does not imply approval or endorsement of the views expressed, either by the sponsoring group or the University.” Why couldn’t a similar disclaimer be added to regulations governing student groups? Perhaps a second type of recognized group could be created under such a disclaimer—this type of club would be allowed to advertise and use university facilities, but not given access to club funding.
The university’s rationale for denying some groups recognition while granting it to other groups which also hold views contrary to church teaching'must be examined. The rules in du Lac are unclear, and when regulations are unclear, they leave a lot of room for arbitrary individual judgement.
A great university should be a place of learning, and true learning requires freedom. Inconsistencies abound in the university’s policies on free speech. Students have a right to an explanation of those inconsistencies, and administrators should start eliminating them.	. .

Save Your money and Skip Other People’s Money
by Noah Cooper
UT love money more than the things JL money can buy ... The only thing I love more is other people’s money.” Outstanding. Danny DeVito snarling thatopen-ing line in his new release, Other People’s Money, signaled the beginning of a potentially great film. What could be better than DeVito as a crooked CEO of a money-grubbing business? It’s the classic Louie Di-Palma in a three-piece suit. Ten minutes later it is apparent that DeVito’s 1980 . vehicle, Going Ape, had more laughs. ,	"the plot is not the problem. With enough
funny lines, and if it did not take itself too seriously, it could have worked. DeVito as Lawrence Garfield (a.k.a. Louie the Liquidator), head of Garfield Enterprises, wakes , each morning to Wall Street, to his favorite .. food, to Dunkin’ Donuts and to Carmen, his personal computer, who tells him what company is ripe for a takeover. One morning, Carmen picks New England Wire and , Cable, a quaint factory run by William Jorgensen or “Jorgy” (Gregory Peck), located in a small, working-class Rhode Island . town. The company has no environmental problems or debt, making it an innocent lamb in the eyes of the ravenous Garfield.
Jorgy refuses to deal with Garfield’s citing loyalty to his workers and the task of carrying on his family business. Jorgy hires his daughter, Kate (Penelope Ann-Miller), as a lawyer to fight and deal with Garfield. Garfield falls in love with Kate, further . complicating the takeover bid. The rest of the film builds to a vote taken by the share-. holders in the company as whether to accept Garfield or retain Jorgy.
The screenplay reeks. Not one funny line is delivered in almost two hours of running time. Danny DeVito can be hilarious when he has the opportunity to scream, curse and scramble his way through a film as in Ro
mancing the Stone or any “Taxi” episode. The script gives him nothing, and director Norman Jewison limits DeVito’s on-screen movement, so he appears stale. DeVito is about as free to show his wonderful talents as the guy in the dorm room next to me is to dance naked at halftime of the Fiesta Bowl (not that he hasn’t tried). You have to be a special kind of stupid not to let DeVito carry your movie, and Other People's Money qualifies. For this film to be a success, Jewison should have used a fast-paced, high-energy world of decisions and careers hanging on the whim of a ruthless boss. Other People's Money is so methodical, predictable and shallow — even in the first ten minutes—that it doesn ’ t even give itself a chance to develop.
Another major reason why this sad attempt at a film fails is the romantic relationship between Garfield and Kate. If someone as gorgeous as Kate can be physically attracted to someone as obnoxious and trolllike as Garfield, then Julia Roberts is giving me a backrub as I write this. It could be me, but the though t of Garfield and Kate ’’sweating under satin sheets,” as Garfield puts it, makes me wish I had accidently walked into Ernest Scared Stupid. When they trade business threats with one another, they almost approach comedy, but the sexual threats, such as Garfield’s proposition that whomever climaxes first during sex has to back out of the deal, are not even close to believable. Jewison forces this romantic relationship on us in several innuendos like the scene where Garfield is shot directly from over the breasts of Kate. Jewison is trying for something that will never work in a non-slapstick film.
The film is more of a moral comdemna-tion of business practices than a true comedy. The film abandons all pretenses of a comedy about halfway through but then
concentrates on pounding home the idea of capitalism gone awry. The climatic moment in the film occurs when both Jorgy and Garfield make their speeches to the shareholders. I don’t want to pay six dollars to hear DeVito in a very dignified, un-DeVi-tojike manner tell me why capitalism demands takeovers. I can get that from a much better dramatic actor such as Michael Douglas in Wall Street, and if that is the climax for a comedy, one would get more laughs from watching “MacNeil/Lehrer.”
The dialogue in the film is predictable (Jorgy screams at Garfield, “Get out of my officebeforel throw you out!”), thebusiness jargon too complex and the ending much too easy and contrived for the anti-big-business message the film wants to send.
The supporting cast is anemic at best. Miller never defines herself as the cunning lawyer or the seductive lover. The fact her character was made to be the daughter of Jorgy seems to be added as an afterthought, because their relationship never has any effect on the defense of the company. What - is Gregory Peck doing in a film of this poor quality? Nothing to save it, that’s for sure. His character is simply top folksy to get any real depth out of him, although Peck deserves some credit for a valiant attempt, and one of the best grimaces of all time. Dean Jones (yes, the same Dean Jones from such triumphs of Hollywood as Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo) should be checked for a pulse, as he showed no signs of life in this film.
In fact, Other People’s Money was devoid of any sign of life, and I wish I had spent someone else’s money to see it. □

Trompe Le Monde
by Marshall Armintor
With the release of the Pixies’ third full album, Bossanova, it had become obvious that lead singer/mastermind Black Francis and crew finally lost their bearings after signing on with the major labelEIektra. Although some tracks were strong, the effort just didn’t seem to be there. Over a year later, with the release of Trompe Le Monde, the Pixies have returned with what is their best musical statement since their landmark 1987 4AD E.P., Surfer Rosa.
In plain English, the album title means “fool of the world,” which seems to be exactly what the Pixies had in mind. Oh, they still sound like, well, the Pixies - like Neil Young and Iggy Pop fronting a flamenco sock-hop band, as tracks like the current single ‘tetter to Memphis,” “Alec Eiffel” and “Distance Equals Rate Times Time” (catchy title, huh?) will attest And yes, Pixies song lyrics are still on the dadaish side. But there aren’t any songs about vampires or witches or the Old Testament, all favorite Black Francis song topics; if the cover art reminiscent of the ’50s classic “Forbidden Planet” didn’t tip you off already, the science-fiction themes of Bossanova abound, as on “Planet of Sound” and “Space (I Believe In).”
But even a quick spin through the release reveals at least four different incarnations of the Pixies. The band playing the stackity slam tune “Planet of Sound” (perhaps the Pixies’ best song yet) sounds an awful lot
like Sonic Youth; “U-Mass” is played by some up-and-coming fraternity grunge band; the etho-folk “Lovely Day” is like an old Camper Van Beethoven outtake; “Space (I Beleive In)” is product of some funk outfit
from the lower regions of hell; their unexpectedly faithful cover of the Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Head On” sound like a cleaner version of, well, you know who.
This musical diversity indicates that the Pixies have managed to avoid the two-homed peril to which some “college” bands succumb: getting into a creative rut (like the Feelies) or evolving for the sake of change and losing your audience anyway (like Talk-ingHeads). In fact, the dominant impression of Trompe Le Monde is an attempt to both recapture their punk past and stretch out artistically. Sure, lead guitarist Joey Santiago’s nerve-grating atonality pleas
antly abounds on many of the songs, and the record as a whole kicks as hard as anything the band has done. But with additional musicians on percussion and keyboards, the Pixies have managed to expand their sound while still managing to sound like themselves, and they come up with far better results than the material on Bossanova. On such meditative tracks as “Bird Dream of Olympus Mons” (strangely reminiscent of late U2) and “The Navajo Know” (the best song Sting never wrote), Black Francis resists sliding into his quasi-Iggy Pop mode and actually sings (!) in his angelic choirboy tones. Believe it or not, folks! My only complaint, though, is about the Pixies’ continued refusal to feature the sultry voice of bassist Kim Deal, whose vocals could make your teeth sweat (But that’s probably a male thing. Oh well...)
With most of the 15 songs clocking in under three minutes (many around two), the Pixies once again prove that brevity, not only create a sui generis sound as far as alternative music goes, but also take their place with Sonic Youth as the premier purveyors of artsy thrash-pop for the ’90s. Now if we could only get Hiisker Dii back together, we would then and only then have a perfect world.	□

Underground organization strives to be recognized by the university
by Jenny Tate
Opposition, oppression, misunderstanding, fear — these are terms often asso? ciated with the plight of gay and lesbian people for recognition and acceptance. In a society where heterosexuality seems to be the norm, gay and lesbian people have a tendency to be ostracized, deemed abnormal or regarded as weird. Gays and Lesbians Notre Dame/SaintMary’s (GLND/SMC) is an organization which attempts to combat such cultural biases in an effort to increase awareness of gay and lesbian people.
GLND/SMC is an underground organization which has gained attention lately for its increased efforts to obtain recognition from the administrations of both universities. A deluge of editorials and discussions has recently been sparked by the group’s issuance of a one-page memo to the Hall President’s Council on August 26 asking for consideration of a resolution declaring student residences as “safe havens for homosexuals.” A relatively quiet group of undergraduate and graduate students, faculty and staff, GLND/SMC has suddenly taken the spotlight amidst heated opinions and religious questions.
The group’s objectives, as outlined in their constitution, consist of four major parts. One primary purpose of the group centers around providing support for gay, lesbian and bisexual people in “the homo-phobic and heterosexist atmosphere in which they live.” Another goal of the group includes informing and educating both the gay and lesbian and the non-gay/lesbian segments of the two institutions of current
6
developments in the gay and lesbian community. The third objective is to facilitate interaction and provide opportunities for gay and lesbian people to socialize together.
The group also attempts to gain recognition from the administrations of both schools “in order to be an effective instrument to advance equality for gay and lesbian persons, and to be more available to those who would benefit from this organization.” GLND/SMC’s endeavors to gain recognition as an official student group have been met with refusal and controversy. Tension
appears to be mounting.
Although GLND/SMC has maintained constant dialogue with administrators in their fight for recognition, members say the
primary focus of the group still rests on providing social opportunities for gay and lesbian persons in a non-political environment
Father Robert Griffin Is sympathetic to the GLND/SMC cause because he feels that people should be tolerant of orientations other than their own.
primary focus of the group lies in creating social opportunities for gay and lesbian persons. The group wants to be seen as a social organization, as exemplified in their recent advertisement in the newspaper, Common Sense, which is entitled “Where the Queers are ’9i.” This advertisement provides a list of upcoming social events for homosexuals. Group president Michael Vore considers formal administrative recognition of the group to be important in that it would allow the group to meet on campus and receive student funding, but Vore stresses that the
SCHOLASTIC j

“I don’t see it (gaining formal recognition) to be necessary. We would essentially be doing a lot of the same things we are doing now ... It (GLND/SMC) is a socially-oriented group. We put that advertisement out to counter, as best we
could, the perception of our group as a political organization,” said Vore.
Aside from its fight for formal recognition from the administrations, GLND/ SMC also faces a difficult struggle to gain acceptance from the student bodies of both Notre Dame and Saint Mary’s. A major obstacle in the path of acceptance for the gay and lesbian community lies in the fact that GLND/SMC has been met, not with hatred and animosity, but rather with a sort of apathy. “I would say that most people we run into are real open-minded, but simply uniformed,” said one group member who wishes to remain anonymous.
Most students, when approached by the Safe Haven resolution, refuse to acknowledge discrimination of gay and lesbian persons as a problem and state that du Lac's previously established policies forbidding discrimination of any sort cause theresolution to be redundant. “It(harass
ment of gay and lesbian persons) was never a problem in the dorms. I didn’t think it happened,” said HPC co-chairperson Charlie James. James contends that the submittence of the resolution and the consequent controversy only encourages gay-bashing and jokes. “The way I see it is that its not a problem, but that by bringing it into the light, it will become a problem,” said James.
GLND/SMC members argue that student apathy or blatant dismissal of the. issue remains unwarranted since the issue is pertinent. “It (gay and lesbian controversy) is relevant in that it deals with 10 percent of the student body. It is relevant in that everyone knows someone who is gay,” said group member Michael A. Miller, a graduate student
Vore emphasizes that the concerns of gay and lesbian persons, as well as the concerns of all minority groups, must be considered for several reasons. Vore stresses that at some point in every individual’s lifetime, hc/shc will be a minority. “There will be a time in everyone’s life when they are at risk. We all think we are in that larger group where
everything is going to go our way. That’s not always the case,” said Vore. Vore advocates education and the exposure to diversity that should occur at the collegiate level. “College is the place where we should be able to accept and encourage different ideas,” said Vore.
On a more basic level, Vore states that the issue boils down to a simple concept of human rights. “Human rights affects us all. When you affirm it for other people, you affirm it for yourself,” said Vore.
Vore, too, realizes that society has created formidable obstacles to the acceptance of gay and lesbian persons. “Homosexuality is perceived as being wrong morally. We grew up $‘We are here; we are all children of God.
Some of us are flawed in one way, some of usareflawedmta-
—Fr. Robert Griffin
with a lot of resistance to the whole idea... We
have to recognize, even with people who hate us, that we have been raised in a society that taughtustohategays. Thatkind of hatred takes a long time to work out,” said Vore.
The group believes that another problem arises when people attempt to reconcile Catholicism and homosexuality. Many people on the predominantly Catholic campuses of Notre Dame and Saint Mary’s view homosexuality as a sin and an orientation incompatible with then-religious beliefs. In actuality, though, the Catholic Church does not condemn homosexuality but homosexual acts, as they are not procreation. Group members affirm that gay and lesbian persons find the tendency to lump together the two facets, causing homosexuality to be deemed a sin, to be frustrating. “It’s an unfair reduction because it equates gays and lesbians only to their sexual acts,” said Miller.
It should be noted that GLND/SMC does not endorse homosexual activity. “We support gays, lesbians and bisexuals, but we do not support activity against Catholic teachings,” said a group member who wishes to remain anonymous.
Father Robert Griffin, who is sympathetic to the gay and lesbian cause, does not feel that being Catholic should cause barriers in the
acceptance of gay and lesbian persons. “The fact is that the relationship between Catholicism to gays and lesbians is the same as the relationship between Catholicism and the rest of us,” said Griffin. Griffin refers to gay and lesbian persons as “our brothers and sisters” and argues that discrimination aimed at gays and lesbians goes against the teachings of the Gospel. “We are here; we are all children of God. Some of us are flawed in one way, some of us are flawed in another,” said Griffin.
Griffin emphasizes that as Christians, people should be tolerant of orientations other than their own. Griffin rejects the idea that, in being sympathetic to the gay and lesbian cause, he is an exception amongst Catholic clergy members. Griffin contends that the major stumbling stone encountered by gay and lesbian community members on the two campuses is not Catholicism, but the institutions. “Gays do nothave problems individually with the Church and with priests. The problem on this campus is recognition of the group,” said Griffin.
Members of GLND/SMC believe that the Observer's (Sept 17) Quote of the Day, “If homosexuality were the normal way, God would have created Adam and Bruce” expresses the view of too many people. “On the surface, the quote tries to imply that it is not natural to be gay and that it is not natural to be lesbian and that God wouldn’t create a situation where two men or two women were attracted to each other. That is untrue and I know that from experience. The worst part about that is that people use that notion to assume that I make a choice to be gay. Of course, I don’t,” says Vore. “The bottom line with the choice thing is that I don’t choose to be gay, but I choose whether or not I show myself to be who I really am,” said Vore.
GLND/SMC harbors no ill will to the students of Notre Dame and Saint Mary’s but seeks to contribute to the two campuses. “I love Notre Dame, the people and the place. That’s why I am working so hard to change it because I care so much about it,” said Miller.
The debate concerning GLND/SMC’s formal recognition will continue to rage. But perhaps mere recognition of the group is not all that lies at stake here. The solution may lie much deeper and involve more than academic institutions.	□

The safe haven problem began with a letter from Michael Vore given to hall presidents from the Hall President’s Council. ‘The HPC handled it very poorly,” said Rob Pritchard, co-president of St. Edward’s Hall. “Instead of any discussion or information on the letter, we were simply told to do with it [the letter] what we wanted.”
As a result, the respective dorm presidents found themselves on their own. The results have been varied. Some dorms voted on the proposal immediately, like Siegfried, who passed the resolution that week; Others, took , time for more discussion to offer amendments to the proposal. And still others have had Michael Vore speak to their residents and are in the process of deciding what should be done next.
■ When asked why she was able to pass the resolution within the week, Siegfried’s president, Amy Listerman responded, “We did not read into the proposal. We simply accepted the term safe haven for what it was
— a place where people can come and hot feel discriminated against.”
In Stanford, co-presidents Greg Butrus and John Donohue acted quickly, too. According to Butrus, “As a dorm, we knew what we wanted. With the help of our rector

the fewer stereotypes would exist. “We

said Donohue. “I don’t know the best way to do it, but as members of the student government and hall council, we’ve got that responsibility.”
Interviewees claim the student body’s response has been varied. While the majority seem to be in favor of the idea of nondiscrimination or no harrassment based on sexual orientation, some have noticed adamant homophobia on campus. Among the general interest in this issue, apathy of indifference is said to still exist “But I feel that even if you see students making jokes of the issue, they are still thinking about it,” commented Listerman.
The hall presidents agree that bringing the problem to the individual dorms was a good idea. “It gave us a chance to discuss what we needed as a dorm,” said Greg Butrus. And although they believe that it may not have been handled in the most organized way, it has still opened debate on campus and given students something to think about.
Student government members have been
satisfied with the dorms’ results also. “I like the fact that the problem is being dealt with in the individual dorms. The dorm is the residents' home, and these resident hall discussions allow the students to voice their opinions on their ‘home,’” said Dave Florenzo, student body vice-president. As for their role in the issue, most student government members feel that they have the duty to provide the students with more guidance and information. And Florenzo believes that an organized forum could be planned with the government’s help.
Despite this agreement, however, others feel that for major changes in attitudes to take place, the problem will have to be dealt with at the administrative level. Joseph Blanco added that, “We have the job of educating the student body, but beyond that, we will need the help of the university.”
Many involved with the issue sense an alienation between the student body and the administration. Student leaders feel as if the university is closing itself off to the problem.
“What they fail to realize is that GLND/ SMC is not anti-Catholic. It is simply an organization designed to help students deal with their sexuality,” said Pritchard.
Listerman added, “The university is afraid to say anything. They feel that if they accept the group, they will sound as if they are condoning it"
Some student leaders believe that most of the problems stem from a lack of knowledge. Donohue said, “Any resolution, in reality, that a dorm may pass doesn’t mean anything unless the students understand what it says and what it stands for.” With the student and hall government’s interest in presenting the facts and increasing awareness of the problem, it is possible that a working solution will be found with the help of the administration.
As Joseph Blanco concluded, “People on this campus have good will. If they learn to sensitize themselves to this issue, I think we will begin to see some positive change.” □

As members of the Notre Dame family return to the shadow of the Golden Dome for Homecoming Weekend, the football team battles Navy for victory number 700 in the football program s history
By Jon Paul Potts
Everywhere the 1991 Notre Dame football team turns, it keeps bumping into history of one sort dr another. Last week, the Irish narrowly defeated the University of Southern Califomia24-20, perpetuating one of the greatest rivalries in college football.
This Saturday, the Irish take to the gridiron on the brink of attaining a true landmark in Notre Dame’s storied football history — 700 all-time victories. Entering the 1991 campaign, the football program’s all-time tecprd stood at 692-206-40. With last weekend’s victory over the Trojans, the team’s record stood at 7-1, and the Irish stood poised on the cusp of history. Only the University of Michigan has attained such a mark — with its all-time mark of 712 triumphsentering the 1991 season—but the Wolverines have had the advantage of nine
14
more seasons than Notre Dame.
And what a weekend to attain this mark. The Irish host the United States Naval Academy, renewing the longest-standing intersectional rivalry in college football, dating back to 1927.
It will be the first homecoming weekend at Notre Dame in 11 years (see history story on pages 22-23), and all the parents will be here for the annual Parents’ Football Weekend. It will be a festive and historical after-noon/evening (the kickoff is at 4 p.m.).
This series has definitely seen its better days. Notre Dame holds a decisive 54-9-1 margin since the series’ inception 64 years ago. The last time the Midshipmen defeated the Irish was in 1963 when a certain Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback who would go on to National Football League
stardom — Roger Staubach — tossed two touchdowns to lead Navy to a 35-14 victory. That is 17 years of futility for the Middies.
Last year, Navy battled the Irish in Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, but came up short in a 52-31 loss. But the score is deceiving because the Alton Grizzard-led Middies played hard and were actually tied with Notre Dame 10-10 at the half. Two Navy touchdowns in the game’s last four minutes only added to the uneasiness of Irish fans watching every where.
But the Irish matched the Navy effort and iced the game with nine seconds left when senior cornerback Todd Lyght, on kickoff special teams for his dependable hands, grabbed an errant Navy on-sides kick attempt and sprinted 53 yards for a spectacular return touchdown.
SCHOLASTIC
After that game, the typically pessimistic Lou Holtz was exasperated, “It’s disappointing when you score 50 points and can’t play your second unit. This is probably one of lowest spots of my career.”
Holtz should not have that problem this
year as the Middies have stumbled to a 0-7 Middies comes in the form of a backfield by mark under second-year coach George committee: junior tailback Duke Ingraham

The last time the Middies beat the Irish, in 1963, future Heisman Trophy winner and NFL star Roger Staubach was their quarterback.
Chaump. Along the way have been losses to such national powers as Bowling Green and Delaware. Holtz may be pulling players out of the student section by the end of this one.
The big reason for Navy’s frustrations has been the loss of Grizzard who graduated as the Naval Academy’s all-purpose yardage leader. Grizzard ran the wishbone offense from his quarterback position and was always a double-threat to hurt the opposition, Notre Dame included. In the 1990 game, Grizzard rolled up 93 yards rushing including a touchdown and 161 passing with two touchdown tosses.
This season, sophomore quarterback Jason Van Matre has struggled to earn his
OCTOBER 31, 1991
stripes. Van Matre leads the squad in rushing with 384 yards and two touchdowns. But when Coach Chaump has called for the pass, the young field general has thrown five interceptions with only two scoring passes.
The other main offensive threat for the
(59 rushes for 187 yards, 2 TDs), sophomore fullback Brad Stramanak (45 for 177 yards and 4 touchdowns) and junior tailback Vinnie Smith (50 for 236 despite only three varsity games).
On defense, their standout player is junior outside linebacker Bob Kuber-ski. He led Navy in tackles in 1990 with 74, including 53 unassisted and 10 for losses. Kuberski stands an intimidating 6’5”, 267 pounds and was a candidate for All-East honors entering 1991. He also recieved the tremendous honor of being selected for the Scholastic Football Review All-Opponents team.
Senior co-captain Byron Ogden will also be a force on
defense for the Middies. Backing up these two big-game players are sophomores David Stowers (6’2”, 228 lbs.) and giant Blair Sokol (6’7”, 238 lbs.). The leading tackler thus far in 1991 for Navy has been junior strong safety Chad Chatlos.
As usual, Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz is putting on his best game face and making the Midshipmen look like a strong challenger to beat his Fighting Irish squad.
“Navy is going to play hard, they are very young, but they almost beat Virginia,” said Holtz in his weekly press conference. “Five of their losses have been by a touchdown or less. For us to think that we ’re going to have an easy day on Saturday would be a miscon
ception. We may have better athletes, but that didn’t make any difference when the score was tied 10-10 at halftime last year.” .
Desire can count for a lot in the game of football, and last year, Navy almost rode a wave of emotion to a huge upset. But this year, the team has been decimated by the loss of Grizzard, their offensive catalyst, as well as the loss of 13 starters and 27 lettermen to graduation.	:	'
Even Holtz concedes their lacking talent — with a qualification, of course: “I’m not going to try to tell you they are a great football team, but they outrushed us last year and proved they were capable of controlling the football against a defense that had three All-Americans.”	/ ;
Emotion may keep Navy in it for the first quarter, but talent will prevail and the Irish will coast home in this one. '
So join in the Homecoming festi vites. Go to the Friday night pep rally in the Stadium, watch the post-pep fireworks, watch the parade, tailgate with yourparcnts and join in celebrating the 700th victory in Notre Dame football history.	;	.
Quite a milestone, indeed.	□

A True Irish Woman
Eva Flood has been a leader for the Notre Dame woman's cross country team despite her inexperience with running against the clock.
By Amanda Clinton
Imagine traveling to a foreign country for college. Imagine that you have never even set foot in the country where you will attend school for the next four years. Imagine that the university you will be attending has a mascot called the Fighting American.
Freshman Eva Flood does not need to imagine such a scene— she is experiencing it.
A native of Skerries, Ireland, approximately 20 miles from Dublin, Flood first set foot on U.S. soil when she reached South Bend, the home of the Fighting Irish.
Flood is not only attempting to adjust to the pressures of collegiate sports competition and a large work load, but she is also living approximately 5,000 miles and a whole ocean away from home. For the oldest of six children and the first to leave home, the transition is not easy.
“I do get really homesick,” said Flood. “I am writing ail the time. 1 guess it will just take a while. But I will be able to go home at Christmas.”
Eva Flood, a freshman cross country runner from Skerries, Ireland, adjusts to life on a campus where everyone claims to be “Fighting Irish”
There are numerous unanswered questions in Eva Flood’s life. At this point, “I don’t even know what I want to major in,” she explained. However, she has already answered the question of how she would perform in the competition of collegiate cross country.
Flood has led the Notre Dame women in the past three cross country meets. In the Georgetown competition on Sept. 14, she placed second with a time of 18:15.11. On Sept 27, theNational Catholic cross country meettookplace.Hertimewas 18:07.8,good enough for a ninth place finish. At the Notre Dame Invitational on Oct. 4, Flood once again led the Fighting Irish with a time of
18:21.8. She placed seventh overall.
How did this new Irish star get noticed by Notre Dame? Her second place finish in the Ireland national junior cross country meet caught the eyes of many. The mother of Brian Pepard, a senior on the Notre Dame men’s cross country team and a native of Dublin, was struck by Flood's talent and spread the word. Her word of mouth discovery ultimately landed a scholarship.
At the age of 16, she competed in the under-17 Irish national championships and placed second. This year she competed in the under-19 Irish national championships anti came in fifth. In Ireland, times are not recorded for cross country; the only thing that matters is the place in which runners finish. In track, Flood broke ten minutes in the 3000-meter run and recorded a time of 4:41 in the 1500-meter. Most recently, this past summer, Flood placed second in the 1500-meter and the Irish national juniors.
It would seem to be a disadvantge to be without the experience of running against the clock in cross country. But not according to Flood.
“I don’t pay much attention to the times. I’m not used to it,” she said. “I just go out to beat the person in front”
There is more to Flood’s life than just running. What did an Irish native expect from the college atmosphere and a university that is home to the Fighting Irish?
“I wasn’t expecting anything,” she said.
How is it to be from Ireland and come to the U.S. to be a part of the Fighting Irish?
“The term ‘Fighting Irish’ is weird,” admitted Flood. “It’s funny, people are always telling me they have relatives in Ireland.”
It is difficult to imagine what college life is like to begin with, but a different country
is tough to envision. Anyone who enters into college knows the fear of going to a new atmosphere where there are no familiar faces, however Flood seems to be making a smooth adjustment, especially in her running accomplishments.
“Running is the same wherever you go,” said Flood.
Many people strike out to for the new world of the United States of America with no thought of looking back. However, Flood has different plans in mind.
“I definitely want to go back to Ireland,” she states adamantly.
The Notre Dame coaches did not know exactly what to expect from Flood, a seventeen year-old from Ireland who had no recorded times. But Flood has proven to be a talented runner. As a freshman she has come to Notre Dame and taken everything in stride. She has been able to adjust to a new lifestyle and a new way of running — with clocks. This Irish woman has led the Fighting Irish team in the past three meets and may lead them on to more accomplishments in the next four years.	□

A Tradition of Excellence: 1947 National Champions
Coach: Frank Leahy.
Captain: George Connor.
Notes: With a record of 9-0-0, the 1947 Notre Dame football team was the third of legendary coach Frank Leahy’s four unanimous national championship teams... The 1947 title followed on the heels of Leahy’s 1946 champions, marking back-to-back titles for the Irish. Only Minnesota, Army, Oklahoma (twice), Alabama (twice) and Nebraska have duplicated this feat since the inception of the AP poll in 1936... Led by Heisman Trophy winning QB Johnny Lujack, Notre Dame boasted five All-Americans in T George Connor, G B ill Fischer, T Ziggy Czarobski and E Leon Hart (the 1949 Heisman Trophy winner)... The Irish outscored their opponents by a huge 291-52 margin... The highlight of the season was the 38-7 defeat of the high y-ranked Trojans in a packed Los Angeles Coliseum.
MALE ATHLETE OF THE WEEK
John Coyle: Coyle, a junior from Howell, NJ, has led the Irish men’s cross country team in five of its last six races. Now ranked eighth in the country, Notre Dame competed in the Indiana Intercollegiate Cross Country Championships last week for the first time since 1987. Coyle’s victory enabled the Irish to win the meet for the first time since 1984. It was the team’s second meet championship of the 1991 season.

Kansas Admits It Is Boring While Stanford Remains Shiny and Happy
Need A Reason For Transfering?
Our neighbors at the Kinsey Institute for Sex Research at Indiana University have discovered some unbelievable facts about average college students. Obviously, they are anything but starved for sex! The College Press Service reports that researchers have found, through surveys, that most students on campuses are having lots of sex. The survey, which included 651 undergraduates, revealed that 81 percent of men and 75 percent of women were not virgins, and that students spend an average of two nights per week with their sexual partners. The study also proved that 50 percent of men had sex with someone they just met, and 36 percent of women did the same. Notre Dame and other noted monasteries were excluded from the survey in order to keep the percentages fair.
You Thought the Hoosier State Was a Bore a Those depressed about spending the best years of their lives immersed in Hoosier Hospitality have something to feel better about. That something is the state of Kansas according to an article in the Daily Kansan Entertainment Guide. Among the recommended attractions is the Garden of Eden limestone cabin (oooh), the world's largest hand-dug well in Greenburg, Kansas (ahhh), and the Iron Mound, "the closest thing to a mountain in Kansas" (please, stop). Perhaps the cream of the crop would be a few weeks in Cawker City, "home to the world's largest ball of twine." The twine weighs over seven tons and is surrounded by an octagonal building to protect it from the mass hanging attempts by Kansas residents.
Why?
A student at Duke University, Joe Loong, reports on the growing popularity of pranks involving park benches at this fine institution. He claims that the front porch bench from his fraternity house "was stolen and driven to South Carolina, where it was placed next to a water tower that is shaped like a peach." Joe also states, "The bench was replaced with a miniature replica." Those frat boys.
OK, One More Survey
Those intellectuals at Stanford are always coming out with informative, eye-opening findings. A recent survey, referred to as "The Statistics That Shape the Campus," in The Stanford Daily asked students whether they considered themselves shiny, happy people. Only 5% of the students are exclusively shiny, 30% are happy, and 25% are both. The 40% that are neither could possibly be dull and depressed, or lackluster and lethargic.
Dance of Death
Things got way out of hand at a recent Virginia State University homecoming dance, reports The Chronicle of Higher Education. A series of fights at the event left one person shot and several injured. . Campus police and local officials are investigating to find out whether the back-to-back playing of Billy Joel and Wham! might have contributed to the unexpected violence.	□

BEHAVIORMODIFICATION

Mr. Manners returns, tanned, rested and repositioned in the universe after a break in the counter-culture known as Dixie. Sorry about the week off, but it's his column and truly none of your business.	.
Dear Mr. Manners,
I’m having a real Dickens of a time coming up with a meaningful costume for Halloween. I’ve thought it over for about the past couple of months and none of my ideas seem to fit. At one point I was going to be Regis Philbin, butldidn’tthinkanybody would get it (or bother to get it.) Then I was going to be Pee-Wee Herman, but that really got out of hand. My latest idea was to be myself and let everyone try and guess what I was, but that just shows lack of effort. Anyway, can you please give me some of your pearls of wisdom as to a decent Halloween costume? Thanks, bud.
P.S. It's getting late and I have to be at the all-campiis costume party real soon.
Sincerely, Regan Lewis Hall
Dear Regan:
Personally, I find Halloween to be an immature pagan festival for those whenever grew out of playing dress-up and begging for candy. Actually, we allknow its just another lame excuse to party during the week. I don’t want to sound like a big faux-pas, so I will give you some of the better ideas I have seen in recent years (as I was walking to the library, of course). I suppose I’m just adding to the rampant plague of unoriginality on this campus, but here goes.
My first suggestion would be to dress up as a stereotypical member of our campus. You obviously like dressing as men so Domerguy
would be perfect for you. It really doesn’t take loo much effort. There are only two types: preppy and dirtbag. For preppy, just wear your Levi’s, loafers,Polo shirt, an ND lid and either the ever popular J.Crew Bam Jacket or Land’s End Ski Jacket. For dirtbag, one only requires a Notre Dame sweatsuit (or any sweatsuit), a lid (backwards) and an offensive smell (preferably cheap beer).
The same goes for Domergal (preppy and dirlbag). For the former, proper fashion sense includes a plaid kilt/swcater/turlle-neck ensemble and the J.Crew jacket. The latter would be much the same as Domerguy with sweats, a lid (backwards), and an offensive smell. Much like a good round of Twister, these outfits are not just fun for you but the whole crowd as they tend to instigate insults and rampant slapping.	.
Dear Mr. Manners,	;
I've heard a vicious rumor circulating on the Saint Mary's campus, and I'm really not too pleased about it, It concerns the new hotel being built next to our campus one the side of 31. A friend of mine is on the naming committees for.the hotel and I heard they decided to call it the Smic Chickinn. Is this true? Say it isn't so!	;
YoursTruly, Sherri
Regina Hall
Dear Sherri:
Relax, relax. I really doubt they would name your hotel after a piece of poultry. If they did, the restaurant in it would end up being Chick Fil-A or the Colonel or something, and alumni don't go for that. They're actually calling it Mother Teresa's Dollar Inn. □
Dear Readers: Mr. Manners requests a favor. We've all had aweek off and none of us have written anyone in several weeks so just write me a dang letter at 303 LaFortune, Campus Mail.

WEEK IN DISTORTION
The Scariest Book on Campus
(and it ain't by Stephen King)
I’d like to begin by congratulating my loyal fans (both of them) who managed to find this column in its new location somewhere in the back of the magazine. I haven’t written a column in a while, and my official excuse (the one I send my parents for not writing home) is that I was studying for the LS AT. Taking the LS AT was a scary experience. Not the test itself, but being in the . same room with a couple hundred aspiring lawyers. I suspect the President would have assured himself of unanimous reelection if he had implemented his proposal for tactical nuclear weapon reduction by nuking every LSAT testing center in the country. Such action might have deterred entry into the legal profession for a few months, at least.
Perhaps it was my keen legal mind which led me to investigate Notre Dame’s very own constitution, du Lac. At 111 pages, it wasn’t an easy read, and I’m wary of any legal code which is substantially longer than Leviticus,Numbers and Deutoronomy combined. But page 25 of du Lac reassured me that “the University sets few limits on student behavior,” so I dropped this objection. Since most people mistakenly believe they have belter things to do than read the student handbook, I ’ m going to give you some of the highlights. Let rhe reassure you that I’m not making any of these up.
The most surprising rule I found is on page 29, which deals with firearms and weapons. “This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, rifles, shotguns, pistols, BB guns, pellet guns, catapults, bows and arrows...” Waita minute! No catapults? This medieval regulation comes as a real shocker to my fellow Dillon residents, since we’ve been working all semester on a giant catapult for launching cauldrons of boiling oil at Cavanaugh during the annual snowball fight I guess we’ 11 have to come up with something else. Strangely,
du Lac is silent about other siege engines, so perhaps we can get away with a few battering rams.
Most of us are more than familiar with the sexual regulations of du Lac, so there’s no need to elaborate much on those; I would
like to point out that the gay rights organization is going to have a tough time establishing open expression of homosexuality, since the Administration doesn’t really care for the open expression of heterosexuality either. I don ’ t think we’ 11 see homosexual safe havens unless we create safe havens for
heterosexuals as well.

However, du Lac is more than a list of rules; it’s full of helpful hints as well. My favorites deal with “Obscene and Harassing
Phone Calls” and “Fire Emergency Instructions.” (Pages 86-88). These tips are precisely why it’s so important to read duLacin its entirety as soon as possible. You don’t want to be put in the embarrassing position of asking the obscene caller, “May I put you
on hold while I look up what to do in du Lad" Still worse, the last thing you want to do after discovering that you’re on fire is to grope around for du Lac’s advice — you might accidentally bum your copy. For instance, there’s a list of four instructions for “any student trapped by smoke or fire in corridors and who cannot leave by normal exits.” If you don’t know these four directions before you get trapped in the corridor of your blazing dorm, your charred corpse might get into serious trouble with Student Affairs afterward.
Then of course, there is much in du Lac which is just plain silly, especially if a columnist takes things out of context. How many Domers does it take to screw in a light bulb? None. “Burned-out light bulbs in corridors will be replaced by the custodians.” (Page 94.) There’s a list of stuff you can’t put on your walls, including “decorative wood shingles” (page 95), so I guess the log cabin look is out. “Combustible materials should not be placed or left in contact with radiators, heating units,” or other things that get really hot, (page 95), so unless you want a visit from your rector, you better not set any large tanks of kerosene where they might blow up and damage the paint job.
If this happens to you and you need to repaint, remember that “paint colors must be selected from approved color charts at the Notre Dame Paint Shop” (page 97), where I suppose they have a staggering array of shades of off-white. And where is the Notre Dame Paint Shop anyway? Beats me. It doesn ’ t say in du Lac.	□

Homecoming Traditions
■By Anne Mary Klem.
Homecoming sounds like a standard university tradition, and for a university so boastful of its tradition as Notre Dame, you have to wonder, what happened to ours? Homecoming is being reinstated this year in a big way in honor of the Sesqui-centennial Anniversary of the University, and we’re hopeful it will last. So for the sake of posterity, here’s what happened in the past...
Homecoming was officially started in 1919, but 1922 seems to be the first year it was a big bash (although you’ll be hard pressed to find any alums still around to talk aboutit). TheStudentActivitiesCommittee worked with the legendary Knute Rockne ' (yes, really) to plan the celebration. The committee found housing in South Bend : homes for hundreds of alumni who were returning to reminisce about their days at Notre Dame. A special train brought in about 200 from Chicago, and carload after carload poured in from Indianapolis, Cleveland and Pittsburgh. (What do you want to bet they wore plaid even then?) Over 15,000 people paid either $1.50 for general admission tickets or $3 for box seats (!) to see the Fighting Irish take on Nebraska in Cartier Field that weekend. It seems that Student Activities wanted to go all out to make the former sons of Notre Dame feel warmly welcomed back to their alma mater ... the precedent of the tradition.
That Friday night, the entire Notre Dame community gathered at the campus post office where a red torch was lit to lead a gala . homecoming parade. The group met with off-campus students on Michigan Street where everyone apparently performed, the “traditional snake dance.” They marched through downtown South Bend to end at the Oliver Hotel with a tremendous pep rally

For three years the tradition was celebrated but then lagged until a revival in 1941 by the Student Council. Homecoming weekend began with “Decoration Day” where members in each hall competed for the first prize of a “smoker” —• your guess is as good as mine. A huge bonfire followed supper on Friday night in the parking lot next to Notre Dame Avenue where the new Hesburgh building now stands. Later after the football game, hundreds of students flocked to the Victory Dance at and area hotel.
In 1963 the Notre Dame homecoming committee inaugurated the homecoming parade. Several groups entered floats and led them around campus for nearly half and hour; the sophomore class took first prize of a whopping $40. This year .of initiation for the parade, however, was the year that the pep rally bonfire was to be banned.
From a past Scholastic. “With the warm red, yellow and browns of a balmy Indian summer weekend setting the pace, the 1964 Homecoming Weekend was a tremendous success. The theme for the weekend was ‘The Spirit of ‘76’ in honor of the 76th year of Notre Dame football. The music of Woody । io man filled the vast space of the Stepan Center and Billy May carried on at LaFortune at the dual Friday night celebrations, before our ‘revenge’ battle with the Stanford Indians at the Stadium. Miss Sharon Bums was crowned Queen of Homecoming after close voting in the election.”
In addition to these festivities, Henry Mancini also performed at the 1964 Home-coming celebration. “Undoubtedly one of the best sounds to come out of Stepan center recently was last weekend’s Homecoming Concert. Henry Mancini brought one of his

40-piece orchestras (he has several, each located in a different part of the country) to Notre Dame for a performance of what he might have described as ‘numbers I have recorded.’ But instead of a mechanical rendition of quality easily duplicated on any phonograph, Mancini’s presence sparked a performance full of life and enjoyment which quickly captivated the audience. Mancini himself seemed to be having as good a time as his listeners. When many late arrivals came drifting in after the concert had begun ... he held up his right hand and explained how ‘this is the hand that shook the hand of Ringo Starr’ until all had been seated and he could resume the musical part of the evening.”	■
Two of the most recent homecoming celebrations have also seen a change in tradition. 1978 was the last year of the homecoming king and queen contest but the first year to end the celebration with a fireworks display, something to be repeated this year. John Malcolm, a 1980 alumnus, chaired a homecoming celebration in the late 70s. They planned it for the weekend of the USC game and went all out A homecoming dance was held in Stepan Center with a 1940s swing

In a recentScholastic interview, Malcolm recalled one of the highlights of homecoming in his Notre Dame years: 1977 was the big year that the team switched to the bright green jerseys and the Irishmen jumped out of the wooden trojan horse. Once again, the Trojans brought their live horse as a the traditional USC mascot. One Notre Dame student, probably after a full morning of tailgaiting, got the bright idea to get fresh carrots and string them above the horse. If the plan worked, the USC man would get bucked off the horse. Ah, tradition...
Recalling his homecoming weekend experiences, Malcolm aptly summed up the spiritofhomecoming: “AtNotre Dame,you become ingrained in the traditions of football weekends—you’re pulled into that... I think that the term Notre Dame family comes into real terms when you see people coming from all four comers. Families become separated and only bond for Thanksgiving or Christmas, but the Notre Dame family comes together for football games... You meet at acommon celebration, but it even transcends the actual football

Urban Plunge: A Chance to Make Life Simpler I by Jane Feeney
My Urban Plunge experience began on Jan 9,1991, when my father, a fearless driver who does not understand the significance of road maps except on rare emergencies, threw my sleeping bag into the station wagon and drove me into the South Bronx. My older sister participated in an Urban Plunge in Brooklyn a few years before, so this idea of observing and living in an impoverished setting for 48 hours was not difficult for my parents to accept. We sped along the Expressway, and as my father reminisced about his younger days, we inevitably missed the proper exit. We found ourselves in the middle of the Bronx—clueless as to our whereabouts. Of

and ask one of the helpful natives for assistance. In response to that idea, I received the familiar crinkling of the forehead, which I interpreted as meaning something like, “What, are you crazy? It’s a good thing I drove you or you would be offering rides to these strangers.” Finally, his natural sense of keen direction led us to the Padre Pio Shelter, the site of the Urban Plunge.
I walked up the stairs of the rectory’s front stoop and rang the bell aside the heavy grated door. A dark-bearded man wearing a long hooded robe opened the door, and I heard myself asking if I could please see Fr. Bob Lombardo. (I seriously felt like one of the von Trapps whining outside the abbey’s gates for Fraulein Maria.) This Franciscan, Br. Terry, gave my dad a few tips about the way back to New Jersey, and then he welcomed me into the building attached to the the shelter. In a few moments Fr. Bob Lombardo, the actual host of the program, made his appearance, and we chatted until the other nine students from St Mary’s and Notre Dame arrived.
Fr. Bob graduated from Notre Dame about ten years ago and worked as an accountant for a while before entering . the seminary. He now works with a community of Franciscan religious who run the Padre Pio Shelter for a

However, if one demanded the greatest compassion and energy of him/herself and put faith in God’s goodness, then a certain peace could be achieved.
The prevalence and importance of religious faith permeated the attitudes in many at the facilities that we visited. A few blocks away from the shelter a contingent of Mother Teresa’s order ran a soup kitchen. When Fr. Bob
Two hours later as I wiped the sweat off my forehead I understood a previous comment about the sisters’ diligence. We helped these Missionaries of Charity carry and sort through hundreds of bags of donated Christmas presents. I was also amazed by the bravery of the one sister who pointed out the bullet holes sprayed all over the ceiling. Apparently, a heroin addict who was late in his payments soughtrefuge in the shelter, but his angry dealer found him. When asked if she ever feared for her life, she-said, “It was God’s work that we built these walls to protect that poor man, and it is His will that we continue our service here.

We witnessed the intense need for help when we journeyed, through the city from Padre Pio to a home for destitute mothers and children and saw the hundreds of abandoned and desecrated buildings. Children ran naked . through their paved playgrounds even though the weather was brutally cold. Broken vials and needles clogged the gutters. Fr. Bob told us story after story about the poor he knew who froze or starved to death since he lived in the South Bronx. Unfortunately, the drastic statistics I had heard so many times were proven very real.
