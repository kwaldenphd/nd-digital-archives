Since the "Talkies” came . . . Hollywood is stronger than ever for OLD GOLDS
(SIGNED)
Why not a cough in a carload?
OLD GOLD cigarettes are blended from HEART-LEAF tobacco, the finest Nature grows ... Selected for silkiness and ripeness from the heart of the tobacco plant ... Aged and mellowed extra long in a temperature of mid-July sunshine to insure that honey-like smoothness.
WALLACE BEERY transpott pilot No. 3298, now appearing in ”Tong War** tells how the movie stars are guarding their throats with OLD GOLDS.
Onyour Radio, OLD GOLD-PAUL WHITEMAN HOUR ... Paul Whiteman, King of Jazz, with his complete orchestra, broadcasts the OLD GOLD hour every Tuesday, from 9 to 10 P. M., Eastern Standard Time, over the entire network of the Columbia Broadcasting Sv stem.
"A year or so ago, Hollywood didn’t think much about its vocal chords or its voices. We were in the silent drama then. But the coming of the 'Talkies’ has changed things. Lovely stars, leading men, 'heavies’ and ingenues are guarding their throats with zealous care_and smoking OLD golds. It didn’t need the 'Talkies’ to win me to old golds. I’ve been smoking them since they came to Hollywood, two years ago. But it’s great to know they are kind to the voice, when the voice has assumed a new importance!

eat a chocolate, light an Old Gold, and enjoy both!

Another Saint Patrick’s Day come and gone, and Ireland is left a little happier and a little older. On occasions peculiarly Hibernian a quaint rhyme immortalizing the landlord curse in Ireland always haunts me—
You prosecute the man or woman Who steals the goose from off the common, But leave the larger felon loose Who steals the common from the goose.
We hear that the Irish gosling is developing into a most independent gander, that there is little that is common about the common that is Ireland, and that the felons no longer molest the sturdy' ganders. Which leads one to think that perhaps Matthew Arnold was right when he said that the Celtic word gair (to laugh) was the compressed expression of the Celtic character. At all odds, the Irish are daily getting nearer to that happy realization, for the Emerald Isle is becoming a country of small land-owners—the Irish ideal of centuries. Many of us are Irish. If not directly decended from the blood of Irish kings, then sympathetically Irish through environment and education. The Pathern Day .... the River Shannon .... county Limerick .... and Ireland—a beautiful name for a beautiful land! The daughters and the sons of Ireland are the beauties and the wits, the saints and the soldiers of the world. May Notre Dame never lose her Irish sentiment, and Ireland never lose her saintly precedent.

Mid-semester examinations are again with us. And, incidentally, did you ever know a quarter to pass so swiftly as did this last one? Some of us were just thinking of getting this semester’s texts, and now we are half through. Writing about examinations is like talking about the weather, they are both subjects that are overdone, and nothing definite can be said about either until everything is over. But we hope that everyone’s luck is as good as that which we have been praying for.

Final arrangements have been made for the Easter Club dances. Which probably means that the orchestra has been engaged, and the Pink, or Blue, or Gold room of some hotel hired. And the real arrangements will be made about four hours before the dance, when the chairman of the dance committee and one or two reluctant club officials decide that decorations, or refreshments, or atmosphere of some kind must be secured, and they will secure them after wrecking a car or two in running all over the town. But the club members will be back to brag about their particular affair for the rest of the year. And, again, it would be well to write the little girl now and secure your dates, for -with no malice intended, she may have believed the line of that stiff shirt from Ann Arbor.

There was a great deal of Philosophy in the last issue of the Scholastic. If you did not understand it all, be con
soled, for you were not the only one. All that is necessary to start a modern philosophy is a vocabulary of abstractions and an afternoon tea. Should you aspire to fame through this means merely take the word “psyco” and tack on a suffix denoting a social problem like matrimonial complexities or how to raise children without razor straps and you will be feted in the drawing room of every social leader between here and Osceola. You will be the upstart of the hour. And this idea is freely donated to any senior without prospects of a job for next year. He has merely to buy a dictionary of philosophical terms, contort a name to bewilder and attract the feminine ear, and philosophize with the ladies at the teas on their misunderstandings and the brutal indifference with which the world treats them. This done, our fortunate senior will always have his belly full of tea and his heart full of amity. Any senior can live on amity and tea. Some of them . have tried to live on love, but their indigestion was most acute.
The Caesar’s ghost who obtruded on the traditional ap- , paration that stalks Washington Hall was what the demonstrative ladies in the audience called a “screaming success.” We all expected a rather good performance Sunday night, especially after having read Dave Lehman’s little eulogium, ‘ but it was more—it was a gripping presentation. Since the Week was a campus weakling no play has been given here that was comparable to “Julius Caesar.” Scenery, costumes, t music, acting, all were remarkable. Yet there was one slight touch that might have been different to advantage,—perhaps not. With no disparagement meant for those ladies who well acted the comely parts of Portia and Calpuria, we should have left the hall with heads a trifle higher had campus talent taken those parts. In a tragedy by men and for men, men might ably carry every part. It is not the particular i rendition that irks, rather the thought is called forth by a histrionic principle. Which is more artistic—a horse’s ( whinny, or your imitation of a horse’s whinny? The Theater did not go to Italy for a Caesar, or to Little Africa for a Lucius. Why go beyond the immediate confines for a Portia?
* * * *
Easter vacation is here. That’s almost too obvious to be mentioned, what with the sartorial appeals of clothiers, the , extended competition in the Scribblers’ poetry contest, and the passing of the Absurdities. No longer do we spend Easter Sunday in orgies of hard-boiled eggs, or in disputes with the kids next door as to which family was most favored by the mythical rabbit. These joys have been cut from us by the same blade that removed our first beard. Easter is rather a formal time now that we have outgrown our early • superstitions, and supplanted them with more supercilious beliefs. We. go home or do not go home, as your case may be, and the only excitement of the time is that which we make for ourselves. The Week hopes everyone has a good vacation. That is a rather unlikely hope, of course, but then its written now.	.	.

DR. C. A. LIPPINCOTT, FRIEND OF NOTRE DAME, DIES
With the death of Dr. Charles A. Lippincott, A.B., D.D., LL.D., at his home in South Bend early in the evening of ‘ Thursday, March 14, Notre Dame lost one of hex- greatest friends, and a man who did much to further the interests of the University during the past decade. Stricken with pneumonia several days before, Dr. Lippincott was thought to be out of danger, when grave complications set in, eventually resulting in death. The shock of his unexpected demise left his numerous, friends at Notre Dame and in South Bend ’ grieved at the passing of a much-beloved, greatly-respected figure.
Dr. Lippincott was a man of many accomplishments. In addition to being head of the co-operative department of the ' Studebaker Corporation and former pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, South Bend, he was also prominently identi-> fied with University, fraternal, and civic activities, all of which found in him an enthusiastic leader. He was nationally noted in industrial circles for his sympathetic understanding of working men and working conditions. He had been associated with the Studebaker Corporation for almost ' ten years as head of the co-operative department.
An honorary member of the St. Joseph Valley Alumni, and a frequent speaker at Notre Dame gatherings, Dr. Lippincott was of great assistance to University officials, faculty members, alumni, and students on numerous occasions. In 1922 he was a recipient of an honorary degree of doctor of . laws from Notre Dame in recognition of his services as a humanitarian, educator, and citizen. His last appearance at the University was at the annual football banquet of the St. Joseph Valley Alumni, the early part of last December.

GLEE CLUB TO PRESENT ANNUAL CAMPUS • CONCERT SUNDAY
The Notre Dame Glee Club under the direction of Pro
fessor* Joseph J. Casasanta, head of the department of music
at the University, will present its annual campus concert
PROF. JOSEPH J. CASASANTA
next Sunday evening in Washington hall. The entire personnel of seventy members will assist in the concert.
The organization has been practising daily since last September in preparation for its spring concert season which will be inaugurated with the annual Easter trip of the club starting in a few days. Losing almost two-thirds of a year’s personnel through graduation, Director Casasanta has capably trained almost a
n e w organization which was first heard in concert in Dixon, Illinois, February 22. Judging from the favorable criticism received by the Glee Club after this concert, and an engagement the next evening at Rochelle, Illinois, the 1929 Club is a worthy successor to last year’s famous organization, which in addition to traveling ovex’ 10,000 miles and appearing in ovex* a score of road concerts, was also the first collegiate Glee Club to be featured on the Vitaphone.
The program of the campus concert will contain several old favorites such as “The Victory March,” “On Down the Line,” “The Hike Song,” “The Italian Salad,” and others. In addition, a half-dozen or so new songs will be featured. To supplement the regular program, the Club will present its usual specialty numbers with R. Zeno Staudt, William McAleer, Thomas Salmon, and John R. Beljon, bettex* known as the “Happy Four,” in an act consisting of a banjo and song trio and populax* piano numbers.
The officers of the Glee Club are: Fred J. Wagner, president; H. Jerome Parker, business manager; and Vincent F. Carney and Peter* J. Wacks, assistant business managers.

■ Thomas F. Konop, Dean of the College of Law, addressed the members of the Engineering Club last Monday night in the court room of the Law Building. Dean Konop stressed in particular, contracts with municipal corporations, and, in the limited time that he had, gave a good, practical summary of business law as regards the engineer.	.
At the short meeting held after the Dean’s speech, Karl Matersteck, president of the club, read a letter from the Reverend Thomas A. Steiner, C.S.C., Dean of the College of Engineering, in which he thanked the club members for the spiritual bouquet and Mass which were offered for the repose of the soul of his sister.

A short meeting of the Engineers’ Club will be held next Monday night at 6:30 p. m. in Badin “Rec.” At this meeting the new constitution, which has been drawn up by Edward Barch, a senior in the mechanical engineering department, will be presented for the approval of the club members. It is imperative that the members be present at this meeting in. order to make any changes before the constitution can be ratified. By a ruling of the S. A. C. a club constitution must first of all be approved by the club members and then ratified. The club’s constitution will be ratified at the first meeting after Easter.

Mr. Stanley Story, of the United States Lumber and Supply Company, South Bend, will give an illustrated lecture sometime after the Easter holidays. Mr. Story spent a year in Alaska, making a timber survey for statistical purposes, and his slides, which are made from his own photographs, will be of interest to the student body, as well as to members of the Engineering Club.

MUSIC AND DRAMA
FRED J. WAGNER President of Glee Club
Lo! Even in Badin dwell campus personalities. We wouldn’t be surprised if they dwelt in Corby and Lyons also. Coming back to Badin; high up on the fourth floor—safe from the rolling waves of Badin’s lakes—dwells Fred Wagner, sweet-voiced baritone and president of the Glee Club.
Fred has been a member of the Glee Club since his initial appearance on the campus. Very few men are good enough to make a trip with the Glee Club during their freshman year, but Fred was one of those few. In fact he made both trips which were scheduled that year. The Glee Club liked Fred, and Fred liked the Glee Club, with the result that for four years he has been one of its leading
’ members. Director Joseph J. Casasanta has more than once featured him in several solo parts.
More honors came to Wagner in his sophomore year when along with Frank Hetreed, Tony Kopecky, and Andrew Mul-reany, he was chosen for the varsity quartet. For two years they featured all the conceits of the Glee Club. It is need, less to make any comments on the ability of the quartet. Those who have heard it render close harmony know how good it was; those who have not heard it have missed something very worth while.
One would naturally expect that a man with Fred’s r singing ability would be specializing in music; however music is only his avocation. His ambition is to be a captain of > industry; with that goal in mind he is enrolled in Dean McCarthy’s College of Commerce; and he will receive his B. C. S. or whatever degree Commerce men get, in June.
Tiffin, Ohio, is Fred’s home town. That is probably one of the reasons why he was elected president of the Glee Club. ' In case any doubting reader may wonder what Tiffin, Ohio, has to do with being president of the Glee Club, let him re-• peat the name to himself. There he has the secret. Doesn’t it sound musical? It does to us, probably because we have always associated Tiffin with tea; tea with tea dances; and tea dances with music. What could be more logical than to elect a musical man from a musically named town president of a musical organization?	—e. l. t.

“DOME” CAMPAIGN CONTINUES WITH OFF-CAMPUS DRIVE
According to Robert J. Kuhn, business manager of the Dome-, plans are being made to enable every off-campus member to sign for the annual if they have not previously done so. A subscription list will be placed on the Off-Campus ' Office Bulletin board today and tomorrow in order to facilitate orders.
The attention of all campus clubs is called to the fact thait the Dome management has decided to allow a special discount to clubs for space in the section reserved for clubs, providing the bill is paid within two weeks after the Easter vacation.
The famous Paulist choir of Chicago was heard in a special program of sacred and classical melodies last Saturday evening in Washington Hall. The choir, which is this season undei' the direction of the Reverend Eugene F. O’Malley, C.S.P., is internationally known, through a European tour several years ago. In a national contest at Philadelphia, in international competition at Paris, and then before the late Pope Pius X, the choristers merited for themselves the approval of critics everywhere.
Francis Hurney, who substituted for the principal soloist, made his debut in the second part of the program. The rendition of Brahms’ Lullaby won the hearts of the listeners to the young singer. The other soloist was a former Notre Dame man of ’91, Mr. Frank M. Dunford, who sang a selected Aria; then, as an encore he sang the “Victory March,” much to the delight of the audience, whom he invited to join in the second chorus.
The outstanding number on the program was the “Emit-tee Spiritum Tuum,” sung by the entire choir. This selection was sung by the choristers twelve years ago at Notre Dame on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee of the University in 1917. “The Judgment Day” brought out the capability of the choir for heavy music.	’

UPPERCLASSMEN ADVISED TO PREPARE FOR SPRING PRE-REGISTRATION
The attention of upperclassmen is called to the necessity of preparing for the spring pre-registration, which will begin shortly after the Easter holidays. Exact dates and detailed notice of procedure will be published one week before registration begins. It is hoped that the confusion and delays of previous years, occasioned by want of familiarity with catalogue requirements, will be greatly diminished.
Sophomore students are advised to confer with the head of the department in which they expect to major. None should choose a major subject without obtaining the counsel and advice of these men, a list of whom may be found on page 58 of the current catalogue.

BOY GUIDANCE MEN HEAR PROMINENT SPEAKERS
The Boy Guidance students were addressed by three visiting speakers during the past week. On Monday Mr. Eugene T. Lies, special representative of the Playground and Recreation Association of America, gave an interesting talk on the “New Conception of Leisure Time.” Mr. Leis also addressed the seniors in the Physical Education Department on “The Place of Physical Education in the Recreational Movement.”
On Wednesday Dr. J. F. Wright, secretary of the Pathfinders of America, outlined the work of his organization, while on Thursday Mr. E. C. Bird, county agricultural agent of St. Joseph county, explained the work of the 4-H Club, and similar programs for rural boys.

HOYER SPEAKS AT GOSHEN FATHER AND - SON BANQUET

MEN YOU KNOW
“History,” says car-making Mr. Ford, “is bunk.” “History,” says H. W. Van Loon, “is the mighty tower of expe-built amidst the endless fields of bygone ages.”
Be that as it may, History is a vital subject, and we are vital incidents in its making. Why not, then, learn something of the “past” (and an interesting one it is, too) of the subject we are making? And again, why not spend our period of apprenticeship under those who are intimately acquainted with the subject which we fain would know?
For all of this we have most excellent opportunities here, and one of the best and most loved of all the
guides who would show us the ways of erring Rome and proud England is Professor James Hines, Ph.B.
Born in Kewanee, Indiana, in the late “seventies,” Professor Hines received his degree from Indiana State Normal in 1900. Not content with this certificate of his sixth sense of historicity, he pursued his studies at Indiana University. While at this latter school Mr. Hines was an indefatigable supporter and booster of dramatics. Indiana students of that day still remember his performance of Dimitrius in “Midsummer Night’s Dream,” and his superb characterization of the noblest Roman of them all in “Julius Caesar.” He obtained his diploma from this seat of learning in 1904 and promptly became superintendent of schools in Akron, Ind., which position he occupied for the next three years. Then, from 1907 to 1909, he held the same post in Wabash, Indiana, coming to Notre Dame in the fall of 1909.
Since then he has been here as professor of history, and has become a conspicuous and much loved campus figure.
In 1921 his ever present interest in dramatics led him to form a Shakespearean club here.
Besides holding the admiration and respect of his students, Mr. Hines is further entitled to honor by virtue of his opinion concerning the younger generation. All in all, he thinks them superior to those of a generation ago in sincerity, frankness, possibly in brain power, and most of all, in the matter of earnestness.
In this latter assertion Professor Hines sounds a challenge to whatever elements of tinseled sophistication may yet lurk in the memories of the younger generation; and it is a most satisfactory flinging of the gauntlet.
Mr. Hines has no set hobbies. He is vitally interested in outdoor life and things pertaining to agriculture. He loves to spend his spare time on the farm upon which he was born, and which he has purchased. There on the farm, known as the “Old Homestead Place,” he can be found during vacation, either strolling over the fields in farm attire or engaged in some one of the many tasks of a Cincinnatus. During the long afternoons he steals away and finds his best enjoyment with a vest pocket edition of Plutarch or absorbed in the historical novels. Not a great lover of the modern day movies, he never misses an entertainment in which the classic predominates.

FINAL PRODUCTION OF “ABSURDITIES” TOMORROW NIGHT
Appreciative audiences, jamming Washington Hall to capacity Wednesday and Thursday evenings, chuckled, laughed and roared at the rollicking performance given by the Monogram Club in their 1929 “Absurdities.” Without doubt it was one of the best shows put on by the Monogram Club since the “Absurdities” were first staged.
Jack Cannon’s clever tap-dancing, the acting of Tim Moynihan, Joe Abbott, and Ted Twomey in the skits; and the dancing and singing of the graceful Monogram Chorus are the high spots of the production.
The last performance of the “Absurdities” will be given tomorrow night, at 8:30 p. m., in Washington Hall.

VARSITY DEBATERS WIN TRIANGULAR MATCH
When a debating team wins a debate, it is no more than right to give the members of the team credit for then* victory. Therefore the Scholastic wishes to correct the report in the March 15th issue which stated that the University affirmative team lost to Franklin at Franklin. Notre Dame won the debate. Owing to a mistake in the original copy informing the Scholastic of the results of the debate, the position of the winner and loser were reversed. As the negative team defeated Earlham in Washington Hall, Notre Dame won both matches of the triangular debate with Franklin and Earlham.
The feat of the affirmative team which consists of George Beamer, Francis J. McGreal, and Charles Haskell, is all the more notable inasmuch as Franklin had a very eloquent and persuasive team. The men composing the affirmative team have worked hard and the Scholastic takes this opportunity of congratulating them for their victory and at the same time rectifying the error in last week’s issue.
Tonight the team selected to debate on the water power question will meet Western Reserve University in Washington Hall. Charles Hanna, Arnold Williams, and Walter Stanton are the members of the team. They have been preparing their arguments for the last few weeks under the coaching of the Reverend Francis Boland, C.S.C., varsity debate coach. In meeting Western Reserve they are encountering formidable opponents. The debating teams of the Cleveland school are consistently good, year after year.

“Julius Caesar” Acclaimed By Critics
(	“I do believe that these applauses are •
For some new honors that are heap’d on Caesar.”
—ACT I, SCENE II.
Some three and a quarter centuries ago, one William Shakespeare, sat down and wrote a great play; some five nights ago, the University Theatre stood up and produced a
great drama. And whether Mr. Shakespeare is indebted to the University Theatre, or the University Theatre to Mr. Shakespeare is a moot question. In any event, “Julius Caesar” was produced here at Notre Dame last Sunday evening, excellently, powerfully — and successfully. “Veni, vidi vici.”
Now, we haven’t the slightest idea of how a Boman senator should look, nor have we, for that matter, any knowledge of the correct meth-eds of engineering a revolution, conspiracy, or other such delightful pastime. If ever we should need
PROF. FRANK W. KELLY
information on these subjects, however, we shall most certainly drop over to see John Leddy. Mr. Leddy, as everyone knows, played Cassius the other evening, and played him so well that we were all prepared to contribute campaign funds to the revolutionary party. Anyway, Mr. Leddy did great work in the usual “lean and hungry” fashion.
Marcus Brutus, as played by Mr. A. J. Doyle was indeed the “noblest Boman of them all!” In fact, Mr. Doyle’s performance was as nearly perfect as any we have ever seen on the amateur stage. His characterization was marked with that nice restraint and sympathy of interpretation that is the badge of the true actor. John Bowland in the character of Caesar also did excellent work, especially in the scene before the Capitol.
Professor Frank W. Kelly, who directed the play, and to whom belongs most of the credit for its success, assumed
Professor Kelly’s acting can be
the role of Mark Antony.
PROF. CHARLES PHILLIPS
described by only two words—superlatively good. He exhibited a keen understanding of the lines, and a remarkable power of expression. ProfessorKelly is not only a great director, he is a great actor. Miss Pauline Jellison and Miss Irma Collmer, who played respectively Portia and Calpurnia, were excellent, as were in fact all the other members of the entire cast.
In regard to settings, lighting effects and costumes, the University Theatre far exceeded any of its previous endeavors. These essential features of
the performance were well worthy of the professional stage. There were none of the usual delays or defects of an amateur presentation. The play proceeded smoothly and swiftly to a very effective climax. The mob scenes were skilfully handled and no confusion was apparent. On the whole, the University Theatre’s first revival of a classic was attended with greater success than even the most optimistic dared hope. Too much credit cannot be given Professor Kelly, who was the guiding genius behind the whole presentation. Professor Charles Phillips, of the English department at Notre Dame, is also deserving of great praise, because it was he who revised the script into an efficient working order suitable for presentation by the Theatre. We congratulate Prof. Kelly, Prof. Phillips and their able assistants and earnestly trust that they will repeat their splendid efforts at some time in the near future.

The News of The Times
HUGH A. O’DONNELL, ’94
The recent death of Melville E. Stone, Counselor for the Associated Press, sad as was the parting, proved no liability because he built so well that the Associated Press has become the Gibraltar of journalism. He founded the Associated Press. He was its first
HUGH A. O’DONNELL, ’12
General Manager and his influence on the board of directors proved effective in the selection of his successor, Kent Cooper. It is the only institution of its kind in the world. Its ramifications extend to every community of consequence every-where. It neither makes noi’ loses money. Its representatives are trained to know what is news and ferret it out with the utmost accuracy. They and their production constitute the very being of the best daily journalism.
The metropolitan “daily,” including the Sunday edition, is an excellent exponent of the so-called “romance
of business.” What could be more impressive in the dissemination of news for the information of the public generally, peoples of the entire civilized world, than that, for example, a certain metropolitan morning newspaper costs on an average of §50,000 a night to produce and then the entire product can be bought for a couple pennies. By the approval of the vast army of purchasers on account of the value of the news, the advertising columns became so important to business men that one advertising agency spent over $1,000,-000 in advertising in that one newspaper during the past year. The yearly gross income of that particular newspaper is over $27,000,000. Who questions the freedom of the press? Yet one may imagine the cost of production when every single copy of the Sunday edition weighs a trifle less than two pounds; and the newsprint consumption daily and Sunday for the year totals one hundred and eleven thousand tons, requiring over five million pounds of ink—rivers of it. The United States government gets $851,000 annually for delivering just part of the circulation—that portion that goes by mail. The yearly cost for telegraph and cables amounts to $500,000. None of the above expense includes the payroll of over 3,300 employees, at least $163,000 weekly.
For whom is all this? The readers. They buy the news to read. Readers are the only ones whom the newspaper management addresses itself with the facts of the world’s activities. Friends or foes are not considered. The news is expressed in simple Anglo-Saxon and, to be most effective, must be timely, accurate, uncolored and non-partisan. Opinions are confined to the editorial page and are based on the
facts as given in the news columns, prophesying, in view of those facts, what is likely to happen.
Quality of readers is a condition over which the circulation manager has hardly any control. It is the exponent of the publication as a whole based on the reputation of the institution as reflected in the character of the owner, taking into consideration his policy and purpose. The theory of the * entire business is that the news and editorial departments attract the circulation; and if enough of the right kind of circulation is obtained, the newspaper becomes permanent and profitable. Judge the quality of a newspaper’s circulation by a copy of the publication. Note the conservatism of its editorials; the comprehensiveness of its news; the accuracy of its statements; its uncolored non-partisan handling of the * facts which it merchandises as news. Study the advertisements, their typography and the merchandise for sale. Is there exaggeration? Are they misleading? Do they describe just what is sold? If the newspaper is conscientiously adjusted to all these you may be sure that it has quality of circulation regardless of how limited it may be in quantity, for, as a natural sequence, it is apt to have much of that too. Remember, the cultured, thrifty and discriminating are not very limited in any community nowadays. They are worth more to advertisers than mass readers who have less understanding, appreciation and money. Formerly when an advertising solicitor of a quality publication addressed himself to a merchant he would ask: “Which is better, a man with a , $10 bill in his pocket or ten men each with $1 in his pocket?” The latter could scarcely buy the bare necessities of life, while the former might be able to make a purchase a bit beyond the absolute needs of that day.
A scientist, who visited an institution for mental de- x fectives and who had cross-sectioned 10,000 skulls just to ascertain the average thickness so as to obtain statistics on , brain sizes, explained that the statistics of our government during the recent war showed that 85% of the army, representing the nation, had the mental capacity of a 14 year old boy. That meant that the remaining 15 per cent were the normals which include captains of industry, merchants, pro- * fessionals, the makers of progress. Yet the 85% are the mass of the nation. They toil but think little; are good citi- a zens; give certain service; but are subnormally responsible. Whether it is the 15% or the 85%, the sons of Martha or of Mary, quality of circulation depends on how much there is of either.
One inmate had been an A. D. T. messenger in New Orleans, the best A. D. T. messenger in the history of that city—perfect He was too good; so good that when some- ? thing happened to the manager of the messengers he was placed in charge. Almost immediately there was a riot, followed by a strike. He refused any other work and became a menace at home. Yet he was 28 years old. Finally the A. D. T. Company was persuaded to take him back as an ordinary messenger. Institutions like individuals do not always learn by experience. After two years something again t happened and the same messenger, having the best record, was made manager again. So much trouble resulted he was thrown out bodily and told never to return. Incapable of doing other work, he was sent to that institution where he was found to be a simple, honest, industrious, dependable man of meager mentality. The A. D. T. Company took him
■ *	The Notre Dame
i
J	back again as a messenger and was advised to keep him a
M	messenger for he was only happy in that capacity, was good
at it and did not wish to be anything else. He is a citizen , and earns his living, though he is not a profitable asset to merchants advertising in any newspaper which he may happen to read.
Ideal circulation is that having the greatest quality of quantity, a circulation of large quantity of a general high M quality. It is profitable to advertisers, regardless of whether the merchandise is expensive or not. I know a man who j frequently pays a little fortune to publish page advertisements in the New York Times and the Saturday Evening Post just to reach 87 men who, he believes, read either one or both of those publications. That advertising pays him.
The day after an advertisement of a five cent chocolate ► appeared in the Neiv York Times a man of rather questionable appearance asked how much the candy would cost by the carload. The manufacturer had never sold the candy that way and had never even estimated the price. The pros-• pective carload purchaser was considered a bit queer. As a matter of policy, he was given an estimate. Then the agents were convinced that he was somewhat abnormal when - he inquired the price of eight carloads. He was told $60,000. You can imagine the amazement he caused when he. ordered eight carloads on condition that he would have exr elusive right to the candy in a certain western state and • that the shipment be made at once. He gave his check for $60,000 which was reluctantly accepted. It was found to be good at the bank. Quality circulation pays along quantity lines.
In contrast, a man and wife, wage-earners, had a hand “ printing press. The idea occurred that after dinner, orders for one hundred letterheads and a hundred envelopes at $1 •	might be printed with profit. Three times in one week an
>	inch advertisement to that effect was inserted in the best
morning newspaper in New York City. Ten days elapsed. The newspaper began to receive complaints from readers who had given orders, enclosing $1.00 for- stationery. The * newspaper wrote the advertiser. No reply. The number of complaints increased. There was an avalanche of them. Five • weeks passed. A representative of the newspaper was sent to the little town where the advertisers lived. During the five weeks they had received over 30,000 replies to the adver-
Scholastic	701
tisement, each containing an order and $1.00. They had not even money enough of their own to acknowledge them, nor to return the money. They could not move. The representative introduced them to the local postmaster so they would not get into trouble with the federal authorities; and then to the local bank, where the $30,000 was deposited and money borrowed on the 30,000 orders with which to buy a place that would serve the purpose. They became successful.
Quantity circulation having quality is distinctive for its thrift, discrimination and prompt response. The best circulation is not quality nor quantity circulation but, if it were possible, quantity and quality added and divided.
The essence of journalistic success as far as the publisher of a daily newspaper is concerned is to keep faith with the reader. The latter pays a certain amount yearly to obtain real news and the contract must be kept by the newspaper owner. If that is conscientiously done, circulation will increase and the advertising will follow, “as the night the day.” There must be no propaganda. That is why continental newspapers lose so much in comparison with the American press; and that is why daily denominational newspapers have been a failure in this country. There are many successful Catholic journalists who do not publish denominational newspapers. I know of no Catholic daily newspaper, as such, that has ever proved profitable in the United States. Ideals must be sufficiently commercial to endure and be effective.
Editor’s Note: This is the third of a series of articles by prominent Notre Dame alumni. Mr. Hugh A. O’Donnell,, the author of the current article, is now assistant business manager of the New York Times. Before joining the Times, he went South and became the editor and publisher of the old New Orleans American. The people of the Southern city were at that time submitting to the unwise dictates of politicians who had been in power for sixteen years. Mr. O’Donnell, with his characteristic honesty began his fight against the politicians by winning the support of the other papers; in this way he finally won the majority of voters to his fight. The political ring was destroyed, not without the endangering of Mr. O’Donnells’ life.
Mr. O’Donnell was a prominent undergraduate while at Notre Dame, graduating in the class of 1894. In this article, he discusses news and circulation.

“HERMAN MELVILLE,” by Lewis Mumford. Literary Guild of America selection for March. Pub. Harcourt, Brace & Co. $3.75.
Lewis Mumford, American critic and essayist, makes his bow to a wide reading public this month under Literary Guild auspices. His offering is a biography, entitled simply “Herman Melville.”
Mr. Mumford’s work is easily the largest, most powerful wave on the tide of interest which during the past two decades has washed Melville up from practical oblivion. But “Herman Melville” is much more than a mere biography. Mumford has truly hitched his wagon to a star; he would carry the revival to its widest, wildest extremes in an attempt to establish Melville’s power and genius upon the same altar where are enshrined those immortal artists of all time, Shakespeare, Rembrandt, Dante. Melville’s power, says Mumford, was thwarted by circumstances, his genius frustrated by an unhappy environment. All of these enlightening discoveries are made, of course, by carefully following and analyzing Melville’s “milieu”; by piercing the externals
and sounding the depths of his writings.
Without wishing to discount the deep critical insight evidenced by Mi-. Mumford* in this remarkable study, yet we are inclined to become suspicious of the facile manner in which he interprets the obscure symbolism of every sentence Melville wrote. In each case the revealed meaning adapts itself with machined precision to Mi-. Mumford’s ambitious thesis. And who wont’ be secretly disappointed to discover that after all, he was wrong in his allegorical interpretation of Moby Dick? There are nearly as many meanings privately read out of this futile whaling expedition as there are readers of Melville. Mr. Mumford himself almost destroys our confidence in his infallibility by presenting three different explanations of Moby Dick, all with equal plausibility!
Even admitting that “Herman Melville” falls short of its author’s purpose, yet one is moved to gratitude for this complete, lucid account of Melville’s life and letters. One may not agree with Mumford on all the extravagant claims made for Melville, but certainly the critic has penetrated farther into the significant undercurrents.of his confused, and withal lonely, existence than any previous biographer. Lewis Mumford has aimed high, pulled a strong, steady bow, but his eyes are fixed on the distant purple of an Eastern horizon.

EASTER
The Lenten season has nearly gone by and we are about to celebrate another Easter. Ever since we can remember our Easters have been given over to those joys peculiar to the season: Easter bunnies, gayly-colored eggs, and, as we grew older, new and fashionable attire. All have had their place in the Easter festival. They are merely additions, however, and not an entity of Easter. As we know, it means more than a mere sartorial parade, an aping and imitation of the clothes dummies of fashion. On Easter Sunday we wear new clothes because of another newness, a new lease on life given to mankind by its Saviour.
On Easter morn Christ rose from the dead, a victorious Christ. Among the first to know of His Resurrection was one who had been lifted by Him from sin to spiritual life. And that was a beautiful touch, for Christ thereby proved to us that His resurrection was to be the hope and the redemption of those who had sinned and were repentent. Mary Magdalene symbolizes the sinners of humanity, and the joy she felt on the first Easter morning should be shared by each of us on the commemoration of that glad day.
If then, the heart that beats under the new. attire is as refreshed and resplendent with hope as is the attire itself, then, and then alone, are we truly sharing in the celestial happiness of Easter. The services of the Church on this occasion are truly beautiful, so beautiful as to have brought about many a conversion. Thackeray, in one of Clive Newcome’s letters to Pendennis from Rome describing the Easter ceremonies, makes the young man say, “There must be moments, in Rome especially, when every man who writes himself English and Protestant must feeal a pang at thinking that he and his countrymen are insulated from European Christendom.” He confesses to a feeling of awful joy to which many others have attested upon witnessing the ceremonies of Holy Week at the Vatican. The ritual of the Church is always impressive, but never more so than during Holy Week and on Easter Sunday. It is the Church’s way of emphasizing the truth of the words, “If He is not risen, then my preaching is vain and your faith is vain.” The revival of hope and the promise of Eternity—that is Easter.	—A.

.	ACAI*. THE EMVERTITY THEATRE
Judging from the enthusiastic reception accorded the presentation of “Julius Caesar” by the Notre Dame players Sunday evening before a capacity crowd, the realization of the University Theater’s primary purpose,, the production of at least one classical play a year at Notre Dame, was realized in an - eminently successful manner. Viewed from every angle the production well-merited the praise it was, accorded from all sides. But the most unusual feature of the play, and the one which reflects the great-• est amount of credit on the directing genius of Professor Kelly, who together with Professor Phillips undertook the presentation of the classic, is the fact that the play was produced with less than a month’s practice. Considering the tremendous amount of necessary work involved—the casting of parts, the arranging of scenery, the selecting of costumes, not to mention the actual rehearsing itself, the accom-‘ plishment of the University Theater in presenting such a worth-while vehicle in such a comparatively short time is doubly-deserving of the highest praise.
* The primary purpose of the University Theater, as said before, is the presentation of at least one classical production a year. It’s secondary purpose is of equal importance, that of providing a means, a work-shop we might say, whereby student playwrights may see their “brain-children” given, and benefit from the actual presentation of them moulded to the dimensions of stage and actor. So far as known, Notre Dame is the only University in the country whose students of play writing enjoy such splendid opportunities.
With “Julius Caesar” being received with such cordial warmth; with previous University Theater productions meriting well-deserved praise; with the “William Mitchell Prize” awarded annually to the student writing the best play serving as an added incentive to campus playwrights; and with such capable men as Professor Charles Phillips, himself a playwright of much distinction, and Professor Frank Kelly, expert director, at the helm, the University Theater seems destined for a long and a prosperous
» and a worth-while existence.	—J- V. H.

We still have a few students, in the true sense of the word, in our colleges and universities. Here is an incidence as recorded by the Daily Texan:
“There exists at least one

class of students in the uni-
versity with a true thirst for knowledge, who will persevere in the paths of learning rather than take an offered ‘walk.’
“In an advanced class in statistics last Saturday when the professor failed to show up, students took things in their own hands and proceeded to hold class themselves, staying the full hour. Several students read reports that were due for that day in lieu of the usual lecture.”

Two thousand of Stanford-University’s 3,482 students are earning all or part of their college expenses.
“Five out of every eight men,” says the Stanford Daily, “are making some effort to finance themselves through college, while one of every five women is assisting in her self-support.”
“The most remunerative job during the past quarter,” the Daily continues, “was waiting on tables which netted a total of S5,362.70. The smallest paid job was that of messenger which amounted to $1.00. Other popular money-makers were tutors, translators, teachers, stenographers, manual laborers, chauffeurs, clerks, cooks, dishwashers, gardeners, and houseworkers.
“Some of the unusual types of work by which the students garnered the shekels were artist’s models, blood transfusion, caddy, guide, porter, printer, newsboy, and social service.”

Wise men, these Minnesotans.

The 1929 Manhattanite, yearbook of Manhattan College, New York, last week conducted a poll among the members of the senior class. The purpose of the poll was to record the personal tastes of the college’s 113 seniors.
Notre Dame was chosen by the seniors as their favorite school other than Manhattan. Trinity was selected as the favorite women’s college, and the majority of the class favored marrying for money. They also approved of examination exemptions.
Some of the other results of the poll are these: favorite movie actress, Joan Crawford; favorite movie actor, Adolph Menjou; favorite author, Jeffrey Farnol; favorite pastime, bridge; favorite sport, football; favorite political party, Democratic; favorite course, philosophy.

The University of North Carolina will have a daily news-papei' next year. The student body recently voted to change the Tar Heel, which is now published three times a week, into a daily. This change, which will be made next Septem-.ber, will give North Carolina the only college daily in the South outside of Texas.
According to the Oklahoma Daily, wall blankets in school colors are the prizes in the university’s bridge tournament. This tournament ranks as an intramural sport, and each organization and dormitory enters a team.

From The Princetonian:
“Using the Oregon style of debate for the first time Saturday, the Princeton and Western Reserve debaters combined their teams on the question, ‘Resolved, that complete freedom of speech and press on political and economical questions is sound,” with the affirmative team winning the decision of the audience. The debate consisted of two twentyminutes speeches, one by both sides, two ten-minute cross-examinations and two ten-minute summaries.”

A PLEA FROM CARROLL HALL
We have some seniors, who are twenty-one, Who stay out every night till half-past one, Who go to parties and dances too, While we of Carroll have naught to do. And every night when ten draws near, Our rector says, “It’s time for bed, my dears.” Now you may think that we are getting stung, But we’ll be happy ivhen we’re twenty-one.
We got those freshman blues, oh Rector, Can’t we please go out, oh Rector, Just around to the picture show, Life in Carroll is awful slow.
Oh, Brother, please don’t be so mean, I’ll bet when you were seventeen, You had those awful freshman blues.

When I do count thy lines of beauty rare, And see the wondrous thoughts composed by thee; When I behold thy style of perfect care, And ever-changing moods which all agree;
When 1 scan works bereft of easy grace, Composed by authors who disgrace the name, Those patterned works which mark the hopeless case, And give these men an un-earned chance on fame; Then all thy artistry stands out alone, to fan, Thy works more lovely and more temperate; Thy ever-present hatred for the droneful man, All prove that thou hast tritely earned thy fate; And I, a slothful student tho I be, Wish fondly that I might grow to write like thee.

Dear Erring Knight:
Have you noticed that one of the local theaters is featuring “The Dummy”—a talking picture?
—WILD ORCHID. .
Our Engineering Committee is still working on the problem of locating a typewriter with sufficient lisp to make it possible for us to install talking pictures in this column. Chief Engineer Otto Graphick has sent in the following report of , their activities during the week:
Dear Chief:
We are hard at work and wish to report that to date we have discovered typewriters speaking seven different languages including the Scandinavian but it seems that it is rather difficult to lisp in the Scandinavian. We have not as yet discovered a native born or naturalized'typewriter that lisps. However, we have discovered an excellent pool room just across the street from the local typewriter foundry and have been trying to determine if any of the pool balls lisp when English is applied to them. Hoping that you will make a bank shot and send us a check, I am,
Yours very truly,
OTTO GRAPHICK.
Chief Engineer, The Wink Talking Picture Expedition.
We hope to have another and more encouraging report for you next time. We have sent the expedition a check and if it does not prove to be good we will send them another one like it.	-	—YE ERRING KNIGHT.

Easter Interlude
JOHN L. NANOVIC
I.
HE train was late, and Don had come down to the station early. He couldn’t make the noon train; eleven o’clock classes every day. He hurried for the Valley Limited not because there was so little time, but be
cause he felt that he must hurry. Wasn’t packing always done in a hurry, even if one packed a day ahead of time? And now the train was late!
After all, what should it matter to Don that the train was late? For all he cared, it need never come. He was in no hurry to go home this vacation; he felt there was nothing there for him now but disgrace. At Christmas time he was eager to go home; eager to see his father and mother and his two younger sisters, Curly, with her boyish virility and hatred of school, and Rene—darling little Rene—who smiled when you scolded her and told you that you didn’t mean to scold her. He was eager to stop in at his father’s bank and see all of the people of Slatington, greet them, talk with them, try to fathom their natures so that he could plan his own future according to theirs, as his father’s life was molded; that he could lead them carefully into the ways that were best for them. And he was eager, too, for Melie. She admired him, he knew. She loved to read his stories, his poems, and even his letters—written from his heart. She would not believe that he loved her letters, too, with their little pearly dew drops in buds of roses.
The train had come and Don got aboard. A few fellows were there, but none whom he knew. He really didn’t care for company; it was much better to sit alone and think of many things, so he placed his grip on the rack above and sat down in the back of the coach.
What a change there had been since Christmas. Things were going along splendidly then. Mother was well, and, it seemed, fully recovered from her auto injuries. Dad was well and fit, and more eager for his work than at any time in years, always watching carefully the affairs of the bank, building earnestly and faithfully the foundation for his son’s success. Don, away at school, was working part of the time, enjoying it all, and planning even more things to do. There was nothing else that could make life more complete or add to the honor of the family and the joy of their home. Then, just a month ago, it came. There were newspaper clippings sent to him .... bank examiners. ... a note that wasn’t just right. . . . more searching. . . . more notes. . . . suspicion. . . . questioning. . . . confession. . . . NEWS. . . . SCANDAL. . . . everything balder. . .. everyone shocked. . . . unbelievable. . . . a hundred thousand. . . . over a period of ten years. . . “for my own use”. . . . “no one else knew of it”. ... “I am sorry for my family”.... “I take all the blame”. ... “I will restore every cent—I will give all I have”. ... “I am ready to pay the penalty”. ... “I am glad it is all over”. . . .
His mother almost broke under the strain, but she would not let him come home. She would arrange everything—he
mustn’t lose; he must go on. Stopping now would not help. And so he stayed at school. No one knew. He kept quiet. He worked harder. He thought more.
Don looked out as the train stopped. Mount Pocono. It was the foot of a long, winding grade—ten miles from Pocono to White Haven as the crow flies, but thirty-two as the rails wound round the breast of the mountain. The second engine was hooked on, and the long, two-headed steam and steel serpent crawled along. Wonderful scenery; the Switzerland of America. Only a short time now, and home. Now the Apex. One head of the steel snake rolled to the side and the serpentile body, unleashed, coiled and uncoiled itself winding downward as it had crawled upward. There was the Gap. Now it was here. The train stopped again. Home.
II.
There was no car waiting for him now. Curly was there, and ran to him as he stepped off the train. She reached for his grip and took it from him. Deal- little Curly, always eager to show how strong she was. He kissed her and, taking the grip back into his hand, walked along with her toward their new home. He looked up to the hill and saw the clump of trees and the long stone wall that made up Residence Park. He could even see the red tiled roof that had been his home for twenty-two years. Curly didn’t look that way. She was eagerly telling him about the house on Lehigh Avenue, right next to the Daly’s (“peachy” people) in which they lived. There was a large front yard, and Mother was going to plant flowers in the back, too. Rene was digging a part of the garden herself—she wanted some for herself, where she could do just as she wished. Rene was that way.
Curly talked on. Adaptable as the wind, she had made her home on Lehigh as enjoyable as her former estate. She didn’t care much for the other “kids on Columbia”—she really hadn’t even while she lived on the hills herself. She chose the more active and exhilarative companionship of the girls below. Don wondered if he would change so, too. He had tried before—he wanted to run around with the fellows from the Flats—to go swimming with them, to ask them up to his home, to play on their teams. Most of them were a bit restrained. They liked him, perhaps, but they were afraid he could never be one of them. Well, now he could—he would; if only they would accept him.
He passed a few people he knew. He said “Hello,” and they answered courteously. Before they would have been more cheerful. They might have added a “glad to see you back,” or something else. But he forgot. Things were different.
At home his mother was well. There was a deep sadness about her, but it was not an oppressive sadness. Rene was the usual teasing, begging, pouting, erring Rene. The little home was as homey as the larger one had been. There were no cars before it, no driveway, no knocker on the door,
!	The Notre Da
r •
no “great-hall”; merely a row of hedges marking it off from the street, a concrete walk leading to the steps, and a vesti-« bule. It seemed odd that the happiness of so large a home could be compressed into such a tiny place and still not lose its flavor. He talked with his mother about the future. They (	were	not as unhappy as he	thought they would be.	He
I •	asked	about Melie. Melie, he	learned, had been out of town
।	the last week—an aunt- in Lehighton was ill, and she	was
|	called	there. Don wondered.	She hadn’t answered his	last
letter, neither had she sent the usual invitation to her Easter party. She had been sympathetic enough during the trouble, but perhaps she, too, would forget him. He did not want her to forget him, but he was too proud to show it.
• * * *
Monday noon he saw Melie driving down the street. She f had probably come back for her party. Don was sorry he would miss it. It would be the first time since Melie had been having parties that he would not be there. Even while he was at school he come home for them—she held them only when it was convenient for him. In the evening, mother and the girls went out, and he sat alone. The phone rang. He didn’t answer it. He didn’t feel like doing anything. It kept on ringing. It angered him. He got up and walked out.
III.
The next day Don was glad it was all over. He would leave that night for school, and maybe when he came back • again people would have forgotten. He read the paper—the story of Melie’s party. He knew the guests well. He knew, better than the account could tell, how lovely Melie was as a hostess. He knew that Easter party so well that he need
me Scholastic	707
not read a word of it, yet it gave him a dull delight to read it. He laid the paper aside and went out to see if there was any mail. The phone rang and Curly, answering it, called to Don as he picked two letters out of the box. The letters were well over-written—just some mail forwarded from school. He merely glanced at them - as he hurried over to answer the phone.
It was Melie.	-
“Melie! Why. . . how. . . are. . . you. . . ”
“Oh, Don, I was so unhappy last night because you didn’t come. I called but no one answered, and I drove down, but the house was dark. . . why. . . ”
“You mean. . . last. . . night. . . ”
“I was so disappointed. . . ”
“But, Mel. . . you, you. . . never. . . even. . . you. . . ”
“And I told you I had to go to auntie’s. Why didn’t you call me as soon as you came home?”
“You. . . told ?. . . . Why. . . I . . . I . . .”
He looked at the letters in his hand. Both were hers— one the invitation, a thick, square plaid envelope; the other her letter. They were postmarked a week ago. Mis-sent, they had arrived at school too late for him, and forwarded, had again come too late. . .
“I’ll. . . I’ll be right up.”
Don didn’t care whether the people spoke to him or not. He ran carelessly from the Flats toward the Hills, and Melie’s home. He no longer felt an intruder; he was no longer proud. Melie was there, waiting for him.
That night, as he boarded the train, he kissed her.
“The Choral Symphony”
JORGE PALOMINO
BEETHOVEN arrived at the dusk of his life with one colossal thought, to which, once crystallized, the noblei- of humanity could come forever after, to find in ■	it soothing balms for all their sorrows, and to be
' lifted from the bog of their petty griefs and little deaths into the higher planes of the spirit, beyond life and death.... beyond fate! . . . Having suffered more deeply than any or-‘ dinary mortal, because of his own greater capacity for suffering and of the greater nobility of his sentiments—too immense for this world and too intense for this life—Beethoven * mysteriously impregnated this work, his last great symphony, r with something, in human measure, of the infinite love and divine compassion which must have filled the heart of Christ at the sight of the perpetual tragedy of humanity moving confusedly at His feet, in the dark mist of Golgotha. . . . Merejkowski refers to the great genius that have lived । among men as “des dieux tombes”. . . and to me, the word * genius is perhaps the nearest in significance to the word " God, in that both touch the immense somewhere in the thick darkness of the incomprehensible. . . . one is convinced of this divinity of genius in hearing the music of Beethoven. In j. that music, not only the bitter tragedy of his own life, but . the tragedy of all human existence, seems to throb and pal, pitate.
* Listening to the Grand Symphony in D Minor, one feels constantly in the presence of something cosmic . . . and in the a	end all limits are broken, and the soul plunges into infinity,
„	singing an Apocalyptic hymn to Joy! . . . that terrible joy
that is the sublime expression of utter resignation, of utter sacrifice. . . . Nohl says: “Beethoven knew from what depths of human nature music was born, and what- its ultimate mean
ing to mankind was”. ... so, to really understand the magnitude of this masterpiece, it is necessary to comprehend not only the great love, but also the great science with which it was written. . . . the two essential things that the “divine” Leonardo always demanded in a great artistic creation. I will express some ideas that will help the mind to grasp more clearly my own feeble conception of this work, and that also will enable the element of colour to enter more powerfully into my description of it, so that it will appear to the imagination not as a mezzotint or a painting in greys, but as a vivid and patent reality, full of light as well as of immensity. Goethe was to Beethoven what he called “a man in D Minor,” and by this he meant a superman that like himself had been gifted with the power to overcome the world. “He did not admire the conqueror, but the overcomer of the world”; therefore the key in which the Ninth Symphony is written is, as it were, the soul of the work; as the work is assuredly the soul of the man. It is the essense of the particular psychological impression that Beethoven wanted it to produce in us.
In advanced Psychology it is well known that a certain musical note produces a definite mood in our consciousness. Transposing this to the field of colour, the fact remains. (This theory is being widely applied in modem drama, of using the light of the colour that corresponds to the emotional intensity of the scene that is being acted.) I will even go farther into this idea, which to me is one of those enigmatical truths that one can approach through intuition: in some obscure plane, colours correspond to sounds, to scents, to flavours and to. . . form ... In man the two senses that are undoubtedly most perfected are those of sight and of
708
The Notre D am e Scholastic
hearing, and that is why it is easy to conceive a link between the phenomena that affect these particular two senses, more readily than with the other three. That is, the mind is able to identify each of the seven colours of the spectrum with each of the seven notes of the scale. In the chromatic scale, D, the supertonic, corresponds to red. . . . the true vermillion. ... so, we can easily imagine the Ninth Symphony as a Symphony in red; and it really impresses one like a great holocaust. ... a gigantic conflagration that carries us away, whirling, into infinity. D is the symbol of Love as passion quintessenced. ... of truth. . . . and of that courage “to bear and to forbear”. ... it projects a mood of intensity in action and excitement which reminds us of our own vital struggle with life and fate. . . . finally, it is the only note that corresponds to humanity, in that when it vibrates, the blood of all men seems, like a still silent ocean, to palpitate in unison with it.
Beethoven, in this symphony, goes into regions which extend far beyond the merely beautiful in art. As the music starts, the immense black curtain of eternal sufferance are opened, and we glance into “this huge stage” that is the world. Lost in his music we get glimpses, here and there, of something superhuman. . . . perhaps of God. . . .
We are afraid, like Dostoevsky, “to watch a man with the Incomprehensible in his grasp”; like Goethe; and like Les-sieur, who exclaimed in astonishment “but such music should not be heard.”
The Grand Symphony in D Minor has four great movements. . . . Allegro ma non troppo; un poco maestoso. . . . Molto vivace; Presto (which he first conceived as a Scherzo) .... the marvelous Adagio molto e Cantabile and the recitatives: Presto: Allegro ma non troppo; Allegro assai. . .. The whole culminating with the overwhelming Finale, the Choral on Schiller’s Ode to Joy. . . .
* * * -
The world trembles. . . . angry clouds roar silently in the blackness of the night. . . . lightnings tint the furious sea with strange red anilines. We feel our consciousness expand, and peer at the tempetuous sea of passions in whose depths humanity is submerged since times forgotten. . . . Love and
Death are but simple melodies lost in the powerful crescendos and bottomless cadenzas that like colossal waves sustain Life and Hate, on the inky surface of that eternally moving ocean. . . . Our eternal struggle between flesh and soul, and all moral battles lost and won, move vaguely in the deep bottom, like agitated seaweeds. All our miseries and our frustrations and our realizations are there. . . . and utterly lost in that chaos the will of man wanders, throbbing with the desire of truth and of eternal peace. . . . and although all his illusions are mercilessly crushed, one by one, he always “rises and aspires” until he finally conquers fate—that cruel monster that like an immense octopus drowns perpetually all humanity beneath its viscous tentacles,—and escapes it for a little moment, ascending through the dark waters and appearing, breathing deeply, on the surface. Man sees the Creator. ... after that mere glimpse he forgets himself in the overtones of the great cosmic Chord that fills the soul and expands it. . . . the weak human mind is dazzled with that sudden solution of all the enigmas and mysteries, that floods it like an outbursting of glittering lights in darkness. Then the serenity of the Universe and the eternal harmony of the Creation lifts man into eternity.... he utterly forgets himself in contemplation. ... he is beyond Life and Fate. ... he exists, unconscious of the immensity of things. . . .
The last chords of the Adagio vanish into a timeless vastness. Suddenly a terrible power awakens the will of man. It is life. ... he resists it in vain, he is pulled downward and downward and plunged once again into the abysses where humanity lies dying. ... he struggles and cries with immense pain. . . . But all is useless. . . . fate is intransigent and man is forced to renounce. . . . and renouncing, he overcomes the world of sufferance, because he realizes that he can GIVE what humanity needs, and thus he gives himself to humanity through a great love. . . . and as the transfiguration of supreme pain by eternal love he utters a gigantic laughter of Joy, filling the worlds of the spaces and the entire cosmos with strange reverberations. . . . reverberations of that terrible Joy that makes souls tremble. . . . that immense Joy that resounds like a tremendous whirlwind ascending towards God.	•

Riding Street Cars
SHAWMUS O’SHAUGHNESSY
STREET cars are to me a nuisance—dull, hateful,wearying. Were I not of necessity subjected to their tortures several times a week, I might ignore them in the supercilious manner that a college widow uses toward a freshman. But my problem is more acute. If I would shun them, I must choose between pedestrianism and running afoul the rules of the University through the somewhat uncertain procedure of begging rides from benevolent motorists.
I find sitting (or, quite often, standing) in a street car ordinarily prosaic to the point of boredom. The efforts of advertisers to relieve the drabness of the interior while furthering their own product is futile indeed—rather, these signs. contribute to the general monotony. I grant that to a few persons these posters may be mentally stimulating, but one can only make himself conspicuous by cranking his neck to read them.	.
Reading, on a street car, is a virtual impossibility. When I merely open a book to glance through it, the car discovers a new series of bumps. If I go further and attempt to
read, it stops with a vigorous jerk. Should I be able to read ever too little, the seats fill as if by magic. I am soon required, in the interests of medieval chivalry, to relinquish my place to some presumptions feminine ingrate who assumes it much in the matter-of-fact way of a college < student appropriating the family car during vacations. And if I sustain street car sickness from the roughness of the ride, what does it avail me to know that there is a nickel in my pocket, but that Wrigley’s (that delicious preventive for car dizziness) is not sold on street cars?
The only time I may harbor an amusing thought while riding a trolley car is at the entrance of a young lady. Then I may always with perfect certainty count on seeing her meticulously .seat herself, taking care to keep her dress artfully at a precise height and to hold her silk-covered knees closely together. My fancy wakes for a moment from its lethargy to prompt a self-complacent smile at the beguiling methods of the subtler sex, then falls back into a state of silent coma.	'

The Scholastic, in conjunction with the Physical Education Department of the University and its staff of coaches and officials, herewith presents the all-interhall lightweight and heavyweight basketball teams for the season of 1929.
The selections were agreed upon only after the record of each individual was given the closest consideration. With the exception of the unanimous vote for Tom Medland for center of the all-interhall team, all of the remaining positions were difficult to fill because of the keen competition among the players, there being little choice between the competitors for the forward and guard positions.
Tom Medland, who captained the Badin heavyweights to their loop championship, has the unique distinction of playing on three championship teams in as many years. In 1927 Medland played with the victorious Carroll Hall team, in 1928 with Sophomore’s winning contingent, and this past season with Badin. He also led the heavyweights in individual scoring with 75 points. It was this championship experience, coupled with his fast floorwork and a keen eye for
the basket that netted him the unanimous vote for the center position on the all-interhall team. Medland was rewarded also with the honorary captaincy of the heavyweight allinterhall team, inasmuch as he was by far the outstanding star of the season.
Bill Reaume, of Morrissey, who was given one of the forward positions on the lightweight selections, topped the lightweight league in scoring honors with 102 points, thereby claiming not only the loop honors but the all-interhall toga for high point man as well.
Two hundred and twenty-eight men participated in interhall basketball competition during the season of 1929. Thirty-one coaches under the direction of the Reverend Vincent E. Mooney, C.S.C., head of the Physical .Education department and director of Interhall Athletics, supervised the various hall teams. From every viewpoint, the past season was far superior to any other previous year. The quality of team-play excelled, and individual performances sparkled throughout the entire season.

The Lone Star state seems to attract more and more major league clubs each year with its favorable climate, and Notre Dame has decided to follow their example. The visit of the Notre Dame team, while a departure from the usual itinerary, should augur- well for the team.
The complete schedule is as follows: April 1, Baylor at Austin; April 8, Baylor at AustinApril 3, Daniel BakerCollege at Waco; April 4, Daniel Baker College at Waco; April 5, Southern Methodist at Dallas; April 6, Texas A. & M. at Fort Worth; April 19, Wabash at Notre Dame; April 22, Iowa at Notre Dame; April 24, Western State Normal at Notre Dame; April 30, Quichita U. at Notre Dame; May 1, Wisconsin at Madison; May 3, Iowa at Iowa City; May 4, Drake at Des Moines; May 10, Michigan State at East Lansing; May 11, Northwestern at Notre Dame; May 14, Bradley at Notre Dame; May 17, Illinois at Urbana; May 18, Coe College at Notre Dame; May 20, Meiji University of Japan at Notre Dame; May 22, Butler University at Notre Dame; May 24-25, Minnesota at Minneapolis; May 27-28, Marshall College at Notre Dame; May 31, Wisconsin at Notre Dame; June 1, Michigan State at Notre Dame.
Besides the Texas games it is interesting to note the visit of the Meiji University team from Japan. The boys from the Orient are making an extensive tour of the States and are meeting some of the fastest of the college teams. The Oriental brand of baseball is exceedingly well developed and an excellent contest is in store.
Fully half of the Big Ten’s diamond power will be represented by Illinois, Northwestern, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota. This quintet may be expected to give Notre Dame plenty of opposition. ■

CHICAGO CLUB TO OFFER TROPHY FOR CAMPUS BASEBALL LEAGUE
A schedule of playground baseball for the campus clubs will be arranged soon for this spring as the result of the interest taken in the sport last year. The Chicago Club and Physical Education Department are cooperating in sponsoring this branch of athletics.
The Chicago Club will offer a trophy this year as it did last year, for which the club teams will compete. All clubs which desire to enter a team in the league are requested to mail their applications to the Reverend E. V. Mooney, C.S.C., director of the Physical Education Department.
The balls, bats, bases and other necessities will be supplied by the department, while officials will be picked from the Physical Education School.

ELDER, WALSH, AND FOUR MILE RELAY TEAM PLACE IN ILLINOIS
RELAYS
Jack Elder, varsity track captain, received one of the few defeats of his career in the twelvth- annual Illinois relays held last Saturday at Urbana, when George Simpson, crack Ohio State sprinter breasted the tape in the 75 yard dash a fraction of an inch ahead of him. So close was the finish, that Simpson was not declared the winner until after a long consultation between the judges. The Buckeye star got off to an excellent start, as did Tolan of Michigan, and Timm of Illinois, the other finalists in the event, Elder on the other hand made a bad start and despite his remarkable effort in the last thirty yards of the race to overtake Simpton, lost out at the finish by an eyelash. Simpson was clocked in 7.6 seconds by the timers. Elder had previously negotiated the distance in 7.5 seconds in a qualifying heat, and had been picked to cop the final.
Notre Dame’s other individual point-winner in the relays was Bob Walsh who finished second in the shot put. Heaving the iron ball the farthest he has ever tossed it in competition, the husky Blue and Gold weightman’s best effort was several inches behind White, of Kansas State Teachers’, who heaved the shot 46 feet, 1 inch to take first honors in the event.
Bob Brennan, Pete Morgan, John Brown, and William Brown running in the order named, constituted Notre Dame’s four* mile relay quartet which finished third to Illinois and Indiana in that event.
Two other Blue and Gold trackmen, Ken Boagni and John O’Brien reached the semi-finals in the 75-yard dash and the 60-yard high hurdles respectively, before being eliminated. •

DONOVAN ELECTED BASKETBALL
CAPTAIN AT ANNUAL BANQUET
The Hoosier state maintained its supremacy on the basketball court when Clarence Donovan of Bedford, regular guard for the past two seasons, was elected to lead the Notre Dame eagers for next season. Donovan’s playing has always been marked by brilliant floor work, coupled with deadly accuracy at basket shooting. The new captain is lefthanded and his clever handling of the ball is enough to render any game interesting.
The banquet was given by the Villagers’ Club last Thursday, March 14, in the Rotary room of the Oliver Hotel. Approximately two hundred guests attended, including prominent citizens of South Bend, officers of the university, Coach Keogan, and Coach Paul Hinkle of Butler. Father Mulcaire and Father Hugh O’Donnell commented briefly on the success of this year’s team. Coach Keogan expressed the belief that the 1928-29 team was one of the best he ever coached; while Hinkle, the Butler mentor, declared that Notre Dame was regarded as the most important opponent on the Bulldogs’ schedule.
Prof. Clarence Manion of the law faculty presided as toastmaster, and Francis Jones acted as chairman. Farewell speeches were delivered by the two captains, Francis Crowe and Joseph Jachym, John Colrick, Robert Newbold, and by student man-

GENE OBERST NEW HEAD FOOTBALL COACH AT WASHINGTON AND LEE
Gene Oberst, former Notre Dame football star and at one time world’s champion javelin thrower, who was formerly athletic director at De Pauw University, Greencastle, Indiana, has recently accepted the position of head football coach at Washington and Lee University. Mr. Oberst was a tackle on the famous “Seven Mules” of 1924.

FRED YOUNG AGAIN PICKS SMITH FOR ALL-WESTERN
For the fifth consecutive year- Notre Dame has been singularly honored in the selection of an All-Western basketball team, when Ed Smith, versatile and consistent guard on Coach Keogan’s quintet for the past two seasons, was picked for a guard position on the 1928-29 honor team. The selection of the All-Western team, which is made yearly by Fred Young, eminent sports writer and official, was announced last Sunday in the Chicago Tribune.
Smith’s mates on the star quintet were, Foster of Wisconsin, and Chapman of Michigan, forwards; and Charles “Stretch” Murphy of Purdue, center; with Ted Chmielski of Wisconsin holding down the other guard berth.
Frank Crowe, flashy forward of the Blue and Gold team, was given honorable mention on the team. Crowe was named as first-string forward on the 1927-28 All-Western, but sickness handicapped his playing this year. Clarence Donovan, guard, and John Colrick, center, were also given honorable mention by Mr. Young, making the second consecutive year that they had received such recognition.
The following Notre Dame players have been awarded berths on first string All-Western quints in past years since the annual selection of such teams was inaugurated in 192-5: Captain Noble Kizer, 1924-25; John Nyikos and Louis Conroy, 1925-26; Captain John Nyikos and Louis Conroy, 1926-27; Ed Smith and Frank Crowe, 1927-28.
Crowe and Smith were also honored by the choice of Blaine Fallen, sports-editor of the Indianapolis Star in his selection of an all-Indiana collegiate five. Crowe, despite his sickness, was recognized as one of the two leading forwards of Indiana, and Smith was placed at guard. Both of the men were awarded silver basketball cups at the basketball banquet last Thursday night, in recognition of the honors they received.

Morrissey, and Sophomore. In order to permit the greatest number possible to play the national game it has been decided by Father Mooney to have two teams in each hall. This system was successfully carried out in basketball the past season. It is planned to play six games each Sunday morning and afternoon, with several taking place during the week when convenient.
Swimming enthusiasts will be given an opportunity to perform in the local tank immediately after the Easter session. A schedule of dual meets will be completed by the time the students return, which will prepare ambitious men to fit themselves for the championship meet at the close of the schedule.
The interhall tracksters will emulate the Varsity and move outdoors as soon as the schedule of dual meets is an
nounced early in April. It is expected that the fine weather will bring about more enthusiasm on the part of aspiring trackmen than was displayed in the recent indoor meet.

CARROLL HALL MERMEN DOWN BROWNSON SWIMMERS IN DUAL MEET
The Carroll mermen defeated the Browmson Hall natators 27-22 in a swimming meet, held in the University natatorium Tuesday, March 12. This marked the opening of the interhall swimming season.
The contest was so close throughout that- it was not decided until the completion of the final event, Carroll winning the 100-yard relay to break the tie score of 22-22.

Gentlemen:
About five years ago, after trying out many different styles of pipes from the Missouri meerschaum to the genuine meerschaum, including the upside-down style made popular by Vice-President Dawes, and experimenting with just about all the tobaccos then on the market except Edgeworth, I finally detided that pipesmoking was not for me.
For the last year or so I noticed the boys around the office here using Edgeworth to the exclusion of all other tobaccos and evidently getting real pleasure from their pipes.
,	In April of this year I was in Canada
on a business trip and detided to take another whirl at pipe-smoking. So I invested a good share of my savings in a pipe and a few cents additional for a can of Edgeworth.
From then on I have been figuratively kicking myself around the block about once each day when I think of the five lean years I put in trying to get along without a pipe. However, I am trying to make up for lost time and am succeeding quite well. Why I failed to try Edgeworth long ago will have to go down in history as an unsolved question. But now that I
- have found it, the years ahead look rosy to me.
Very truly yours, Btii Bayer
