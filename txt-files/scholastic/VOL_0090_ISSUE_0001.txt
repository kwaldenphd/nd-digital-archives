Dear Reader:
This column is supposed to be Letters to the Editor, but just for once let us run one from the Editor to the reader. We have a gripe. The people who write letters to this column are grand people. They are the finest people in the world — they read the Scholastic. They tvrite to us about a variety of things, mostly gripes — some of them very good and others horribly weak. After all, Notre Dame does not, necessarily, claim to be Heaven. But, whether your gripes, your suggestions, your compliments, are good or bad, let’s make them short.
But we do want your letters — they tell us that you are reading the Scholastic — and after putting in from 20 to 30 hours each week on this magazine, we like to feel that we are putting out a “mag” that is of interest to you. But keep them short; then, we can get around to printing them all. And sign your name. If you have a reason for not exposing yourself tell us and we’ll withhold your name. But it better be a good reason — especially if the gripe treads on somebody’s toes.
There’s the policy for the Letters column this year! We hove you tvrite.

Dear Editor:
In the Scholastic last Spring under a caption of “Tracksters to end dismal season tomorrow” I wrote a story which depicted the Notre Dame track team as a dying group destined to end its season in a pathetic manner. I was in grave error. What I had diagnosed as a fluttering pulse turned out to be the strong rhythmic pulse of a surging powerhouse.
The group for which I held low hopes — on the basis of relatively close losses to Missouri, Penn State, and Michigan State — rebounded with victories in the Indiana State meet, the Indiana A.A.U. meet and a strong second in the Central Collegiates in Milwaukee. In addition, one member of the team, Capt. Ernie McCullough, represented Canada in the Olympics, and four others barely missed the opportunity of making the United States team.
I regret my hasty and unsound judgment of a group which I have always felt to be Notre Dame’s finest and fairest spoi-tsmen. My apologies to Coach Elvin R. Handy and the track team. Henceforth, I will leave the field of prog-

Under the Air Force expansion program, there is plenty of room for advancement. 2nd Lieutenants automatically become 1st Lieutenants after three years of service; are eligible to become Captains, Majors and Lieutenant Colonels after 7, 14 and 21 years respectively. More rapid promotions are frequent. Never before has the opportunity for making the Air Force a permanent career been so favorable, especially to the men in Aviation Cadet Pilot Training.
Here are the requiremeato:
Appointment to the Aviation Cadets is open to single men, between 20 and 2614 years old, who have completed two years of college (or can pass an equivalent examination). Upon graduation. Cadets receive their wings and commission, a $250 uniform allowance, and three-year active duty assignment with pay up to $336 a month. Get full details at any Air Force Base or at any U. S.

Dear Editor:
In view of the fact that the administration at Notre Dame has amply provided for the married veterans, a few of the faculty do not seem to realize the conditions which strain our everyday life.
Upon registering this year, I was confronted with a four-hour class to be taught in mid-afternoon. As it is for the average Vetville home-maker, it is impossible for me to take afternoon classes. I work in the afternoon.
After consultation with the proper authorities, I found that the only alternative was to drop this course. No alternative was offered to replenish my schedule with another subject.
By carrying this lighter schedule my graduation is seriously hampered.
There is no doubt that the mechanization of IB M has greatly lessened the toil of registration. But these machines can not be expected to master the more ticklish problems of human relations. That’s up to the faculty.

Dear Editor:
What’s the matter with the guys that oriented the freshmen? They fed them doughnuts and cokes; they had high officials take them on tours; they had information booths set up on campus and down town. But they forgot one thing!
Somebody should have whispered something in their ears about the tradition. What tradition? The one about not walking up or down the outside steps of the Administration Building until you have graduated.
If the orientation program missed that one detail, how’s about the Scholastic mentioning it to the daring 1200?

THE WEEK
By Bob Vierhile
Facts & Freshmen
Despite all the excitement about the record freshman class, we’re not going to hot-foot the newcomers with any sulphur-coated adjectives in this department. In the course of oui- conversation with a freshman from Dallas, Texas, we were informed that Indiana and Notre Dame were not all he had expected.
“Down where ah come from,” he said, “we really eat. That Italian spaghetti we had Friday night had a distinct Polish accent.” After that, we realized that the freshmen would receive all the mistreatment that is traditionally theirs simply by leaving their halls, going to the dining halls, and returning — for the next four years.
Arsenic & Old Legacies
We had a few words, in a manner of speaking, with a law student named Jack “King” McCabe, whose challenge to fame is owning an autographed copy of Dean Manion’s book, “Lessons in Liberty.” Jack told us of his latest meeting
with a summer school professor, whose chief challenge to fame is to have a fifty per cent flunking average.
“Well,” said the herewith-and-where-as expert, “what did you think of my course this summer?” “Well, sir,” said Jack, “I thought it was a very all-inclusive course. Everything that was not covered during the year was covered on the final exam.”
Drop and Add
Progress in registration procedure took a long limp forward here at Notre Dame last week. An IBM machine which manufactures class cards and schedules with all the wondrousness of a penny weight machine, was installed. It was installed to do the thinking of some two-dozen office girls and to confuse some five thousand students.
We came upon The Machine deep in the Main building. A girl, wearing a size 12 calico Louella Ballerino original cotton skirt, a matching eyelet-trimmed peasant blouse from Carson, Pirie, Scott & Co., and an unfinished pair of pink Llama pumps, greeted us.
“Hi,” I said, “is this It?” She nodded and immediately started pushing buttons, reading gauges, checking a “mike,” and stopping only to dust off her Bausch and Lomb safety glasses.
“This is how it works,” she said with a 31-tooth Ipana smile. Taking about forty manila cards, about the size of government subsistence checks (if you’ve had the pleasure), she jammed them into a black cavity in the top and pushed a green button lettered “Go.”
“This is history prof Number 805,” she said. “Students with numbers 5387 to 5421 will get course 131 in room 316 in building 13 at 10 MWF.” The history professor’s number was hammered home on the student’s cards for a second or two, then The Machine whined like a hurt dog, and stopped. The girl went for the oil can. “These history cards run through a little hard,” she said. “Oh,” I said.
I looked at the finished card of a fellow named Murphy. He was scheduled for course 96 in room 306 in building 88 at 8 p.m. MTWTFS. “Where is building 88?” I asked. “It’s not listed here.”

As if he had a line on the opening day of school, Hopalong Cassidy will he dusting ’em off tonight and tomorrow night at the Granada in a thing aptly termed “Borrowed Trouble.” Hoppy, an old favorite with Notre Dame men, gets - himself into a nasty mess trying to help a-grave-old widow hold her stake.

PEP RALLY, in the Field House. From all reports Leahy’s lads need increased suppoi-t from the student body this year. The big game of the year should mean the biggest pep rally of the year. Speakers from N.D. and Purdue, radio and press. Also debut of new, 50-piece freshman marching band.

The Scholastic is published weekly during the school year, except during vacation and examination periods at the University of Notre Dame. Address all manuscripts to the Editor, Bov 185, Notre Dame, Indiana.
COVER: Caught in the welter of class registration is Leonard Kilian of Auburn, New York and 128 Breen-Phillips.

This is Volume 90, No. 1 of the Notre Dame Scholastic. This is our 82nd year of publication. When the Scholastic started back in 1867. the first editor said that the paper was started to “record accurately and completely the events of the campus year.” That is still the aim of the Scholastic this year, some 82 years later.
But let’s get things straight. This is not a student magazine. It is, rather, an official University publication published on a student level, i.e., students do the writing, the copy reading, take the pictures, and plan the magazine, but only in terms of what should be put in an official University publication.
Since we are official, we shall not bite the hand that feeds us. Yet, in another sense, we must uphold our integrity and stand up for our rights from the level of the student. We shall speak against small things which we feel to be wrong, but editorially we shall not blast away haphazardly at our own foundations. That is the status of the Scholastic.
Lest you take things wrong, we do intend to be the sounding board of student opinion. We cannot promise you that we will campaign against all the evils—both real and imaginary—which face the Notre Dame student, but we do intend to approach the problems.
Getting back to the job of recording accurately and completely the events of the school year, we must say that in order to do so, we need the cooperation of all the people of Notre Dame, students, faculty, and administration officials. Generally speaking, there has been cooperation in the past. We hope it continues.
We think the Scholastic should speak for all the school—for the engineer as well as the journalist. In order to be successful in this aim, the Scholastic staff should be made up of engineers, chemists, lawyers, commerce men, and arts and letters students. But unfortunately, the bulk of our staff will always be those interested in journalistic work-Hence, we fail somewhat in our aim to give the campus the complete coverage which we would like.
To combat this, we appeal to the men in the various colleges to offer their services to this year’s staff. Perhaps your contribution may only be the hint of a story, or may be the story submitted to us in manuscript form. But if you give us, only the hint, we’ll try to record your story. If you expect the Scholastic to represent you, you must cooperate.
This year, things are a little different. There are a lot of new faces— young ones. The grizzly old vet, who sloughed his way through the mud of Italy and Normandy, or through the swamps of the South Pacific, is on the way out. In two graduations, Notre Dame turned loose some
scheduled which they had already completed, and so on. One prof put it this way: “We are at the mercy of a machine.”
1100 men—then picked up about 1200 new ones in our new freshman class. The Scholastic must appeal to both groups. We must record the history of the year, and at the same time make our pages light and amus-ing—something to look forward to on a Friday afternoon. We hope we can do it.
Summing up for a moment: the Scholastic will go on being about the same. There will be a few changes; we’ll be a little more amusing— call it cornier if you will—but just don’t expect too much.

Swollen Enrollment Jams Notre Dame
Faculty Total Soars; 47 Added This Term
With lead in their feet and a cold fear of Dining Hall sheep in their hearts, forty-nine hundred aspiring, perspiring students flocked onto the campus last week for the opening of the 1948-49 academic year. They found they constituted the biggest, highest-paying enrollment in the University’s 106-year history.
Forty-seven new teachers from all parts of the United States and from Canada, South America and Europe have joined the Notre Dame faculty this year.
Of the new faculty members 27 will teach in the College of Arts and Letters, eight in Science, five in Engineering, three in Law, and two in Commerce. Two others have been added to the Mediaeval Institute staff.
The new appointments are: COLLEGE OF ARTS AND LETTERS: Dr. James F. Anderson, of Dover, Del., from the faculty of Loyola University in Chicago, Assistant Professor of Philosophy; James Binder, of Reading, Pa., from Johns Hopkins University of Higher

They found, too, a few changes in the city by the lakes. There was new gold being pasted on the Dome, a new setup in the disciplinary authority, a new registration procedure, the IBM machine, 47 new profs, new rectors, and in some halls, new paint for aging walls. But it was still the same old Notre Dame.
Most impressive addition to campus life was the huge crop of freshmen, already trotting around buying- Rockne’s chair, Gipp’s crib notes, and Sorin’s beard from accommodating upperclassmen. The frosh, numbering 1200, were hand picked from thousands of applications which flooded the Registrar’s office last year. They came from every state in the Union, from the D. of C., Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and from six foreign countries. One hundred thirty were veterans.
The total enrollment, still climbing as late arrivals came in this week, was 4933. Every hall was choked to overcapacity, and some of the freshmen were being temporarily housed in the Oliver. To instruct this outpouring of eager scholars a 5C0-man faculty stood ready with shining smiles, outside reading, and departmental exams. Among the faculty members were 86 priests of the Congregation of Holy Cross, four priests of other orders, four teaching brothers, over 300 lay teachers, and 102 graduate assistants.
Among other shifts in the University administration, the Rev. Father James Norton was appointed Assistant Director of Studies, replacing the Rev. Father John J. Lane. Veterans’ affairs will be handled by Mr. Edward J. Murray, Director of Students Accounts.
And to keep the swelling mob of students in line, the Rev. Father Joseph Kehoe was back on the job, but his office had a new title. It was now the Office of Student Welfare. The Rev. Father Joseph Barry, former student activity adviser, was to assist Father Kehoe in policing the ranks.
It was still the same old Notre Dame.

Public School Exploitation Charged In Fr. Cavanaugh's Opening Address
The Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., President of the University of Notre Dame, lashed out against the “campaign to exclude God and religion from American life” in his address at the solemn opening of the current schoclyear. In particular, Fr. Cavanaugh decried what he termed “the deliberate exploitation of the public school system at the expense of the private, religious school.”
Refuting the prevalent propaganda that the founding fathers of the country established the public school system, he pointed out that no public schools were established in the United States until the 1840’s. Therefore, he asked, “who communicated the philosophy of Americanism in the interval, if not the private, religious schools?”
Fr. Cavanaugh then attacked the theory that the public school system is the only “melting pot” in America. “If the record means anything, the work of merging the different races and creeds goes on so effectively in the private schools, that in war and peace the patriotism of private school students and graduates is second to none.” He went on to point out that the records of wars as well as the records of peace prove conclusively that private school products took their places in the service of their country and of society as easily and well as the products of the public schools.
Getting down to the main point of his address, Fr. Cavanaugh defended the right of parents to send their children to the school of their choice. “The state,” he said, “can justly make demands only when the family fails to provide for its children the kind of education which will make good American citizens.” So why, he demanded, must Catholic parents be made to pay for a public school education, even though they prefer, as is their right, to give their children a religious education for which they must also pay? “I would' like to have some one show me the reasonableness of this double taxation for Catholics,” he challenged.
Fr. Cavanaugh continued, The Catholic school system, takes a tremendous burden off the budget of the public school system. He showed dramatically the chaos that would result if all the Catholic schools in the country should suddenly shut down. He expressed his belief that a workable plan can be devised to take this unjust burden off the shoulders of a minority in the country.
Father Cavanaugh ended with the following plea to ward off the growing
secularism that is gripping this country: “If the good of the country demands the exclusive development of the public school system with funds provided by taxing all the citizens, if public education must be non-religious, as the Supreme Court requires, then the further secularization of America must follow as night follows day. Those who believe that American life must never be completely secularized, that we need to work back in the other direction to the religious faith of our fathers, to the union of everyday affairs with morality and religion, must elect to provide private, religious schools.”
S+ay Council Faces Heavily Piled Desks
Busy days are once again in store for this year’s Student Council with such jobs as elections and the first victory dance pressing its immediate attention. “That’s only part of it,” said Bob Uhl, Council stalwart, as he began listing the many problems confronting the organization.
The student trip to the Navy game in Baltimore is also awaiting the organization’s attention. Of the 23 members on last year’s Council, there are but three men left on a standing committee which was elected last spring to serve as an advisory group and to plan programs already approved by the school for the beginning of the year. Each of the college deans chose a representative from his respective college last spring, and those chosen men will also work on the Council this year.
Jim Cassidy, an off-campus student is chairman of the Stay-Council, while the other two members are Lou Burns and Jack Kennedy. During the first week in October they plan to have student elections to fill the empty positions in the Council. At that time they plan also to encourage all school organizations to have meetings which are to be more or less like open houses for the further orientation of the freshmen.
These meetings will afford the newcomers a chance to examine all the geographical and technical clubs before accepting membership. The Council also plans to publish a social calendar in the near future. It will contain not only the dates of Notre Dame activities but those pertaining to St. Mary’s as well. As a result of the Council’s efforts, telephones have been installed on every hall floor.
Teaching Aids Are Available At New Audio-Visual Center
Latest types of teaching aids were made available recently to public and private schools in the middle west by the new Audio-Visual Education Center which is located in the Main building.
The new Center, which is equipped to make phonograph recordings, photographs, silent and sound motion pictures, film strips and similar aids, will supply the 35 academic departments with educational pictures and recordings as teaching aids. A library of such aids covering every subject taught at the University also is being assembled.
Orville R. Foster, instructor in education, is director of the new Center. According to him, the Center can serve such functions as producing educational films for every subject taught at Notre Dame, building a library of films, record by picture and sound the history of Notre Dame, and record great musical programs, addresses and lecture series for classroom use.

WND's Fall Program Boasts New Schedule
Station WND, “the voice of the Notre Dame campus,” will return to the airwaves Monday at 7 p.m., beaming a revamped schedule of student programs for three full hours.
Among the carry-overs from last year will be those voted most popular by a survey among students, which revealed that 87% of the campus residents were regular listeners of WND during its first season. These include Moonlight Serenade, Jump Time, and Broadway Musicals, featuring musical scores from the latest New York productions.
Bill Halligan will present a daily “Spotlight on Sports,” Monday through Friday at 7:55 p.m., offering a roundup of Irish athletic news.
Each Monday night, Frank Tripucka will broadcast a 15-minute program giving his impressions of the ND football game the preceding Saturday.
Starting Thursday at 7:30, a weekly news forum featuring analysis of current news events by members of the faculty is listed on the WND program slate. Taking part in the broadcast will be Professor John H. Sheehan, head of the economics department; Mr. Marshall Smelser, professor of history, and Professor A. H. Chroust, of the Mediaeval Institute.
Semi-classical and classical records will be a regular feature from 9 to 10 each evening, in a program presented with the cooperation of Rev. John D. Gallagher, C.S.C., and the Department of Music.
With the expanded schedule comes the need for more helpers in the fields of announcing, engineering, production, business and script writing. All students interested in joining the WND staff should see general manager Frank Cronan between 7 and 10 Tuesday at the studios in the balcony of the Old Gym.
A special new feature of WND services will be re-broadcasts of FM programs each afternoon, enabling students with AM radio sets to hear them.
Among the veterans of last year’s staff back on the job again are Frank Venner, chief announcer, associate announcers Walt Garrity, Bill Carey and Bill Halligan; Jack Dunlevy in the post of assistant station manager; chief engineer Jack Jones and his helpers, Ken McCabe, Bill O’Hern and Bob Nouri; and Al Verach, handling production.

Successful Season Shapes Up For Glee Chib As Trips To South And West Are Slated
PROFESSOR PEDTKE Prospects are bright
Band in Traditional Parade For Opening Rally Tonight
Tonight’s the night! With emotions stirred up by the University Band, in the traditional parade around the campus, the student body will converge upon the Field House to “shake down the thunder from the sky” in the season’s first pep rally.
The parade will begin at 7:15 from Washington Hall, sweep past Farley and Breen-Phillips to pick up the freshmen, then proceed over to Badin’s Bog and Howard, charge across to Dillon and Alumni and finally to the Field House for the rally proper.
John Gaines and his cohorts of the Blue Circle plan to start the rally off with cheers, followed with talks by Coach Leahy, Father Barry, and, if he arrives in time, Bill Stern, noted sportscaster. The Hike Song will prelude Captain Bill Fischer, huge Irish guard, who will introduce the team. He and quarterback Frank Tripucka will give brief talks, representing the linemen and backs, respectively. Then the rally will break up to the strains of the Victory March.
The Blue Circle, sponsor of the rally, plans to sponsor rallies before all the home games, before the student trip to the Navy game and possibly before the Southern California game, and also to arrange sendoffs for the team before they leave for the away games. This year the rallies will be less like vaudeville shows and will be given back to the students. They will be shorter and more enthusaistic, with the emphasis being put on student participation, rather than student attendance.—Dan Brennan
Notre Dame’s talented Glee Club, straining at the leash in anticipation of another successful season, ha^ organized its wealth of vocalists and began practicing in earnest last week in preparation for concert tours and local appearances scheduled to begin later in the Fall.
Under the tutelage of Daniel S. Pedtke this year as in the past, the campus choristers find most of last season’s veterans returning. This year’s slate of officers for the club seats Roy O’Neill, of Aurora, Ill., in the president’s chair. Willoughby Marshall, hailing from Ap-palachicola, Fla., is vice-president; No. Dakotan, Larry Metcalf, secretary; and George Bariscillo from New Jersey, will fill the business manager’s position.
According to Mr. Pedtke, the Glee Club plans are promising and the prospects are bright. Already contracts have been signed for concerts in Aurora and Elgin, Ill., on December 10 and 11. Although pre-Christmas concerts by the club have been few in the past, Mr. Pedtke hopes to have the program worked out early this year in prepaia-tion for the projected Glee Club tours through the south and the west. Concerts in the major cities of these districts are now in the embryo stage.
Among the other events of interest looked forward to by the members of the Irish Glee Club is the release in the Spring of an album of college glee club recordings in which Notre Dame is represented. The album, to be issued by Capitol Records, will contain a Notre Dame Glee Club recording of the Victory March and Notre Dame We. Hail Thee.
Vetville's Agenda for Year To Include Maternity Fund
Vetville’s resourceful denizens have popped up with some new plans for the coming year, according to the tooner-ville Mayor Robert Gardner. Near the top of the agenda is a plan to start a maternity fund which would help defray hospital expenses. Also under consideration is a blueprint for organizing all married students.
The social season will open tomorrow night with a dance in the Rec Hall, with a mixer hot on its heels. The latter will be delayed until the new residents get settled. More than fifty families stayed on this summer at the village across the Juniper to attend summer school. They sponsored their own graduation exercises at which diplomas were awarded to wives of the departing students.

Steaming Mob Opens Another Gala Season; St. Mary's Girls Get First Look at New Frosh
By MURRAY POWERS
Starched cuffs and collars wilted and sagged when scores of ND men besieged St. Mary's College for the first tea dance of the semester last Sunday afternoon. The dance had been intended for the freshmen only but as the afternoon lengthened so also did the number of upperclassmen. As freshman Ray Earls of Portland, Me., observed, ’"‘The upperclassmen have the upperhand.”
Assorted comments were heard as the new students paid their first visit to the college across the Dixie. Some fellows wandered around the campus “just looking at the ducks” in the pond while others crammed their way into the social hall to “see what the women looked like.”
The Social Hall was a steaming mass of human beings slowly moving back and forth and constantly wiping the sweat off their brows. Every window was open but any breeze that might have drifted through was turned back by the solid wall of students on both sides of the hall.
One change from last year noted was that the girls were standing on the right side of the hall instead of the left as was the case in last year’s dances. Other than that the dance followed much the same pattern as those of past semesters with the same records and the same persevering hostesses trying to get the fellows and girls to dance. One such hostess, “P. D.” Anderson, a junior, did take time enough to remark that the freshman class had “darling girls and cute boys.” The spectators jammed the doorways and at least half of the dancing space, forcing couples headed for the
Gee Whiz! Frank Tripucka
dance floor to waste half of the record before they were even able to start.
The usual fear of making any public statement was present in one group of girls who remarked “It’s much too formal, but don’t quote us. We’re only freshmen.” One dainty little one inquired, “Where are the sophomo e boys?”
The ND frosh were a bit more talkative. Dom Narducci of Naugatuck, Conn., obviously in the midst of junior and senior girls asked, “Where are the young ones?”
SMC upperclassmen were observing the new arrivals with a great deal of ;• interest, too. Connie Connors, a soph from Moline, Ill., considered the frosh girls as “stiff competition.” For the ND newcomers Claire DeCrane, a soph from Cleveland, Ohio, said, “They look like they’re loads of fun.” Not quite so enthusiastic was Mary Ann Pasin with “I guess they are O.K.”
Many men went back to the campus disappointed by the vast number of males as compared to the females available. Even the girls noticed it as Sally Disser, in between arranging dates for some fellows out on the portico, commented “the odds are all for the girl.”
The only thing to mar the otherwise perfect day happened in Farley where some campus comic put a very official looking notice on the board stating that the dance had been called off and that there would be one on the following Sunday.
The men left SMC at five. Few were disappointed but Bill Puetz, a rugged soph from Morrissey, claimed that he lost seven pounds during the afternoon. But even he agreed that it was worth it. —Murray Powers
Association Taps Staunton For '48 Lay Faculty Award
Professor Henry C. F. Staunton, of the Department of English, has been named the 1948 recipient of the Notre Dame Lay Faculty Award for distinguished service during the 1947-48 school year. The award, which carries a $500 purse, is made annually by the Alumni Association to an outstanding member of the faculty.
Professor Staunton has been a member of the faculty since 1925 and has specialized during his teaching in American Literature, English Literature of the 19th century and poetry. He is a native of Skaneateles, N. Y.
Hoosier's Hoagy Here For Slam-Bang Revue
“Stardust Revue,” a variety show set to the tinkling keys of composer artist Hoagy Carmichael, opens a one-day engagement at the auditorium of John Adams High School on Saturday, October 2.
A native of Indiana, Carmichael, composer of the ever popular “Stardust,” has appeared in several Hollywood productions, one of the more recent being Washington Hall’s “Night Song.” In addition to his movie undertakings, Hoagy has brought his fine piano onto a major network. The show is aired on a local station.
Slated to complement Carmichael on the same bill are eight established acts. On the spectacular side, the Sensationalists skate through their paces in whirlwind style, followed by the aerial act of the Nelson Sisters and the adagio dancing of the Sylvia Manion Trio. Comedy is supplied by the balancing dub of Park and Clifford and Ray and Nardo, excellent mimics. The “Wizards of the Accordion,” the Tutones, Annette Olson of musical comedy and operetta fame, and Cee Davidson’s recording orchestra will add then* music to MC Carmichael’s pianistics.
Tickets for the afternoon and evening performances, sponsored by the Junior League of South Bend, went on sale at Copp’s Music Store on September 20. Matinee seats are scaled at .60. 1.20, 1.80. 2.40,-. 3.00. and 3.60, while for the evening show the prices are 1.20, 1.80, 2.40, 3.00, and 3.60.
Father John C. McGinn, 69, Noted Scholar, Passes Away
One of Notre Dame’s outstanding professors and sociologists, Father John C. McGinn, 69, passed away September 14 in the community infirmary. Father McGinn was a professor here from 1912 until 1945 when he was forced to retire because of ill health.
He was intensely interested in the formation of a strong alumni association. In 1922 he was instrumental in founding the Notre Dame Alumnus — magazine for the far-flung graduates of Our Lady’s school. Father McGinn was also the first full time secretary of the Notre Dame Alumni association, serving in that capacity from 1921 to 1924. During the Oliver corporation strike of 1930 he was chairman of the board of arbitration.
Father McGinn was born in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1879 and was ordained in 1910. He received his A.B. from Notre Dame and his S.T.L. from Catholic University.

SUMMERTIME
Conventions, Commencements and Courses Set Fast Pace 'Mid Sightseeing Hordes
Its students were scattered far and wide, enjoying a long-awaited vacation; but the wheels of Notre Dame activity buzzed and hummed right along during the summer.
Conventions, study groups, and hordes of sightseers converged on the campus in a steady stream that kept the summer session from being anything like a dull routine.
After the end of the spring semester but before summer courses got under way, Notre Dame awarded diplomas to nearly 900 seniors at the University’s 103rd commencement. More than 6,000 persons attended the exercises, at which Paul G. Hoffman, Administrator of the Economic Cooperation Administration delivered the principal address.
In his speech, Mr. Hoffman declared that Stalin will not dare plunge the world into war “if the free nations stand together and are prepared militarily to meet aggression.” He called on Americans to “share our freedom and abundance” with Western Europe in order to save mankind from “a world of misery and slavery.”
During the summer, the first group of students enrolled in graduate courses in Correctional Administration began periods of six-month interneship in various state and federal agencies, including the Federal Board of Prisons and the New York State Board of Parole. Upon satisfactory completion of their interneship, the students will receive degrees of Master in Science.
More than 300 nuns, representing 80 religious communities, attended the annual Sisters’ Vocational Institute at the University on July 23, 24 and 25. The Most Rev. Thomas J. McDonnell, Auxiliary Bishop of New York and National Director of the Society for the Propagation of Faith, and the Most Rev. Floyd L. Begin, Auxiliary Bishop of Cleveland, Ohio, were the principal speakers at the meetings.
A special Catholic Action Institute was held here on July 16, 17 and 18. At a series of conferences and panel discussions, those attending considered several unique methods of fostering Catholic Action among students. The Rev. Louis J. Putz, C.S.C., presided over the sessions. Rev. Charles E. Sheedy,
Sept. 24, 1948
C.S.C., was a prominent speaker at the Institute; and Frank Gwynn, a ND student from La Plata, Md., presided over a special Student Leadership panel.
Latest techniques in the field of advertising were studied by more than 100 representatives of advertising firms from all parts of the United States at a special Outdoor Advertising School held on the ND campus early in July. Dean James E. McCarthy, of the College of Commerce, directed the school. With executives, plant operators, and specialists of all types in the field of outdoor advertising acting as instructors during the two and a half week course, the school covered 75 widely-varied advertising subjects.
Two hundred sixty-three undergraduate students received degrees at the 1948 summer school convocation, held in the Drill Hall August 13. Dr. Lawrence H. Baldinger, Dean of the College of Science, gave the convention address; and the Rev. Hobert H. Sweeney, C.S.C., delivered the Baccalaureate Sermon.
Notre Dame Greet* Our Lady of Fatima
Enrolled in the eight-week summer session were 1237 undergraduates and 585 in the Graduate School, including 221 Sisters and 79 priests from all parts of the United States.
More than 10.000 persons prayed for the conversion of Russia, as promised by the Blessed Mother in 1917, when the American replica of the famed statue of Our Lady of Fatima was displayed at Notre Dame during August. Special daily services were conducted in Sacred Heart Church, where the statue could be viewed by the faithful.
Highlight of summer activity on the campus was the 13th National Convention of the Catholic Students’ Mission Crusade, which took place here from August 26 to 29.
Student delegates, 3600 in number, representing organizations totaling 850,000 in membership took part in the conclave, first of its kind since 1941. Ranging from primary grade students to collegians, the students adopted five baric resolutions, urging support of the missions, propagation of the Catholic Faith, spread of Catholic .Action, and a renewal of the principles of social justice.
The conference-also pledged 3,000,000 Catholic students to observe a Day of Prayer on Sunday, October 3, the “Chinese Fourth of July,” for the welfare of the Chinese people and the success of the Catholic missions in China.

“Into the valley of the mystery ball, into the jaws of the pink slips, rode the 1200."
Like Tennyson's famous band, the 1948 Notre Dame freshmen class thundered on to the campus last week right into the concentrated cross-fire of a new, high voltage T CS-Blue Circle orientation program. But whereas Alfred Lord’s cavalrymen were riding to the attack, the class of 1952 were caught in an ambush. They could hardly have expected what they got. And what they got was something refreshingly new to the Notre Dame scene.
Sleepy-eyed and grimy, the eager newcomers descended from every conveyance known to modern man. Not knowing just what to expect, they were met with service that would equal that of the world’s most adroit doormen. The wel-comers were a voluntary group of YCS and Blue Circle members who abounded with bustling friendship and super efficiency.
One frosh, rendering his initial impression came out with: “I was impressed with the hugeness of Notre Dame.” This' impression of hugeness was soon translated for the freshman into one of confusion as he hit the campus. Where was B.P.? Which way to Farley? Once more the orientation committee saved the day. Two information stands, one at the Circle and the other between B.P. and Farley soon had all the fledglings in the right halls. The service went even further. Two committeemen were stationed on each floor of the halls to help in explaining the mystifying registration procedure and answered questions ranging from “Are there any good looking girls at St. Mary’s?” to “How often do you see Frank Leahy?” and “Why do all ’the upper-classmen seem so happy?”
Then there were the parents. Some proved more of a problem than their “mother-today-I-am - a - man” offspring. They wanted to know how Junior could . take a bath and was the food nutritious and why can’t Edward take thos.e::-Ad-vanced English courses right off the~.bat seeing as he got the English,, medal-an high school. To satisfy their curiosity;< about their son’s new home, many "of/ them tramped around the grounds on the committee-conducted tours.	.
The first complaints (and, in most casts, the last) came when the frosh were ushered into their rooms. Having been so long subject to civilization the lack of closets and the famed Notre Dame water were hard..to take. Len Simons of 341 B.P. and formerly of Minneapolis came up' with the comment": of the week. “The water,” said Len, “is a diabolical plot to ruin the laxative. business in South Bend.” The frequent
14
wail, “There’s not enough locker space,” echoed through the frosh halls, but the newcomers were consoled with tales of of the gold coast and Walsh.
Cook and his travel agencies could have made a financial killing with the jammed campus tours on the first afternoon. They looked like family picnics with everyone traipsing behind the guides, from toddling babies to white-haired grandmas. The tours were enough to convince the plebes of the vastness of the campus. Many were ready to take the next train home when they came puffing back from the far reaches of the Rock. Jim Bunsen’s remark, “I wish they would move that Social Science building closer to the Biology building,” typified many similar hopes. The tours, which were run all that afternoon were greatly appreciated. George Gross expressed it well when he said, “Having the tours was very helpful. Without them we might have found

ourselves in the middle of the stadium hunting for a history class.”
The huge class became acquainted with Washington Hall that evening when they were officially greeted by Bev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., president of the University, and Dean Lawrence Baldinger of the College of Science. The traditional Knute Rockne film was shown following the speeches and many were heard whistling, humming and even singing the strains of the Victory March as they wended their way out of the campus antique.
With barely a chance to breathe, the now slightly less eager freshmen were ushered into the engineering auditorium on Tuesday for the comparatively new aptitude tests. Full houses turned out for the two programs of student orientation talks that evening. Among the speakers were Bob Reynolds, Pat Costello, Bob Uhl and Kevin O’Shea.
Four-hour tours were offered on Wed
nesday morning. The hall groups were corralled through the engineering building, the science museum, the biology building, the main building, the church and the library. The LOBUND tour was particularly well handled and received the most favorable reactions.
Father Sweeney, who conducted the tcurs through the main building, summed up the sight-seeing trips when he had a group up in the highest environs under the dome. “The reason why I brought you all up here was not so much because I wanted to show you the exhibits, but because I knew you would never come back again during your four years at Notre Dame.”
The climax of the whole program came Wednesday night. It was then that the frosh took over the Field House for their all-out “mixer.” That the ancient structure survived the pandemonium that reigned that night is a tribute to engineers of another era. But amid all the noise and speeches and music there was born a spirit of comradeship within this new class itself. The freshmen who for days had been meeting everything and everybody connected with the University, finally met each other. It was a happy occasion.
After having squeezed themselves into the permanent stands on each side of the basketball court, the guests of honor settled down to listen to a program of speeches and entertainment officiated
The Scholastic
over by master of ceremonies Marty Galvin. John Broderick, K. C. vaudeville winner of last year, gave out with “When Irish Eyes Are Smiling” and “Stout Hearted Men”; Chuck Perrin, Vetville’s Bob Hope, went thiough his highly successful impersonation routine; Bob Azar did the same and Frank Ven-ner resurrected the Four Horsemen a la Grantland Rice.
A group of speeches by representatives of various campus organizations followed. Tom Dore spoke briefly on behalf of the Monogram Club, John Frampton represented the football squad and Kevin O’Shea and Leo Barnhorst spoke for the hoopsters. Jim Mar-heine, ND cheerleader, prepped the new class for the Purdue game by going through a few cheers with them. In return Jim Hamby, a newcomer from St. Eds expressed the appreciaticn of the freshman class for the entire orientation set-up.
Comments on this little show varied but were rather consistent in their praise. There was much fault found with the P.A. system which was traditionally defective. Many were impressed by the athletes’ speeches. O’Shea’s was rated at the top because “it was the shortest.” Don Strasser, former Leo (Chicago) H. S. gridder, was sold by Tom Dore “Any time you walk by just say hello; you’ll always get an answer.” One of the more realistic frosh exclaimed: “I liked the idea of plenty of food and cokes at the mixer.” Tom Kleet, a Wilkes-Barre, Pa., immigrant, liked “the mixer where the boys got the chance to meet guys from their home state. There were some guys I was told to look up but didn’t get the opportunity until the mixer.” A mild complaint came from Bob Schampiei' of Zahm Hall and the Bronx. “I think more of the fellows would have liked to have seen more of the football team.”
But with or without Leahy’s lads the mixer developed into the social success of the young season when the cokes and doughnuts were handed out and the mob scene started breaking up into state segments. Somehow a couple of rival staters started playing a game with the state banners, trying to lift them higher than their neighbors. The end result was the case of a daring young New Yorker up on the high ceiling girders triumphantly flaunting the NY sign down on the rest of the crowd. That, it would seem, was the high point of the whole evening.
It was all over at 11. The frosh went back to their halls. The YCS and Blue Circle men started cleaning up. A little while later the lights went out. The chiming of the midnight bells from 16
Sacred Heart tolled the end of the freshman orientation program.
But because it had been a great success, because a handful of Notre Dame men had worked hard at introducing their school to its new students, because of the tours and the speeches and the cokes the program wasn’t really over. It’s going on as you read this and will keep on going until every one of the men who benefitted from it has graduated. Because Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of last week 1200 high school graduates had become Notre Dame men in a manner that they will never forget. The new relatives had been royally received into the “Notre Dame family.”

New Faces, Old Jobs Keep Students Alert
Students arriving back for the fall grind found that Notre Dame had undergone a few changes. Of course everyone saw that the Dome was at last taking on a new look, but even the faces behind some of the desks were changed.
Biggest change in the minds of most students was the abolishment of the office of Prefect of Discipline. At the present time, Rev. Joseph A. Kehoe, C.S.C., heads the office of the Director of Student Welfare. He is assisted by Rev. Joseph D. Barry, C.S.C., who had been director of student activities last year.
Rev. Matthew A. Coyle, C.S.C., professor of English took up his new duties as assistant chaplain at St. Mary’s.
Students assigned to Alumni Hall found that this hall had a new rector for the first time since 1935, when Rev. Chas. Carey, C.S.C., replaced Rev. Henry Gleuckert. Rev. Charles Sheedy, C S.C., took over in Dillon Hall to complete the changes on the Gold Coast. Other new rectors were Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, C.S.C., in Farley Hall; Rev. John C. Burke, C.S.C., in St. Edward’s Hall, and Rev. Joseph Cavanaugh in Lyons Hall.

Band Opens Season With 'Musical Murals'
As unfailingly as it brings falling leaves, Autumn, at least on the east side of the campus of a certain university in Northern Indiana, is sure to bring the familiar sound of a band feverishly practising for the first football game of the season. And this Autumn, as the residents of Cavanaugh and their eastern neighbors will testify, is no exception. H. Lee Hope, director of the Notre Dame Band, called the first two-hour practice session of the year almost before the mountains of steamer and wardrobe trunks had begun to diminish in front of the halls. At four o’clock last Monday afternoon, the 1948 Marching Band invaded Cartier field for their first crack at the open air.
This year’s marching band is composed of 110 men and will play at all the home games as well as traveling to Baltimore for the Navy fray. Hope revealed his plan for what are to be termed “Musical Murals,” the programs he has worked out for each game. Every program will have a different theme; the theme for the Purdue game being a ‘Back to School’ theme.
Another new project for the year is a 50 piece band, to be mado up entirely of freshmen. Hope was high in his praise of this year’s frosh talent and revealed that this band, which is to be a separate unit from the ‘regular’ band, will play at all the pre-game pep rallys.
Although it is still too early to give any definite information, Hope did say that steps are being taken to continue the policy of a band trip in the spring which was renewed so successfully last year.
Watch Out! Traffic Snarl May Get You! Authorities Plan For All Hoosier Crowd
Saturday night may be the loneliest night in the week for many a good football fan if he plans on doing a lot of downtown driving tomorrow evening.
Notre Dame and South Bend authorities predict the largest flow of cars in history to jam traffic in all directions before and after tomorrow’s grid classic. Police, school officials, stadium workers, groundskeepers, and janitors are making preparations to handle another of the large crowds so familiar to the Notre Dame campus.
Special trains, buses, and airplanes will join with the automobiles to bring this largest Hoosier crowd to the Stadium. The Northern Indiana Transit Co. will load buses for two hours prior
IN MEMORIAM
Notre Dame was saddened this week by the death of a recent graduate, Edward James Le Couteur, of Vetville, who died Sunday in the Veterans Hospital, at Hines, Illinois.
Funeral services were held in Sacred Heart Church yesterday morning, the Rev. Thomas Brennan, C.S.C., offering the requiem Mass.
Le Couteur, suffered from war injuries received in the crash of an A-26 bomber. He entered the University after his discharge in 1944 and graduated at the summer school exercises on August 13.
to the game on the east side of Michigan street from Colfax to LaSalle avenue. Buses will re-load at the special turnstile near the Stadium. Bus authorities say they can empty- the ,stadium in 30 minutes, but don’t count on catching a fast coke in any downtown spot for a good hour after the game.
Rev. Joseph A. Kehoe, C.S.C., and Rev. Joseph D. Barry, C.S.C., of the new office of student welfare met with police and county officials to plot the strategy in shuttling cars in and out of Notre Dame’s five huge parking lots. At the same time, Herb Jones, business manager of the athletic department, announced that parking fees would be upped to 50 cents this year to take care of increased costs.
Pete Redden, familiar to many Notre Dame men as the operator of many special football trips, will again manage the parking lot concession. State troopers from the northern half of Indiana will assist South Bend police in the handling of the crowd.
Special restrooms, cafeteria accommodations, and telephone booths will try to keep things moving swiftly on the campus. There will be a special faculty buffet luncheon before the game in the upper dining hall.
. “Pop,” dining hall brass polisher, will be at his usual station shining brass at the dining hall entrance. When asked for a comment, Pop said, “Hope it don’t rain. Brass won’t shine very good in this damp weather.” Pop went on to predict another Notre Dame victory, but only by “two or three points.”

Draft-Proof Students Sail the Pacific
By LAWRENCE CONNOR
This summer when most Notre Dame studen.s were attending summer school classes or working themselves or their families for subsistence, some eighty-three fellow pencil pushers traveled to the west coast. These fellows joined approximately 2900 other young men, from half a hundred colleges, for the annual two month Navy reserve cruise.
It’s hard to predict how many of the 83 from Notre Dame will go for a lifetime of salt water service, but one thing is sure: If the Navy manages to make life as interesting as they did on the summer cruise, they’ll likely bolster their ranks considerably. Beach parties, dances, cocktail parties, airplane flights and guided tours were the orders of the day. It just happened that the Navy had some help in this entertainment line from a few Notre Dame alumni clubs, but they just added more sugar to the syrup.
The Sophomore cruise hit a few more ports than did the Juniors. After leaving San Francisco they went on to Seattle. Some of the fellows are still hearing from the people there. Most of the contacts were arranged at a dance given there by the Alumni club. In the course of the cruise, the Middies took in Long Beach. A liberty there meant Los Angeles and Hollywood, and all the sights therein.
Most of the boys thought Hawaii the best spot in the voyage. Besides running into Johnny Lujack (on his honeymoon)
18
at the Royal-Hawaiian Hotel, the sailors were feted with an Oriental dinner. Lincoln Yamamoto, a transfer' student from the University of Hawaii and now of St. Ed’s, helped his father arrange the dinner. Sitting barefooted at a foot-high table, the boys labored with chopsticks and bamboo stalks. They had an option on beverages: soda, pineapple juice or beer. There are no reports on the gourmets who had to try all three.
The itinerary of the Junior cruise runs parallel to their Sophomore mates. The U.S.S. Boxer, part of Task Force 38, left Alameda. Calif., immediately for Hawaii. Father Hesburgh (new rector of Farley hall) was instrumental in lining up entertainment for the boys. Frequently he wired Alumni heads to have parties arranged when the Middies docked.
When the cruise moved into Long Beach, the Irish moved on to Los Angeles. Vern Rickard, of the Notre Dame Alumni club there, had seven cars available for a tour through Los Angeles arid Hollywood. One of the stops was a broadcast of Pat O’Brien’s show at the NBC studio. “The poor man’s Knuts Rockne” (self-styled nickname) and Virginia Bruce obliged the boys with pictures and hospitality.	.
Commander Bernard F. McMahon, commandant of the Middie school at Notre Dame, must have been proud of his charges. Throughout the cruise he was stationed on a sister ship, the U.S.S.
Iowa — a battleship. One of his men, Tom Carroll, last year’s freshman class president, helped the Astoria to win the unit baseball championship. Playing second base, he hit .350 for the series. Tom wasn’t the only active Irishman cn board; Dave Smith led the midshipmen’s band aboard the Astoria. The one ship paper put out by the Middies had five local boys lending a hand: Jim Hartman, Andy Walsh, Ted Prahinski, Nelson Lowe and Dick Hurrle.
Somewhere in the Pacific Midshipman John J. Donahoe, Jr., made news. While acting as Junior Officer-of-the-Deck aboard the Segundo, one of the submarines that the Middies did practice duty on, he sighted distress flares. A followup by the sub and a Navy patrol vessel disclosed a fishing boat about to submerge. A bucket brigade and pumps righted the boat. For all Donahoe knows, it’s still out there dragging in sardines.
About the time Thanksgiving rolls around, the fellows will pick up their Aloha shirts, the most popular souvenir on the Islands, and look back on the summer cruise. They’ll remember the girls in Seattle and Honolulu, the good food on and off the ship, the parties and the tours. Classroom work will be getting tougher by then, and the boys will start thinking. By the time they get into the second semester, they’ll begin to wonder where next summer’s cruise will take them.	. .

Irish and Purdue Battle Before 59,000
By HARRY MONAHAN
Noti'e Dame Stadium will be converted into a gridiron laboratory tomorrow afternoon with Doctors Leahy and Holcomb presiding. Over 59,000 “students” will witness the interesting physics demonstration when the irresistible Purdue Boilermakers meet the immovable Fighting Irish. Two titlebound squads will be unveiled as Purdue warms up before striking out for the Big Nine crown and Notre Dame opens its defense of the national title.
Holcomb is a man with a problem. It may take every trick in the Purdue repertoire to stop the Irish tomorrow. But this game has no bearing on the Big Nine championship which he wants. To use all the tricks now will be to expose them to Northwestern and defending conference champ Michigan whom he must meet on the next two Saturdays. Neither of these foes is expected to be easy and will also require clever strategy if Purdue is to down them. The Monday morning quarterbacks will have the answer — the day after the Purdue-Michigan game. All of which doesn’t help Holcomb in tomorrow’s contest.
A hard fighting Purdue forward wall will be led by Captain Phil O’Reilly, a

The 6’2”, 210-pound lineman from Chicago has been one of the chief reasons why the Purdue bandwagon has been rolling so merrily through the pre-season grid picture. He will be playing in just the right spot to cause the Irish a lot of trouble in the local drought of good tackle material. Letterman Pete Barbolak will probably
hold down the other tackle slot to give the Boilermakers veteran performance there.
On the flanks South Bend’s Bob Heck will prove to be another stubborn defensive man. Pass-snagging Clyde Grimenstein will be on the other side to add to the Purdue menace. Untried replacements in the end position might prove to be Purdue’s weak spot. The fight has been hot for the guard slots with lettermen Abraham Gibron, Thomas Hard, William Horvath and Earl Murray competing with several good sophomore candidates. It all spells trouble for Irish backs trying to take the mail down the center. Centers Angelo Carnaghi and Bill Sprang have had converted quarterback Bill Deem added to the contenders for the starting call there.
"Bullet Bob" to Pass
Should the line play prove to be too equal, both elevens can be counted on to open up with the aerial warfare. In “Bullet Bob” DeMoss, the Boilermakers have an ace signal caller with a passing average to be respected. He finished last season with a .420 average and 509 yards gained for his passing effosts.

dispel any chance of weakness in the key backfield spot.
Purdue will bring its own version of the Irish jackrabbit Coy McGee when it unleashes speedster Harry Szulborski. This leading Boilermaker ground gainer will be teamed with number two rushing ace and last year’s backfield workhorse Norbert Adams. A stable of sophomore speedsters will augment this breakaway duo. The fullback slot is another spot weak as far as untried reserves are concerned. Just how effective Coach Holcomb’s remedy will be remains to be seen.
Irish Knees Weak
The questions concerning the legs of Terry Brennan and Ernie Zalejski will be answered at game time tomorrow. Fullback John Panelli and right halfback Emil Sitko have joined the ques-

tionable starters due to knee injuries. A strong fullback replacement is available in Mike Swistowicz, but diminutive Coy McGee is strictly for spot assignments at left halfback. Bill Gay and Jack Landry could be the answer to the portside halfback problem. Larry Coutre will not give Coach Leahy any worries concerning the right halfback slot.
Frank Tripucka will get his first starting assignment for the Irish tomorrow and can be counted on to give Purdue’s DeMoss a struggle for passing honors. Frank’s aerials have been hitting Leon Hart and Jim Martin with more than creditable accuracy during fall drills. Sophomore Bob Williams may see some action, but only if Purdue proves to be weaker than expected.
Tackle Spots Troublesome
As if the halfback ■ problem was not enough, Coach Leahy and his assistants are still trying to solve the line weakness at tackle. Ralph McGehee and Jack Fallon will probably get the starting call and they will have their work cut out for them against O’Reilly and Barbolak. Gus Cifelli and Frank Gaul will be backing up this critical spot.
The remainder of the line should give the Irish headman something to smile about. With Leon Hart and Jim Martin on the flanks the Irish will have a pair of defensive as well as offensive assets. The Irish Brick Wall trio will be plugging up the center alley. Capt. Bill Fischer will be 226 pounds of trouble for the Boilermakers. Bill is headed for more All-American honors this year and he will get the campaign off to a good start. Marty Wendell and Will Walsh will be knocking down the value of Purdue stock either in the line or as linebackers.
Irish Hold Series Edge
Tomorrow’s game will be the fOth in the Purdue-Notre Dame series. The Irish hold a lopsided edge over their downstate rivals, having won 13 while dropping only four, with two ties recorded in the series. The last time Purcue opened their season in the Notre Dame Stadium was in 1939 and the Irish edged them in a 3-0 thriller.
Fans! Here's a Little Tip! Why Not Take the Pitt Trip?
First of the away football games will find the Irish at Pittsburgh and arrangements have been made so that a number of interested students may attend.
Al Lesko of 269 Dillon Hall has arranged bus transportation (one bus) leaving the circle at 12:30, Friday, Oct. 1 and returning Sunday. The price including ticket to the game and round trip bus fare will be only $17.25.
Those interested should contact Al Lesko as soon as possible.
FROSH FLEET-FEETSTERS TO MEET
All freshmen distance runners who are interested in fall track preparation are asked to meet with Coach "Doc" Handy in the Field House Tuesday. Oct. 5, at 3 p. m. Coach Handy, will outline workout schedules, and discuss plans for the track season. He will be assisted by Bill McCarthy, senior manager of track.
Seatback Sheridan Back to Tutor Frosh
Benny Sheridan, one of the greatest breakaway backs in Notre Dame history, returned here last week as the new head freshman football coach. He will be assisted by Notre Dame students Bill Vangen and Dick Friend.
Sheridan played left half for the Irish in 1937-38-39. A few years hack Coach Frank Leahy called Benny one of the three greatest running hacks he had ever seen. One of his best games was his last; that day, against a strong Southern California team, Benny sped 60 yards for a touchdown and completed all four of his passes.
John Adams High School hired Sheridan as head grid coach upon his graduation in 1940. When the war broke out, Ben went to Fort Riley where he coached and starred for the cavalrymen. After combat service in Europe, Sheridan became secretary to athletic director Ed McKeever and later was business manager for the South Bend Blue Sox. In 1946, he appeared with the Old Timer squad in the annual spring game.
The new coach comes from Havana, Illinois, where he earned 12 letters in four sports. He graduated from ND with honors as a physical education major.
Bill Vangen enrolled here in 1941, but had his studies interrupted by 52 months of submarine duty. He was a strong candidate for the varsity center assignment in 1946, but was sidelined due to injuries. Vangen acted as head Frosh coach last year. Dick Friend was kept out of varsity action by a knee injury. Four years with the Coast Guard sidelined his Notre Dame education. He served as football, basketball and baseball coach at South Bend Catholic High School in 1947 and 1948.—Ralph Wright

Irish-PurdueGame to Have Crowded Network Coverage
Even the radio channels pouring out of Notre Dame Stadium tomorrow will be crowded. The Irish Press Box will bulge with personnel handling the largest number of individual broadcasts ever to originate from there. Fourteen stations, two networks, and one television show will cover the Boilermaker contest. Last year’s Army game still holds the record for the largest number of station outlets due to more extensive netwoi'k coverage.
Sportscasters Harry Wismer and Bill Stern will handle the network microphones for ABC and NBC respectively. The television coverage of the Irish home games which was initiated last year will be continued through Chicago’s WBKB. Other Windy City stations on the scene will be WJD, WBBM and WGN.
Hoosier interest in this contest will rival the usual basketball madness. Joe Boland will describe the play for South Bend’s WSBT. His broadcast will be relayed through three other stations. WJVA will also be on hand for the local listeners. WIRE and WIBC will beam the game to Indianapolis while Fort Wayne will receive it through WOWO and WKJG.
Out of state stations moving into South Bend for tomorrow’s game will include WJW of Cleveland and WSD of St. Louis. KPOA and KULA of Honolulu have made arrangements to secure rebroadcast coverage on the game.

CARTIER FIELD KIBITZERS Over the fence
SPLINTERS from the Press Box By Harry Monahan
New Management
As soon as we received the keys to the press box from our old boss, Pete Brown, we rushed over- to inspect our home for the coming year. Such an inspection always uncovers items left behind by former residents. The old P-B is no exception. We hope that the battered Underwood will hold up another season although it was called on for some heavy duty last year when Jim Butz was covering this beat.
We note in the corner a well worn set of files marked “Snide Remarks About B. Stern and J. Costin.” Obviously left here by Joe Cheney — or maybe Joe Wilcox. Maybe we can find something there for some Pacific Coast writers who have been sniping at the Irish all summer; but more of that later. The traffic through here tomorrow will be terrific, so let’s get a few things out of the way.
Third National Championship?
It is hard to deny the cold facts. As Pic put it, “The weakest thing about Notre Dame remains its schedule.” The Irish can blast their way through another undefeated season and still not capture the national crown. If S.M.U. and North Carolina can down all their rugged southern opponents, Coach Leahy’s lads could come in a faltering third. Sportswriters are a peculiar breed and the mathematical gymnastics they go through to pick a national champ could well leave the Irish “without the gates.”
The one consolation in this dilemma is that the odds against the Mustangs and Tarheels completing undefeated seasons are long. Not because they are weak, but because their opponents are top flight. This is the key to the Irish handicap. Purdue is the only opponent rated high enough to be a test for that crown. True, Northwestern will be tough and Southern California could be the sleeper to trim the Irish. But in pre-season observations the other seven look like sitting ducks for Moose Fischer and Co.
It would be a waste of time to make a prediction on the 1948 National Champion. Besides, it’s been done. We will, however, make this prediction regarding the Irish stake in the ’48 crown. If Purdue rolls over and plays dead tomor
row, Coach Leahy can chalk up another undefeated season. Then S.M.U. and North Carolina can start worrying about their chances. If the Boilermakers should pull the string on the Irish victory parade, Notre Dame will finish with an 8-2 record.
Why the other loss? If Purdue can do it, then one of the two or three ques-
Kunkle QUARTERBACK TRIPUCKA
Tomorrow will tell
tionable teams could very well repeat the performance.
Man on the Spot
Perhaps a bigger question mark is the fellow who will start at the quarterback spot tomorrow afternoon. We don’t envy Frank Tripucka. Trip goes on the scales to try to balance the record set by “the Luj.” Good or bad, the judgment will be unfair. Because, hero .or heel tomorrow, he will still be working in Johnny’s shadow. Frank’s performance in the Navy game last year forced many to revise their estimates of John' ny’s understudy. We think that after tomorrow more revision will be necessary. Again, upward. But it’s a strain we wouldn’t want to have on us in any game, let alone against the Boilermakers. Prediction of the Week
We’ve waded through the Purdue enthusiasm and Irish tears, but it still looks like the Irish by one touchdown.

Failure of Boryla to Return Is Jolting Blow; Far Western Trip Helps Cheer Basketeers
San Francisco will be the scene of a donnybrook to end them all when the Galloping Gaels of St. Mary’s College tangle with the Fighting Irish quintet on January 3. This year’s western cage trip will include a swing down into the Southwest to test the strength of the Mustangs of Southern Methodist University. Almost simultaneously with this announcement, Irish basketball hopes received a set back when Vince Boryla, former Notre Dame sharpshooter and 1948 Olympic participant on the cham-

pionship U. S. quintet, entered the University of Denver. It had been expected that he would re-enter Notre Dame when discharged from the Army.
The local eagers will start their western tour in the Butler Field House, Indianapolis, on December 27 when they meet the Purdue Boilermakers in a twin bill with Butler and Indiana. On December 28, Indiana will scrap with the Irish while Purdue takes on Butler.
The touring quintet will move into Dallas, Texas, on December 30 for the tilt with S.M.U. This contact with the Southwestern Conference probably is the first move towards closer athletic relationship between Notre Dame and the conference. Director of Athletics Frank Leahy, hinted last spring that some consideration was being given to establishing football relations with the conference. This December tilt could be a dress rehearsal for a full scale Irish invasion of Texas in the near future.
The road trip will end in the Golden Gate City on January 3 with Kevin O’Shea playing his first collegiate game for the hometown folks. While this part of the schedule is definite, the remainder of the Notre Dame basketball program
has not received final approval from the athletic control board.
Boryla’s sudden registration at ’ the University of Denver will force Coach Ed Krause to revamp some of the plans he had made for this year’s quintet. Krause was counting on Boryla to add some height to the squad and give the Irish a better balanced attack than they displayed last season.
As a freshman, during the ’44-’45 season, he broke the individual season point record with a sizzling 321, better than 30 points over the previous record held by Johnny Moir. In the same year he set a new Field House record for individual scoring in one game with 31 points which still stands. His first year for the Blue and Gold was climaxed when he was elected honorary captain for the season.
Boryla came back strong in his sophomore year to score a season total of 320 points. But his new record fell under the bombardment of Leo Klier, who looped in 355 points. Vince won a berth on this year’s Olympic quintet which captured the international cage crown.
Chapter Two of the Boryla episode will be written on January 22 when the University of Denver moves in to the Field House to challenge the Irish cage squad. Just what kind of a welcome Ex-Irish-man Boryla will get is being carefully planned by Coach Krause and his cage strategy board.

University Run Faces Harriers Next Week
Sunday morning, October 3, the annual University Cross Country Eun, one of Notre Dame’s oldest athletic events, will be held over a three-mile campus course. The contest, which begins at 11 a. m. from the junction of roads between the lakes near the Grotto, is open to all students, and Coach “Doc” Handy will choose his varsity cross country squad from among the winners.
Jim Murphy, last year’s champion, will again lead the list of competitors. The other scorers in last season’s run will take part again this year, thus insuring one of the best contests in years. All of the winners of last year went on ’ to score consistently as members of the greatest harrier squad in Irish history. Corny Styers, who was second last year, Bill Leonard and Jim Kelly who tied for third, and Jim Kittell who took fifth, have all indicated that they will compete.
Three outstanding freshmen distance runners of last year- are expected to provide rough competition for the men from last season’s varsity harrier group. They are Vai Muscato, rated one of the most promising middle distance runners in the midwest, Tony DaDamio, a top miler, and Lou Lepry who showed well in the frosh run last fall. Others who will feature in the tortuous grind are Tom Maguire and Lou Tracy.
A special feature of the distance battle will be the arrangement enabling the spectators to see the finish of the first, second and final miles from a point near the Grotto.
Titles Roll In as Trackmen End Cinder Season in Glory
The Irish tracksters who have the longest and most difficult season of any group at Notre Dame, amassed a spectacular array of honors after the dossing of school last summer. First, they captured the Indiana State Track crown from a determined Hoosier group at Bloomington. The spikesters of Purdue also made the battle and the final victory more impressive. The local cinder kickers scored the largest number of points ever recorded in achieving their victory.
A week later, the squad coached by “Doc” Handy traveled to Indianapolis without special advance preparation and blazed their way to the Indiana A.A.U. track title, again rolling up the highest total of points in the record. Participation in this contest was not scheduled, and the final decision to compete came at such a late date, that several events had to be delayed so the Irish runners could engage.
Then early in June, the thin clads who dropped three close dual battles during the season to Missouri, Penn State and Michigan State traveled to Milwaukee to take part in the Central Collegiate track meet. Several members of the team did not make the trip as school was over, and it was believed that the strong Big Nine competitors would make a victory difficult. The weakened group performed in championship form and rolled up 43% points to take second place behind a full strength Illinois squad.
Preparation for the Olympic trials followed, and in the special A.A.U. trials in Milwaukee late in June, four members • of the Irish team proved their skill and determination by qualifying for the fin?l

All of the men showed well in the final battles with the greatest trackmen in the United States, but failed to score in the first three places necessary for an Olympic berth. Fleming was prevented especially, because of the fact that he had a broken bone in his foot.

Charity Covereth a Multitude of Woes; N.D., Army, Michigan Join Against Pros
Charity accomplished this fall what many an eager promoter tried to do last fall; to get Notre Dame and Michigan into the same stadium. It still did not settle .the National Championship debate because the Irish and the Wolverines were teammates, not opponents. Charity also teamed the West Point halfback who was the scourge of the Irish for three seasons with his former Notre Dame foes when Lt. Glenn Davis, U. S. A., joined the Los Angeles Rams for an exhibition tilt with the Washington Redskins.
When the scoreboards were checked, however, it was obvious that the Irish and their new-found friends didn’t click the way pre-game publicity had predicted.
The Chicago Tribune's Fifteenth Annual All-Star Game was the occasion for the Michigan-Notre Dame picnic, but the only ones who came away well-fed were the birds, the Cardinals that is. Johnny Lu jack and 13 other members of Frank Leahy’s 1947- traveling campany, plus the head man himself, made the trip to the Windy City on August 20. But the much publicized double offensive weapon of the college stars could not match Cardinal Coach Jimmy Conzelman’s strategy and the pitching arm of Paul Christman. The only consolation to Irish rooters in the 28-0 shutout was the fact that ExIrish back Elmer Angsman scored the Chicagoans’ first touchdown. Bob Dove, Corwin Clatt and Bob Hanlon were other Notre Dame men used in the victors’ attack.
The 33-28 scrimmage victory of the collegiate T-formation squad at the expense of their single-wing team mates added some fuel to the Michigan-Notre Dame feud. But the margin wasn’t big enough to quiet Wolverine defenders.
Sportswriters covering the game were also able to whip up froth on another hotly debated subject—Who was the top college back of 1947? The performances of Johnny Lu jack, Bobby Layne, Bob Chappius and Chuck Conerly were given close scrutiny. The mediocre brand of ball displayed by the college squad prevented a decision however.
In addition to Lujack the following Notre Dame men played for the AllStars: Art Statuto, George Strohmeyer, Floyd Simmons, Bill Gompers, Ziggy Czarobski, George Connor, Joe Signaigo, Bucky and Zeke O’Connor and Gaspar Urban. Pete Ashbaugh and Bob Livings-stone also reported to the squad but could not play because of injuries.
Some 80,000 people fitted comfortably into the Los Angeles Coliseum on Sep-
tember 2, to see another Irish foe join with former wearers of the green. The Los Angeles Times, sponsor of this four year old West Coast rival to Arch Ward’s pet project, were responsible for placing Glenn Davis in such strange company. Teamed with Gerry Cowhig, Jack Zilly, Jim Mello, Bucky O’Connor and Steve Bagarus, he tried to help the Rams solve the problem of George Marshall’s meal ticket, Slingin’ Sammy ' Baugh.
But Mr. Outside spent most of the evening on his backside as the wily Redskins kept the Army speedster bottled up while stacking up a 21-10 victory. While working out with the Rams, Davis broke the world’s record for the 100 yard dash in football euipment formerly held by Willie Steele, San Diego State halfback and 1948 Olympic broad jump champion. Glenn covered the century in 10.8 seconds.
Cowhig, Zilly and Mello drew defensive assignments for the Rams and were unable to help Davis on the few occasions he carried the ball. Injuries sidelined O’Connor and Bagarus. Davis netted exactly one yard from scrimmage for his

night’s work as the Ram line was unable to open up the stubborn Redskin forwards. Redskin rookie Dan Sandifen of L.S.U., fresh from playing right halfback on Leahy’s T-squad at Chicago, added to Davis’ woes when he returned one of Bob Waterfield’s punts 84 yards to score. The last man he trampled into the turf before going over was Davis.

Ticket Sales Break All Former Records
The shattering noises coming fiom Breen-Philips Hall are not evidence of Frosh exuberance, but more broken records being swept out of the Athletic Office. Business manager Herb Jones and ticket manager Bob Cahill are at it again. Both had counted on a breather this season when the Army series was dropped, and then came Purdue.
Notre Dame ticket sales started setting new marks as far back as August 4. On that date the Purdue and Northwestern games clocked record sell-out time; all available public sale tickets for these games were exhausted in four days. The last two Army games cannot be considered in this record as there was no public sale for either.
Cahill thought he had squeezed every possible spectator into the Notre Dame Stadium for last year’s Army game. Tomorrow’s Boilermaker clash, however, will top the 59.171 attendance mark of the Cadet classic. Field bleachers have been erected to accommodate the extra ducat holders.
Wh’le other records were falling the season ticket sales also hit a new high with 12.000 applications being received. An attempt was made to alleviate the strain on available tickets by cutting the guaranteed alumni allotment in half. This nlan failed as the number of alumni eligible for 1948 tickets is double last year’s figure.
Tickets still remain fox- the Michigan State game on October 9 and the Washington game on November 27. Notre Dame’s quota for all away games is practically depleted, with the Navy and Nebraska contests being the first to go.
The new student athletic card is to be used for all snorting events on the home schedule during the 1948-49 school year. After the close of the foo+ball season the insert indicating the holder’s Stadium seat number can be removed. Student admittance to ba°kctball, baseball, track and other varsity shorts will he on presentation of ID c^rd and holder. The numbers bordering the holder replace the tickets issued in hook foi*m in previous years.

$15,000 Gold Regild Tops Summer Jobs
By JOE DUKERT
Notre Dame men returning to the campus this year stared unbelievingly, blinked and stared again. The famed Golden Dome on the Main Building was wearing a new brand of makeup—a dull coat of yellow paint.
University officials hastened to assure puzzled students that the long-awaited Job was only partially completed. Within a month a new mantle of gold leaf will have completely transformed the weather-beaten landmark.
Ordinarily the Dome should don a new wrapper of gold every ten years or so. Last gilded in 1934, the Dome was scheduled to have teen recoated six or seven years ago, but the government denied the use of gold leaf, a critical war material. Shortly after the job was finished in ’34, phosphate blown from a railroad car on a siding ate away some of the leaf before the damage was noticed.
The Rev. John J. Reddington, C.S.C., University purchasing agent, is in charge of the regilding, which is being done by the R. J. Wolf Co. of South Bend. 325 rolls of gold leaf will be needed to cover the Dome. Total cost will be around $15,000.
Though probably the most spectacular, renovation of the Dome was not the only change in the Notre Dame campus during the summer.
A refinish job completed this week on the exterior of Morrissey Hall had tne building looking more chipper than a two-year-old. Old mortar between the bricks was ground out and replaced with new binder in the huge undertaking, begun during the last school year.
Armed with paint brushes, the maintenance squad, directed by Rev. Bernard J. Furstoss, C.S.C., moved in on St. Ed’s, Walsh, Badin and Sorin Halls, leaving them with fresh new wall-dressings.
Work has already begun in the new machine shop of the germ-free research laboratories. Here, cages, tanks and other special equipment are made for biological work. A quonset-style animal building and a new structure to house LOBUND (Laboratories of Bacteriology, University of Notre Dame) have been erected behind the Heat Power Lab, and are scheduled to swing into operation shortly.
Among other summer additions were new copper rain gutters for Sacred Heart Church, a rubber tile floor for the Library reading room, concrete steps leading to the laundry, and a new sidewalk connecting Cavanaugh Hall and the Huddle.

September 21, 22, and 23 will be remembered for a long time by many of this year’s freshmen because they started college life right last week by attending the retreats held in St. Edward’s and Farley Halls. This is the first time that an opening retreat was held in separate hall chapels.
The retreat consisted of short talks after morning masses and similar talks during the evening devotions. The talks

and the services were shared by the priests of the halls. The purpose of such an arrangement was to acquaint the students with the rector and the various prefects and to impress upon them the fact that the primary job of the priests is one of counsel and guidance, not discipline.
Following the final gathering, an informal get-together was held in each hall. The frosh thereby got a chance to meet new friends and companions for the coming years. An old fashioned song fest was the biggest ice-cracker of the evening.

LUCKEY, proved himself to be as equally at home in a saddle as in a bacteriology lab when he snagged top calf-roping honors in a Colorado rodeo recently.

New ’Concord' Opens With Freedom Forum
After celebrating its first year of publication last June when the ninth issue rolled off the press, Concord, the new national student monthly, will inaugurate its second year of existence with the October issue, featuring a student forum on academic freedom; first hand reports on student problems in Austria, Switzerland, Canada and Russia; and many other editorials, short stories, articles and book reviews.
Representing the University of Notre Dame, St. Mary’s College, Mary Manse College, John Carroll, Chicago, Mar-quete, and other midwestern universities, Concord has been the very heart of a unique venture in Catholic Action on the student level. It has been the hub of YCS activities on many campuses throughout the past year, has echoed the spirit of the movement, and has influenced many students who otherwise would not have known YCS ideals.
Although generally inexperienced in the field of magazine publication, the members of the Concord staff took to their tasks with collective vigor to learn through doing. Now after its first year, Concord is being acclaimed not only for its high quality of content, but also for its professional appearance and presen-t a t i o n. Said Harry Sylvester, in Commonweal, “Less pretentious than some of the other (new magazines) and much more quietly initiated, Concord, in its mature approach and professional quality of editing could well be an example for even more established periodicals in the Catholic field.” Already Concord has a strong foothold on more than 40 campuses.
Meeting once a month, the national editorial staff plans each issue and discusses student problems and prospective problems. Exhaustive discussion and no little amount of revision faces each article and story as each staff member brings the knowledge of his own experience and background to bear on them. Despite strict editorial policies, the magazine welcomes contributions from students everywhere.
Here at Notre Dame, Bob Reynolds, president of the local YCS unit, is the editor of Concord. Vince Giese, graduate student in political science, is managing editor; Curt Kissling, political science senior, is business manager; and Walt Zenner, art and letters senior, is circulation director. Other men who contribute time and talent to the magazine are Don Stoner, Dan Norander, Chuck Bauman, and Joe Reilly. Concord is published monthly at the Ave Maria Press on the Notre Dame campus.

Radio
By VERNE KELLEY
If you have a .radio in your room and listen to it frequently, you might enjoy this column. This department hopes to give you the lowdown throughout the year about the best in radio. Knowing-how a college man’s time is limited, we’ll try to select programs which should prove interesting to the average student and maybe that’s you.
This is the time of the year when radio shows which were on the air during the summer as replacements find themselves out of jobs and the old standbys plus a few newcomers prepare themselves for the long season ahead.
One of the shows which was produced these past months was the Mel Torme Show heard Tuesday nights at 7:00 pjn. our time. It starred the Velvet Fog and always presented a few good tunes in Mel’s style.
The main drag was the comedy which was directed about four levels below the average bobby-soxers intelligence. A typical gag was:
“Is that your car on Main st.?”
“On Main st.! It’s all over Main st.” Nuff said?
Due back this fall is Bob Hope. His writers promise the same jokes but with the locations changed so everyone should be happy. However, as an added attraction Hope has signed the lush-lovely, Doris .Day, to sing some melodies and look pretty for the audience. Let’s hurry with that television.
Tonight Red Skelton entertains in his inimitable manner at 8:30 on NBC. Eddie Cantor precedes him on the same network.
If your mornings are somewhat free, tune in on Arthur Godfrey and all the little Godfreys heard in this area at 10:00. It’s guaranteed to make you forget what was said in your last class.
On Thursdays at 8:30 p.m.— Candid Microphone. One of the few new shows with a different idea and one that provides laughs without the aid of a staff of writers copying from another staff of writers. It has a simple formula. Ordinary people without an actor’s training are unknowingly involved in an unusual situation which is recorded and later presented over the airwaves. Makes for interesting listening.
Any complaints, which we hope will be few, and any plaudits, which we hope will be many, may be sent to Radio ; Column, The Scholastic, and, who knows, . they may reach us.

Vet News
Subsistence payments for vets studying under the G.I. Bill will arrive during the first week of November, according to a recent announcement from the Veterans Administration. Checks sent to out-of-state vets attending college in Indiana for the first time, may be delayed by the transfer in records, however. In these cases, VA will send out individual explanatory letters.
“Three-way checks” on vets’ National Life Insurance policies are advised to eliminate future difficulties. They should cover: (1) beneficiaries, both principal and contingent; (2) manner in which proceeds are to be paid to beneficiaries; and (3) amount and type of NSLI in force.
The gradual decline in veterans’ education and training program enrollment is expected to continue. Colleges and universities have led the drop, with a decrease from 1,245,000 to 1,140,000 between January and May of this year.
Eligible veterans needing hospitalization or out-patient medical treatment are advised to apply for these benefits at the Regional Medical Division, 36 South Pennsylvania Street, Indianapolis. VA has emphasized that only hospital emergency cases should apply directly to a VA hospital.

(Continued from page 13)
A formal fight against secularism, the “Christian America” campaign was launched at the parley under the direction of the Rev. Clifford J. King, founder of the Crusade and for 25 years a missionary in China.
In a special message to the assembled Crusaders, Pope Pius XII bestowed the Apostolic Blessing on all members of the CSMC and urged them to “work and study with unremitting zeal in behalf of the Church in mission lands, and par
ticularly for the increase of vocations for the home and foreign missions.”
Monsignor Fulton J. Sheen, speaking before the Saturday night session and over a national network told the Crusaders that each onq of them should bring one soul back to God. Commenting on his recent tour of the Far East, the Monsignor said that he shocked the people of Japan by speaking of the Emperor.
“What you Japanese do is not so far wrong; you adore a man-God, whereas the Christians adore a God who became man.”
In China he said that he had encountered people who were going over to the Communists. For this reason the Monsignor urged that the Crusaders devote
much of their time to the Chinese missions. Speaking to the Chinese, he said, “The trains that come into North China carry passengers only one way—from the Soviet into China. No one goes back to Russia.
“Likewise,” said the famed radio orator, “No one jumps out of embassy windows just to get back to Russia.”
Between addresses by the more than 110 speakers at the huge Crusade meeting, the delegates inspected mission and vocation exhibits and went on special tours of tha Notre Dame campus.
Along about that time the football players got back and the campus took on that familiar look. Notre Dame again became Notre Dame.

Dr. Zay Jeffries, G-E vice president and an eminent metallurgist: “One of the fields where metallurgists still have much to do is in permanent magnet engineering. Here are opportunities not only to pioneer new applications but also to develop better alloys and techniques. Many industrial applications await only the ingenuity of the design engineer.
GAS TURBINE ENGINEER
Alan Howard, directing gas-turbine development: “We are building the country’s first gas-turbine for a utility... are testing a 4800 hp unit for locomotives. Developments like these are creating an ever greater demand for men who can handle tough problems in thermodynamics, combustion, control processes, and metallurgy.”

Dr. K. H. Kingdon, heading atomic power development in the Research Laboratory: “It is a mistake to think that atomic energy work has room only for nuclear physicists.

Browser’s Column
The city of Notre Dame, Indiana, got its citizens back last week. Fifty-five hundred strong they came from all over this land and others, not very eager, not very ready for the new term, but back. A brave, bold and complacent lot.
These citizens of Notre Dame are a weird group. Most college populations are. If there is any distinction to be found in the ND variety, one must come to sad conclusions in discovering it. Fo the uniqueness of the “Notre Dame Man” has been found by history to lie in his noble aversion to any sort of student activity and an amazing record for poor campus leadership and organization.
There must be a reason for this. It would be a waste of more space to look for it here. The discouraging fact remains. “ND men” pay their evermounting tuition, go to class, live, eat and sleep for four years “under the Golden Dome” and exert themselves to the minimum toward extra-class, extrasack activities. They manage to avoid the contaminating disease of student action and organization as if it were the plague they think it is.
Last year this magazine took a poll of the above mentioned species on the subject of THEIR student council. The student council, according to theory, is maintained for the expressed purpose of fostering student activities; promoting the general welfare; and knitting campus organizations into a solid front of effort. It never has. It has been a shameful failure through all the years of its recent existence. Asked “why,” the “ND man,” in last year’s poll, promptly laid the blame on the Administration. In doing so he was carrying on a tradition. The Administration is a scapegoat. There may be justification for the condemnation- heaped on it but it still remains a scapegoat and the student body still remains inactive.
In conversation last semester with a former president of that council, this column heard a sad tale. There was a small high school of Catholic origin-just starting out back East. Wanting to find and use as a model for their new student government the leading Catholic University in the country, they wrote to
Notre Dame asking for advice. They got none. Notre Dame had none to give. Notre Dame didn’t have a student government worth knowing or copying. They still don’t.
There is, however, a note of encouragement in certain happenings of last year around here. The Mock Convention, Bengal Bouts and Relief Carnival, not to mention WND, were all projects of great magnitude and success. They were done by students, for students. But they were done not as the result of a smooth functioning student government and organization, not through the backing of class officials or the student council but by a handful of talented, determined men. They were refreshing breezes in this atmosphere of stagnation.
And then there was the Freshman class.
There was a remarkable group. For some strange reason they got the idea ■ that a large, well populated institution such as this might want something done to make it a better place in which to live. They believed in the force of that corny phrase “class spirit.” They thought that the students could act effectively “cn masse” and help themselves by doing same. They organized picnics, forums, dances and held outstanding elections. They were audaciously radical and refreshingly active. Whether they will succumb to the general atmosphere and lay down to play dead for three more years or whether they will remain as a disturbing influence is yet to be seen.
Which might lead us on to the new batch of frosh just arrived. They are an awesome sight moving around the grounds in a body. They look as if they came, here to find a full life for four years. They look as if they might do things. The odds (and tradition) are against them. But you can never tell. There is a strange attraction in having a good time, in developing in oneself a sense of leadership and responsibility. The 1200 plebes might be seduced. Think what that would mean! Two classes, almost 2000 students, acting on their impulse of “school spirit” and self pride. It could start a veritable revolution! It could make the Notre Dame student body a proud thing again. It COULD!
Here and There
YCS- and Blue Circle did a great job with their frosh orientation program but what took everyone so long to wake up to the fact that this is a big place and freshmen get lost? . . . after all, they are paying guests. ... By the way, where is the much publicized “SPIRES”? . . . Will the band finally move out of Indiana and bus to New Orleans on Spring Tour as rumored??? ... It will be interesting to give a listen at the Stadium tomorrow and see if the enlarged ND student body can drown out the 600 shrilling leather lungs from St. Mary’s. . . . The ultra modern book store opened operations with the usual ultra-archaic service ... it is incomprehensible to this column, why added help isn’t employed for the opening rush. . . . Added thought on the freshman orientation: Where was the Monogram Club at the mixer last Wednesday night. . . according to count there were about a dozen “sports” there with the track team having the best representation. . . . One football player showed—John Frampton who, incidentally, gave a rousing speech. . . .
