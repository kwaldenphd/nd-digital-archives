Notre Dame Victory March
Sir:
I deny everything.
In your frantic search for a scapegoat to crucify before the English department and the Editors of our fellow publication, the Juggler, for the appearance of “Parabolic Violets,” you have lashed out at me based on the slim thread that I happen to be a Commerce man. Mr. Dc-fant, there are over 1,000 other men in the Commerce school and any of them could have written the now immortal parabolic verse. May I remind you that the original letter which you showed me was signed by the Purple Dragon, a friend, no doubt, of the Scholastic’s late group of mystery men, Archie Mc-Bitters and Don Lee and with whom I disclaim the slightest connection. As a result of your indiscretion I have received a highly confusing verse from the REAL dragon, apparently denouncing me. entitled “The Parabolic Bean Bush.” Also received were various mash notes from English majors, undeserved bouquets from other Commerce men and a letter from the Dome staff asking me to resign.
Anon you shall hear from the Dome lawyers who assure me that they can put you away for ninety-seven years, with time off for good behavior, as a result of your lapse from virtue.
Consequently, sir, the next time I pass you on the campus, I shall expectorate directly in your eye.
Hastily yours, John P. Walker Editor, the Dome
Dear Sir:
It is unfortunate that the Scholastic feels burdened with the duty of judging rather than merely commenting and reporting on the publications which appear occasionally on campus. The right to criticize presupposes the ability to understand and the recent aimless attacks upon The Juggler in parody, column and letter-form are admissions of ignorance rather than intelligent criticism.
It cannot be denied that each man has the right to analyze the material slipped under his door, but it simultaneously does not appear that inept and unfounded criticisms need be published: “I turn to poetry—that was poetry wasn’t it? To say the least, I was confused, and even reading it backwards didn’t help. Of course I realize that the English Majors shiver with delight when they read such stuff ... So I sez to myself, I sez . . .” (Continued on page 33)
MUSICAL POWDER BOXES
The musical units were made for us in Switzerland before the war and we have just recently been able to secure fine blue and gold cases for them. Most are powder boxes, but there are cigarette boxes, fine leather jewel cases and candy boxes as well. Prices start at $8.25. All the musical units are 22 note, not to be compared with those used in many cheap powder boxes. Only 150 all together and when these are gone it may be several years before we can secure mother importction.

endeavor to give you a homogenized version of what these columns look like and why they please. First, Dorothy Dix. Most letters and advice read something like this:
----By John A. O'Connor
On looking at Henry V a second time we have come to agree with the cafeteria ’ critics who claim that Hollywood could have done a better job. Let’s look first into the casting. If the boys out west had selected loved and familiar American faces for the roles we might have felt more at home. Errol Flynn would be the logical choice for Henry’s part; he would have been much more dashing than Olivier; and he would have won the hand of Princess Katherine with much more action and less talk. They might even have used his yacht in that fleet invasion scene.
Had Warner Brothers produced the film you can bet Lizabeth (Geronimo) Scott would have been in the slippers of Princess Kate, and Maria Ouspenskaya her Duenna. Ancient Pistol’s lines would have been allotted to that hilarious Danny Kaye oi’ even Groucho Marx. That would have been funny.
So if you’re in an outfit predominantly Southern, you’ll get grits and greens most of the time, as that’s what the yo-all boys are used to. If your bunch is mostly Brooklynese you’ll no doubt enjoy salami and blintzes.
But the Army has failed to mention what you get if you’re from South Bend or Notre Dame. If they give you what you’re used to, then . . . But gosh! They can’t keep serving that!
Long a favorite with the ND men is the women’s page of the city journal. Second only to the comic section, and probably a slight favorite over the sports section, this sheet fairly bursts with erudite advice, daily drooling from the unc-tous Underwoods of such charming souls as Dorothy Dix, Mary Haworth, Emily Post and Josephine Lowman. Foi- the remainder of the school year we shall
Dear Miss Dix:
I am madly in love with an ND man. He’s tall and handsome, uses Kreml, and Pond’s. He tells me he won four letters in billiards in high school. He drives a canary - yellow convertible Zephyr. I met him recently after he had been over to our horseshow. I knew he loved me because I overheard him say “Number 3 has good form.” I was riding No. 3 that day. Now he has asked me to go out to Rum Village with him on May-day to pick wildflowers. Should I go.—EAGER?
Answer:
Don’t you dare. Listen, honey, you really don’t know anything about flowers at your age anyhow. He’s no doubt another cad. Send me his name and phone number, and I’ll have him reported.—DD.
Advance publicity would no doubt have billed the technicolor extravaganza as torrid and lusty. Advertisements would read “Henry’s Back and Kate’s Got Him,” or “Don’t Tell Anyone What the Dauphin Did or Where He Did It.”
Technically Hollywood would have done a far superior job. They would have used no fake backdrops like that fairy-land castle of Agincourt, rising out of the mists. They would have built another Dragonwyck on the outskirts of Los Angeles and stormed it with 100,000 extras. And that fuzzy bright photography job done in the court scenes would have been averted under the skilled eyes of Hollywood’s master craftsmen.
There is balm in Gilead. And the U. S. Army is out to serve some of it to every GI. If you don’t believe it, listen to the program “Sound Off” on Friday. It’s the new comedy show of the airways, even funnier than Allen or Morgan. It proves that the U. S. Army cannot only go out and get themselves the best football team in the country, but, on entering the field of radio comedy, can come up with some of the richest stuff on the air.
For instance in the new peace time army they are offering chow designed to please the palate. They make a survey of your outfit to determine who’s from where, then sling out the sectional favorites, just like you’re used to at home.

A Friend Has Passed . . .
In the death of Brother Mauritius last week, there passed from the Notre Dame scene one of the few living religious who knew the founder of the University, and saw it grow from a small institution to its present importance. In that development Brother Mauriliuj had a humble though necessary and not unimportant part. He had no ambition but to lend a hand wherever his superiors thought he could help; a peg for any hole. As a prefect, and later as rector of Carroll Hall he had an active part in the life of the students; but he left that willingly and carried on in the store when Brother “Leep” had to retire. He came back again as Rector; and then when there was need for him he helped with the mailing of the Ave Maria; and when Brother Cyprian was no longer able to oversee Washington Hall, Brother Mau-rilius took over to see that the young actors and orators who hoped to set the world on fire didn’t begin that operation prematurely. Finally when his old pal, Brother Aloysius, had to go to the infirmary across the lake for his dress rehearsal for heaven (he had studied his lines and cues a lifetime), Brother Mauritius took his place as guest master in Corby Hall.
Only the older alumni who “experienced” Carroll Hall will remember him well. His “laying down" of the rules at the beginning of each semester was an occasion devoutly to be wished. His emphasis was purely quantitative; and when he announced the thunders of wrath that would fall upon the scorner of the law, he suited his volume to the word. But his bark was worse than his bite. Gentle at heart, he had a genuine sympathy for the good lads who had enough of the devil of mischief in them to make them interesting, and he could readily forgive and forget. For years the bells in the halls were rung from the study hall in the Main Building; and Brother Maurilius was as addicted to the
split second as the present rector of Alumni.
One cannot picture Brother Maurilius "without his cigar. It was his one complete worldly luxury. He never left the campus; for him South Bend was as far and as near as New York. He attended no football games, no baseball games, no movies or lectures or concerts. But he believed that Thomas Marshall was more than a politician or statesman when he declared that what this distracted country needed was a good five cent cigar. Brother Maurilius subscribed to , that. It gave an air of quiet and contentment to him. There was always a processional gravity to his stride. Who could be precipitous and enjoy a good cigar?
Brother Maurilius had a few favorite cronies who came foi’ an occasional visit to Corby Hall of a Sunday afternoon. Brother Peter and Brother Columbanus and Brother Alan exchanged local news with him, as he had with Brother Aloysius before them. And often when they had gone and there was a let-up from callers asking to see this or that priest, „ he would slip away to a back seat of the chapel within earshot of the door bell, and enjoy a cozy' half hour with God. And now the door bells will bother him no more; he has gone home to God, and those who loved him here and admired him and his humble work will follow at his heels with the applause of their prayers.—Rev. Eugene Burke, C.S.C.

"lolan+he" Begins 6-Day Run Tuesday
BY ED SNYDER
Gilbert and Sullivan’s “lolanthe,” the 1947 musical presentation of the Notre Dame Savoyards, comes to Washington Hall Tuesday night for a six-day stand.
Performances will be given for the student body and faculty on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Monday nights (May 6, 7, 8, 9, and' 12). The distribution of tickets began Thursday in the basement of the dining halls. Students must present their athletic books to get ducats for any one of the performances. Two shows will be given next Sunday, May 12; a matinee at 2 o’clock for the Holy Cross community and nuns, and an evening show for South Bend residents only. Curtain time each evening will be at 8:20, it was announced this week by Professor Cecil Birder, director of “lolanthe.”
This year’s presentation marks the first appearance of the St. Mary’s College Savoyards on the Washington Hall stage. Six St. Mary’s girls have lead roles in “lolanthe,” while 21 others are in the chorus. The Notre Dame orchestra will provide the musical accompaniment for the show, under the direction of Professor Birder. The production is presented by the University Theatre of which Rev. Matthew C. Coyle, C.S.C., is Director of Dramatics.
Here is the cast of leading characters as announced this week: Ralph Thorson as The Lord Chancellor; John W. Owen as the Earl of Mountararat; Nolan Sheehan as Earl Tolleller; John Comerford as Private Willis; Roy O’Neil as Strephon; Evelyn Sahel as the Queen of the Fairies; Elaine Bruck as lolanthe, Jane Lavelle as Celia; Frances Hanson as Leila; Petrina Marshall as Fleta; and Marcia Nolan as Phyllis.

In addition to the usual Prom arrangements, the conunitee was notified last week that the dance will be fea-

Review of Politics Features Atom Article By Possony; Others by Gurian, O’Malley
War against a strong “would-be” aggressor can be prevented only by becoming or remaining stronger' than such an aggressor and by blocking the aggressor through political isolation, Dr. Stefan T. Possony, noted military expert and author, asserts in an article appearing in the April issue of “The Review of Politics,” published currently at the University of Notre Dame.
Dr. Possony, in his article entitled “The Lessons of the First Atomic Year” points out that such a policy requires domestic support and sacrifice and balancing the aggressor’s military force. It requires furthermore, he added, an understanding of the old maxim that “the quickest way to become involved in war is to be afraid of war.”
In discussing various atomic experiments, he stresses that the Bikini tests underscored the potency of the new weapon, although results of the tests were short of the catastrophic effects expected.
“No modern weapon, industrial plant or city,” he observes, “was built to withstand shock and fire effects as strong as those created by an atomic explosion; hence none of these installations and materials can be expected to escape destruction or heavy damage from an atomic explosion within the dangerous radius. Yet there is no reason why much more resistant equipment should not be built.”
Emphasizing that the extreme dangers result from radio-activity, Dr. Possony adds that “essentially the atomic bomb is a combination of an extremely powerful explosive and incendiary with an extremely powerful poisonous substance and combines all major known forms of bomb attack into one.”
Discussing efforts to form an international commission on atomic energy, Dr. Possony declares that it is doubtful if the Soviets will permit the necessary inspections required to make these plans operative. He stressed that “no system can be devised that would prove efficient with respect to production methods tomorrow, which are totally unknown today.”
Dr. Possony believes that since the fear of retaliation is the chief preventative of the use of the atomic bomb, any future agreement on atomic forces “should recognize the right of every state to make a certain number of atomic
8
bombs and to maintain installations capable of producing atomic explosives.”
Another article of current international importance in the April issue of the Review of Politics is “France Faces Germany” by Maurice de Gandillac, distinguished French editor, in which he states that the French do not place much faith in the democratization and reeducation of the Germans along Anglo-Saxon lines. Professor Elmer Plischke, of DePauw University, presents a critique of the operation of the denazification policy in Germany, as he experienced it at first hand in his article, “The Denazification of Germany.”
Three great romantic thinkers are discussed in the three final articles of the April issue. Frank O’Malley, Professor of English at Notre Dame, writes on “The Wasteland of William Blake.” Dr. Waldemar Gurian, Professor of Political Science at Notre Dame and editor of the Revieiv of Politics, treats of the famous Lamennais, who has had a great influence in the revival of democratic ideas among the Catholics of modern times even though his philosophical and religious principles were completely unorthodox and unacceptable. Rev. Otto Karrer, noted German theologian, writes an essay on Newman’s ideas as applicable to the present crisis in Western thought.
Book reviews of current studies of European, American and South American subjects are presented by the Rev. Thomas T. McAvoy, c.s.c., Head of the Department of History at Notre Dame and Associate Editor of the Review of Politics; Professors Matthew A. Fitzsimons, Aaron I. Abell and Thomas E. Downey of the Department of History at Notre Dame; and F. A. Hermens, Professor of Political Science at Notre Dame.
Mother's Day Program To Feature Rosary
A star-studded cast of stage and movie celebrities will present a special Mother’s day broadcast over a nation-wide hookup of the Mutual Broadcasting System at 3 p. m. (EDST) May 11.
The half-hour program, arranged by the Rev. Patrick Peyton, c.s.c., director of the Family Rosary movement and also promoter of the MBS Family Theater, will feature the story of the world’s greatest mother, Mary, the Mother of God. The cast will include Loretta
Young, Ethel Barrymore, Ruth Hussey, Irene Dunne, Margaret O’Brien, Rosalind Russell, Charles Boyer, Don Ameche, Pat O’Brien, and George Murphy.
Described as the story of the Mother of Jesus, it is also the story of the joys, sorrows, and triumphs of every mother, as told through the dramatic presentation and recitation of five mysteries of the Rosary. The broadcast will afford an opportunity for millions in their homes to kneel and recite the Rosary in unison with the stars participating.
People are still talking about the Mother’s day program Father Peyton arranged two years ago, which featured Cardinal Francis Spellman of New York and Bing Crosby. The broadcast attracted international attention and gained countless volunteers for the Family Rosary Crusade.
Dr. Mizelle Named Biology Journal Editor
Dr. John D. Mizelle, Associate Professor of Biology in the University of Notre Dame, has been appointed editor of the American Midland Naturalist, noted biological journal published at Notre Dame, it was announced by the Rev. Howard Kenna, c.s.c., Director of Studies at Notre Dame.
Dr. Mizelle, who since December 1, 1946, has served as managing and associate editor, succeeds Dr. Theodor Just, former Head of the Department of Biology at Notre Dame, who resigned his post at Notre Dame last year to become Chief Curator of the Department of Botany, Chicago Natural History Museum. Dr. Just will relinquish his duties as editor of the American Midland Naturalist with the completion of the current volume in May.
An authority on parasitology, Dr. Mizelle joined the faculty of the University of Notre Dame in 1940 after' serving for three years on the faculty at Oklahoma A & M College, and formerly as an assistant animal parasitologist in the division of animal pathology and hygiene at the University of Illinois. A native of Louisiana, he received his bachelor of science degree at Louisiana State University in 1932 and his master of science degree at the same institution in 1933. He received his doctor’s degree at the University of Illinois in 1937. He is a member of the American Microscopical Society, American Society of Parasitologists, Indiana Academy of Science, American Society of Zoologists, and the American Association of University Professors. Dr. Mizelle was managing and Associate Editor of the American Midland Naturalist since December, 1946.
Bro. Mauritius Dies: At ND for 50 Years r
Brother Maurilius, C.S.C., a prominent campus figure for the past fifty years, was buried last Friday in the Commu-. nity cemetery after a Requiem Mass celebrated by Rev. William Robinson, C.S.C., in Sacred Heart Church. He died v at the age of 69 on April 23 in St. Joseph’s Hospital in South Bend.
Known affectionately as “Brother Moe” to Notre Dame faculty members, 1 students and alumni, Brother Maurilius,
BROTHER MAURILIUS, C.S.C.
a native of Chicago, was the former William DeGan before receiving the Holy Habit, August 15,1896.
He had served as rector of Brownson and Carroll Halls at various times before they were converted into administrative offices in 1945. Before that he had charge of the student confectionery store. At the time of his death Brother Maurilius was guestmaster at Corby Hall, a position he had held since 1944.
LaRaza Dance Open To All This Spring
The Progress Club on May 10th will' be the setting of this year’s LaRaza Club Spring Dance. This year will mark the first time that the dance has been open to the entire student body.
Handling the musical chores for the evening will be Steve Company and his Pan American orchestra. Steve and his aggregation are well-known for their musical accomplishments and should contribute greatly to making the dance a big success.
Those wishing to attend the dance but who are without dates might consult the date bureau comprised of Roger Casti-ello of 158 Cavanaugh and Louis Pallais of 202 Dillon.
Inasmuch as the dance is an informal affair between the hours of 8 and 11, it will not be necessary to obtain late per-’ missions. The bids, which are $1.75 pei' couple, are on sale in all of the halls and can be purchased from hall representatives.—Jack Lowe.
Dome Late; Will Be Mailed in Summer
Because of delays caused by material shortages, the 1947 Dome will not be ready for distribution until after the end of the present semester, it was announced this week by Arthur E. Coughlan, business manager.
In announcing the delay, Coughlan reported on how the distribution will be carried out. During the summer, one copy of the Dome will be mailed to each undergraduate student at his address as it appears in the Students Accounts Office, he said. However, he added, this will be done only for those students who have been in attendance at the university during both the fall and spring semesters.
Undergraduate students, regardless of their class rating, who enrolled in February of this year, must pay an additional four dollars to procure a copy of the year book. Since the total cost of the book is eight dollars, there is a deduction of four dollars per semester off the general fee. Students who entered
COMMENCEMENT INVITATION NOTICE
The Alumni Office has announced that the custom of giving ten invitations to the Commencement to each member of the Senior Class will be continued. These are given by the University to the Senior without cost.
Because of paper shortage and the limitation of space in the various campus facilities which will house the Commencement ceremonies, extra invitations cannot be ordered through the Alumni Office.
Tickets wall be given to each Senior for his immediate family and other guests. Distribution of invitations and tickets wall be announced in detail before May 10 in bulletins to the Seniors.
ALUMNI TICKET PREFERENCE
The Athletic Department and the Alumni Association call attention of the students to a clause in the priorities for 1947 football ticket distribution which may cause confusion to a few who are eligible for alumni membership but wrho continue as students.
A former student, even though a member of the Alumni Association in good standing, who is an undergraduate at Notre Dame in the Fall of 1947, will not be permitted to secure football tickets (army tickets to be specific), on the tentative allotment of two for each alumnus in good standing, and to secure in addition the tentative allotment of two for his parents. Only one preference will be possible.
in February will have paid only for half of the total cost.
Graduate students, who wish to procure a copy of the book, must make a full payment. Those graduate students, who were undergraduates last semester must make only a half payment. This is due to the fact that no allocation for the Dome is made in graduate students’ fees.
All payments must be made at the Publications Office, Room 118 of the Main Building on or before May 9. The yearbook will be distributed to graduating seniors in the same manner as it is mailed out to undergraduates. If they have been enrolled only since February they must make a four dollar payment to procure their copy.
Band Knocks 'Em Dead
In Southern Illinois
Starting on April 18 the Notre Dame band made a three-day concert tour in southern Illinois, playing in Olney and Effingham, returning to the campus on Sunday night, April 20.
Leaving at 5:30 A. M. from behind Breen-Phillips Hall, they arrived in Olney eight hours later, holding their first concert at 3:00 P. M. and another that night, both of which were favorably received.
Saturday morning they continued their tour, travelling to Effingham, where two concerts were given. Sunday morning after mass the forty band members loaded into the bus and returned to Notre Dame after another successful tour.

"BEST BAND IN YEARS" TO FEATURE SENIORS' FIRST POSTWAR BALL
“Music by Masters,” that famous tag line that has been heard on records, broadcasts, at leading hotels, in theatres and in the best of America’s ballrooms, becomes a reality for Notre Dame upperclassmen two weeks from tonight, May 16, when the number one social event of the year, the Senior Ball, is staged in all its formal splendor at the Palais Royale.
The first post-war dance of pre-war standard, the Ball is only one among, three high-lighted events of the weekend. The following afternoon, Ballgoers and their dates will have an opportunity to see the 1947 version of the Fighting Irish in the Oldtimers’ football game in the Stadium at 2:00 p. m. On Saturday night, a Candlelight Dance and a buffet supper will be held at the South Bend Progress Club as the finishing touch to a grand and glorious week-end of activity. Although tentatively set for the South Bend Country Club, the Saturday night dance has been moved inasmuch as repairs at the Country Club will not be completed in time for the Ball week-end.
Few Tickets Left.
Undoubtedly the best band to be booked for a Notre Dame class dance in a number of years, Frankie Masters brings twenty top-flight musicians and entertainers, headed by lovely songstress Phyllis Myles, handsome Phil Gray and Marty, Kay, Pat and Jo, the famous Masters’ quartet, to render that “Masterful Music.”
Combining sweet music with a touch of swing, and sprinkling in a few entertaining novelties is the Masters formula of success. Not a small part of the band’s success falls directly on Frankie’s shoulders. His congenial personality, coupled with an uncanny sense of showmanship have gained for him an enviable position among the nation’s top bandsmen. The band is one of the most sought-after, and his appearance at the Senior Ball is regarded a catch by the Ball Committee.
In addition to its 48 performances on the “Coca-Cola Victory Parade of Spotlight Bands,” the band has been heard nationally on the “Household Finance” program and the “Fitch Band Wagon.” Recently engagements at the Stevens Hotel in Chicago and the Taft Hotel in New York have been added to Masters’ prestige.
Of the 50 bids that remained after the close of the down payment sale, April 21, only a few are still in the hands of the five campus ticket agents. The abso
lute deadline for all ticket sales is this Tuesday night, May 6. Those who have not purchased their bid as yet are urged to do so immediately as they’re going on a first come, first served basis. Those who made the $5.00 down payment are reminded that they have till Tuesday night to pay the $3.50 balance. If the balance is not paid by this time, the initial $5.00 payment will be forfeited.
FRANKIE MASTERS
If you’re still worrying about a place to house your date, see Herb Daiker, 231 Sorin, who has a list of private homes that will accommodate the imported misses.
Tickets for the Saturday night dance are now available and may be had by contacting the agent that sold you your bid.

Dr. Price Travels East On Observation Tour
Dr. Charles C. Price, head of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Notre Dame, will leave Sunday for the east where he will visit several industrial plants and deliver addresses before the Chemistry departments at the University of Delaware, Newark, Del., and Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.	.
He will visit the Socony Vacuum Oil Co., Paulsboro, N. J., on Monday and Tuesday (May 5th and 6th). On Wednesday and Thursday (May 7th and 8th), he will be at the Hercules Powder Co., Wilmington, Del. Operational procedure and research methods will be observed by Dr. Price at both plants.
Mims’ "Iron Pastoral” y Is Realistic, Religious r
Chicago and its hustle and bustle form the theme for The Iron Pastoral, a vol- ; ume of poems by John F. Nims, Asso- । ciate Professor of English at Notre , Dame. In this his first book of poetry, Mr. Nims has combined the realism of T the modern city with its true religious a meaning in a contemporary lyrical manner.
Prof. Nims, who has been favorably compared to Carl Sandburg as a compas- * sionate biographer of the various aspects of metropolitan life, reports the fast * tempo, the elevated lines, the skyscraper of the big city as valid for poetic expression as the romantic lanes and glades of former years. From this perspective, the title, “The Iron Pastoral,” is inevitably and totally correct. Perhaps more sympathetic and understanding than * Sandburg, Mr. Nims penetrates through ~ the surface tension of the city to its spiritual restlessness; he has a pity for its -brashness and sees beneath it a soul’s uncertainty. All in all, Mr. Nims’ book is an event in contemporary poetic literature.	. /
Professor Nims, a frequent contributor ' • to poetry journals, has been associated with the Department of English since , 1939. He received both his bachelor’s -and master’s degrees from Notre Dame and his doctorate from Chicago Univ.

Prof. Sheehan Flays Economic Injustices
Application of the principles of social justice as advocated by the Popes is the best means of eliminating present economic and social unrest, Professor John H. S'heehan, head of the Department of Economics at the University of Notre Dame, said last Saturday in a speech before a Regional Congress of the National Federation of Catholic College Students, at St. Paul, Minnesota.
Emphasizing,- in particular, the duty of American Catholics towards building a peaceful and constructive social order, Professor Sheehan declared that “economically, there is nothing yet so wrong with the United States that it cannot be repaired.”
“To have access to the fruits of the earth—that is, to goods and services— is a right every man has, just because he is-a man,” he added. “This is the right of private property—the right to ownership and control of sufficient goods and services to enable men to live as men should live.” -
“. . . Although some try to hide or distort them, the economic facts are available to those willing to dig for them. Generally, the facts are: badly distributed income, unhealthful concentration and control of wealth, unbalanced wages, prices and profits, all causing serious economic injustices and strife. Specifically, many facts bear upon the general problems. For instance, it is true that the average weekly wage for all manufacturing workers was roughly $43.00 during 1946, before taxes and deductions. It is also true that manufacturing profits in 1946 averaged 12%—on net worth—after taxes, depreciation, interest, other charges, and reserves.
“But more pertinently, in 1946, while cotton mill workers averaged less than $36.00, cloth:ng workers less than $37.00, and bakery workers less than $40.00, all of these industries had net profits of more than 21%. Likewise, while retail trade workers averaged less than $33.00, net profits exceeded 22%. The evil and the warning signal for the future reside in the fact that while some wages are high, prices and profits are relatively higher—to the point of bleeding away necessary purchasing power. Such specific facts are too little known. One reason is that too much of our press and radio function too often as purveyors of inadequate information.”
Professor Sheehan spoke at a Faculty
Panel on “The Responsibility of the Catholic Student in Reconstructing the Social Order.” The National Federation of Catholic College Students represents more than 200,000 students in Catholic colleges and universities all over the United States.
Desmond Fitzgerald, Friend of ND, Dies
The unexpected death, on April 9, of Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald, former Minister of External Affairs and Minister of Defense in the Cosgrove Government, was of much concern to Notre Dame. Mr. Fitzgerald was well known at the University, having delivered a series of lectures on Thomistic Philosophy here before World War II.
DESMOND FITZGERALD
For more than 30 years, both before and after the Treaty in Ireland, Mr. Fitzgerald took a leading part in the movement for Irish independence. As a volunteer he took part in the Rising of 1916, for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment, later being released at the time of general amnesty. From 1918 to 1921 he was Director of Publicity for the Dail Eireann, and was responsible for bringing many foreign journalists to Ireland and for interpreting the meaning and aspirations of the Sinn Fein movement. Mr. Fitzgerald was also a brilliant writer and a poet of distinction. One of his plays, “The Saint,” had a lengthy run at the Abbey Theater. He was active in the literary movement and knew Yeats, Lady Gregory, George Russell, Gegarty, Padraic Colum and many others.
Mr. Fitzgerald, a recognized authority on Thomism, was an intimate friend of M. Jacques Maritain, famous French philosopher and the present French Ambassador to the Holy See, who is scheduled to lecture at the University some time following the completion of his diplomatic mission.
Vincent Hogan, at the Graduate School here, visited Mr. Fitzgerald at Dublin on two occasions while in Europe recently, once in September, 1946, and again in January of this year. Hogan recalled: “Mr. Fitzgerald had pleasant memories of his stay at the University and of his many friends here. He often recounted many pleasant experiences at Notre Dame. He said that he always felt that the atmosphere at Notre Dame was the nearest to that of Ireland he had ever experienced, as it was preserving great Irish traditions and emphasizing real Catholicism.”
Tom Look, Shaw Win Bridge Tournament
Tom Look and Bob Shaw defeated Bruce Harlan and Bill Riley in the finals of the first Annual Natre Dame Bridge Tournament to become the contract bridge champions of the campus.
The final elimination round of six was a seven rubber affair, but it was clear to onlookers that Look and Shawr were the champs after three rubbers. The winners not only built up a 1000-point lead in the first rubber but continued to win the first five to increase this to 3000, and insure victory.
A Junior, Look of Detroit met Shaw, a Senior from Tulsa, over a bridge table last semester, and when the tournament was announced he asked S’haw to be his partner in the event. After playing only one practice game together, the two set out to conquer their six opponents in quick order.
For the records, they used a false club informative open coupled with a cheap Blackwood two no-trump convention. In the course of the tournament they reached the slam level numerous times, fulfilling this contract on practically every occasion.
The contests, sponsored by the Student Council, have been termed a great success by the 132 entrants, and shall be continued in future years. A twenty-five cent entrance fee per team is charged, out of which cards will be given as prizes to the winners and runners-up.

Blue Circle Holds Communion Breakfast
On Sunday, April 27th, Blue Circle, honor society of the University, held its annual Communion Breakfast. Mass was celebrated in Sorin Hall Chapel by the Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., President of the University, who was a Blue Circle member while a student here in 1922-23.
Breakfast was held in the West Dining Hall with Father Cavanaugh as guest of honor, and as a special guest "John V. Hinkle, Director of Notre Dame’s Department of Public Infomation, also a member of the Blue Circle in his undergraduate days.	.
Father Cavanaugh gave a brief address at the conclusion of the breakfast outlining his plans for the future of the University. He said that it is the duty of every Notre Dame student to help build a greater University. While Notre Dame stands on a par with other colleges in the country in academic achievements it is being hampered from realiz- ' ing its future ambitions because of its extremely small endowment. It is the duty of today’s students, Father Cavanaugh continued, to compensate for this by becoming vibrant Alumni who will aim for the general betterment of the University.
Fr. Cavanaugh Lauds Circle
Father Cavanaugh lauded the Circle for its widespread scope of successful activity this year, and commended the members for the zeal that they have shown in pursuing their cause. Plans were outlined for Father Cavanaugh whereby through extended cooperation: on the part of its members, the Circle hoped to include a more complete coverage of all student activity. Father Cavanaugh then conducted a seminar orr student problems and student activities, and stated that it is his hope that in the near future he will be able to devote more time to discussing individual problems with the students.
At the conclusion of his talk, Father Cavanaugh- presented pins indicative of membership to the thirty active members of the Circle. Those receiving pins were: Bob Uhl, Chuck Russ, Walt Zenner, Jim Walters, Ed Schlaffy, Leo McNamara, Harold Sullivan, Bill Wom-bacher, Vince O’Reilly, Art Cassidy, Steve Valetich, Tom Green, Al Gross, Frank Paxton, Tom Healy, Ed Luther, Lou DiGiovanni, Dick Elliott, Bill Thompson, Lou Tonlreau, Herb Sampson, Steve DeBruil, Steve Heekin, Jim McClintock, AI Kemnitzer, Jim Dillon, Jack McKeon, Paul Abraham, Buzz Wright, and Tom Higgins.

SIGNS OF A REVITALIZED EUROPE SEEN IN IRELAND, FRANCE BY N. D. STUDENT
(This is the second article in a series of three devoted to Vincent P. Hogan’s seven-month sojourn in post-war Europe. The first article appeared in the March BVst issue of Scholastic.)
Following the two weeks at quaint and ancient Fribourg, Switzerland, scene of the Jubilee Congress of Pax Romana, Vince Hogan moved northwest again. To Paris first, where he contacted several youth organizations, Hogan then crossed the Channel into England, and from that point back to Eire.
Eire—happy, prosperous, deeply Catholic Eire! In its capital, Dublin, Hogan set up his headquarters for the two weeks which were to follow, days devoted to intensive study of Eire’s wartime policy of neutrality, and the condition of the Emerald Isle today, which is largely a result of that policy. The purpose of the study was in line with the thesis Hogan was preparing for his Doctor’s degree in Political Science.
Eire's Prestige Grows
Paradoxically enough not only has Eire’s material welfare increased as a result or her neutrality, but her prestige and post cion in the international scene has also improved. Hogan found Ireland to be the oasis of present-day Europe, generally well off materially, one of the very few countries not suffering from disastrous food shortages. Not only was Eire an oasis materially, Hogan reported, but she is also undoubtedly the strongest Catholic nation in Europe. The old faith which has come down to contemporary Irishmen through the centuries of Irish Christianity still pervades the country today. Especially is it noticeable in the deep devotion of the people to the Blessed Sacrament and to the Blessed Virgin manifested in attendance at daily Mass (which nearly equals the attendance at Sunday Mass) and in
• devotion to the Rosary.
One of the highlights of Hogan’s stay in Ireland was an interview with Prime Minister Eamon DeValera. Although 6-5 years old, Hogan found Eire’s leader vastly younger-looking and more vigorous than his years would indicate. A kind, very affable person, the Prime Minister displayed a keen appreciation of current international affairs, befittting his position, for under this man Eire became a striking example of the right of
a small country to pursue a neutral course in time of war. Though her formal policy was neutral, Hogan declared that history will show that Eire was decidedly unneutral in spirit and in the great amount of material aid she furnished the Allied powers, and most important in the thousands of her fighting men who enlisted in the armed forces of the Allies.
At University of Paris
France again claimed Vince Hogan, this time (in October) to studies at the University of Paris’ Institut d’Etudes Politiques. More than four months were spent here, thus affording the opportunity for a remarkable insight into the problems facing that nation today. These problems he has classified into three main groups: the shortage of coal; the lack of adequate manpower throughout the whole of her industrial economy; and the necessity of stabilizing the monetary system. The resultant economic distress, the scarcity of food, and the extremely high cost of living are the bases for the present success of the Communist party in France, Hogan asserts.
But once these economic problems are solved the attraction and powei- that Communism now enjoys will be diminished considerably. Even as the situation is now the French people themselves worry far less about the dangers of Communism than do most observers from outside the country. The numerical strength of French Communists is usually over emphasized, Hogan feels, especially in view of the fact that the present coalition government is so constituted that the power of the Party is neutralized. The greatest danger, the French believe, lies in the fact of Communist domination of the great trade union Con-federacion Generale de Travail, thru which the key industries of France are controlled.
In its cultural and religious aspects Hogan observes a flourishing rennais-sance in France. Among Catholics, especially in the student, and industrial and agricultural worker classes, the laity is taking an active role. They are assuming their proper responsibilities and have been well organized, to such an extent that the recent criticism of a Time correspondent regarding Catholicism in Europe is quite unfounded. For Catholicism is not waging a holy war against Communism but is concerned about the spread of its program of social justice
Met. Opera Star Sings In Drill Hall Tonight
One of the brightest stars in South Bend’s galaxy of cultural billings for this spring will be the appearance of Charles B. Kullman, tenor, in the Navy Drill hall tonight at 8:1-5. Mr. Kullman will sing with the South Bend symphony orchestra in the latter’s final concert of the season. Other attractions which will find their way to South Bend this month include: James Melton, May 13; “The Student Prince”, May 15, and Monsignoi* Fulton J. Sheen, on an as yet unannounced date.
Mr. Kullman has been a star with the Metropolitan Opera Company since Dec. 20, 1935, when he made his debut as Faust in the opera by Gounod. Born in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1903, he first demonstrated his talent with the Yale varsity glee club. He won a solo spot with that organization, and after

based on the papal encyclicals, which program in the temporal order is being j pursued by the Christian Democratic parties of Europe. Moreover, the Church is especially concerned with the problem of “dechristianization” and the secular influences which threaten spiritual life and values within each country.
Culturally and intellectually, too, life in France today is vigorous. Paris, states Hogan, is without a doubt the intellectual center of the world. In fact, he predicts, France will continue to play a great role as an important civilizing influence throughout the world.

Baseball Nine Wins Seven of First Ten
Nearing the midway mark of the twenty-four game schedule Notre Dame’s hard hitting baseball squad was the owner of seven victories in the first ten games. So far, the season has proved to Jake Klein that it is regrettable he can only play nine men at a time. His problem is which nine of his assorted, ample talent to play. That problem, should give his mathematical wizardry a workout. At the keystone position, for instance, Ben “Yogi" Kozlik, a starter at that station last season, has come through with a sufficient string of base-hits and superb fielding to let Gene “Stanky” Lavery know he has by no means cinched the second base job this year. Lavery, a Brooklyn boy, had been hitting and fielding commendably during the first eight games to establish himself as the regular second sacker. In Bill “Tank” Sherman, Kline has obviously uncovered another definite starter, who with enough work, should lend strength to his mound corps.
Tomorrow the squad hops a bus to Kalamazoo to meet Charlie Maher s Western Michigan Broncos, long a provider of major league material, in the first of a home and home game series. The site for these two old rivals will Le Haymes Field with a 4,000 seating capacity and conceded to be one of the best collegiate ball parks in the country. Since the two schools began their series way Lack in 1914 Notre Dame has won twenty-eight, lost eleven, and tied one. Last year Old Jupiter Huvius stepped in and wet blanketed Loth engagements. For the Brones, Maher can call on Ed Rossi, Warren Biddle, Ernie Victor or Gordy Bowdell, all of whom have had past diamond experience at Western. Walt Young handles the catching assignment. Among well known names on the Brone roster is Nick Milosevich a brother of Mike who was up with the New York Yankees during the war. It is difficult to call the turn on Kline’s choice of a starting flinger. Mahanhah or Campbell, if well rested, should be

KLINEMEN LOSE TO MICHIGAN STATE, TOP WILDCATS AND ST. THOMAS
Three contests with mid-west baseball powers resulted in two victories for Notre Dame last week. The first two games played on the local diamond found the Irish winning Tuesday over Northwestern, 4-2, and following it up with a Friday afternoon 10-2 victory over St. Thomas. A clean slate for the week was wiped out by a 7-4 defeat at the hands of Michigan State Saturday.
The Northwestern game was a 2-2 tie until the seventh inning when Notre Dame crashed the scoring column with two runs. Third Baseman Bob Klein accounted for the tallies when he singled with the bases loaded. Wildcat Pitcher Bokelman dug his own grave in that frame by walking the first two batters, Kelly and Petrzelka. The stage was set for a double play when Lavery was intentionally passed, but Klein foiled the strategy with his clean hit after Schneider had popped out.
S'heehan and Petrzelka with two hits apiece were the other hitting stars for the Irish. Hurlers Dick Kluck, Dick Smullen, and Jack Campbell held Northwestern to four hits. Kluck was particularly effective, allowing no hits during his three inning stint. Campbell received credit for- the win.
A big fourth inning that produced eight runs was more than enough to insure an Irish victory in the SL Thomas game. Big Bill Sherman, making his first start for Notre Dame, handcuffed Tommie bats with a nifty four hitter despite the presence of seven port siders in their lineup.
Klein opened the home half of the

fourth with a walk. Mayo singled Klein to third and then advanced to second when Creevey walked to load the sacks. Sheehan brought Klein and Mayo home with a one-bagger to left. Schneider , sacrificed Sheehan and Creevey along. An attempt to cut down Creevey at the plate on Petrzelka’s grounder failed. Creevey scored and Petrzelka was safe on the fielder’s choice. Successive singles by Sherman, Kelly, Kozlik, and Klein produced five more runs. A triple by Mayo and • singles by Sheehan and , Petrzelka provided the final two runs in the seventh.
Kozlik, Mayo, and S'heehan sparked the Irish attack, collecting eight of the thirteen hits.
At Michigan State Notre Dame jumped to a quick three run lead in the " first inning but that was all their scor- -ing until the ninth. In the meantime the Spartans were collecting seven runs.
Penny Kozlik started the first inning with a shot over second good for one base. Ed Barbarito, Spartan second . baseman, muffed Klein’s hot grounder. With Kozlik on third and Klein on first Mayo smashed another ball to Barbarito who again erred with a wild throw to the plate trying to flag Kozlik who raced in to score. Klein and Mayo advanced to third and second respectively on the error and scored on Creevey’s single.
Campbell, Notre Dame’s starting and losing pitcher, ran into trouble in the fifth when the Staters pounded him for three runs. The uprising was featured 14 by a home run and double. The next inning saw the exit of Campbell and Mahannah came in to finish the game. ?
*
The last Irish run came in the ninth on Sheehan’s hit, McHale’s Texas leaguer, Pavela’s life at first on an error, , and Kelly's long fly.
Kozlik and Sheehan had the most sue- 1 cess with Roberts’ fast ball, each nicking him for two safeties.

Thomas J. Sheehan, catcher, stands 6-3, weighs 210 pounds, and is winding up his last season at Notre Dame. Tom captained the ’44 and ’46 Irish nines: Only 23 years old, Tom, who bats and throws right handed, has received many offers from the majors and hopes to tag on with one of them after he graduates in June. His home is in New Haven, Connecticut.
Raymond J. Petrzelka, 6-3, 183-pound first baseman, hails from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and has two more years of eligibility ahead of him. Ray, who throws and bats right handed, won his monogram last season. Age: 19.
Eugene R. Lavery, 5-10, 170-pound second-sacker, is a sophomore from Brooklyn, New York, where he played second base at Ebbets Field a few years ago when the Brooklyn High School Stars played a charity game against a hand-picked All-American Legion team. Gene throws right-handed but bats lefthanded. Age: 19.
George J. Schneider, 5-9, 165-pound shortstop from New York City, is ending his college playing days come June and graduation. George bats and throws right-handed. Age: 21.
Robert A. Klein, 6-1, 175-pound third baseman. is captain of this season’s team. Bobby bats and throws right-handed, and at present is leading the team in batting. He makes Buffalo, New York, his home. This is his last season with the Irish, but according to the major league scouts who have watched him in action, it won’t be his last on the diamond. Age: 24.
John L. Mayo, 6-1. 190-pound outfielder, hails from Youngstown, Ohio, and led the Irish hitters last season. “Jumbo” throws right-handed but bats out his hits left-handed. Another Kline-man who graduates this year has a professional baseball career ahead of him. Age: 21.

BY JOE CHENEY
Professor of mathematics at Notre Dame, Coach Kline is in his fourteenth season as head coach of baseball at Notre Dame. He was named head baseball coach in 1934 to succeed the late George E. Keogan, who wished to devote his full time to basketball coaching. Kline won baseball monograms at Notre Dame in 1915, 1916, and 1917, playing third base and hitting well ovei’ .300 all three seasons. He captained the 1917 team which won 10 games while losing 4.
The high point of Kline’s collegiate playing career was reached in 1916 when he hit three home nms to lead the Irish to a 14 to 6 victory over the University of Michigan. A fourth drive landed foul by inches or he would have had another homer.
Jake turned down an attractive offer to play with the Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League to go overseas in 1918 to serve with the infantry in World War 1. Upon his return he was named Director of Prep Athletics at Notre Dame, a position he held in 1920 and 1921.
Coach Kline played and managed a club in the Southern Minnesota League in 1922, played in California in 1923 and 1924, and from 1925 to 1930 played and managed various clubs in the Utah State League. He returned to Notre Dame in 1931 as freshman coach. He became varsity baseball coach in 1934.
Last year, as manager of the Bennington, Vermont, team in the Northern League, Kline’s team won the pennant, and this spring he was elected president of the Indiana-Michigan League, which is composed of outstanding semi-pro teams.
Coach Kline has enjoyed outstanding success in his thirteen seasons as head

In 1887 one Adrian Anson, then a student at the University of Notre Dame and later a star with the Chicago Cubs, showed the boys how to play a game called baseball, similar to rounders which was played with a stick and ball by any number of boys. That year marked the introduction of baseball history to a school which subsequently was to send forth some of the outstanding college teams of the nation and a creditable number of major league players.
Although considerable interest was shown in the game as the boys played it among themselves, no outside contests were scheduled until 1892 when Notre Dame defeated Michigan, 6 to 4, in the
20
only game played that season.
The period from 1906 to 1908 inclusive marked Notre Dame’s greatest success on the diamond. In these three years, the teams scored 60 victories to only 9 defeats. They won 20 games in each" of these seasons, five defeats in 1906, three in 1907 and only one in 1908, the greatest single season in Notre Dame history.
The 1908 team made a swing through the East and won over such outstanding teams as Williams, Dartmouth, Boston, Fordham, Syracuse and Georgetown, losing only to the University of Vermont in the middle of the trip.
Other good seasons were in 1900, with
13 victories in 16 games; 1902, with 16 out of 20; 1903, with 17 out of 22; 1910, with 19 out of 21; 1913, with 15 out of :' 18 and one tie; 1914, with 17 out of 22;
1916, with 16 out of 19; 1922, with 19'-out of 23; and 1936, with 16 out of 19. X Up until e present season, the Irish <had won 625, lost 306 and tied 13 games -in 58 seasons of baseball competition.

StdutienA- wun the. Pte&t,
 By JOE CHENEY—Scholastic Sports Editor
Since tomorrow is Derby Day in Louisville, Kentucky, we will devote this space to the Derby candidates which will parade to the post about four o’clock tomorrow afternoon, and also to the Derby hopefuls of yesteryear.
The morning broke without a cloud visible in the heaven, while a cool breeze was wafted over Churchill Downs tempering the increasing rays of the sun. It was just such a day in May, 1875, that the first Kentucky Derby was celebrated by the followers of the turf.
The course was in splendid order, and all the appurtenances requisite for the comfort and convenience of racing were ready for the big event. As the hour approached for the opening race, every avenue leading to the track was thronged with people, just as the avenues will be packed tomorrow.
15 Horses Start
Fifteen handsome horses were summoned to the starting barrier. H. P. McGrath’s entries had the call in the betting and many thought he would win with Chesapeake, but the other half of his entry, Aristides, the son of Leamington, carried off the honors and became one of the best three-year-olds ever stripped for a race in this country.
The first Kentucky Derby had a value of §3,100 compared to §126,000 in 1946. It will be over §100,000 again this year. The fifteen youngsters assembled at the half-mile pole nervously awaited the start. When they were marshalled into line, Col. W. H. Johnson, the official starter, tapped the drum and the horses got away like a platoon of cavalry, except the Baywood colt, who hung at the post. Volcano jumped away first, with McCreery second, and Searcher third. The remainder of the field were bunched closely behind. The horses came at a rapid rate down the stretch and past the stand. McCreery took the lead away from Volcano, who was now in second place, Searcher held on in the third slot, with Aristides moving up to fourth position.
Before they had gone far down the back stretch, Aristides leaped to the front and opened a gap of two lengths-Volcano was second, three lengths in front of Searcher. The pace was so hot that it began to tell on the rest of the field which were stretched over a good deal of ground. The race from this point
on was never in doubt. Aristides won by two lengths with jockey Oliver Lewis using the whip down the home stretch. Volcano ran second, a length in front of Verdigris, who closed a big gap on the inside during the final furlong. The official time for the race was 2 for- the mile-and-one-half distance.
Matt Winn, president of Churchill Downs, witnessed the first Derby and hasn’t missed a single “Race for the Roses” since then. In 1896, on the twenty-second anniversary of the Kentucky Derby, the distance was shortened from a mile-and-a-half to a mile-and-a-quarter, the present distance of the race.
Rain had fallen during the night and the track was muddy for last year’s Derby. Lord Boswell and Hampden were favored to win and the tote board showed that the bettors were following the form selections. Seventeen horses, one of the largest fields, answered the bugle’s call to the post. The rain had stopped by post time but the track was slow. As everyone probably remembers, Assault, who had been lying in fourth place from the start of the race, slipped through on the inside coming around the last turn for the final furlong and galloped home an easy winner with jockey Warren Mehrtens riding his first Derby winner. Spy Song, who led most of the distance, finished second ahead of Hampden. The Texas colt collected the highest purse, §96,000, ever rewarded to the Kentucky Derby winner.
Phalanx, Riskolator Stretch Bunners
Looking over tomorrow’s Derby entries, we can’t find any strong stretch runners outside of C. V. Whitney’s Phalanx and Circle M. Farm’s Riskolator. Warren Wright, who won the Derby back in 1941 with Whirlaway, one of the greatest stretch runners that ever performed on the American turf, will try again this yeai* with his hot-and-cold Faultless. Blue Border, a long-shot special which burned up the Saratoga track last summer as a 2-year-old, may surprise the bookies if he breaks better than he usually does when the barrier opens. Other standouts include William Helis’ Cosmic Bomb, E. O. Stice’s On Trust, Mrs. Mary Elizabeth Whitney’s Bullet Proof, Main Chance Farm’s Jet Pilot, and Mrs. Barley Douglas’ Secnav. Harry Warner, the movie man, bought Stepfather from another motion picture ex
ecutive, Mr. Mayer of Metro-Goldwyn and you-know who. But so far Stepfather hasn’t shown much in his Derby tune-ups.
John A. Kinard is pepped up with his entry, John’s Pride, but no one else seems to think too much of it. Louis Schlossers Milkwagon joe may end up behind a milk wagon Sunday morning. Ridgewood Stable’s Double Jay and Augustus and Nahm’s Count Rough will probably complete the field. Cornish Knight, the E. P. Taylor entry, is a doubtful starter.
If you’re interested in our choices, here they are: 1. Blue Border; 2. Phalanx; 3. Riskolator; and 4. Bullet Proof.
Shavin's From the Splinters
Next week we hope to combine the golf and tennis teams and devote the sports pages to these two Irish sports . . . Art Statuto has been on a special diet (he ate nothing for two whole days) trying to stay up on Coach Leahy’s first-string team ... If Red Sitko continues to go for those long jaunts through the Irish lines, he’ll land on quite a few All-American teams next fall . . . Amos Burrion, number two man on Father Hol-derith’s Notre Dame golf team, had to use a brassie during the first 17 holes last Saturday because he cracked his driver and decided not to use it. After* he cinched his match on the 17th, he changed his mind and used it. You guessed it, he drove a three-hundred-yard drive and ended up with a birdie for the 18th hole . . . The Notre Dame tracksters claimed that the competition at the Drake Relays was mighty stiff. Question of the Week: Who’s going to play with the Old-Timers against next year’s varsity on May 17th? From what we’ve heard, none of last year’s graduating players have any desire to play.

TRACKSTERS HOPE TO WHIP SPARTANS TOMORROW, AVENGE TWO DEFEATS
long barrier race. Notre Dame con- a. nected heavily in the shot as Luke Hig-. gins captured fourth and George Sullivan fifth with heaves of 48 feet 9% '
Notre Dame spikesters will travel to East Lansing tomorrow for their third and last attempt to administer a defeat to the powerful Michigan State Spartans. The Irish have suffered severely at the hands of the Spartans this season, dropping a close dual contest to them on March first for the first defeat ever given a local squad by Michigan State. A week later in the Central Col-legiates, N.D. permitted them to take their first C.C.C. title in 13 years.
The story should be different tomorrow. In the previous dual meet, the Irish failed to score in their usual manner, and put the load on the mile relay team, running the final event of the day. The relay team nervous and tense, fumbled a baton pass on the last lap giving the count to the Spartans. The local cindermen are close to their top form for the outdoor season, and should score more evenly throughout the contest tomorrow, carrying a favorable balance of points into the windup mile relay.
N.D. is counting on better performances in the shot, pole vault, and dashes to take the decision at Lansing. In the previous meet, George Sullivan and Luke Higgins were not in their normal form, and took second and third behind Michigan State which won "with a feeble toss of 47 feet, far below the usual efforts of the Irish weight men. The locals will be trying for a tie in the pole vault tomorrow, and the longer dashes of the outdoor oval are expected to yield more points to the Notre Dame cause. Tomorrow’s duel is the first non-relay appearance for N.D. since they met the Spartans on March first.
John Smith, captain of the local thin-lies, is again in shape, and may contribute strongly to the Irish cause. Smith suffered a leg injury in the last battle with Michigan State, and has only been able to compete in the meets of the past few weeks. He scored a win in the 120 yard high hurdles at the Kansas Relays, and took fifth last weekend at the Drake Relays. Drake was the first real test for Smith, and he gave a favorable performance running against Harrison Dilliard of Baldwin Wallace, Bill Porter of Northwestern, Clyde Scott of Arkansas and Augie Erfurth of Rice for fifth place in 120 yard high hurdles.
Notre Dame scored in the Drake Relays last week, but not as strongly as was expected. The mile relay and the four-mile squad failed to gain any points and the sprint relay, 880 relay, and two-mile teams failed to score. The mile
22
squad was eliminated in the Friday trials when Steve Provost ran into difficulties, and was spilled on a turn.
All of the Irish tallies were made on scores in the individual events. Besides Smith’s points, the hurdlers gained a fifth in the 440 yard stick race. Bob McDavid carried the Irish hopes in the
VET’S CLUB GOLF TOURNEY BEGINS FRIDAY; ENTRY DEADLINE TODAY
By PETE BROWN
At 5:30 this afternoon, entries are closed for the Vet Club Golf Tournament. After you finish reading this first paragraph, mount your trusty pony and gallop across the campus to the golf shop in the Rockne Memorial and deposit 75 cents with one of the Vet Club money changers. Large denomination bills do not frighten them. They are all Commerce men, and have been well trained in the manipulation of the coin of the realm.
If you have not ventured into the golf shop prior to reading this, here is the information and background on Keel’s dream. President Hank Keel of the Vet Club and Mr. John Turley of Latin syntax fame put their heads together and decided that the pros, semi-pros, amateurs and dubbers of the campus should have something to shoot at. The first idea was a handicap tournament as reported earlier in the Scholastic, but after several days of consideration, a straight match play tournament blossomed forth as the answer.
The next step was to pick some strong shoulders on which to unload the burden of managing the tournament. Joe Doyle of St. Eds. and Bob Sesterhan of Dillon stepped forth to fill the bill.
The tournament is open to all students except members of Fr. Holderith’s sand blasters. Qualifying rounds started today at 12:30 p. m., and will finish Sunday at dark. The score that each player turns in will determine the flight in which he will compete. Each qualifier’s honesty is assumed when he turns in his score.
The owners of the top 32 qualifying scores will be matched in the Championship Flight. For the unlucky 16 who are eliminated in the first round of the Championship Flight, there will be a consolation flight. The remainder of the
inches and 49 feet 614 inches respectively. Higgins has improved steadily throughout the season. The other score came in the two-mile run, in which Cornie Styerstook fifth. The two-mile was run on Friday. Next week the Irish " will have the only home meet of the season if the pending contest with Pittsburgh materializes.
golfers with 75 cents deposited in the Vet Club coffers, and a qualifying score for 18 holes, will be placed in flights of 16 each until the manpower supply is exhausted.
Several merchants of greater South Bend have donated trophies for the winners of the various flights. The trophies will bear no markings of the winner’s score. Only the flight number and the winner’s name will be engraved. Therefore the winner of flight 26 will not be ashamed to show his trophy because his winning score was 173.

Notre Dame’s power-laden tennis team lived up to advance notices with smash-Ot ing victories over Western Michigan andM§ Michigan State on the Irish courts. Mon-®? day, April 28, the squad journeyed togfe
Madison to meet the University of Wis-®^
consin.
In the Western Michigan match on^^' April 24 Notre Dame made a clean®!, sweep of the singles and took two out|g& of three doubles in winning 8-1. Theg^ Irish team of J. Evert, G. Evert, David, Tully, Caparo, and Brown was never^^ pressed in winning its singles matches-Wf
The Evei-ts combined to dispose of th^^ Stuckert brothers in two easy 6-2, 6-lg sets in the doubles. David and Tully®® then whitewashed their Bronco oppo nents in two sets. Jankowski and Pos-3 tema salvaged the last match of the aft
, ernoon when they bested Notre Dame’s *' Griffin and Lyons 6-3, 7-5.
Notre Dame defeated Michigan State ? 6-3 on Saturday. The Irish garnered five straight points in the singles before Elliot of State outlasted Brown 1-6, 6-4, 6-3. Notre Dame was strengthened by ■ the return to action of Chuck Samson who had been out of the Western Michigan match -with an injury. Samson * swept aside his opponent 6-2, 6-1.
Michigan State rallied in the doubles, taking two of the three matches. After Jimmy and Gerry Evert won 6-2, 6-3, Spartan netsters defeated the duos of Tully and Samson, Caparo and Griffin.
Dillon, Farley Lead Interhall Softball
Softball play began in the Interhall Leagues last week and after a week of play most of the teams had seen action. Though the league races had not as yet taken a definite form, it must be conceded on the basis of early returns that Dillon in the Western division and Farley in the Eastern division seem to be the best organized teams in Interhall play and this always is a main factor. •
Dillon got off to a good start with an J opening game no-hitter against Walsh, 8-0, and also won handily from Badin * 11-6. Morrissey appeared to be long on ' power but shy on pitching as they beat Alumni 10-6 and Walsh 14-10 after- losing the opener to Badin 6-5. Walsh has a 2-2 record having stopped Lyons 2-1 and Alumni 6-3 as well as losing to Dillon and Morrissey. Badin, Lyons, and 4 Alumni each have one win and two loss' es. Howard, the other team in the Western division, failed to field a team.
In the Eastern division, Farley Wals', loped Cavanaugh 19-6, and stomped St. Ed’s 13-9 to give them a clear record. The Off-Campus entry from Vetville v- have a 2-1 record. They beat Zahm 126 and St. Ed’s 15-9. St. Ed’s topped Cavanaugh 4-3, and Zahm 7-6 before losing to Off-campus and Farley. Cavanaugh had a 1-2 record going into Monday’s game with B-P. B-P has no official record as yet.	.
Play this year will consist 'of a round robin, i. e. all teams play each other twice, and then the top four teams in each division will stage a Shaughnessey playoff. The winners of these playoff games -will play against each other for the championship on the Field Day, May 18.

Asks Student Buyers' Strike to Lower Prices
A new note in the drive to lower prices was struck last week by a Florida Marine Captain, Captain Gerard A. Armitage. A graduate of S’t. James Catholic High school of Haverhill, Mass., and Boston College, he called upon Catholic college students to lower prices through a pledge not to buy clothing, not to patronize expensive restaurants, theatres, or clubs until prices have been reduced from 10 to 12 percent.
Fearful of a pending economic collapse heralded by the unprecedented skyrocketing of prices, Armitage believes that students can make their beliefs felt through a concerted effort

against these prices. Students, who represent millions in dollar value to clothing merchants and entertainment vendors, have the power to turn the tide toward lower prices. He urged that Catholic colleges take the lead; that they form committees in their schools and encourage participation. “No business could survive in the face of such determined opposition,” Armitage said.
Armitage urges that students pledge themselves to keep the vow for six months, “unless before that time, prices deflate from ten to twelve percent, and the school committee abolishes the pledge.” He insists that the drive be not confined only to the college towns during the school year, but that hometown and vacation spot merchants should also be made aware of the pressure.

Dr. Nutting’s ' new book emphasizes that capitalism has gained' -luxuries for the
American people than economic freedom,', and if the people of this nation prefer.^ economic freedom to large-scale capital-^ ism they will have to sacrifice some ofc these comforts.	.
In his new book, Dr. Nutting points-:’ out that the basis of our American gov--ernment is founded on the theory that', each ordinary citizen of the nation who, £ so desires can be his own economic boss
— that is, can earn his own living from his own property. This theory, he claims, is not substantiated by large-scale capitalism in which many people’^ are employed by a few.

A SHORT GALLUP
The Metropolitan Club is having more trouble in whipping up a club meeting than the New York Giants are having in winning a ball game. A week ago they tried, had to ask the night watchman to put away his comics long enough to make a fourth at bridge. Last Wednesday night they tried again, couldn’t find the nightwatchman.
Armed with a broken-down mine detector, a copy of the New York Times and a letter-of-introduction from the Blue Circle we proceeded to fine-tooth the campus for shy New Yorkers. Hidden away in the crevices of this institution we found over 300. Boldly we asked, “Why weren’t you present at the last Met Club meeting?” Borrowing the style of the hermetic HUMANIST, we herewith gallup forth with a few informal

THE MAN WITH THE MIKE
Bill Halligan, station WND’s new sportscaster, is rapidly becoming a poor man’s Bill Stern.
Handsome, popular, Mennen-user Halligan has been in the Streamlined Sports slot only three weeks, is already cutting in on jumping Joe Boland’s sports audience. The only reason that can be given for Bill’s immediate success is that he is everything that Bill Stern isn’t. Seemingly, this qualification would be like giving a guy a kick in the pants when you intended to give him a pat on the back. But not with Bill Halligan.
“You see,” diagnoses Bill, “Stern always tells a story something like this: Tn 1923, a young boy noticed a shabby foreigner stretched out in the gutter. Using his last fifty cents, the youngster bought that foreigner a steak supper (they were cheaper then), his first in
many months. Twenty years later, a wounded American soldier lay in the battlefield of Iwo Jima. A Jap, gun in hand, found him, stooped over the lifeless body ready to give it a “good measure” blow. He hesitated—that was the same boy that had given him the steak dinner in ’23. And do you know who that Japanese soldier was? It was Bwongoo Fiiji, the greatest dart thrower ever to wear a dart uniform’.”
Now, when Bill Halligan tells a story it goes something like this: : The player lay on the football field. An opponent, football in hand, tripped over him, hesitated — then shoved his foot into the joker’s mouth, kicking his tonsils right between his larynx.”
That’s the way Bill pulls ’em in every Wednesday afternoon at 2:30 p. m. over WSBT. In the control room he’s assisted by Frank Cronan and Pete Reiner. Check the results yourself next week.

History Department To Have Final Talks
The “Notion of the State in Latin American History” will be the topic for the final history discussion of the year 4 to be held in the law auditorium Tuesday 3 evening, May 6, at 8 P. M. Leaders in . the discussion will be Professor Thomas ; E. Downey of the Department of History f and Professor Walter Langford of the " Department of Modern Languages. The r chairman for the discussion will be i. ’ Father Philip S. Moore, c.s.c., the Dean of the Graduate School.	;
Dr. Downey, who will open the discus- / sion, gave a very interesting lecture on : Peron and Argentina earlier in the year. He received his doctorate at the Univer- • sity of California where he studied under the direction of Dr. Herbert Bolton, the noted authority on Latin American his- , tory. He has in preparation a study of early Mexican history and a textbook on ; Latin American history. He will begin his discussion with a sketch of the notions of the State in the old Spanish !, kingdoms of Aragon and Castile, and trace the developments through the vice- 2 regal period in the new world down to | the close of the colonial period.	I
Professor Langford, who has combined X historical studies in Latin American his- jS tory with his studies in Spanish language and literature, will be the direc- S tor of the Notre Dame Summer School F in Mexico this summer. He has spent much time in the country south of the Rio Grande and taught classes in Latin American history before concentrating inS the field of Spanish literature. He will^ take up the discussion where Dr. Downey leaves off and outline the notion of the® state in republican Latin America. He 8. will give special attention to the notion®7 of the state as evolved in Argentina. W This will have special interest not onlyW because the Argentines have produced® most of the studies on political theory of S' the region but also because the recent® developments in Argentina have at-S tracted world-wide interest to the cur-S rent regime of Peron.	S ,
This discussion will complete the series® ■ of discussions which have been conducted® under the auspices of the Department®-
26
of History on the general topic of “The Notion of the State in the Various Periods of History.” These discussions have been well attended and the student participation and faculty interest have stimulated much interest in the general topic as well as the special phases which - have been analyzed in the meetings. The recent meeting on the “Notion of the State in American History,” led by Father Thomas T. McAvoy, C.S.C., and Dr. Aaron I. Abell, attracted a large attendance and provoked a discussion that was checked only by the intervention of the Chairman, Professor John Sheehan, because of the lateness of the hour.
Villagers Club to Elect
Officers Next Wednesday
Members of the Villagers club are urged to “get out and vote” this Wednesday, May 7, at the annual election meeting of the organization at 7 p. m. in the Law auditorium.
Last-minute stumping for candidates, and blotter-passing activities by them proceed unchecked, with a multitude of individuals nominated for the various offices.
Presidential nominees are Tom Hynes, of 414 Peashway, who distinguished himself by his efficient handling of the recent testimonial banquet for the Irish basketball squad; Art Clark of 1909 Donald st., for the past year the club’s representative on the student council; and Mike Riordan of 117 W. North Shore Drive, popular and hard-working member who served on practically all committees extant during the school year.
Candidates for the other offices are too numerous to mention, but the complete slate may be obtained from retiring president Fred Tansey, or secretary Ed Chartier.
Notre Dame Press Here;
Product of Press Club
A new experiment in journalism appeared on the campus last week with ■ the sparse distribution of the NotreDame Press, a two page product of the Press Club, edited by J. R. Houghteling.
While the paper has no regular publication date and does not attempt campus circulation, the lead editorial expresses the hope that it can show how a “daily or three-times-a-week newspaper . . . would present the day’s news to those who ought to have it.”
President of the Press is N. F. Digby, and its purpose, according to the edito
rial, is “to give journalism majors the experience of working on an actual newspaper, in a newspaper manner and with a newspaper* style.”

Daylight Saving Time! Everyone seemed to make the transition painlessly last Sunday, but consternation gripped our hearts when we thought of the Cistercian Monks in Rhode Island, who regularly rise at two in the morning. That, you may remember, was the fatal hour when time changed. Think of them rising on that black morning as usual, and finding two a. m. had disappeared!
The National Association of Manufacturers has been advertising widely the question ‘-Who wants the closed shop?” Not the Public, they exclaim, not the workers, nor members of the unions, nor manual workers. All that is left, as far as we can see, are the manufacturers, and we can’t quite talk ourselves into that. They also offer (free!) a copjT of “Americans Won’t Stand for Monopolies.” We assume this is another expose of unions, but when you remember some of the associated manufacturers (A.T.&T., U.S. Steel, Alcoa, etc.)

there’s a possibility7 it is a collection of confessions.
We’re hiding our dirty dry7 cleaning under the bed these days. With the South Bend cleaners madly slashing each other’s throats; offering enticing discounts, first 10%, then 20%, now 25%; we’re just waiting. As soon as they offer to plant a nice, gleaming five dollar gold piece in the change pocket of all submitted suits (and they’ll get there) we’re off with our load.
While chastely sitting by our radio the other evening, a syrupy arm swept from the loudspeaker and delicately crushed us against the console. Frank Stewart, Priddy-Tompsett’s own shiek of the airways, was loose again. Running his aetherial fingers through our locks he told us of Mother. He compared Her a to battleship. Like a battleship She is always ready to guard her little flock of destroyers. A bitter tear trickled down our cheek, and dropped onto the blotter like a comet, which, after fluttering through the skies at last arrives in a sea of crystal Karo. His gorgeous, sweeping swirls of gummy prose left us weeping ac our Philco, unashamedly, until our prefect heard our sobs, and forcing brandy down our throats, recalled us to reality. “Raphael, Rembrandt, Priddy, the great artists,” kept pounding in our brain. “A thing of beauty is a joy forever.” John Keats spun in his grave, like a lathe, and our heart throbbed for the timeless beauty of a Priddy-Tompsett sepia.
Half our room is now blocked out with stacks of Priddy masterworks, and we can’t afford to lose the space. Wouldn’t someone like a picture of us, a picture that captures us in a moment of fetching melancholy? And- besides, “nineteen is such a beautiful age!”
Notre Dame has had three pictures in the Collegiate Digest, that tabloid discreetly inserted into the inners of the Scholastic.- Number one was of a football game. Number two was of a weight lifter. Number three was of the Bengal Bouts. Is this a plot to carry on in the public eye Notre Dame’s great tradition of “the university attached to a stadium.”
We ran into a surprising picture caption in a recent newspaper. “At the Mas-

in the caf Saturday a friend asked us if it really was a student who wrote Iasi week’s letter about “More Snow.” We assured him that, to th3 best of our knowledge, the gentleman did exist. ' “Gee,” our friend said, “I’d like to meet a person that naive. I’ve got some gold bricks I’d like to show him.”
We were more than slightly surprised to read in last week’s Scholastic of Dr. Milton Burton’s demand for a world government as the only way of keeping peace. Imagine, a professor of Notre Dame advocating in public something as radical as a world government! We have always felt that an educational institution should be officially neutral in matters of politics, but since Universal Notre Dame Night we have had a sneaking suspicion that the Chicago Tribune (speaking through the Ave Maria, perhaps) was Notre Dame’s official policy maker.

In recent weeks both the “College Parade” and “The Week” have had their fingers slapped in public, and we feel a little neglected. It’s not that we don’t write controversial columns, it’s just that we write them so controversial that they are censored. Not too long ago we point-. ed out the slight disparity between the principle of the Living Wage and the distinctly sub-Living Wage paid to University employees. It was, of course, censored by the cowards in the main office. Last week we launched a low-minded, rather depraved campaign against the speeches of Universal Notre Dame Night. It was also censored. This week we wrote an item telling all about the censored items and it was censored. Now we know why Voltaire left the Catholic Church and made his famous comment on freedom of the press. He had been a columnist on a Catholic college magazine.

Cardinal Tisserant Here
(Continued from page 7) sented at this extraordinarily uncommon function. As secretary of the Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Church, Cardinal Tisserant heads the office to which are referred all matters and problems pertaining to persons, discipline and the various rites of the Eastern Church which is in communion with Rome.
The purpose of his visit to this country, according to the Cardinal, is to encourage and promote the unity and spiritual welfare of the Catholics of the various rites of the Church in the NearEast. Inasmuch as these minorities have clung to their union with Rome despite great disadvantages and even persecution, they deserve recognition and sympathetic understanding on the psat of Western Catholics. His Eminence on the occasion of this visit is attempting to meet as many as possible of the priests of the various Eastern rites and to encourage them to remain firm in their own liturgical practices.
The Cardinal made previous visits to the United States in 1927 and 1931 under the auspices of the Carnegie Foundation, which was working in conjunction with him toward the modernization of the Vatican Library. During that
visit he made a wide tour of American and Canadian libraries to study systems of classification, cataloguing, etc. He also addressed the American Library Association. One of his objectives, the Cardinal maintains, is to renew fellowship with the many scholars who visited the Vatican Library during his tenure.
The Cardinal is attended on this lour by the Rt. Rev. Msgr. Thomas J. McMahon of New York, director of the Catholic Near East Welfare Association and Fr. Augustine Arcibao, Procurator General of the Fathers of Mercy.

INTO THE LIGHT . . .
Blue Circle, campus honor society, this week shrugged off the cloak of anonymity that it had assumed all year long and stepped into the limelight. At the traditional Communion Breakfast last Sunday, Father Cavanaugh, President of the University, presented pins to thirty members of the hard-working organization, local whipping-boy for the Student Council. Though tendered a special invitation to attend, Joe Wilcox, Scholastic Feature Editor and arch enemy of the Circle, declined, stating, ‘“I am afraid that my acid typewriter might take a turn for the better, leaving me an enemy of nobody.”

JUST THINKING . . .
We have come to the conclusion that some people worry too much . . . the time to start worrying really is when the ink runs out of your lifetime pen . . . but even if it won't write, it will keep the cigars in your pocket from being broken . . . Medical science offers proof positive . . . research has proven that blondes have 104,000 hairs, brunettes 102,000, and redheads only 88,000. Wonder how men stack up in this department? . . . ’Tis said that a man’s best friends are his teeth and his hair, but even the best of friends fall out sometime . . . hair today, gone tomorrow, we guess.
THE DOWNTRODDEN REBEL . . .
Last week, Army brass was around trying to round up talent to form an 11OTC unit here on campus. In their days of toil, they succeeded in inducing 100 men to sign on the dotted line. Let’s see, 100 divided by 4,600 . . . about 2% . . . No wonder the Army is for compulsory military training.
A WORD TO THE WISE ...
With tonight’s Junior Prom being followed in two weeks by the Senior Ball, Notre Darners are being bothered by an apparent lack of Sen-Sen around town to rid breath of tell-tale give-away to prefrolic activities. ’Tis said that a dab of Mum placed under the tongue does won- ■ ders. Other Remedies?—Rinse out with Lifebuoy.
Baseball season is with us once more, but still a shy scoreboard hides ’way out on the left field foul line, 500 feet from the stands. Is there a chance of getting it moved in about 50 yards? To be able to read it out there we’d have to be 1-A.

IRISH TRIUMPH . . .
Notre Dame, home of nationally known football, basketball, baseball, track, golf, and tennis teams, this week seeks to conquer an aesthetic crown by sending its only 100% Irish squad to West Point for the Invitational Meet for debate teams sponsored by Army. Finn and Kelley lead Professor Sommer’s group, and not a Toplitzky among them!
Last Sunday was Shove-clock-ahead-lose-an-hour-of-sleep Day. Really conscientious studes arose at 2:00 a. m. to advance the clock an hour as instructed by the local periodical, the South Bend Trib.
The Indiana Daily Student comes up with the following quote: “At last our school has become self-supporting. The report that campus buildings would be erected with funds collected from liquor taxes assures us of cooperative school backing.” Ahem!

A meeting has been scheduled for next | Thursday evening, May 8th, in the Law | Building for the purpose of electing offi- | cers for the next school year.	j

LETTERS
(Continued from page 3.)
Admittedly a large segment of the University population are simply not equipped to understand much of what appears in literary form but I do not see that the Scholastic must emphasize the uncouthness of the trade school type of mind.
The heavy-handed and, in large part, listless parody “More Snow” (Apr. 18) aside from being in poor taste is an obvious collaboration with the uncultivated minds on campus who, discovering the writing in The Juggler too rich for their intellects, find salve in the ridicule clumsily applied by your magazine. It is not expected that the writing in a journalistic publication should be so fine as that appearing in a literary magazine, but it would be more graceful for the Scholastic to stand humbly and quietly by, rather than giggling self-consciously like a frustrated scrub. The line drawn between humor and bad taste is not so fine that the bifocaled editors of Scholastic cannot see it . . .

Sirs:
A letter by Richard Elliott concerning myself and an article I wrote appeared
in the last issue of the Scholastic. It seemed to indicate disapproval. Although no defense is necessary for such a puny, inane attack, I would like to make a few comments.
Do I know the difference between an .88 and a peashooter? Yes. An .88 is an electrified particle formed when a neutral Irish Terrier loses or gains atoms. A peashooter, on the other- hand, is the middle division of the small ostracoderm between the duodenum and ileum. Does Mr. Elliott know the difference between “install” and “provide?” (I really don’t care, but I thought it would give him something to work on for the next few weeks).
Mr. Elliott wisely mentioned that “any guy who gets hit in the puss with the butt of an Ml rifle isn’t really going to feel good about it, if at all.” Since I didn’t say that the person so struck did feel good, I suppose Mr. Elliott mentioned this merely to impart to us some of his vast store of knowledge.
Snow in the South Pacific? We should not question the acts of God.
Concerning the twenty-three explosions that broke the still air, the comment was: “What are these guys? Quiz kids? Or have they got an adding machine . . .?” Myself and most of the people I know are able to count to
twenty-three without trouble. If Mr. Elliott is unable to manage this feat without the aid of an adding machine, well, that is unfortunate, but hardly my fault.
I can’t answer Mr. Elliott’s comment about the Japanese soldier on his way to the White House. He seemed to have become so excited and so infatuated with his letter by that time that it is completely unintelligible to me, I have no doubt it was very profound.
I must thank Mr. Elliott for his deep interest in my life, for it has spurred me on to further effort towards completing my autobiography. When it is completed Mr. Elliott, and anyone else with his burning interest, may have an autographed copy for 85.00.
Mr. Elliott mistakenly called me the editor of the article. I will make no comment on that, since most college students, and most grade school students too, can make the fine distinction between the editor and the writer of a story.
The part of the letter that hurt me was where Mr. Elliott intimated that I had incorrectly called a rifle a gun. That sort of thing has been a sore spot with me ever since I inadvertently called for a “tent peg” when I should have said “peg, tent, M1A6.” In the story I was correct for, as a matter of fact, the guns the men picked up were 16inchers that

had been salvaged from the battleship USS Oklahoma, sunk at Pearl Harbor. Mr. Elliott’s great rage and righteous indignation concerning this unpardonable sin was due to a misinterpretation (an accomplishment at which he is deft).
Mr. Elliott went to great lengths to impress us all that HE was in the service during the war, and that was manifestly his only purpose in writing his letter. My congratulations.

To the Editor:
Most of the larger colleges in the United States have bookstores where current books, both popular and technical, can be bought or rented for a nominal fee. Since it is the policy of the local Book Store to supply only class texts and inasmuch as the Library, due to limited funds, cannot meet the wide student demand fox- “just off the press” books, it would seem that a book store of this nature would be a worthy enterprise. Surely 4,500 students and 500 or more faculty members could support a thriving store where books could be examined casually and bought without having to stand in line for hours.
Among several i ecommendations, these seem the most feasible: the store could be an independent concern financed and supervised by a publishing house. Or it might be a student enterprise, completely and wholly. The students could share in the profits and work as clerks. The former plan has worked unusually well for many universities and schools while the latter has not been tried, so far as I know.
A very workable plan is that found at Columbia. There a rental library is a part of the University Library, while a browsing corner is provided for in the bookstore proper.
One thing is certain. Students and faculty should have the freedom to browse among the stock and the store itself should be large enough physically for a varied topical list of both current and timeless books to be displayed openly and without the inconvenience of having to ask for a specific book.
Another pleasing, though harder to realize portion of this enterprise would be a record shop in conjunction with the store.
As for location, there are few available locations on campus, at least at the present time. The basement of the library seems the most logical place even though it would subtract from the much needed classroom space. The most inter
esting and likely place would be the old Carroll study hall. As things now stand the Badin Hall bookstore is by no means large or adequate enough for the addition of a proposed current book corner. ’
Regardless of the objections and the barriers to such an undertaking, I think we all agree Notre Dame sorely needs a good bookstore where all books may be bought and not just the few particular ones used in classes.
