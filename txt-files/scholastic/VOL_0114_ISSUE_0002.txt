Columbus, Ohio (AP)-Julie Eisenhower, President Nixon's younger daughter, says . she would be willing to die in com­bat to save the South Vietnam­ese government. 
Mrs. Eisenhower, here for a speech Tuesday to· a Kiwanis women's gathering, was asked at a news conference if she would be "willing to die for the Thieu regime." She replied, "Yes, I would," and went on to defend Nixon's policy of gradual withdrawal. (South Bend Tribune). 

Following her statement to Colum­bus · news, Julie . Eisen bomber received a person-to-person call from the White House. Clutching the phone to_her ear for several minutes, she once muttered "Yes," then hung up. She immediately called for a press · conference. Three reporters came.

Ascent of Mount Savior 
Near Elmira, New York, ~n the high, sharp-edged, tree-blariketed mountains, above the lovely Che­mung river valley, there is a small Benedictine Monastery called Mount Savior, the Mount of the Transfi­guration. It is set on a spectacular hilltop, perched between -a ravine plunging down to· the Chemung on one side and· a deep valley on the ­other, where Hendy Creek is only about a mile from the River. The rugged scenery, looking out upon the mountains and the lush valleys. that wind among them, is breath­taking. 
This past summer five Notre pame students and I found our way to the narrow road that climbs a steep wooded ravine out of !Iendy Creek · valley. We wound our way up:, be­yond the trees, ·past rather steep fields of knee-high grass, grazing cows, newly planted corn, two red farm houses and a barn. ·At the top of· the road we· came_ upon· an un-· usual assortment of buildings tucked into a level patch just below the crest of the hill,:off to the northwest. An old white farmhouse was hunched up next to a long rectan­gular white stucco structure: the old monastery, now the guest house. A chapel -in the form of a perfect­ly· symmetrical Byzantine cross gleamed white in the sun, stand­ing out sharply against the land­scape.· Behind the chapel, nestled into a dug-out hollow were two modern, almost rakish buildings: the -new monastery, connected . to· each· other and to the·· ·chapel by a tunnel built into the side of the 
hollow. 
The scene was extremely quiet. 
Only the ceaseless swishing of the 
hilltop wind through the trees 
and the distant muttering of the 
farm tractors as they threaded 
their way .through the fields in­
truded upon the silence. Occasion­
ally, figures robed in grey and black 
could be glimpsed striding pur­
p o s e f u 11 y about the grounds. 
Moving_ more slowly and -method-.

clad ·in grey-cowled work habits·. ­

The farm is not romantic. In fact, it smells of manure; and is full of flies. 1:et, some of my simplest and most strikirig memories are of the farm; ·watching a gasping calf,

Today, Mt: Savior-is a dairy farm. A squat, horse-shoe sliaped new barn lies just a little to ·the east of the main buildings. Farther away js a high vaulted, three story barn of the old fashioned variety, used for stor­ing hay and equipment. The sloped fields that make up the farm are beautiful but the hilltop soil is rocky and poor, good only for raising grasses and corn.

The black figures again filled the -cross-shaped chapel, forming two un­connected semi-circles on either.side

Finally, there is the question as to wl\ether or not the Kersten ad­ministration will finish its term. There have been rumors that Ker­

. sten and his cronies are planning 
· an evacuation of the student govern­ment offices. Certainly, Kersten him­self did not want the job. He tried to withdraw on the eve of the run­off election last spring, but was forced. to stay because he failed to inform the election committee in time. ' 
Thus, there is the possibility that he will retire. The possibility raises many · questions. Who will succee.d him if Ed Gray also resigns, as is rumored? Who would select his successor? Under the new Constitu­tion which is pending Senate ap­proval, the selection would be made 
·by the Board of Commissioners. 
·Regardless of who does the choos­ing, it can only be hoped that if Ker­sten does retire, it will not be in favor of those he satirized. One thing is certain: a return of the "old bureaucracy" would destroy any

Onward Christian Housing 
They are pwying a ganie. They are pwying at not playing a game. If I slww them, I see they are, I shall break the rules and they will punish me. I must play their game, of not seeing I see the game. 
from Knots by R. D. Laing 

Rumor, that most penetrating of all humanity's vices, has had it of late, at least among undergraduates, that student housing under the Dome has become a problem of some mild concern to the community at large. It would seem that Notre Dame, being the unique intellectual institu­tion which it is, has been beset by yet another incongruity. It remains today one of the few stalwart uni­versities across the nation at which housing has become ~ non-problem problem. In marked contrast to a nationwide trend toward off-campus living which last year left some 300,­000 beds empty on college campuses, generating financial difficulties for most, Notre Dame enjoyed the lux­ury of having every available bed 
filled. . 
A non-problem, yes? No· ... a non-problem problem. For on;;.cam­pus housing, ·far. from .being under-booked, has evolved this fall into an from the Office of Student Affairs overcrowded and cramped situation. stated that anyone wishing less This is, of course, seemingly uncom-· • crowded housing could contact that fortable for the 225-250 freshmen department for new room assign­who have been forced into six-man ments.

THE SCHOLASTIC 

are numerous, though, according to administrative sources, they were due to circumstances "beyond our control." Yet some reasons for the mix-up may be surmised. First of all, fewer students than usual chose to move off-campus this school year, while none were forced to move off as in previous years. Furthermore, last year's Badin and Walsh resi­dents, given the opportunity to choose the hall of their desire, did so, their former homes becoming the il­lustrious women's residences on cam­pus. Lastly, freshmen dorm quotas, normally declared in the spring, were either never made public, or simply went unheeded. In the past, the number of students moving off-cam­pus coupled with those who either transfer, dropout or stopout have balanced out with the number of in­coming transfers and freshmen. This year the numbers game was miscal­culated, and, though administrative "shake-ups" seem to indicate that some one person was responsible for the bogus math, inside sources de­clare no. Be that as it may, Fr. 
boys clean up their act." The solu­tion to the housing dilemma seems to lie not in number reductions or development campaigns, but in for­cibly moving some students off-cam­pus. Obviously, if continued enroll­ment of women is a prime objective and if erection of a new dorm is impossible, another bastion of mas­culinity will, of necessity, be sur­rendered to the ladies. How chival­ric! Perhaps one could even sur­mise which dorm will be next to wave the white flag by simply con­sidering Fr. Hesburgh's words at a recent administrative meeting. He stated that he had previously been an R.A. of Walsh Hall, later, rector of Badin and finally rector of Far­ley. But, regardless of which dorm falls, overcrowding remains an in­surmountable problem if some stu­dents are not forced off campus. In the past, overcrowded situations were resolved by evicting from the campus those students with the low­est grade point averages. However, complaints from legal circles were 
registered as to the. impartiality of . this procedure, and thus a lottery rather than a grade point average will be the determining factor this 
spring. 
The coming year may witness sev­
eral other housing innovations as 
well, of which the most widely pro­
moted is an experimental co-educa­
tional dorm. Both the HPC and Hall 
Rectors have organized study groups 
to investigate the pros and cons of 
co-ed (salt ·and pepper type) living, 
and Alumni Hall has been benevolent 
enough to volunteer its services 
should the occasion arise. Experi­
mental study dorms as well as living 
arrangements of small groups are 
also being discussed. Hopefully, this 
investigational phase will, in the 
future, flower into productive hous­
ing innovations, allowing the student 
a choice between a variety of living 
situations.

Chambers's position as director of .------------------------------­
Student Housing has been revamped by Mr. Faccenda. As Fr. Chambers himself resigned this summer to work for his comprehensives in a doctoral program in Administrative Education, the office of Student Af­fairs is now headed by Fr. Riehle, who is concerned with the dormitory buildings, and Fr. Flanigan, who is director of rectors and resident as­sistants. 
According to Fr. Riehle, the over­crowded situation is not expected to recur next fall even though fresh­men quotas will not be cut back nor the predicted number of incoming women reduced. Currently some 1300 men enter the University annually and, hopefully, some 300 women. Riehle, considering campus housing problems, discounted as financially unfeasible the possibility of erecting a new dorm to handle the overflow of students. He cited the substantial $3½ million building debt for Grace Hall as the basis for his judgment. However, he was emphatic in ex­pressing hope that the number of women on campus would steadily rise, and further stated that the in­creasing communication between Notre Dame men and women has resulted in improved language, ha­bits, and, in general, "has helped the

Making Christmas Merry 
A child is particularly observant on Christmas morning as gifts are opened. If he doesn't receive as many gifts as each of his confreres, he is likely to be depressed and per­plexed. 
Judging affection by the number of gifts is a stage .we all should grow out of; yet to a mentally retarded individual, this can be as important as the love that it reflects. The fami­lies of some mentally retarded chil­dren can afford to be generous with their gifts on Christmas, but certain others find it difficult to simply pro­vide for necessities. Since a simple gift means so much to these people, the Mental Health Association of St. Joseph County is sponsoring a pro­gram to present each of the 1,200 patients at the Dr. Norman M. Beatty Hospital with Christmas gifts. The association is planning to distribute the gifts at a party for the entire hospital on December 19. 
Needless to say, the association cannot fulfill its promise without a good deal of help. They are asking for new gifts of any sort, which will then be sorted and wrapped by a volunteer staff during the week pre­ceding the party. Aides who know and have been working with the patients will then help in selecting three gifts for each person, two gifts that he needs ( a housecoat, slippers, etc.), and one that he has requested. 
Though the hospital is run by fed­eral and state agencies, _the Mental Health Association is a volunteer organization working with and through the individual hospitals. In addition to the Christmas party, they

Affairs of the Dome 

Affairs of the Dome 
·Affairs of the Dome Affairs of the Dome Affairs of the Dome 
SHORTLY after the close of the spring semester the administration was hard at work reorganizing itself. Changes were many, or at least more than usual. The most notable change was the appointment of Dr. Phillip Faccenda as Acting Vice-President for Student Affairs. 
The importance of his position in the life of a typical student can be seen in the number of influential people who comprise his central staff. The Director of Student Services, James Shilts, CSC, the Dean of Students and the Director of Housing, James L. Riehle, CSC, and the Director of Campus Ministry, William Toohey, CSC, are but a few of the personnel under Faccenda. 
How did Phillip Faccencla attain this important ad­ministrative post? When Father Blantz resigned as Vice-President for Student Affairs to return to teaching, a search committee was formed to nominate a suc­cessor. The committee was instructed by Father Hes­burgh to give preference in their selection to a Holy Cross priest. 
The reasons for Hesburgh's instruction were three­fold. First, he wished to further one more Notre Dame tradition. "My position has always been filled by a Holy Cross priest," notes Faccenda. The bulk of the people serving the Vice-President are clerics, which is another reason for seeking a priest. Finally, a religious is much more closely connected with the Notre Dame campus. "Most of the duties of the Vice Presiden~ involve even­ing hours when a layman should be at home with his family," states Faccenda. 
The search committee, chaired by Dean Thomas Shaffer of the Notre Dame Law School, was unsuccess­ful in finding a suitable, permanent replacement. In mid-May, Father Blantz suggested that an Acting Vice­President be appointed to ser~e while the committee continued the search. Dr. Faccenda was the appointee. 
DR. Faccenda is no stranger to Notre Dame. In 1952, he received a Notre Dame degree in mechanical engineering. He was a member of the varsity track team for three years. After graduation, he studied law at Loyola University and received his Doctor of Juris­prudence degree in 1957. This led him to a partnership in the LaSalle Street law firm that bears his name. 
Faccenda has held several elected positions in Notre Dame organizations. In 1959, he was president of the Notre Dame Club of Chicago. And, after serving as president of the Notre Dame Alumni Association in 1964, he became president of the Notre Dame La,v As­sociation in 1967. 
Mr. Faccenda also became an active member of the administration during 1967. He was made Special Assistant to the President when the University's Board of Trustees was reorganized and the move to lay gov­ernment effected. This position enabled Faccenda to become a member of the Student Life Council and also the Assistant Secretary of the University. 
When the position of Vice-President and General Counsel to the University was created in 1970, Dr. Fac­cenda was appointed to the post. As Counsel, Faccenda helps the University with its legal problems. 
Faccenda did not relinquish his legal post when ?e assumed the title and duties of interim Vice-President for Student Affairs. But he explains that the duties of 

SEPTEMBER 29, 1972 
students will be closer to tnen able to solve their probletns 
these two positions do not coincide. His vice-presidency gives him the responsibility for all non-academic stu­dent affairs. 
SINCE Faccenda is only an interim vice-president, does he have power to implement changes in student life? Faccenda himself affirms that he has as much power as· "any previous vice-president." However, he notes that his plans are curtailed due to the temporary nature of his appointment. "It wouldn't be wise for me to start some program now," he explains, "that will take two or three years to develop."· 
. Yet, Faccenda is not sitting on his hands.· One of his first actions as Vice-President was to re-organize his central staff. He sees this administrative maneuver as the action of a man in a new position who wants it organized as he sees fit. 
Faccenda also hopes that his· administrative "shuf­fle" will benefit·the students. He is attempting to give each member of his staff more freedom to express his opinions on student affairs by holding a weekly meeting with them. His re-organization is also aimed at spread­ing the burdens of administrative tasks on more shoulders. Finally, he hopes ·that the:emphasis of power· will not be on him as Vice-President. He wishes to rele­gate more power to. his staff so a student will be closer to men who are able to solve his problems. 
The success· or failure of Faccenda's reorganization may not be as apparent as is the outcome_" of his other concrete plans. One of· these is the renovation of the La.Fortune Student Center. Dr.· -Faccenda h~s: given priority to this plan~ "We will ·probably. call in a pro­fessional architect to· loo~ ·at redesigning the student center. Burwe need to know what the students want 
-~ -, 
whether they want mo_Iiey_ 1:o up~ade their individual halls or LaFortune. -We can't 'ilo both," he adds~ 
' • + -+ + • 
in all, Faccenda may not see this latter plan materialize. For he hopes to have a successor by the end of the year. The. committee is still searching for a suitable Holy Cross priest, but its efforts have proved fruitless. Also, as the Observer noted in a recent editor­ial, the search committee is unbalanced. With the loss of John Barkett, no student sits on· the committee. 
Whether a successor to the Acting Vice-President appears sooner or later, Phillip Faccenda is not un­satisfied with his interim post. "I don't like working sixteen hours a· day which is necessary_ because of my added responsibilities. But nohody forced me to take it," he states. According to Faccenda, a little extra 
· effort for tlie·University is simply part of the "Notre Dame tradition." · 

A Case Against Shakespeare 
A special article for the SCHOLASTIC ... A com'[J'ilation of research inspired by the findings of Stephen Orury, who is currently cornposing his doctoral thesis on the same subject at the University of Kentucky. S. Oru,ry has granted Mr. Treanor and Mr. Phillips special per­mission to incorporate bits of his research in this article. 
IN the eight hundred years which have ensued since Chaucer made English a coherent, liquid language, no single man has manifested as acknowledged a mastery of that language as .William Shakespeare. His name has. been enthroned; he himself has become a paragon, a mask, a noisy deity, a cliche. William Shakespeare gave the English Theater, and indeed, all of English art, a legacy of legitimacy it might otherwise never have had. 
So much for the myth. 

In sooth, William Shakespeare was a figure as ob­scure and forebodingly cryptic as any in English intel­lectual nobility. He was born of illiterate parents in Stratford-on-Avon during the year 1563. His schooling is unknown, but the town of his origin possessed only the most primitive of educational facilities. 
Shakespeare has always been a hero for intellectual egalitarians; however, he possessed none of the vaguely aristocratic trappings of intellectuality. He had no library. There is not even evidence that William Shake­speare ever possessed a book other than the Bible. His daughter, Judith, was illiterate and thus unable to read any of her famous father's monumental creations. 
To further deprecate himself as a man of intellectual pretensions, Shakespeare spent a good deal of his life as a usurer, like his own Shylock. When at the height of his purported literary career-around the time he was playing the ghost of Hamle.t's father-he was engaged in purchasing a malt factory with designs of becoming a beer producer. 
When Shakespeare's will was finally probated, it was discovered that not only was he without a library, but he· was .also without much financial store. It is ·appar­ent he never received remuneration for most of his plays. Some were published anonymously. Some were published with no p.r:otection from plagiarism. No plans were even set up to. procure funds from reprints of the First Folio for his heirs and·assigns. 
However, Shakespeare's most spectacular assault on the intellectual pretension was in the writing · of his . name.. In opp9sition · to the spelling, "Shakespeare," the ·signature on ·the _First Folio, i1;1 the six known William Shakespeare signatures-all written in a vague, hesitant hand, as though guided by someone else-his last name is spelled, "Shakspere." 
T~ERE is a curious discontinuity between Shake­speare the man of profundity, the caresser and molder of the English language, the author of thirty-seven plays, one hundred fifty-four sonnets, and innumerable small poems and epigrams; and "Shakspere," the man of illiterate ancestors and illiterate descendants, the citizen of bumptious Stratford, the man of questionable education, the man of modest means, the man who (al­though he often wrote in foreign languages, including classical Latin and Greek, and although he often, quite accurately, set the scene in foreign lands) had never been outside of England in his life, the producer of beer. 
. William Shakespeare, or Shakspere, is indeed an unlikely author for all the magnificent literature which is attributed to him. A likelier candidate would be Sir Francis Bacon, who, among other things, edited the King James edition of the Bible. 
Could Sir .Francis' excessive genius have spilled into yet another medium? The treatise has been the subject of a thousand expositions. Bacon was himself a man much given to deception and hidden fntention-so much so that his reputation finally cost him his political career. He was a Rosicrucian, and a symmetric cryp­tologist. He had a Rosicrucian cipher number-33­and a symbol-the hog. The hog was a double pun on Bacon's name-for "Bacon" 's derivative is the word "beech" and hogs were customarily fed on beech-not at the time. Bacon also had a secret signature--"AA" -an initialing of "Astor Argentum" or Silver Star which was Bacon's cryptic sign. 
What-is the case for Bacon's authorship of Shak­spere's plays? It is not the purpose of this article to rehash. a three-hundred-year-old argument-rather, the design here is to observe some of the as-yet-incomplete­ly-researched _study of S. Orury, a 51-year-old graduate s_tudent at the University of Kentucky. Yet a back­ground is necessary; the controversy is without a flavor of completeness if it lacks the old thunderous bromides. Bacon was brilliantly and thoroughly educated. He was a man of the world in the best sense; that is to say, ·he knew ,of the world and of its effects. He traveled broadly. He had a magnificent library. He was well versed in Aristotelean and Platonic philosophy. He -clearly had the background and knowledge to write

brury's ·CC>Ii~id~atlons:-throw· new light on· all. the claims. He has unearthed; thanks. te> the Royale Shake­spearean Society's new~policy of granting any serious researcher access ·to their_ archives, significant evidence for authorship of ·aJ.l bf• Shakespeare's works from a number of old-and deleted verses originally included in Shakespeare's manuscripts, but later either revised or. deleted at the author's request.: 
Contrary to . the· viewpo_int·. of· · several · magazine articles, Orury :finds :most-of th·ese deleted poems poor in quality; .thus_ an:argumentamight be made for their deletion from "aesthetic rea·sons.

tainly disqualifies it from the Shakespearean Sonnet status. It does have fourteen lines, and may even be called strikingly bad; full of references inexplicable except in the light of Bacon's symbolism.

Along with '-m_y_love, who resembleth a swine? Sure­ly ,the Bard of Avon would have a rationale for such a·,crude piece of humor. Seen in the cryptology of Bacon; it does. indeed have·a purpose-to praise Bacon . Once again,· the boar serves an important function; he 
·.makes.certain that the hero is restored to reason and truth, though surrounded by an unbalanced and irra­tional head (the heat of midsummer; perhaps Shake­speare/Bacon had the madcap antics of Puck in mind when he wrote this poem). The first letter of the first three words of the first line of stanza two spell "Hog''; take the first letter of every line and you will have an­other great-and perhaps conclusive-surprise.

Ori.icy posits six codes, all linear and all beginning with some letter in Bacon's na:me.

The poem itself could well be about Bacon, for who else would be such a "braver force?" Who else would "Hid(e) ... his name to 'scape imbroglio?" William

Terivaki Steak~ 
Hello everybody! Toda_y's recipe is for a marvelou.s en.tree that's guaranteed to perhaps please somebody: taste-femvting Teriyaki Steak. Try some soon. 
Take a 5 oz. cube steak. Marinate it in a Teriyaki Sauce (of pineapple j_uice, soy sauce, water, garlic granules1 pepper and ginger powder) for about the time yoU, spend in bed ( do it in the fridge, of cou,rse). Grill for a flashing five minutes and ... voila! Teriyaki Steak! 
Do it to 5600 cube steaks and get 5600 portions! -based on actual Food Service recipe. 
STUDENTS don't appreciate the effort that goes into preparing a typical dining hall meal around here. In fact, a few hardly appreciate the results. But never­theless, consider the fact that every morning at 5 a.m., the advance guard of a veritable army of food service workers march to the dining hall of their choice and begin preparations that will involve 17 cooks, 10 cook's helpers, 155 attendants and servers, and 3 or 400 part-time students from one place or another. 
The mass of ingredients used is literally enough to feed an army of 5600 (the number of contract cus­tomers for a typical N.D. serving). 
Take a meal, for instance. For a typical lunch­time menu (Sept. 13's to be exact) the ingredients called for included: over a ton of meat, including 1360 lbs. of hamburger for sloppy joes; 212 gallons of chicken noodle soup and 3000 packs of crackers; 7080 bread rolls and 50 loaves of bread; 1800 lbs. of "tater tots''; 55 lbs. of butter; 300 lbs. of mixed vege­tables; 318 heads of lettuce; 1500 lbs. of cottage cheese; 1272 pear halves; 1240 peach halves; 4560 
-lC 
cookies; 3500 portions of ice cream; 1260 portions of jello cubes; 458 gallons of milk; 130 gallons of car­bonated beverages; 45 gallons of punch and a mere 80 gallons of coffee. It's easy to perceive that there are plenty of pounds to prepare, people to employ, patrons to please, and problems to ponder. 
Maybe you're not impressed, or surprised or even interested-but at least you've been rendered "aware." (And in these times when awareness is prized as one of the most valuable possessions of all clear-thinking individuals, that's good.) 
SEEKING awareness myself, I interviewed Mr. Edmund 
T. Price, chief taste-tester, captain of the food suppliers, man in charge, and, of course, Director of Food Ser­vices at this place. Contrary to popular opinion, he does eat lunch and dinner here in the regular food lines every workday (that's six times a week-and some­times on Sunday). He occasionally invites his wife and daughter to join him, and they love it. He's friend­ly (smiles a lot); likes to wear snow-white belts with matching shoes; and seems to possess one cardinal con­cern: pro_viding good food service to every student. 
He says that since the university is an educational institution, and education is the primary goal of the place, "Everything we do at the Food Service should be aimed at the student with this in mind." He noted, "We're not here just to keep you healthy or fill you up. 
"Everything is attitude," he says. "We want to give the student as much as we possibly can for the dollar that he's paying." And, sitting before Mr. Price as he says it, you just can't help believing that he means it. 
However, Mr. Price is not all-knowing. He doesn't claim cognizance of all that we students are finding wrong with the dining hall food. But, of course, he's 

and other dining hall stories 

not deaf either. He does know that student opm10n isn't terribly high when table talk turns to the fare of the day. He knows we're all out there complaining; and he'd dearly love to find out what about. 
"We need the students to communicate with us, to tell us what they want. We need an exchange of ideas. We're anxious to give the students what they want­not what we think they want.... We need to com­municate." 
THE problem, of course, comes with the logical ques­tion of "How." A "Feedback" system was tried a while back, where students were invited to leave their com­ments on blue cards conveniently stacked in the middle of each table. Completed cards were deposited in appro­priately labeled "Feedback" boxes (along with a pot­pourri of other "Feedbacks") as well. Questionnaires, too, appear from time to time. The results are "re­quired reading" for Mr. Price, his managers, and the dietician, he says, and the data is heeded. 
"A few years ago, when I first got here [this is Mr. Price's fourth year on the job] all I heard was that 
SEPTEMBER 29, 1972 
nobody liked the veal parmesan. So we cut it out for a while. The next thing I heard last year was 'where's the veal parmesan?'" This year, friends, you'll see more veal parmesan. 
"People like almost anything but some things they don't like too frequently," he says. '"It's a matter of getting a balance, and I don't know if there's anyone who knows where that balance is." So. l\'Ir. Price tries questionnaires and "Feedback" cards, but there's a problem even with these, he says. 
"The student has a habit of saying the quality of the food is poor-and I don't think he really means it. He means he really doesn't like the food for one reason 

they would line up before eight or twelve eatsups 
or another." For instance, he said, some people like their peas "almost raw" (like he does-and that's how it seems you sometimes get them) but others prefer to savor a softer variety and when Mr. Price gets a "Feedback" that simply characterizes the peas as "rotten" or of "poor quality," he can't do much to help. 
"The quality is there,'' he emphasizes. "Our specifi­cations are rigid. We get only first quality-that's what we're after." A few cynics may marvel at such a prom­ise, after examining what sometimes reaches their plates, but Mr. Price assures us that it's all only the best. 
«We taste-test almost. all the products ahead of time,'' he says. Over the summer, a student was even employed to join Mr. Price and his staff in a week of intensiv~ taste-testing. Twice a day-at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.-the group would line up before a series of eight or twelve cat~ups, relishes, etc., and rate them. "We take the scores, compare them, and then figure the cost factor. But, that's always last, and surprisingly enough,. there's often no correlation bet\veen quality and cost." Is there ever compromise? "We try not to," he assures. "We steer for the highest quality-we don't compromise." 
AND if the iconoclastic reader should be gracelessly asking, "The highest quality of what? · Soybeans?" he's wrong again. "We're resisting extending meat such as ground beef," Mr. Price explains. "We're de­manding pure ground beef and we're getting it." The only meats with additives of any sort are the Meat

Loaf and Salisbury Steak because they have recipes that call for them. 
Menus are made up three or four weeks in advance according to dietary standards and the preferences of students-as they're understood. The service's buyer then goes looking; it might come as a surprise to some that meal plans aren't based on the buyer's bargains. The menu comes first. 
So why don't we have steak more often? "What is better?" Mr. Price returns, "Would you rather have steak or more of other things? Steak is not necessarily a real good buy. The type-of steak makes a big differ­ence. We're trying to stretch your dollar as far as we can." 
But, on the other hand, seeing that the food that's served is eaten is an important cost consideration, too. "If it's not eaten, it's costly," Mr. Price observes. He's found that one way of examining student taste is by examining what students don't taste. He admits looking at the tray returns from time to time. 
ALL RIGHT, you say, you've still got complaints ­even if the food is of the highest quality. What about the length of the lines? "Well, we've considered length­ening the dinner hour, but there's nothing we can do if everybody comes at the same time." The fact that everyone seems to have an 11 a.m. class certainly doesn't help much; and, as in the case of the Grace and Flanner cafeteria lines, "If we began the dinner hour at four o'clock-they'd all be there at four," he predicts. You say, -that's because all the best stuff is gone if you wait too long. Mr. Price assures me that the problem is being worked on -managers aren't perfect, and taking capricious taste preferences, and the number of seconds into consideration, its not easy to prepare just the right amount of any­thing. However, take courage bandsmen and glee club­bers -and anyone else who arrives at the dining hall fifteen minutes before closing-lVIr. Price says the problem is being worked on, and he means it. 
You might complain that the food is cold, or the service could use a little help (or the help could use a little service), but Mr. Price suggests that here's where students can be of assistance in an indirect way. 
For instance, suppose you are the woman behind the serving counter charged with tweezing an infinite series of Teriyaki Steak lumps from an infinite succes­sion -of sloshing tin tubs, onto an infinite parade of characterless white dishes. Your pay is less than your heart's desire. You don't particularly enjoy tweezing Teriyaki Steak. Lastly, suppose for your pains, you are presented with a gasping rush of ineffable dread from an infinite procession of disembodied faces, sneer-

Your attention., ple013ef Most of 'US realize that the physical facilities for being sociable at Notre Dame are sadly missing. Gathering places for students to meet-besides iniperfect La Fortune Center-are-dif­ficult to discover. It seerns., however., that the dining halls are one of the few places around which students can get together, sit down, pursue the eternal verities., eat; and enjoy each other's friendship without having to go over the Michigan border. 
In addition., as Mr. Price noted, there's the fact that students who eat three meals a day in the sa1ne place, in the same room tend to tire of the environment., and transfer their displeW3u,re to the tW3te of the food (de­spite change-of-pace nights like "Italian Night" or "Western Night" or the gala bacchanal of two years ago, "Hawaiian Night;" when the uninitiated cafeteria help impaled their hands on pineapple prickles). 
The idea of allowing .students to eat on any line they pref er with all their friends., whenever they like­seems like a good one to improve both social conditions . and appreciation of the Food Service's services. ·After all, the lines would theoretically balance out since intel­ligent people would tend to find the shortest lines ·at the most convenient locations. The net. load at any one place should not be drW3tically affected.· 
SEPTEMBER 29, 1972 
I brought up this proposal to Mr. Price., and his response WW3 an agreeable., "Nothing would pleW3e me more. The only thing that's holding me bad~ is a con­servatism. I'm afraid of the students' reaction. 
"I'm not here to heap restrictions on students-I'm ~ ,here to serve them," Mr. Price continued. "I would be willing to entertain the motion of letting any contract student eat anywhere he wants. 
"But/' he noted, "'I'd like this to come from the students. If they want it, it'll work." 
So, fellow students., if this prCYposal a'[Yl)eals to you,. and you, would like to give it a try_. call the Student Government Secretary at 1668 and voice your prefer­ence; OR fill out the handy Q-pon (coupon) belcnu and drop it into any of the little blue "Feedback" boxes garnishing th~ dining hall ea;it ways, before next Wednesday.

Your motivation for providing the best of all pos­sible service might be overcome by an urge to run off screaming and never come back. Pride in one's work is important; a sense of being appreciated is important; being treated with dignity is important. Teriyaki Steak is not so important. 
"If the item is good, say so," adyises Mr. Price. He recalled the night of the "September Thing'' picnic two weeks ago, when• most students seemed pleased with the atmosphere and cuisine, and let the food attendants know about it. The result was a staff with enthusiasm, who enjoyed serving, enjoyed their job, felt needed, and came in the next day ready and_ willing to go to 
-work again. Cafeteria clients might do well to save a little cheer for the ladies who didn't even cook the stuff. Venting frustration on them just doesn't make sense.

points out. "If you don't like the food, just say so. No.

"We're anxious to give the student what he wants," 
says Mr. Price; again and _again.

Hemingway's "Michigan Stories" 
.Michigan was the first place 

Ernest Hemingway truly • loved. ·It was · the setting for many of his · short stories. Still the question: 
"Why no 'Michigan novel'?" 
The Nick Adams Stories, Philip 

Young's recent compilation of the 
sixteen previously published stories 
of Nick Adams and eight heretofore 
unpublished Nick Adams pieces, 
might be considered the missing 
novel. The twenty-four pieces can be 
arranged to give a coherent develop­
ment 'of Nick Adams from boyhood 
to manhood and a cogent argument 
that these stories do comprise the 
"Michigan novel.''. Young gives such 
an arrangement. 
· Of the eight new pieces, one is dearly a short story. Two more could be considered short stories and probably are. Four are excepts from other published short stories which h~d been edited out. "Three Shots," the first piece of the book, was· orig-· inally part of· "Indian Camp." ·one pi~ce, ,iThe Last Goo·d Country," ap­pears· to be ·the beginning of.what Hemingway critics have been looking for-the "Michigan novel.'' · 
•. It Js the last piece,.· "The Last Good· Country," which Young· might llave mistakenly placed. In organ­izing the stories, Young divided them into five headings; "The Northern Woods,'' "On His Own," '.'War,','. "A story of Nick leaving home, is placed after"The Light of the World," "The Battler," and "The Killers." Ali of these take place when Nick Adams has already left home. ·Young offers no explanation in his preface, but one might conjecture that he meant it as a sort of flashback. 
If these stories are to be taken as the "Michigan novel/' they ·must have a unity. That unity is found in the development of Nick Adams. The whole conflict is within him. From early. on Nick • is . apparently seeking a peace of mind, "a separate peace" as he terms it in the story " 'Nick sat against the wall... .' " In "Indian Camp" Nick can find this peace. He trails his hand. in the water. beside the boat and decides that he will "never die.'.' ·As he grows older this becomes harder to attain. In "The Killers," he leaves town, not .merely ,to escape the physical threat of. being · killed, but .to get away trom·_everything he confronted · in the story. It takes .two stories (and the resolution of inner peace is still. left uncertain) for Nick Adams to break off a close relationship with a girl named Marge. I!}, the .last story, "Fathers and. Sons," ·Ni~k Adams still tries to attain that peace. But, it has grown more elusive with age, and he. must. n_ow•_.accept ·it as something_ unattainable. ·.He.. has grown older and his memories afford 

This is the denouement of the novel of Nick Adams, of Michigan. Nick Adams, a Hemingway "hero," fails to become a Hemingway "code hero.'' He cannot resolve within him­self that the past is beyond his con.:. trol. This might give him the peace he seeks, but his route, that of denial, gives no peace at all. 
The Nick Adams Stories certainly does not possess the continuity of any other Hemingway novel. In such an arrangement, however, it becomes 
· apparent that this is more than a mere collection of short stories and that the character of Nick Adams is more than a mere coincidence. to them. Ernest Hemingway was too good a writer for all this to be pure

the last word 
rd 

I can remember back to two and three years ago, back when Carolyn Gatz was an editor of the SCHOLAS­TIC. Carolyn, small, with long dark hair, quiet, with one of the warmest smiles I have ever known, was one of the more outspoken St. Mary's students on the sub­ject of women's liberation. As a freshman, naive (probably more so than today's freshmen), I can re­member my bewilderment at her impassioned concern over that problem. 
Three years has helped to mellow the inner tur­moil of that spring of Cambodia and Kent State, and helped to unsmudge the lenses with which I see mem­ories of those days. And recent thoughts and conversa­tions bring back many of Carolyn's words in more clarity than they possessed even then. The conversa­tions have been with several people, mainly Terri, a junior. at St. Mary's, and Peggy, who graduated last year. The personal thoughts, I suspect, have been prompted by watching the women of Notre Dame and St. Mary's in this transition year, wondering what sorts of experiences they will be exposed to, sub­jected to. 
Much of Carolyn's concern dealt with discrimina­tion against women in the business world. Still pro­tected by the warm womb of the University, I am at too great a distance from these aspects of the problem to grasp them as fully as she, who has had to content herself with a minimum-wage waitress job out west­not the best outlet for a woman of Carolyn's sensitivity and intelligence. But others of Carolyn's words, and especially those of Terri and Peggy, have brought the problem much closer to home. Notre Dame must be a terrible place to be a woman. 
Terri and I talked once, last spring, puzzling over the reasons why women at Notre Dame so often seem to have less confidence in themselves than their abilities warrant. Why are women in Notre Dame classes so often the most taciturn in the group? Why have women -capable women-so often been hesitant to write a story for the magazine because they did not feel com­petent? Part of the answer is obvious. If I were the only male in a class of women, with all eyes turned to­ward me whenever I raised my hand in response to a professor's question, I suspect I, too, would be reluc­tant to answer often. But much more insidious process­es are at work in the Notre Dame coeducational class­room. I have been in more than one class where very derogatory comments about the abilities of women­St. Mary's women in particular-have been habitual. And women are the more frequent, though not the sole recipients of unflattering under-the-breath com­ments following a response in a class. Not unfamiliar to the student of psychology: "negative reinforcement reduces the frequency of response." 
The difficulties of the woman in the Notre Dame classroom may be among the less disturbing she ex­periences. I would venture to guess that a majority of the women new to this campus have already been the victim of the crass, boorish, gross comments of an intoxicated (or not intoxicated) male student as he tries to assert his masculinity. (Perhaps some have been the victim of more than his words.) Notre Dame men, with their famed party conduct, their frequent pastime of "hitchhiking at the circle,'' etc., often re­veal something embarrassing and sad about them­selves. 
Germaine Greer often becomes so engrossed in her political terminolog:y: and emphasis that she may alienate more than she convinces. Lesser activists, in their preoccupations with the more trivial aspects of the problem, do the same. But when experiences force us to focus on the "close-to-home" manifestations of the problem, the question becomes less a political one and more an ethical one: a moral question of Christian conduct to be dealt with by the members of this Chris­tian community.
