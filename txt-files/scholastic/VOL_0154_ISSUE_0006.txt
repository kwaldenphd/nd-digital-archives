EDNOTES 
It was at 3:30 a.m. during production for my first issue as editor-in-chief of Scholastic that I realized I had no idea what I was doing. The stories were in and edited, the pages were designed and photos taken, but it never occurred to me to find out how the issue changes from computer files to printed pages. My elation at having finished before dawn was quickly deflated as crushing panic set in. 
I'd like to say that overcoming trial by fire let me know I could do it, but, in reality, little has changed since that first early morning. Eight issues managed to make it to the printer, perhaps, but never without a lot of floundering and rescuing by the incredible staff. The only function I've consistently served well is Keeper ofthe Phone Number for Pizza -certain I'd be exposed as a phony at any moment. 
If nothing else, all the blundering makes for great stories; there have been enough to fill the Gipper column and the publication information section hundreds of times over. It can be difficult at times to remember that whatever stress or embarrassment experienced at any given moment will be forgotten when we recount it a few years down the line. 
I finally feel like I'm not faking it anymore and it's time to go, a pattern encountered several times over the last four years. The seniors are, willingly or not, being hurtled toward uncertain futures. Whether we can envision life post-May 22 yet, time will keep going, and we will have to figure out how to be without the things that made us who we are. But maybe everyone else will be faking it for a while, too. 
The time has come for the seniors to hand Scholastic over to the new staff. Thanks to the amazing group of staffers who have been there through all the late-night disasters, Reckers runs and idea plates, and a big thank you to the readers. 
I had the time of my life and I owe it all to you.

ESSAY 
ON 

Notre Dame 
An Essay byJosh Flynt 

As I write for the final Scholastic issue of my Notre Dame career, I cannot help but wonder where the time went, both in terms of the last four years and the two weeks when I could have been writing this essay. It is hard to discuss the passing of time without being cliche or trite. We hear it so often: "Make the most of your time here" or "Time flies. Cherish it." But there is a reason we hear these words so frequently, a reason they have become commonplace-they are.true. 
I have always been a sentimental and nostalgic person. Anyone close to me knows my affinity for sharing (arid often repeating) memorable stories among friends. But rather than recall specific and unforgettable afternoons, evenings or late nights, I will stand on my "soapbox" to remember what makes Notre Dame special and why this university will forever have a place in my life. 
I would be lying ifl said I understood what Notre Dame was all about when I arrived in August 2007. Like many, growing up Irish Catholic was reason enpugh to root for ND on Saturdays in the fall a1,1.d, ultimately, to make the trip to South Bend as I began the college search. 
As an 18-year-old from upstate New York, I had my doubts about coming to Indiana. One of the first memories I have of this place is meeting an alumna at a local club event. She told my dad and me abouther experience at the university and started tearing up. 
Today, as I think about the few short months until graduation, I can understand why she was so emotional when speaking about ND. I cannot imagine having spent the last four years anywhere else. As the admissions brochures say, there trulyis "Nowhere Else But Notre Dame." My passion for this university, coupled with the ~ct that my future is still uncertain, makes me wish itwere possible to return for a fifth year­a victory lap around the Dome. 
I find myself in a position similar to that 
-which I faced four years ago: not quite ready to leave a place I have grown to love so much. In high school, people could not wait to move on, to get out of town and experience the world on their own. 
Still, many left with grand plans to keep in touch with old friends. But now, in 2011, we can probably count those who we still call and see during semester breaks on one hand. We realize thatwe do not have as much in common with those former schoolmates as we once thought. At Notre Dame, we are excited about the opportunities that life will bring, but not as anxious to move on, perhaps not ready to say goodbye. 
Earlier this semester, I had the opportunity to attend the senior retreat. The Dr. Seuss theme was a flashback to childhood and also a reminder that regardless of where we go after we r~ceive our diplomas, no matter how many beverages are purchased at Finny's or Kildare's, we are still kids at heart. 
With friends I have had since freshman year, classmates I knew only by name and others who I had never seen before, we came together in the spirit of Dr. Seuss to discuss "the places we'll go." But we also reflected on all thatNotre Dame has given us since we arrived for the absurdity ofFrosh-O. 
In four years, Our Lady's university has afforded me opportunities and taught me lessons upon which no lofty tuition bill can place a value. When I finally sign that first job contract, I will, ofcourse, appreciate my degree and the academic rigors ofNotre Dame. 
Yet, more than anything, I will remember how Notre Dame has transformed from a place 719 miles from my home to a place that effectively became home. Ballston Spa, NY, will always have a special place in my heart -fond memories, my family and those few friends I will have for life-but eventually, that connection to my hometown may fade. 
I am confident that my connection to Notre Dame never will. The Notre Dame spirit is special. It goes beyond a common affection for the Blue and Gold or a shared understanding of du Lac and residence halls. 
After we leave ND, life will lead each of us in different directions. Whether in New York or Chicago, London ot Tokyo,-graduate school or the "real world," there is one place where our paths may _cross again -Notre Dame. This university is a uniting force. It is a place where Knights, Kangaroos, Shamrocks and Purple Weasels reconnect, where Zahmbies, Ramblers, Ducks and Chaos will bring their children to pep rallies, Rocco's and Bruno's,­tailgates and football games, the Grotto and Basilica and back to the old dorms, carrying on the family traditions that have been passed down for generations or those that have developed in the last four years. 
• As students and future alumni, we share a familial connection. But part of what makes ND unique is that.brotherhood or sisterhood that is shaped in the residence halls. I would never consider myself a loner, but like Alan from "The Hangover," Notre Dame has given me a wolfpack -the 3-West Wolfpack of Keenan Hall, a section I called home for three years (and believe it or not, thatwas our section mascot back in2007, before Alan & Co. hit the big screen). 
Early in college, I found myself counting 
down the days until the next break, the next chance I could return home. It has often been said, "Distance makes the heart grow fonder." I am not sure that is necessarily true. But each time I leave Notre Dame, as I spend time away from North Quad, the Keenan "Fratres in Christo," and the Golden Dome, I find that my · appreciation for this university grows stronger. 
For the underclassmen, if you have not yet recognized and embraced Notre Dame as a true home, I hope you will soon. For my fellow members of the class of 2011, take comfort in remembering the unbreakable nature of the Notre Dame bond. Our time together is running out, but truly, it is just the beginning of our connection to one another and to Notre Dame. We will always be welcome at Notre Dame, a place we can visit in times of celebration and in times ofneed, a place we can always, and should always, call home.

How to Survive Midterms 
Jacqueline Patz
Midterms season is upon us once again, casting a dark shadow over the promising glimmer of spring break. Arguably more oppressive than finals, midterms include a comparable work 
and exam load but without the cushion of reading days. Be brave, Darners, and do not lose hope (or your sanity). Scholastic is here to guide you through this treacherous time. Follow these suggestions, and you (probably) won't find your well-being threatened by midterms week. 
Forgo the all-nighter. There are many acceptable ways to minimize time devoted to non-studying activities -neglect personal hygiene (that's what perfume is for) and skip all the whining (while you're busy regretting your existence, everyone else will start to wish you'd 
disappear too). But do not sacrifice your shut-eye time. You need REM cycles to consolidate memory, so all ofyour cramming will be useless unless you get some sleep. Who knows, maybe you'll even dream you're a genius. 
, .:. Step away from the computer. Unless you want to be sucked into the 
9) giant whirlpool o~ ~indless clicking that is the Internet (I'm ~ooking at & you, Facebook), bm1t your computer usage to necessary emails, papers 
and other unavoidable tasks. (No, Sporcle does not count.) ~ Pay a visit to the candy wall. There comes ,a: point at which it is no d longer pru~e~t t~ force your_body to metab~lize mor: caffeine. This _is 
· when you hit 1t with sugar. Time your candy mtake at mtervals that will keep the proverbial sugar crash at bay. Then, enjoy the slightly spastic rush of energy and surf the sugar-haze wave all the way to straight Ns. 
Invest in a time-turner. OK, this suggestion may be unrealistic, given our status as Muggles and the fact· that time-turners were destroyed in the fifth book. In lieu of magical manipulation of time, stop procrastinating! Listen to the wise marketing experts at Nike and 
"Just do it." fP3 Pay attention in class. Specifically, let the infqrmation enter your brain ~ the first time your professor attempts to teach it to you. What's that? 
ea§/ You opted to sleep, doodle or text instead? Oh, well. There's always next 
semester. 



Irish Insight 
Visting Author Discusses Work, Shares Advice 
Kathleen Toohi/1
Acclaimed Irish author and Keough Visiting Professor Pat Mc­Cabe began writing stories at the age of 10, a hobby that got him beaten up by classmates, he says. "It's a fundamental right of 
passage for every aspiring writer, maybe not for girls, but for boys," Mc­Cabe says. "It toughens you up, and you get used to rejection." 
Born in 1955, McCabe grew up in southern Ireland in the small town of Clones. He says he was raised in a literary and musical enviornment. McCabe first worke~ as a primary school teacher before concentrating solely on writing. · · 
McCabe is the author of two novels, "The Butcher Boy" and "Break­fast on Pluto," which. were shortlisted for the Booker Prize and subse­quently made into filnis by director Neil Jordan. 
McCabe and his wife, Margot, are spending the semester at Notre Dame while McCabe teaches the undergraduate Advanced Fiction Writ­ing course. He gave a reading at Notre Dame in 2007, and three years later, Director of the. Keough-Naughton Institute for Irish Studies, Chris Fox, approached him about teaching at Notre Dame. "I wanted to come to America, so this was the perfect opportunity," McCabe says. 
On Feb. 10, McCabe gave a reading of "The Butcher Boy" in the Hes­burgh Center Auditorium. The book is a dark stream of consciousness story that chronicles the adventures of troubled protagonist Francie Brady. McCabe says his inspiration for the novel came from an old Irish song of the same name, as well as the John Wayne movie "Red River." 
A tentatively planned event for mid-April would feature the director Neil Jordan and screenings of his two adaptations of McCabe's novels. "They're both very fine independent movies," McCabe says. "[But] they wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea." 
McCabe says the new book he is working on takes up all his time when he's not teaching. "[It is] a shortish book about faith and optimism rather than my usual topics, despair and misery. It works well with the ethos of Notre Dame," he says. , 
As for aspiring writers, McCabe says, "You have to be made of strong stuff. It's not an easy road to glamour and notoriety." He says that de­spite technological advances that simplify the process, getting published is harder than ever. 
"Keep meeting as many people as you can, don't look down on any­--one. That's all you need .to be a writer, that and discipline. Everyone's story is valid." 0

Campus Chat:i:er 
DEPARTMENT OF BITTER SINGLES 
Ah, March! A time for madness, midterms and matrimony-or, at least, proposals. Yes, readers, it is time for a few lucky ladies to take part in the most exclusive of all Notre Dame traditions: the Ring by Spring Club. 
Walks around the lake, kisses under Lyons Arch, proposals by the Dome -it seems this is what the admissions department had in mind for "Nowhere Else but Notre Dame." It truly is a tradition unlike any other, because what other college can claim its students marry fellow students? 
Amid the excitement, however, I sense some controversy. Debbie is never without her downer, so while she polishes her new engagement ring, I see no better time to address what I believe is a growing bitter sentiment toward couples ofall marital statuses on campus. 
A few weeks ago, I was embarrassed to hear my fellow singles 
bemoan Valentine's Day. With an onslaught of "Singles Awareness 
Day" Facebook statuses and comments such as, "The closest 
relationship I have is with my Blackberry," I was confused. How could 
they think the holiday was anything less than a wonderful exhibition 
of giddy, elementary school love? 
While we singles have to manage class, homework, jobs, athletics 
and extracurriculars, you, couples of Notre Dame, have the added 
pressure of handling some kind of happiness! The pressure must be 
exquisite. 
How can we be so bitter? What reason can we have to not rejoice in 
the slew ofnewly minted Claddagh rings and additions to the Basilica 
waiting list? 
I say, "Flaunt your felicity, couples, because the rest of us need 
something to aspire to." 
Let's be honest, singles: Our lives can be stressful. During the 
week, we have to find people to socialize with or, worse yet,· find a 
friendly dinner date every night. In class, there's almost no one we 
can constantly text, and when we're studying, no one will tell us that 
we really should get back to work. Oh, the productive nights in the 
library couples must enjoy. 
The ultimate nightmare, of course, happens on the weekends, 
when we are tasked with partying with friends and, quite possibly, 
meeting new people. "Who will I talk to? Who will I dance with? .Who will stand with me in the corner?!" 
There's so much uncertainty! We're never quite sure where the 
night will take us -dorm parties, off-campus parties, cab rides, 
Reckers and Sbarro at 2 a.m. How I envy those who know they'll

COVER 

THE PERFORMING ARTS ERA 
When the Debartolo Performing Arts Center, which requested to be referred to as the Center, opened in 2004, University President Rev. John Jenkins, C.S.C. wrote that "Notre Dame entered its 'Decade of the Arts' -a celebration of our arts legacy and fulfillment of our future." 
The Center is now in its seventh season and Thompson says it is "helping to advance Notre Dame's reputation as an arts presenter, both nationally and internationally." The Center, which hosts over 1,000 events and serves 100,000 patrons each year, aims to provide Notre Dame and the South Bend community with a variety of film, theater, dance and musical programs. 
"This was Father Malloy's baby," Thompson says. "He wanted Notre Dame to be as well known for the arts as we are for academics and athletics. We're still catching up, but there's a whole gamut of activities in this building that people don't know about. Our real job is providing academic support through our events. We're not a commercial venue for rent. We relate direci:ly to history, social concerns, American studies and more. We have an interdisciplinary focus and, ideally, there is something for everyone." 
The Center-made up ofFTT classrooms, five performance venues, a THX-certified 
20 I SCHOLASTIC I 3 MARCH 2011 
cinema and various work spaces -tries to balance rising artists like Spalding, established classical performers, a variety of dance and theater performances, and film events like the new midnight movies program. The events, which can take up to two years to schedule, often include pre-and post-performance talks, lectures, workshops or open rehearsals. 
Thompson says that the Center's next season will continue to reflect that comprehensive diversity. While the schedule has not been released yet, she says it will feature an event that is "like comic books for grown ups" and Sacha! Vasandani, "a jazz vocalist who will melt your heart," along with performers from Iraq, India, Ireland, Israel, Germany and Australia. 
"I pretty much live in that building," senior FTT major Marie Wicht says of the Center. "It's a beautiful building that I feel like people don't always take advantage of. And that's disappointing because they offer so much. For FTT students, it's where we live, breathe, play -everything. I can't imagine the program without it." 

FADING FACILITIES 
The Riley Hall of Art and Design and the Crowley Hall of Music, however, stand apart from the Center. Since the early 1980s, Riley Hall has been the center of the art department, housing classrooms, studios, computer labs, gallery spaces and offices for faculty and graduate students. But Barber says the building can no longer keep pace with the department's needs. 
"One of the things that has most surprised me about being the chairperson of this department is how much time lhave to spend just thinking about the building," Barber says. "We're a department that has simply outgrown itself. We've had to build classroom spaces out of storage areas. One of the main classrooms for design, our largest major, can only hold eight students. This inhibits our students' options. We have classes taking place in hallways and classes that need to move from 
· room to room iri the course of their meetings. Needless to say,· _safety is always a concern. "If you ignore the peeling paint and the 
. cramped conditions, you will find wonderful computer facilities and some really high-end technology," he says. "Unfortunately, it is all housed in a building that compares poorly to almost any other facility on campus. Students become excited about the arts, but then they see the space and w:onder how they can do their work here. They're paying the same tuition as every other student but find themselves in our somewhat ramshackle space. It makes a very poor comparison with the newer facilities such as the business, science and engineering spaces on campus." 
Sophomore industrial design major Alisa Rantanen says Riley's limited space disrupts the everyday activities of art and design students. 



COVER 
"I love the building, and I'd be sad to see it go, but we honestly need more space," she says. "The rooms are tight and I've seen classes have their critiques in the hallways. We're at capacity. I think everyone loves"it here and loves the building, but then you see a new hockey arena while you're still plugging away in Riley." ... 
Barber says the· concerns about overcrowding have existed since he first came to the department 14 years ago. "The administration understands the problem. Our need is for this understanding to be translated into our becoming a campus priority. The music department has very similar problems with its space." 
Senior FTT and music major Stephanie DePrez says the problems at Crowley Hall are especially obvious to her after spending time in the Center for her FTT classes. 
"The music department was initially supposed to go into [the center], but it was too expensive so music students are still stuck in Crowley with non-insulated classrooms," she says. "You'll be in one room trying to listen to Beethoven, but you won't be able to hear it because they're playing Stravinsky in the next room, and it's coming through the wall. There are also pipes buzzing that change the pitch in the rooms. I appreciate that it's a historic building, but it's a joke between music majors· that someone is going t<:> burn down Crowley just so they'll have to build a new facility. 
"I actually tried to get office hours with Father Jenkins to talk about the issues with the building, but I was denied like many people probably were," she says. "Watching my professors struggle with the technology -I mean, there's state ofthe·art equipment in [the Center] with everything you could possibly need, but we can't even get the record player to work in Crowley. That's embarrassing." 
With interested students and a skilled staff, DePrez says that the building holds the department back. "The program itself is good. We're not known for music -we're not Northwestern -but I have a friend that goes there for music and I could definitely go toe to toe with him. It's just that ifwe had the facility and the resources, we could be so much better. I think it's a quality program that deserves to be invested in. There's so much talent in the music department that we could be great. We focus on being the number one business school and a top research university, and I think that that's great. But we have the potential to be top in music, too -so why aren't we doing that?" 
EXPANDING THE ARTS-NEW FACILITIES FOR THE FUTURE 
In response to those concerns, the university has plans to develop a "fine arts district" around the Center. As explained in the university's "Imagine" pamphlet on the project, "assembling Notre Dame's fine arts departments within a single area will foster additional collaboration, generate opportunities for shared, rather than redundant, facilities and amenities, and enhance the efficiency of teaching and program delivery." These plans would concentrate all ofthe arts at Notre Dame and provide a joint space for the FTT, music and art departments as well as the Snite Museum and the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center. 
"It's a crossover audience," Director of the Snite Museum Chuck Loving says. "It would just make sense to bring all those departments together. We really want to have an all­encompassing arts center. Sooner rather than later, we'd like to have a building that houses the museum and the art department in one

too -so why aren't we':t_'t, 
doing that?" (,!-,

physical place, and we'd like to have the music department eventually included as well." 
The execution of these plans, however, is a long way off. For the university to break ground on a new building project, "at least 90 percent of the funding has to be in place, and the remaining 10 percent has to be pledged," Thompson says. 
"I would say that the discussions continue and some progress might be forthcoming, but that a whole new building remains far distant," Barber says ofa new art department facility. 
Despite the long-term wait for an entire arts quad, Loving says the Snite Museum will be the first up for a new facility. A site adjacent to the Center has already been reserved. 
"We have hopes and aspirations for a new building," he says. "We had been saving a lot of money, but then the recession hit, and it came to an almost screeching halt. We're just about to resume our momentum, and I'm hoping that in five to 10 years we'll have the new building. One day, probably after you graduate, you'll be able to drive up from Eddy Street, park easily outside the Arts Center, go see a show or exhibit, and get a cup of coffee at the museum cafe." 
The new museum will feature a student­run gallery, an auditorium and seminar-style classrooms where students can see artwork up close, in addition to the permanent collections and changing exhibit spaces. Loving says a new facility with these features could encourage students to visit the museum more often. "We'd like to create a social environment where students can hang out together, sit at a cafe, and see a film or exhibit," he says. 
"Students will come to the museum for a program -for class, a lecture or a tour -and it's a meaningful engagement, but students don't usually just drop in," he says. "We'd love for students to hang out here and spend more time, but it's difficult, and we haven't had milch success. We're in the top 10 university art museums in the country, and most students don't know that. We want them to see that the museum is a major resource on campus. It's free, and we have 10-12 changing exhibits each year. So ifyou've only come once, you haven't seen everything the museum has to offer." 
To that end, the Snite museum presents the "popular BFA/MFAstudent art exhibit every spring, hosts lectures on a variety ofdifferent subjects, has undergraduate tours for Spanish students on Latin American art and has just added similar tours in French and German," Loving says. "We take pride in how deeply and richly we're involved on campus. 
"Last year we had the 'Thin' exhibit by Lauren Greenfield," he says. "We were trying to draw attention to the issue ofeating disorders and the people who suffer from ·them. It was controversial, but one of the things I was proud of was that self-referrals to the campus eating disorder clinic spiked after the exhibit. A lot ofpeople became aware that they had eating disorders after seeing the exhibit and sought help. There was even eating disorder therapy held after hours in the exhibit space. The exhibit really had a powerful, profound effect on the students that saw it." 
Beyond changing exhibits such as "Thin," the museum owns 25,000 permanent objects. 
"Outside ofMexico City, we have the best collection ofOlmec art," Loving says. "We're developing a more contemporary collection of Latin American art, too. We have a great

collection of19th century French oil sketches and we're doing important research on the French Academy before the Impressionist movement. We have over 10,000 images, so we're very strong in photographic history. In addition to that, we have over 500 Old Master drawings and small, but very good collections of Native American and African art." 
Regardless, Loving says "we could do a lot more to promote the arts at Notre Dame." 
"It just isn't a part of our tradition right now," he says. "I think that's changing rapidly, which is great. But there are other universities where the arts are a part of everyday life, and I don't think that's the case at Notre Dame." 
A CREATIVE CULTURE 
But for art, film and music students, daily life is all about the arts. 
"It's a cliche, but art is everywhere, and you'll learn things that will always stay with you," Rantanen says. "Industrial design is really hard to define. It can be shoes; it can be cars; it can be silverware. We've had an alum who worked on 'Iron Man' and another who designed the water in 'Avatar.' We're not inventors -although we can be -but we work on solving problems or improving products. For my Advanced Product Design class, the green trash cans on campus cost $2,000 each, and they keep breaking, so the university approached us to see what we could come up with.'' 
Beyond university projects, Rantanen says the design program focuses on real-world application. "Our main project this year is luggage, and our client is Kenneth Cole," she says. "We even took a weekend trip to go to New York, meet him and see his design studio. 
!twas amazing, and itwas very much about the real world. I'm not done exploring yet, and I don't know where I see myself, but I might do consulting. Thatway, one week I'd be working on a garden hose and the next week, I'd be working on the designs for Bob Marley ear buds. I like that kind of diversity.'' 
That diversity is also reflected in on-campus options for music students, junior music and philosophy major Rebecca Roden says. "There are definitely musical opportunities here. I teach piano lessons, I've been involved in PEMCo productions as a keyboardist, I play clarinet in an orchestra and I've been in an a capella group. You can do everything here.'' 
In the FTT department, too, film students work on a wide variety of projects. Last year, senior FTT major Javi Zubizarreta filmed his documentary "Artzainak" on sheep herding in the Basque country with a grant from the Nanovic Institute. 
"My documentary actually aired on the .Basque national television station," Zubizarreta says. "My cousins and uncles in Spain got to see it. And a distributor saw it, liked it and picked it up for distribution. It's been shown in Ireland, Spain, France, the Czech Republic and New Zealand, and now it's coming to the U.S.'' 
Since then, Zubizarreta has won the Princess Grace film award to fund his senior thesis project, which is a fictionalized account ofhis grandfather's life as a sheepherder in the Basque country before coming to America. 
"Only six kids each year win the film award, and I never expected to get it," he says. "With this award and this being my final film at Notre Dame, I thought that it had to be special. It had to be meaningful. So it's about, 'Why do I get this wonderful life and opportunities?' 
22 I SCHOLASTIC I 3 MARCH 2011 
It's about my grandfather who lived a hard life, herding sheep to help his family, and the film is going really well." 
Closer to home, DePrez traveled to California for her senior film project. 
"I got a grant to go to Comic-Con this past summer and study fan interaction and influence on television writers," she says. "I interviewed an executive from FOX, a writer from 'Chuck' and a woman who developed 'Arrested Development.' Itwas incredible and there's so much funding available. I just got a grant to go to Vienna over spring break and hear Schubert preformed live at the Opera, so I've gotten grants for both of my majors now. In that way, Notre Dame has definitely been supportive. Ifyou can come up with a specific artistic project, Notre Dame will fund it, and I'm so grateful for that." 
THE VALUE OF AN ARTS EDUCATION 
Aside from providing grants and facilities, students and faculty question whether Notre Dame's culture recognizes the educational value of the arts. Zubizarreta chose Notre Dame to study film, despite its lack of a reputation in the arts. "I'd applied to places in New York and California -real film schools like USC. But I knew that to grow as an artist and as a filmmaker that Notre Dame would be the best atmosphere for me. Notre Dame is the superior place to grow as a person, not just become technically proficient in the arts." 
He says, however, that his desire to study film was met by initial setbacks. "I had a bad experience with FYS when my adviser, who no longer works at the university, said to my face, 'Javi, film is a waste ofyour time. Switch to business.' And that was devastating. When I came as a freshman, all ofmy friends in the dorm were engineers or in business, and when you're surrounded by that, you start to-second guess yourself. You ask yourself, 'Am I wasting my life studying this?' But in FTT you're taken seriously as a filmmaker from day one, and you really-need that. You need someone to say you're on the right track because so many other people will be saying the opposite." 
Barber says many students in fine arts confront the idea that their degree won't be worthwhile. 
"We have to overcome the fears of those who would say, 'Don't go for an arts degree. It's a waste of money,'" he says. "We have students who come in and have to give up their arts degree because ofparental pressure. We need to continue to persuade these ~tudents and their parents··that, apart from the many

careers that can arise from our disciplines, there is real value in understanding how to think visually." 
To that effect, second year graduate student Jon Simpkins says his side interest in film complements his engineering studies. "My full-time thing as a student is engineering, but I do film on nights and weekends, and there's an incredible amount of overlap between the two," he says. "The :research I do relates to the technical aspects of photography and videography. Without those technical aspects, you can't get at the artistic side, so I see the two as going hand in hand. They really do play off of each other." 
But even for students fully committed to the arts, there are concerns about future security and the stereotype of "Arts and Leisure." 
Originally a mathematics major with plans to become an actuary, sophomore Edward Jacobson became a music history major after realizing that he only wanted a high-paying math degree so that he could afford to attend the opera. 
"I was a smart kid, and I felt like I had to be a scientist or a doctor," Jacobson says. "I was always good at math, so I went along with that, but I don't know that I ever really loved math. It was a lazy choice because it was just something I knew I could do. But music theory is difficult and challenging and wonderfully analytical. It's not as easy as my calculus classes were, but I'd rather work at it because it really interests me. I've wept listening to opera, but ifl had become an actuary I don't think I'd ever have that type of passionate experience." 
Despite his dedication to music, Jacobson says he still has a nagging feeling about its moneymaking potential. "I refuse to believe 
that a Notre Dame graduate will end up living 
in a box, but I do have this dichotomy in my 
mind that it's one or the other: making money 
or doing what you love. I'm sort of moving 
beyond that. I know that being an usher at 
the Met will bring me more happiness than 
being an actuary." 
Still, Jacobson says that he feels as though 
he occasionally has to defend his major. "If 
I say I'm a music major, I feel like I have 
to follow that up by saying I'm focusing on 
music history or that I'm interested in a liberal 
~~ There needs to be a 
change in Notre Dame's

arts education," he says. "I feel like I have to 
explain myself or qualify it, because ifyou're 
not doing accounting or nursing or something 
practical, the reaction is 'Then what are you 
doing?' I used to be pretty practical that way 
too, but being here I've become more liberal­
minded in that I want to get an education, not 
just career training." 
That does not, however, mean that the arts 
are always separate from practicality. 
"At Notre Dame, I've heard about being in 'Arts and Crafts' instead of Arts and Letters. But people would be surprised at how much work goes into design and how much time is involved," Rantanen says. "You really have to be able to problem solve and think creatively. It's not like we're only designing things that are pretty. We're doing things that have practical use, and there's a lot of research involved." 
Recognizing the intellectual value of the arts, as well as their real-world application, will be key for Notre Dame, Barber says. "There is vibrant and significant work being done in the visual arts on campus. We would like the university not only to invest additional resources into these areas, but also to come to understand and appreciate the intellectual value of these visual arts. We are working hard to become more visible and to make the connections that would link us to the rest of the campus. I think we now need to believe that this value is recognized." 
Zubizarreta says, "With the arts, people don't understand how they can be profitable, and they fear that. But you're not going to end up a starving artist living out of a cardboard box. The arts are not about selling your paintings on the boardwalk. Students interested in the arts need to know that there are jobs and opportunities out there. You shouldn't be afraid to try, because you cai:i­do it, and it is worth it. There needs to be a change in Notre Dame's way of thinking so that we realize the arts are a major part oflife. Whether it's going to see films, concerts or gallery showings, people need to know there are great things happening at Notre Dame." 0

Irish Eyes On: · ·'· ·. ·····•·· <. ·••·· ····•• 





DEVEREAUX PETERS
Luke Mansour 
enior forward Devereaux Peters has been a key contributor to the
S
Irish womens basketball team this season. The teams 23-5 start has 
sparked hopes ofa Final Four appearance on the 10th anniversary of its National Championship season. Peters, a Chicago native, burst onto the scene her freshman year, averaging nine points and 5.6 rebounds per game before her season-ending ACL surgery in February. After her sophomore season was again interrupted by reconstructive surgery, this season she has rebounded to post averages of 11.4 points and seven rebounds per game. Thanks in part to the efforts of a fully healthy and productive Peters, the Irish hope to make a run deep into the NCAA tournament this season. 
How difficult was it to deal with the two ACL injuries and three 
surgeries early in your career? Has that provided any extra motivation 
to succeed over the past two years? 
It was tough the first time. I think the second time I was mentally prepared as far as the rehab and lmew what I had to do to get it done. And it's definitely helped because I appreciate it more now: You don't take anything for granted when you're not playing, so I think it has put a drive in me, ignited more passion in me to play and focus and do well. 
You had a lot ofchoices in high school concerning where you wanted to play in college. Why did you pick Notre Dame? I got along with the coaches really well. I loved them and the team, and I thoughtitwas the best balance ofa really good program where I could come in and immediately contribute, and academics. That was really good for my parents, as well, on the academic side, but they also wanted me to play for a good team, so I think this school has the best balance ofthat. 
What do you feel is your biggest strength as a player, and, conversely, 
what is your biggest weakness? l think my strength is in my length and being able to run the floor well, which is not something you see very often in players my size. I think that sometimes my biggest weakness is moving on to the next play. I'm a perfectionist, so it's frustrating but I thinkI've gotten a lot better atit. But it's really hard to just let things go and think, "All right, I've got this. Let's go." 
What are your thoughts on the team's 23-5 record to this point? We were really frustrated with our losses, and we had a tough non­conference schedule. I think we were still trying to figure out who we were as a team. And now we know what our game is and what our strengths are, so we're really just working on that and getting better every day. I think the sky is the limit for us. 
What's one aspect ofbeing a student-athlete that the average person may not see? I think really just the time that we have to put in outside of basketball, even simple things like going to an away game, coming back at 1 :00 in the morning and having to go to an 8 a.m. class. I think people look at athletes and think things are handed to us, but they don't realize all the work we have to put in through practice and in games, lifting and study halls. 
26 I SCHOLASTIC ·1 3 MARCH 2011 
What are some of your favorite things to do when you aren't on the court? ­I'm a movie buff. I love watching movies. I consider myself more of a homebody ... I'd rather sit in and watch a movie with some friends than go 
out. 
Do you have a favorite movie? [Its] kind of embarrassing, but my favorite movie is "Finding Nemo." I love cartoons. 
What was your favorite sports team growing up? I'm a huge Celtics fan. 
A Celtics fan? What about the Bulls? Everybody gives me heat for that, but!just love the Celtics. They're definitely my favorite team. 
If you were stuck on a desert island, what's one book and one music album you would like to have with you? "The Coldest Wmter Ever" by Sister Souljah, and I think I'd have to go with "Confessions" by Usher. 
Describe Head Coach Muffet McGraw in a single phrase. I would say "brutally honest." She tells it like it is. 
Where do you see yourself in five to 10 years? Do you have hopes of 
playing professionally? 
I've been considering trying to play professionally, but I don't really know what I want to do with that yet. I'm letting that come to me when it comes. I definitely want to do sports commentating though, so whatever I do in five to w~~~~~~~~ @

In the first round of the 1970 NCAA men's tournament, legendary shooting guard Austin Carr turned in one of the greatest performances in college basketball history, posting 
a tournament-record 61 points and leading the Irish to a 112-82 victory over Ohio University. 
In the first 11 minutes of the game, Carr scored 21 points, but the Irish did not take a decisive lead until 6:29 in the first half. By halftime, Notre Dame led 54-41, and Carr had 35 points on 15-of­23 shooting. Carr's offensive attack continued in the second half. He scored his final basket with 49 seconds remaining, finishing 25 of 44 from the field and 11 of 14 from the foul line. He left the game to a standing ovation from a sell-out crowd of 13,450. 
Though the Irish fell to No. 1 Kentucky in the second round of the tournament, Carr's 52-point contribution to the game added another impressive performance to his resume. He scored 45 more points in a consolation game against Iowa. 
Throughout his career at Notre Dame, the 6'4" guard from Washington, D.C. scored 2,560 points, averaging 34.6 per game. He also ranks as the greatest scorer in NCAA tournament history, averaging 41.3 points per game in seven games. Carr was named the 1971 National Player of the Year and chosen by the Cleveland Cavaliers as the first overall selection in the 1971 ... NBA Draft. Nearly_40 years after his graduation, he still holds 25 -Notre Dame records for scoring and field goals. 0

HUMOR 


It hurts to be toyed with, doesn't it, my tiny, tender Giplings? Each and every time the permacloud disappears, the promise of spring plucks at the heartstrings of my naive, little soul. And yet, despite the vicious lies and propaganda spread by that pompous Punxsutawney rodent, the bitter winds of winter come rolling in time and again. It's really no environment for someone of my age, you see. 
Luckily, ol' Gipp has managed to lay his mythical hands on some most amusing anecdotes! Nothing puts a silver lining on the abysmal clouds of South Bend's winter season like a tale or two of miscreant mischief. As the snow begins to slowly melt away, you rascally rapscallions are raising hell all around campus and my informants are delivering the delightful details. The only thing that hasn't completely frozen over this year is the grapevine, Gipling_s, and I've heard a lot of resplendent reports this month. · 
It seems as though every group on campus likes to make its mark. Sometimes, it's the Feminist Club selling cupcakes in LaFun. Other days, we see the Hawaii Club shakin' its groove thang in Stepan. But if there's one group we can always count on to proudly hoot and holler their honky-tonk joy all across campus, it's those beloved Domers hailing from America's heartland. 'Twas not long ago this boisterous bunch gathered together for a friendly romp in the hay. Now, now, it was just a cowboy-themed dance! Get your minds out of the gutters, Giplings. 
After a night of passionate yee-hawing and sloppy square­dancing, one rowdy rodeo star -let's call him Buffalo Bill ­decided to bring the party home with him. Having had quite enough of the fusspot, neat-freak antics demonstrated by one of his comrades all semester, Buffalo Bill was itching to play a practical prank. Being of what ol' Gipp can only assume was a sound and sober mind, our outlaw swiftly swiped a large and cumbersome bale of hay from the dance. The lad clumsily hauled his unwieldy prop down the darkened sidewalks of campus, avoiding the scrutinizing stares of random passersby and Safe Walk employees alike. 
With no time to waste, Buffalo Bill pulled his plunder up the stairs, down the hall and into the perfectly made bed of his unsuspecting cohort. It didn't take long for the poor, innocent neat freak to spot what was amiss in his hospital-like room. In a fit ofHulkish rage, this mistreated mister began throwing pieces of hay all over the room. As tubes of Clorox went sailing around and filthy bits of fodder flew left and right, Buffalo Bill smiled 
proudly to himself, and then most likely passed out on a dirty 
dorm room floor somewhere. One thing is sure, friends -the 
Gipper will never mess with cowboys. 
Now hear you me, Giplings. I have perused DuLac at great 
length and have yet to find anything prohibiting the presence 
of hay in one's bedroom -provided it isn't there as a habitat for 
some type of carnivorous pet. That being said, our respectable 
rulebook does provide us with a plentitude of oppressive 
regulations. In our next saga, the protagonist finds himself 
breaking one such rule -among many other things. 
After a night of off-campus cavorting, two little lovebirds 
made their way back to Dome-Land for a romantic evening of 
very quiet canoodling in the lady's lair. Pesky parietals being 
what they are, the duo dared not tell a soul about its plans. So 
you can imagine, Gip_lings, what a shock it was for the damsel's 
unsuspecting neighbor, deeply asleep in her own chambers, to 
hear what she described as a most effeminate scream coming 
from the next room! 
Quick as a flash, the friendly neighbor was out in the hall, 
loudly offering her assistance. When the only response was a 
continued series of painful, girly screams from within the room, 
she finally threw open the unlocked door, fearing the worst, only · to be greeted by an unfamiliar gentleman on the floor. 
It seems that our male lovebird went soaring out of his 
companion's ceiling-high loft and onto a wooden table below. 
His ego and his back were sorely bruised, and the neighbor's 
eyes were surely scarred for life. The damage, you ask? Parietals: 
broken. Coffee table: broken. The once solid trust ofa roommate 
to open an unlocked door: BROKEN FOREVER. 
Fear not, my Giplings. All that is broken can surely be fixed 
-or at the very least improved with a large case of brewskies 
and the healing power of time. As spring gets sprung this year, 
remember to be bold, push the limits and keep me in the loop! 
Baby I was born this way, 
Gipper

EXIT INTERVIEW 

PROFESSOR LUCIEN STIEL 
You have studied and practiced nil over the world. What drew you to Notre Dame? 
[My] interest, since I first started studying, was in classical architecture. And Notre Dame is ... the only program in the world really teaching classical architecture. There are about 154accredited architecture schools in the U.S., and only one teaches classical architecture-this one. Also, Notre Dameis the onlyschool thathas a year [abroad] in Rome. So I [was] convinced immediately that this was the only school where I could really teach. Itwas the only school [where] I could find the resources, the intellectual feedback and the good scholastic relationships. What's important here is, ofcourse, the curriculum -focusing on classical architecture, urbanism and humanism. [Notre Dame's architecture program] really supports ethics in terms ofprofessional and moral standards. We would never support anything thatwould harm a community or harm the environment. It's a philosophy ofarchitecture that supports life and that also respects local traditions. 
What cities in tbe world are yourfovorites, architecturally? 

I'm relatively open to different cultural settings. I have spent much of my time in Italy, so I love Venice, Rome, Siena and Palermo. I also really love Barcelona, Spain; Lisbon, Portugal; Berlin, Germany -which is a very different, reconstructed city -and Paris. In the United States, I thought Washington, D.C., was really beautiful. I thought New York was a fantastic city, [as well as] Portland, Oregon; Philadelphia; San Juan, Puerto Rico. I've visited Seattle several times and really thought it was an outstanding place. · Savannah, Georgia is a beautiful place, as well. I've also been to Chicago several times, and I must say tliat Chicago has started a really wonderful development. 
What kinds ofbuildings do you most enjoy designing? 

Thatis a hard question to answer because myinterest ranges from landscapes to pavilions, streets, commercial buildings, hotels, residential facilities ... so there's no exclusion. For me, they are all part of the reality of architecture. This realityofarchitecture also includes buildings thathave never been built. I've seen factories that I really like, or warehouses that are really fascinating. 
You have worked extensively with mstainnble m·chitecture. How do you think Notre Dame is doing in terms ofsustainability? 
What I know is thatNotre Dame is very rigorously following the worldwide. standards for sustainability. The new buildings are all built with a high standard ofsustainability. In the architecture program, we have several classes promoting sustainable design. Generally, in our program and in theway that

Architecture Professor Lucien Steil studied architecture and urbanism in Paris and Vincennes, France, and has worleed at the Archives d'Architecture Modeme in Brussels, Belgium, with architects Maurice Culot and Leon Krier. He is a permanent member ofthe faculty for Notre Dame's Rome architecture program and is currently a visiting professor on campus. 
the campus envisions architecture and urban design, [the university] has a strong sustainable foundation. 
How do you view the state ofthe arts nt Notre Danie? 
I'm not really familiar with everytl1ing, [but] I came across very interesting programs in music and theater in both the city and on campus. I [wish] there could be ... a more synergistic connection between the cultural opportunities in the city and tl1e campus. I know that tl1e Snite Museum also has fantastic collections -Renaissance painters, native artists and exhibitions -that a lot of the students may see, but that I don't think many people in the city know about. Notre Dame also has one of the best architectural libraries in the country. [It is really] one ofthe best two in the United States in terms of rare books. In terms ofpainting and sculpture ... I haven't really felt that the art students are reaching out to get [tl1e rest of the school] involved -but maybe we in the architecture department are not doing that either. I think there's a bit ofa bunker situation in [the arts at Notre Dame] in which ea·ch 
department keeps to itselfand doesn't really reach out. 
What isyour favorite part about teaching in Notre Dame's Rome program? 
I must say I like everything about the Rome program. I like the fact that we use tl1e city as a learning experience. We almost didn't need books. Ifthere's a problem, we say, "Why don't we go out in the street and look at some buildings?"You could always, for anyurban problem or architectural issue, go out and look. I thinkwhat's also nice is the fact thatyou have a smaller group ofstudents and you spend all your time with them, so you get to know them quite well. [The professors] really get to be friends with the students. Plus, we like to teach. We don't see teaching as a one-way, "I'm teaching from my desk to the people" situation. It's a two-way relationship. We expect a lot of responsibility from [the students] but we commit, also. 
Do the nrchitectzn-e st11dents get to sleep more in Rome? 
I thinkRome is even worse! Theywork as hard as theywork here ... butthey are also independent and have to live in and experience the city. In Rome; you have a life that's going on 24 hours a day. There are a lot ofthings going on, a lot ofstreetlife, a lot ofthings to see, a lot ofparties. Between studying, experiencing the city and having a social life, there's very little time for sleep, actually. It's very, very demanding, but they enjoy it! It becomes a part of tl1e mythology of [architecture]. Even famous architects go without much sleep, but they seem like they keep going without getting old. It keeps them fresh and young.
