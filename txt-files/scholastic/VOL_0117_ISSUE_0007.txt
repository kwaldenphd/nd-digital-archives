· But there was a·. lot-more to this hard-fought·. battle , than ·just · one spectacular play. · From .the very start, the hitting was .vicious, with · many bone-jarring shots adminis~ tered every play.

But it was that kind of.-an, after­noon for both sides.;1 Frustration reigned supreme; as so often hap~ pens when two . big, hard-_hitting t~ams with nearly equal_ defenses 

literally as well as figuratively, as Bradley and the defense came up with the big play. There was still 
11 :17 left_ in the game when Bradley ra"c:ed into the Purdue end zone, but. the ,game was all but over; and· everyone knew it-in­cluding Irish Head Coach Dan Devine. 
Asked about the sophomore stal­wart's heroics in the jubilant locker room a little while later, the rookie coach quipped, "Well, Luther isn't as fast as I thought he was. ·1 beat him to the end:zone."

NORTHWESTERN 
Northwestern came, to ·South 
Bend. sporting an undefeated rec­
ord and already casting sidelong 
glances at what might be their year; 
if their first two games were any 
indication., They left less than 48 
hours later' staring· straight ahead, 
counting the cold miles back to 
Evanston,: and thinking of what 
might have been.. It's not that the 
31-7 loss at the hands of the Irish 
was a shocker, or . even . that it 
ruined their season, but an upset, 
instead of the annual embarrass~ 
ment, .would have: made a promis­
ing season even more enjoyable for. 
the Wildcats. · : . 
They. came as they always do, 
. with a busload of. big boys. from the ·corn belt/a characterization that could apply to any one or all o( ~he Big Ten teams. Among them :was·. a: pair of talented ·tailbacks .:who.promised to presenta·serious ·.challenge,. if not· ari overt threat 

by Dan O'Keefe 

to an Irish defense that was rated as one of the·toughest in the na­tion. Greg Boykji, had amassed 251 yards in the first two Wildcat vie­tories. Every team··has one man that must be stopped by the oppo­sition, and l'Jorthwestern had Boy-. kin., Dan Devine. had emphasized that he had tremendous balance, as well as how· difficult he is to bring down in his remarks during the week before the game. On the other side of .fullback Rich Boothe was Jim Pooler, whose previously 
unimpressive statistics gave little indication of his· ,ability. At the helm was Randy, Dean; who was faced with the task of replacing the Big Ten's leading, passer~ ,Mitch Anderson. · His scrambling per-: formance against Purdue had been 
an encouraging sign for Coach Johnny Pont 
. The Irish were. ready, too. They 
were glad to be home after a hectic 
week that was spent· mostly on · buses and airplanes. · They had looked impressive in half of the Boston College game: Five days later, they were less impressive on · offense and thrilling on defense in a victory. over Purdue that was a bit frightfuL But now they had a week of rest and plenty of time to forget last year's .home opener . when the West. Lafayette lightning had struck. .· · 
·That game had to be on every-: .one's mind when Northwestern scored after seven minutes had elapsed to take an early lead. The Irish had stumbled early,· the first possession. ending with an Al Hunter fumble and: the second with an interception by MarkHar­. low of Rick Slager, ·giving the 'Cats the ball at the Irish 26. North­
· western played "give the. ball to Boykin," and the tailback lived up to: his advance publicity by slash­ing for 26 yards a~d ·the s_core ir1 four carries. · · · 
Notre Dame·•. came marching right back as Slager mixed passes, sweeps and slants· masterfully and the Irish started to grind down the Northwestern defense. Slager:him­self swept left end on first and-10 at, 'midfield and gained 'four, -but had to leave the field with his bell rung. Montana stepped·. in to re­place him for what the· u~excited fans figured to be a· couple of plays. Eleven plays later, Al Hunter 
. had six poir1ts; the fans had a new 
•. cheer: "Let's go~ Joe!"; sportswrit­ers had a fun name to. play with; and for all intents and purposes, Joe· Montana had a job. . 
'.Al( Rick Slager· had-was a nead­ache. . . '· ·. y ·. 
. . . 

The rest of the, contest was no contest at all. The Irish '.'D," seem­ingly insulted by Boykiri's .sacrile­gious. trespass in their. end zone, came very much alive., Willie Fry, who patrolled the side that Boykin had swept on his touchdown· run, more · than made up for the per-: sonaL-outrage by blocking a punt, 
. sacking. Dean twice, leading .the defense with four solo tackles arid making;a general nuisance of.him"'. self as far as Northwestern was concerned. Freshman .Bob ,Golie was super .in. his · first start; mak­ing three solo. tackles and . seven · assists at. middle linebacker..:

Navy's game; on land or sea, is defense: That is, except in Nofre Dame Sta.dium.

This hadn't beeri. a conceivable possibility in years, but this was to be a year for 
firsts. .· ' . . '. ' . ' 
The older players tried to rally 
the younger ones so· that this squad 
would noi be remembered as the 
first Irish team to lose three con­
secutive· home: games since 1960. 
But this team wanted no part of a 
connection or resemblance to the

And, every ND athlete coach since the early sixties, De­
tion, which in 1966 and 1975 named him Coach of the Year. In recent years he has developed the girls' fencing' program to a point where the club sport will soon have varsity status. 
DeCicco spends most of his time, when he isn't teaching his mechan­ical engineering course or coach­ing his fencing teams, on counsel­ing. From the moment a student­athlete is accepted at Notre Dame, DeCicco keeps track of his aca­demic status. He studies the high school records and college board test scores. He sets up a three­
. phase program of study halls, tu­torial sessions-and a counseling program. 
"We try to help them over any · trauma the first year o( college might cause and help them deve­lop good study habits. Later we help them choose a course of study and meet degree requirements," he explains .

DeCicco wishes he'd studied psychology and counseling. "Only the school of experience has pre­
. pared me for this job," he says.

one for Parise. Two :freshmen ap~ peared :tc> be quicker and 'im::ire de­pendable in the opinion qf the coaching staff. The continuing pull . lingered for the first'few weeks of -the. fall. The unrest over the dis­. missal of Art Best -and its; reper­cussions for the harried senior, did 
little to enhance his-chances:,, 
. , He never was able : to budge Browner ·and Heavens Out of the backfield. His only. appearances in . varsity contests were as a tight end, and he never caughtl pass.
