EDNOTES 
I have a confession to make: I don't like football. I'm not from a football family. I go to the games, at least most of the time, definitely tailgate and always have fun, but I usually sneak out after halftime. I love the marching band, but standing for four hours in the cold to watch any game that isn't baseball doesn't hold much appeal for me. Plus, I get my pick of the special food in the dining hall before the post-game rush. Wins all around. Except for the team. 
I once explained my football apathy to a friend who responded, "Why do you go here?" Notre Dame is associated with a particular set of traditions and a specific typ~ of student with a given set ofinterests. The vast number of fans with no ND affiliation other than love for it and all it represents is a testament to what is commonly referred to as the "spirit" of Notre Dame, the intangibles that make this campus more than just a school. Still, while some master it before they even arrive on campus (see p. 14 for an illustration), getting into the swing of the typical Notre Dame student lifestyle is a task others never fully realize. 
Though I like Notre Dame now, I chose this university based on its academic reputation. I didn't know the words to the fight song, had only seen Rudy in passing when it happened to be on TV and didn't own a single piece of ND apparel before deciding to attend; I just wanted a school with a good ranking (the beautiful grounds didn't hurt, either). I don't pretend to be an intellectual powerhouse, and any pretensions I had were squashed at Trivia Night (read about my humbling experience on p. 16), but Notre Dame does accept some of the brightest students in the country. In spite of its academically high-achieving student body, some say that Notre Dame students do not spend time developing their minds the way undergraduates at other top universities do. 
A college experience (or a life, for that matter) without a dose of fun is incomplete and unhealthy (seep. 17 for the low-down on campus parties). Notre Dame students are known for their broad range of activities and accepted in part for their well-rounded interests. Some say the other side of this attribute, however, is a compartmentalized life in which thinking is relegated to the classroom, knowledge is important insofar as it is useful for a test and time outside of lecture is wasted on additional intellectual pursuits. In this issue's cover story (p. 18), Managing Editor Claire Reising explores the benefits and potential drawbacks of Notre Dame's "work hard, play hard" mentality. 
Enjoy fall break and remember to tip the Gipp. 
Until next time,

ESSAY 

An Essay by Chris Milazzo 

Ihate eating lunch. I always have, and I always will. I suppose I'm not a three­meal-per-day person, but at my Catholic elementary school, my habit proved problematic. The nuns were offended when I didn't finish my lunch, and they certainly knew how to make me feel guilty about it. "How could you not finish your sandwich?" they would say. "The pagan babies in Africa are starving!" At the time, starving babies were enough to make me finish my PB&J, and, honestly, I occasionally feel a twinge of guilt when I don't clear my plate at the dining hall. Whenever I do, however, I always ask: vVhy feel guilty? My unfinished sandwich, eaten or not, will not save the starving babies; it's irrational to feel guilty about it. I creatively call this "irrational guilt." If you don't understand, these examples might be more familiar: Your boyfriend or gii-lji·iend breaks up with you. Clearly, it must be so'IJlething you did. You received a tei-rible grade on your exa'IJl. lv[ust've been that half-hour break -fi·o'IJl studying last night. A certain football tea'IJl loses. You know 
you should've cheered harde1: (Well, this 
one is legitimate. I'm looking at you, 
freshmen.) 
In these situations, the guilt is self­generated. Sure, there are occasions when you give your significant other a good reason to dump you, don't study hard enough .or . don't cheer enough. Usually, however, there isn't a legitimate cause for your guilt. It's all 
in your head. 
This is crazy. We go to Notre Dame; 
I think: we all have enough on our plates 
without wallowing in guilt over the pettiest 
trifles. 
Perhaps we feel such guilt for that very 
reason. Notre Dame is a high-caliber 
institution, . and that_ reputation places a 
stress on its -student · body unlike ,that of 
other schools. It's not a conscious act by the 
university; Fr. Jenkins is not sitting in his 
office thinking of the best ways to stress out 
his students. It's just part-and-parcel of the 
kind of students this university, and others 
like it, attract. 
With stress comes pressure, and with 
pressure comes a sense of guilt when you 
don't live up to it. We should not, however, 
allow guilt to define how we live our lives. 
We might not be able to eliminate it, but we can certainly deal with it. 
vVe all have our own methods. Some wallow and complain, while others internalize it until it explodes. Then there are some who take it as an opportunity to go wild on the weekend, and create some Gipper-worthy stories. It has been my experience, however, that these methods and others like them only exacerbate the problem. They don't deal with guilt; they postpone it for a later, more inconvenient date. 
Maybe those methods work for you, but if not, what's a guilt-ridden student to do? The next time you suspect you're feeling irrational guilt, write the situation on a piece of paper. Then imagine you're turning it in as an essay to a professor. Ifyou can picture the professor saying, "I don't understand the connections," then maybe your guilt isn't founded, and you should move on from it. 0

Notre Dame, Our Forum 
A Yearlong Reflection on the Global Marketplace 
Alexandra Moulton 
Previously, the Notre Dame Forum was a singular event held in September in the Joyce Athletic and Convocation Center. Forum topics have ranged from "The Global Health Crisis" in 2006 to "Sustainable Energy" in 2008. This year's Notre Dame Forum is not one fall event, but instead encompasses multiple discussions on human development in the global environment during both semesters. 
The topic for this academic school year is "The Global Marketplace and the Common Good" because of current issues that have affected economies worldwide. The global aspect of these conditions demonstrates the repercussions of the economic recessions in recent years. In addition, the forum topic is a response to Pope Benedict XVI's 2009 encyclical, Caritas in Veritate (Charity .in Truth). 
The encyclical "offers a framework to assist the marketplace in working for the common good," according to forum.nd.edu. 
The first featured event, "Morals and Markets," occurred on Sept. 21 in Washington Hall. Notre Darrie professors Douglass Cassel, William Evans and Margaret Pfiel discussed their reflections on the Pope's encyclical through law, economic and theological points of view. 
Panelists Judge Kathleen Kearney, Terrence R. Keeley, Daniela Papi and Dr. Daniel J. Towle participated in the second event, "The Professions and the Common Good," on Oct. 6 in Washington Hall. The discussion focused on how the panelists' choices of professions reflected their aspirations to help victims of discrimination, oppression and poverty. 
Notre Dame professors and deans will participate in "The Impact of Technology" on Oct. 12 in Washington Hall. Dean of the College of Science Gregory Crawford, Dean of the College of Engineering Peter Kilpatrick, engineering and geosciences professor Harindra Fernando, and electrical engineering professor Wolfgang Porod will discuss the relationship between technology and human development and how their scientific research relates to the Pope's encyclical. 
The fourth featured fall event is already creating a buzz on a campus because of its main speaker. On Nov. 3, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist and best­selling author Thomas Friedman will be coming to campus to discuss the global marketplace in the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center's Leighton Hall. Brother/sister residence hall events will be held on Nov. 4 to give students the opportunity ·to reflect on Friedman's discussion. 0

Bipartisan spirit and the Midterm Elections 
Laura Kraegel 
With midterm elections less than a month away, it would be easy to label Notre Dame and the state of Indiana as red, Republican or conservative and move on. But Indiana went blue in the 2008 presidential election, with St. Joseph's County contributing to President Obama's win, which has left the politics of Notre Dame less certain for the Nov. 2 elections. "We feel that this campus is falsely stereotyped as being conservative," senior co-president of the College Democrats and political science major Eileen Flanagan says. "But the more you talk to people, the more you realize that there's a wide spectrum [of political beliefs]." The College Democrats attempted to display that spectrum at Progressive Day on Sept. 28, during which students with progressive beliefs on "social justice, environmental harmony, an equal and sustainable society based on tolerance and a respect for human dignity" were invited to wear blue and rally on South Quad. "The point is to wear blue and realize that if you are progressive, you're not alone on this campus," Flanagan says. "This is the first time we've ever had it, but there are a lot of people here I don't recognize. These are people I didn't know were progressive and that was the point." The College Republicans, however, wrote a Viewpoint letter in the Sept. 29 Observer, suggesting Progressive Day should have been a day "with Republicans and Democrats apparently united on Progressive ideals." 
"In wearing the color of the Democratic Party in support of the issues mentioned above, a false dichotomy is created, one that mischaracterizes Republicans, casting us as the opposition party to the American people," the letter said. 
While the College Republicans did not host a comparable Conservative Day, the club is working for the conservative cause. 
"Hopefully, election day will be Conservative Day," sophomore chairman of the College Republicans campaign committee and political science major Mickey Gardella says. 
To help those hopes become reality, the College Republicans have worked to keep conservative students up to date on the midterm races and informed on key issues. 
"We're trying to get more active conservatives to pay attention and not keep silent," Gardella says. "So many people will vote Republican when the election comes, but they should also be active [in keeping up with Republican politics]." 
Gardella and the College Republicans formed a new campaign committee this year, focused on making club members true participants. 
"We compiled voter information for each state -where to register, absentee ballots, 
ND may not be as conservative as you think: 
Democrats won in St. Joseph's County during the 2008 election; 
things like that -to send to our members. 
after our first meeting. That's already done," Gardella says. 
"And now we're getting information on all ofthe key races," he says. "I assigned each person [on the committee] five to six races to cover and they'll send me information on those races and candidates. Then we're going to send that information out to members so they'll know about their state elections. 
"Once school starts, you almost have no time to keep informed, but this way we can keep our members updated on what's politically important to them," Gardella 
says. The College Democrats have conducted similar projects to further progressive 
politics on a supposedly conservative campus. 
"People are often surprised to see what a strong club we are," Flanagan says. "We were Club· of t~e"Thr last year [awarded by the Club Coordination Council]. It's a big honor that has nothing to do with your political alignment and everything to do with how effective you are on campus. 
"We focus on the political topics relevant to what's going on," she says. "Last year, the topic was healthcare. We made over 6,000 calls for healthcare reform. For this little club at this conservative, Catholic school, we can be very influential." 
This year, the College Democrats are using that influence in the Indiana midterm election by phone banking and canvassing local neighborhoods. 
"We're mainly campaigning for 
[Democratic] Congressman Uoe] Donnelly," Flanagan says. "We'i;-e working with the

incumbent U.S. Rep. Donnelly will compete for re-election against Republican Jackie Walorski this November. 
The College Republicans are campaigning for Walorski, as well as for Republican Dan Coats, who is running against Democrat Brad Ellsworth for the open Indiana Senate seat. 
"We're enthusiastic to help them, and we're really excited about Walorski," Gardella says. "Coats should win -he's ahead in the polls -but Walorski's cleacllockecl with Donnelly. We think she has a chance to win here and this is really something of a battleground." 
Gardella says a successful showing at the midterm elections would be beneficial to the Republican Party after the Democratic wins in the 2008 election. 
"A victory in November would be really helpful. It'd be encouraging after Obama's victory when some people said the Republican Party would be dead," Gardella says. "So many young people were so excited [about Obama], but now there's discouragement. The party's not dead a~cl we've had signs of 

How They've Prepared 
confidence." 
Despite their ideological differences, the College Republicans and Democrats have moved toward greater cooperation in the last year. 
"There's an assumption that if you're a Democrat on this campus, then you're condemned. But that isn't true in my experience," Flanagan says. "The president of the College Republicans and I are actually friends and we communicate a lot. And that's not something that has ever happened before on this campus." 
"We don't have many events together, but there has been talk of maybe sponsoring a debate together -not students, but guest speakers, one from each [political] side," Gardella says. "I don't think that wiII happen now with the campaigns because we're busy and they're busy. But eventually, I think we'd be open to that." 
At the moment, both clubs are· co­sponsoring the Pop, Pizza and Politics lecture series organized by the Center for Social Concerns and are considering sponsoring a political debate comparable to last year's Goel Debate. 
"'Bipartisan' is a word thrown around a lot, especially in Washington, but we believe that it really does help the Notre Dame community and any political community," Flanagan says. "We're trying to lead by example." 
And though the College Democrats' Progressive Day event was organized for leftist students, speaker and professor Julia Douthwaite wore red and blue to emphasize "the democratic politics of give and take" and the importance of "the role of words in creating and sustaining a democratic consciousness on campus." 
"Having attended the Progressive Day rally on South Quad, gooclwiII from some was obvious," the College Republicans Viewpoint letter said. "Professor Julia Douthwaite's speech on bipartisanship and becoming informed spoke volumes." 0 
Both student groups have made extra efforts to inform student voters on major issues and candidate 
platforms in this year's midterm elections.

etwork Gone Crazy: 

The /\wkward Facebook Groups 
You have been invited by The Notre Dame Class of 2014. Julia Steiner 

hen high school seniors are accepted to the University of Notre Dame, most turn to Facebook to express their joy. Hoping to unite with fellow Darners, future classmates create groups as general forums for everyone "to get to know" each other. Some offer thoughtful wall posts such as, "yayyyy notre dame baby! <3." Others 
showcase their dedication by declaring "89 days till move in!" Some just want to find other kids from Vermont. By the time schedules and housing assignments come out, almost everyone feels the need to connect with, complete strangers and begin their ND experience online. The Class of 2014 was no exception, with a few distinct groups emerging as the summer wore on. 
The Celebrities 
Every group ofeager freshmen includes a few who choose to put themselves out there. Their intense activity is!}'t good or bad, but it is definitely noticeable. As a result, a few achieve Facebook fame and become celebrities in the group. 
The most notable ofthese in the 2014 group was freshman Gina Klingel, the reigning Miss Teen Indiana, a South Bend native and a self-proclaimed "obsessive liker [of statuses]." "I don't know how things would have been ifwe didn't have the group ... it was really important to me to try to be helpful and to meet a few people before school," Klingel says. During the summer, she was the go-to person for any questions about the South Bend area or ND, from places to get a haircut to the recommended size of refrigerators for the dorms. · 
She recalls that "people started friending [her] because [she] was so helpful." Each day, Klingel recieved a constant stream of 
.notifications and texts. On campus, people have asked her for her autograph. "It was just reaHy nice meeting people before college started." Not all celebrities view their activity in a positive light, however, as one active member who.preferred tc>~emain anonymous says, "I've taken a lot of flak for [my activity in the group], and I really regret it now." \ ' · 


Sophomore Spammers 
\ 
A common aspect of all "ND Class of" groups is the presence of upperclassmen who join to casuajly spy on the1naive freshmen, to give advice or to cause mayhem. Sophomore business and psychology major Brendan Ward, for example, made a fake bio video to spoof the freshmen posted. In it, he describes himself as "an avid color enthusiast" and ·"really-excited to go to Indiana." Brendan says he decided to "have a little fun" because he was excited to get back to schoo~,/-\ .. : , ·, 
But the spamming does not end there. A few sophomores started the discussion post "Freshman Advice Column.'1, One of these fonts 6f knowledge was the elus_i_ve.Cravin.Moorehead. This figure is now/he sole administrator 9f the-2014 grouii and sent out two Facebook messages toafl member~, ,orie of which contained a'video of in orangutan ~ri~ating in~chits o~m mouth~1While some deeply protested the spammers' behavior, many say it was humorous. As !vfoorehead's i;bommate and fell6w spammei-soph_omore civil engineering major Da1nny Waytula says, _''..We·hav<,! n() regrets. Our fa1orite thing we:did was blow up ihe group frorr!. the inside."

Since Sept. 11, 2001, developers have sought to reconstruct the area in and around Ground Zero in New York City. Recently, controversy erupted over the planned construction of an Islamic center two blocks from the site. The project, officially titled Park51, proposes constructing a 13-story building that would include a prayer space, a performing arts center, a swimming pool, a culinary school and other various public spaces. The center would be developed at a site that has already served as a prayer space for New York Muslims for over a year. Supporters of the plan say that the center would stand as a testament to freedom of religion, which is essential to the American identity. The imam behind the proposal, Feisal Abdul Rauf, says that the center would be a celebration of moderate Islam and would show the healing that has taken place between Muslims and the greater American community since Sept. 11, 2001. 
Critics, however, say that its proximity to the site of the 9/11 attacks would be an insult to the memory of the people who lost their lives there. 
The debate over this controversial proposal has been a point of contention o~ Notre Dame's campus as well. vVhile most students acknowledge the importance of freedom ofreligion, some take issue with the Islamic center's proposed location. "They do have the right to put [the center] there, but it's an emotional location," sophomore business major Kate Kenney says. 
Others affirmed the right to freedom of religion that all Americans are guaranteed by the First Amendment. "\il/hatever people may feel about the proposed mosque's proximity to the site of the Sept. 11 tragedy, whether it be anger or hurt, should not interfere with the protection of the rights guaranteed to all Americans in the Constitution;" sophomore business major Beth Panich says. 
Many students say they agree with New York Gov. David Paterson's recent suggestion that the center be moved to a more neutral site. As sophomore engineering major Stephen Schwaner says, such a plan would "show respect for the families who are grieving over lost loved ones due to the terrorist attacks ... but it [would] also show acceptance of the i\lluslim community." 
For other students, the Park51 center could serve as a positive reminder of the presence of moderate Islam in America. "What happened on 9/11 was the result of Islamic radicals, and the Islamic community center would be for everyday American citizens," sophomore business major Jessica Fay says. "I think it would be fine for them to build it there." 
The Park51 Islamic Center construction remains a complicated topic. It will continue to be controversial for many Americans, as it brings into question issues related to freedom of religion. 0

Campus Chat:t:er 
DEPARTMENT OF USELESS FACTS 
At Notre Dame, we think we're pretty smart. Or at least I do. I can handle the Daily Double, Will Shortz has nothing on me with the New York Times crossword puzzle (Monday through Wednesday only) and I know that ifl were in the Cash Cab, I would make it to my destination. By myself. 
With hoards of useless knowledge and self-confidence in place, I sauntered into Legends Thursday Night Trivia to jo,in my team, Hide Your Kids, Hide Your Answers, which, though it did not win a prize for best title, was one of the few printable team names. The restaurant was filled with Trivia Night regulars, a few groups who perhaps mistakenly stumbled in on their way to The Feve, more interested in the $2 domestic beer and margarita special than in trivia, and the trombone section of the marching band. 
Though situated away from the main action in a part of Legends where it was difficult to hear the announcer call out the questions, my team had crowd support, by which I mean the table of grad students my teammates and I were friends with and the large mustachioed Midwestern man enjoying hot wings and the "junior parents weakness" with his family who, though not playing, kept calling out answers. 
The first question was announced: "Which East African country ... mumble ... static ... something?" While my team's resident peace studies major racked her brain, a girl a few tables over nonchalantly asserted "Ethiopia" for her team before launching into the story about that time she had fever in Ethiopia while building houses/ distributing medical supplies/saving orphans from a burning bus, making the rest of us regret our decisions to not jump on the service­work-in-Africa bandwagon. If only we had known it would come in handy for trivia. 
The questions marched on through mythology, presidential history and state facts. My teammate Paul listened intently and concentrated hard while I made what proved to be my main contribution for the evening, singing along and pounding the table in time to "Tainted Love" as it blared in between questions, making it impossible to concentrate, or so I claimed. 
I was biding my time until something more my speed came up when there it was: "What were the real names of these authors who wrote with pennames?" The moment of glory for me and all other English majors in the room. And I choked. Beyond Mark Twain as Samuel Clemens, I couldn't remember a single one. Not Lewis Carroll. Not George Eliot. Not even Dr. Seuss. 
I was cursing my internet-less phone as everyone in the room whipped out iPhones and Droids when salvation arrived in the form of Kara, a grad student friend who provided five of the six names and proof that there is, in fact, a situation in which an M.A. in English is useful. 
I sheepishly returned to 80s and 90s pop hits and sought out friends to wave to, just too busy being social to tap into my store of trivia answers. Really. 
The evening drew to a close and when points were tallied, Hide Your Kids, Hide Your Answers had placed. I left Legends that evening with humility, a new tee shirt and the knowledge that you can call someone from Georgia a cracker and still be politically correct. 0

Welcome to the Dawghouse. Every weekend, this dorm recycles cans abundantly. Don't be fooled, though; Alumni also welcomes those who don't find sobriety appealing. Sure, every dorm has quads crowded with sweat, sleaze and strobe-lights, but Alumni's appeal is beyond just music in the dark. The Dawghouse is recognized as "consistent" and "chill." The most obvious evidence of Alumni's attraction, however, is also its greatest weakness. Its high concentration of females, or "Lady Dawgs," from the weekend before can create an uneven girl­to-guy ratio that could potentially ward off newcomers. Nevertheless, Alumni has some ofthe greatest variety in dorm parties. Whether you 
want a raucous dance party or~\.a. ~.c.i·ra. lizing kickback, Dawgs do not disappoint. ~\)\)) _

in things I'm interested in,"' 
he says. 
Senior math major Brooks Smith considered transferring during his sophomore year. He says that he applied to Notre Dame because he knew interesting people here who had gone to his high school. He was disappointed, however, that few people seem to enjoy intellectual conversations. 
"I think abstract discussion about art or about music or about cultural happenings is certainly not beyond [students'] capacity. Everyone here is incredibly bright," he says. "They don't see how they're going to profit from expanding their minds in that way. The biggest challenge for professors and other people at Notre Dame who are interested in that is to bring other people to the point where they can see that it would have a beneficial effect on their lives, that it would enrich them." 
Smith says that while stud.ents are well rounded, he wishes they had more time for discussion and contemplation, instead of rushing to different events. 
"Life is very fast-paced here and there's not much time to stop and smell the roses or read Rousseau. There's not much appreciation of the value of that either, because people feel 
20 I SCHOLASTIC I 7 OCTOBER 2010 
like if they're not doing homework all the time or if they're not being social or being involved with something, their time is being misused," he says. 
Director ofAdmissions Operations Robert Mundy says that in recent applications, extracurricular activities have not interfered with students' academic pursuits. When admissions officers evaluate applicants, they look not only for well-rounded students but also students with individual achievements, such as musical talent or research experience, who will make up a diverse class. 
"To be very honest, I think what we've seen in the last 10 to 15 years is as the academic side has gotten stronger, the non-academic side has moved in concert. Students are strong academically, but they're also busier," he says. 
But some students say their schedules may prevent them from attending ·academic events and learning about topics outside their classes. Although Notre Dame offers several opportunities, such as plays, concerts and lectures, it is often difficult to fit a showing of "King Lear" between soccer practice and hall council. 
Sophomore philosophy major Ellen Carroll says she gets several emails from the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies advertising lectures that she wants to attend. 
"There's just so much going on that it's hard for people to do everything. There are so many things I'd like to do but I don't have time," she says. 
While some argue that students spread themselves too thin, others value the well­rounded quality of Notre Dame students. Hahnsays he would like to see more attendance at intellectual events, but that he understands 
• I 
students need a break from academics. 
"It gets~im and serious soon enough, so there has to be a little bit of the pep rally and all those other [activities,]" he says. "Overall, I have to say that we have an appropriate balance with all these various elements and ingredients that go into making the life of an undergraduate." 
Hahn, however, says that professors could help students learn to enj_!)y intellectual events, such as performances at the DeBartolo Center for Preforming Arts. For example, ifa seminar topic corresponds with DPAC events, the professor can incorporate that into his or her lesson plan. 
"One could presumably tie.specific elements of a seminar into the sequence of events at the DPAC so that various seminars would then prepare a student for the delights of the 
~ 

performance," he says. "Maybe that kind of intervention can change things, but I don't think that's being done." 
Work Hard, PlobJ Hard 
Venter says that with students' busy schedules, their lives become unbalanced, rather than well-rounded. They adopt a "work hard, play hard" mentality and compartmentalize, in which academics are confined to the classroom and seem irrelevant to life. 
"I may be wrong, but it seems to me that it's a bipolar life. The courses and the intellectual [activities] are in the day and once you get into the dorms, you switch into this· other gear where it's social. It's either-or. There's no mix of the two," Venter says. "Both of those are extreme, and I think both of those are unhealthy." 
He says that more academic events in dorms might help break down this separation. "vVhat if you started doing things like having some classes in the evening or trying to create an [academic] environment in the dorm? I know at Yale [University] they have housemasters, actually professors and their families who live in the dorms," he says. "They have weekly events with speakers. There's a structure where they have intellectual, academic [events] come into the dorm." 
At the University of Chicago, professors and graduate students live in the dorms, and dorms host lectures once or twice a quarter, Musilek says. He adds that students at UChicago show a similar enthusiasm for academics that Notre Dame students have for sporting events. 
"Every time I've been to Notre Dame, when the football team is marching to the stadium, you see people cheering them on," he says. "The first day [of school at UChicago], there's a convocation, and all the students process to their residence houses. All of the returning students line up, and we all cheer for the incoming student class." 
But Duncan Hall rector and Spanish professor Rev. Tom Eckert, C.S.C., says that academic life is present in the dorms if students look for it. He says he hears academic discussion in Duncan, and students often help each other with homework. Academic commissioners in dorms also work to bring speakers into the halls. 
"I've always seen a very close-knit relationship between residential life and academic life. You really can't separate those things," he says. "If you walk down the hall on rounds, you will hear video games, you'll hear people Skyping their friends, but you're. also going to hear philosophical debates and people trying to figure out limits for their engineering assignment. I hear maybe not as much academic pursuit as social [talk] in the dorm, but there's definitely constant engagement there." 
Eckert says that being a rector and a professor helps him integrate dorm and class life. In Duncan, students often visit him to discuss their academic goals. 
"One student I know is studying economics and medicine because he wants to be a physician and shape health care in the future. He doesn't just want good grades to get to medical school. He wants to shape health care in America," Eckert says. 
Arts and Letter Dean John McGreevy says that he would like students to have as much pride in their major as they have in their dorms. 
"i,Vhen two Notre Dame students first meet, what do they ask each other?" he says. "rd like a few more students to ask, 'vVhat is your major?' vVe want to get more students to identify with their major and their

undergraduate education." 
Passive learners 
With study abroad programs, service­learning and campus clubs, students have several opportunities to expand their 
horizons. Although students take advantage of the activities around them, associate director of Notre Dame's Center for Undergraduate 
Scholarly Engagement (CUSE) Philippe 
Collon says that some students are more passive when it comes to academics, both 
inside and outside the classroom. He says 
that students should not be afraid to assert 
their own ideas. 
"We don't have a tradition ofstudents who challenge the professor. The faculty misses that, and I think we have to make students aware that this is part of university, of 
challenging, asking, pushing the boundaries," 
he says. "Asking a question and not knowing the answer is perfectly OK." 
Passive learning might give students 
weak classroom experiences, but senior management-entrepreneurship major George Pinchock says it may help them adjust to corporate life, learning to focus on the group 
rather than the individual. 
"On the surface, Notre Dame students make great employees for that reason," he says. "They do what they're told, they don't question it. They act as a group." 
As students pass through college focusing on grades and results, many have their eyes set on professional rather than academic goals. Many students pursue traditional occupations instead of choosing careers that require a doctorate degree. 
Among top universities, Notre Dame has an unusually low number of undergraduates who later earn doctorates, remaining in the bottom 25 percent of leading universities whose students later receive Ph.D.s, according to Notre Dame's Office ofStrategic Planning · and Institutional Research. 
Although these numbers are only one look at undergraduates' goals, assistant director 
for undergraduate research at CUSE Cecilia Lucero says they show that students could take more advantage of their education. 
"It's a proxy number, but it tells us that Notre Dame students are just going through, going to classes, getting good grades, but we wonder if they're taking as much advantage as possible of what they have here," she says. 
The low number of future Ph.D.s may also reflect Notre Dame students' cultural 
backgrounds. Hahn says that because Catholics are relatively recent immigrants to the United States, families may still see college as preparation for a career, rather than its own rewarding experience. 
"This idea of making a success in this country is probably at least still embedded in the subconscious of even the current generation," he says. "And so the idea ofbeing successful in a career is something that I think was present very early·on and is still present in some sense." 
Program of Liberal Studies professor Walter Nicgorski has worked atNotre Dame for over 45 years and has taught multiple generations from the same families. He says that the common curriculum among PLS students creates a strong intellectual community. Although PLS does not prepare students for a specific occupation, graduates have built careers in traditional fields as well as in academia. 
"In the long haul, many of them come to recognize that a strong liberal education where they do a lot of thinking, reading and discussing and get a lot of faculty attention prepares them for the world much better than sitting passively in large lecture courses where they may be getting some expertise," he says. 
For ~he Win 
Students arrive at Notre Dame with a vision for the future. As a result, some say that students may limit themselves to classes that further their goals, rather than exploring new interests, and may care more about grades than the course material. 
Venter says that ifstudents focus too much on grades, they miss out on personal growth. He compares the attitude to a game in which players caren;iore about the outcome than their perform:ince. 
"The o~ome. matters, so people don't really think about the process," he says. "I really dislike this pulling an all-nighter to write a paper at the last minute or pulling an all-nighter to cram for an exam at the last minute because that kind oflearning is anti­intellectual in a sense. It's inert knowledge -just putting stuff in your head so you can spew it out again." 
Although students who cram may do well on tests, Venter says that many of them do not remember the information. When he asks students about their classes from previous semesters, several say that they forgot what they learned, even though. they earned Ns. Instead ofbuilding a body ofknowledge, they jump through ho·ops to graduation. 
But Musilek says that concern for grades

and love of learning can coexist. It only becomes a problem when students avoid hard or interesting classes to inflate their GPAs or focus on the numbers rather than what they are learning. 
"Ifyou take the class that will improve you as a student and you fight for the grade because you want public recognition ofyour effort or you want it to be useful later down the line, that's something to be commended," he says. 
Pinchock says he sees apathetic students in several of his classes, and some who only go to class for the attendance grade. While he finds some courses interesting, he says that few students initiate discussions in class. 
"In my business classes, I do not think I have ever seen a student except [one graduate student] stay after class to talk about something intellectual. It was always about their grade or some kind of administrative detail," he says. 
Venter says that Notre Dame's athletic culture might contribute to the emphasis on winning and losing in terms of grades. To curb this attitude in his classes, he gives three unannounced midterms throughout the semester. He says this method encourages students to read, pay attention and review their notes regularly, instead of cramming for a test. 
Encouraging research and graduate studies 
CUSE, which opened in fall 2009, promotes student intellectual life by providing funding for research opportunities, from working in a biology lab to writing a novel. Students who do research become more self-motivated to take ownership of their education, Lucero says, instead ofseeing class as a series ofessays or exams. 
Senior physics and German major Elizabeth High says she has done research since freshman year and intends to go to graduate school in physics. 
"[Research] actually makes physics more interesting in the sense that it gives it a purpose. You can learn an equation in the classroom, but being able to apply it makes it more fun for me." ' 
For High, a passion forthe subject motivates her more than the prospect of a high-paying job, since she says the work is challenging and physicists do not make much money. 
"Physics is something you have to really enjoy or get some sort of fulfilling feeling out of to be able to survive the field because it is very intense, and if you're not enjoying what you're doing, it gets tough to manage the strain. You have to get a certain enjoyment out ofspending eight hours on it and then finally coming up with the right answer," she says. 
McGreevy says that the college is also promoting independent work among Arts and Letters students. In the past, the college had put a modest emphasis on senior thesis projects. Now more students are writing theses and doing independent projects such as creating films and directing plays. 
CUSE encourages more students to consider graduate school as an option. Although academics may bear the stereotype of the ivory-tower recluse, Lucero says that students are often unaware of how people

with advanced degrees can change and serve society. 
"It is a form of service if you think about using your mind to address issues of policy, ofhealth, of anything," she says. 
But Notre Dame students applying to graduate school also have a high chance of success. 
"I think, in general, graduate schools look very highly on Notre Dame students," Lucero says. "I think it adds to a graduate program's prestige when students are coming from Notre Dame because they know they're getting top students." 
CUSE also assists students who are applying for competitive national scholarships or fellowships such as Rhodes and Fulbright. According to CUSE assistant director for national fellowships Roberta Jordan, the number has risen over the past IO years. She says students have shown a greater interest in graduate studies and fellowships, but the influx may also be in part due to a lack of available jobs. 
Ultimately, Lucero says it is the students who are responsible for their intellectual development. As CUSE provides more research opportunities and departments emphasize undergraduate thesis work, students must seek out these options. 
"The best [discussions] happen spontaneously, and that's what people remember," she says. "Students have to step up and take ownership of their own learning. They have to feel comfortable with taking that risk."

Irish Eyes On: 
Catie Mohamed 

Not only is junior American studies and film, television and theatre major Kristen Dealy one of the most versatile players on the volleyball team, but she is also a leading hitter and blocker. Dealy plays an important role on the team which swept its first two opponents on the opening weekend of Big East season play. One of the region's top players and the leading hitter on the team with 875 attempts last season, Dealy is making a name for herself and is hoping to lead the Irish to a successful season and the 2010 Big East Volleyball Championship. 
What do you think the team needs to do to keep winning and 
make it to the Big East Championship? 
We're a really young team. We're getting better and better as the games go on, so we need to keep building on what we've done before and keep being more consistent. ·when we're all playing to our potential at the same time it can be really good.

The third game of the season for the Irish in 1977 was a test; they had just come off a loss and dropped eight rankings, to No, 11 overalL A loss would put them out of contention for 
a major bowl game. The first half didn't go Notre Dame's way; the Boilermakers led 24-14 and Purdue quarterback Mark Herrmann was lighting up the defense. In the second half, the Irish defense came out with a different attitude. Herrmann was limited to nine completions out of27 pass attempts after halftime. Irish cornerback Luther Bradley also had a key fourth quarter interception. The momentum shifted over to the offense as well, as Irish quarterback Rusty Lisch connected with running back Terry York for a touchdown. To close off the game, however, Coach Dan Devine called upon quaterback Joe Montana to complete what would become the first of many comebacks in the next two years. He threw a late touchdown to tight end Ken MacAfee to complete the fourth quarter comeback. The Irish shut down the Boilermakers in the second half, winning the game 31-24. The first of several improbable victories (overcoming deficits ranging from eight to 22 points), the win began Montana's reign as the "comeback king." By overcoming the deficit in this game, the Irish sparked a IO-game winning streak, culminating in an easy victory over No. 1 ranked Texas in the Cotton Bowl to earn the national title. 0

In December 1999, the National Coli~giate Athletic Association levied sanctions against Notre Dame's football program for major violations involving a booster's gifts to players. The Irish lost two football scholarships and were placed on probation for a two-year period. Kim Dunbar, a Notre Dame booster, provided up to eight players with gifts that were "extravagant in nature," as the NCAA Committee on Infractions reported at the time. Dunbar's nebulous \ ~~atio_nship to the university was a key •: issue m the case, as her booster status 'Was/~.<;~arly defined.

The long and challenging process of educating incoming student-athletes begins during the recruiting stage, Associate Director of Athletics Jill Bodensteiner says. 
"During that time [student-athletes] start to learn about initial eligibility requirements for the NCAA and ongoing academic requirements. They might start to learn about agents and advisors, depending on their sport," Bodensteiner says. "A lot of educational efforts start with the coaches during the recruiting process." 
These efforts continue once the student-athletes arrive on campus in late summer. The compliance staff conducts mandatory, hour-long rules education meetings for every team. 
"During that session we go through every category of rules you can imagine," 
"We do reminders about outside competition during the summer ... We reeducate them about extra benefits and summer jobs. You can't accept a summer job from a booster unless it's a legitimate job and you're getting the same rate of pay," Bodensteiner says. 
The Compliance Office is currently developing a program to offer high-profile student-athletes additional information about issues that will be relevant to them as they pursue professional careers. Players from all sports who are considered likely to compete professionally are eligible for the additional education. 
."We're. going to get that crew together on a little diffei;~imetable other than just the begin£ing \md end of the year meetings," Bodensteiner says. These student-athletes will focus on matters like dealing with agents and advisors, and taking out an insurance policy to protect themselves in ~he event that they get

J,•·~~----­
That being said, I'm incredibly impressed with our student-athletes ... When I do talk to the really high-profile student athletes, I'm amazed at how wise they are about the dangers of this business,? Bodensteiner says. 
Becoming familiar with every rule in the 440-page NCAA rulebook is an unrealistic task for both players and coaches, Bodensteiner says. "But the good news is the stuff that will really get you in trouble is common sense. Is it difficult for a student-athlete to remember that taking a 56-inch plasma TV from a booster is illegal? No, that's pretty easy," she says. 
It is quite possible, however, for a student athlete to overlook some of the more subtle rules. For example, joining

would not dunk twrne:tY ~ about can become a agents, ethical conduct and sportsmanship, potential rule violation for a student-athlete. and academic progress toward a degree. 
But, Bodensteiner says, "If they trip. up They get a really broad sense ofthe NCAA on something like fantasy football, the rules and how they can affect them. 
consequences of that type of trip up versus the consequences of breaking a major, obvious rule are quite different." 
Another prominent challenge facing institutions like Notre Dame is regulating what its boosters do, which was underscored by the controversy involving Dunbar. Although one would assume that the NCAA has clearly defined who qualifies as a booster, in reality it is a gray area. 
"First of all, what is a booster? Second, who are Notre Dame's boosters under whatever definition we apply? Third, how do we best communicate and educate those boosters all over the world, some of whom we have contact information for and some of whom we don't?" Bodensteiner says. 
Because of the many difficulties in contacting and educating boosters, the Compliance Office focuses most of its efforts on the student-athletes. "The best way to control what boosters are doing for our student-athletes is to educate our student-athletes," she says. "vVe know exactly who the student-athletes are, where they are, and how to get to them. It takes two to screw up. It takes a student­
· athlete and a booster. We try to make our student-athletes very aware of the dangers." 
The Compliance Office also reaches out to local hotels, restaurants and bars to inform these establishments about what they are and are not permitted to do. "We have mailings that go out to local retailers. We remind hotels that they can't offer special deals to student-athletes' .parent; during football season," Bodensteiner says. "We also remind local eating and drinking establishments that they can't offer deals 
to our student-athletes." Although it can be challenging at times to play by the rules, Bodensteiner says 
~ ,.(6\:/c;, by the Compliance Office. "We're staffed -JILL BODEN~.Tf.lNE.Bf[;:t at five, which is right where we should }\J, l:h be. For our size program that's the right

. tfJJY tfJ/ 
she is confident that student-athletes can 
resist temptation as long as they heed two 
key pieces of advice. First, ask before you 
act. "If you're ever in a situation that you 
think is a close call, ask us. Do whatever it takes to find somebody who can help you," she says. Second, if a situation seems too good to be true, then it is. "If there's a sweet deal and your buddy who isn't a student-athlete isn't allowed to get that deal, then something's wrong," she says. 
While Notre Dame has been able to remain free of sanctions in the past decade, the same cannot be said of many other top college football programs, most notably USC and Michigan. Even so, Bodensteiner does not believe there are any major differences between Notre Dame's approach to promoting compliance and the approach taken at other schools across the nation. "I think it's really similar across the board. We all network and talk to each other. You know number," Bod~nsteiner says. "That wasn't the case back m the day. We were a pretty small compliance department." 
While the issues Notre Dame's student­athletes deal with continue to increase, the Compliance Office will keep helping them what all the other schools are doing so you try to keep up with them," she says. 
Bodensteiner says, however, that Notre Dame probably has an advantage over other schools in promoting compliance due to the tendency of Notre Dame's student-athletes to live on campus, where they can be more closely monitored. 
Although the sanctions received in 1999 represent a blemish on the football program's history, the university has since made a concerted effort to learn from those mistakes. A major change was made to the number of professionals employed

I must admit, my little Giplings, I was a wee bit worried. There was a fear deep within my harried heart that you wouldn't come through for me. That you might actually start this year off on the right foot -living every clay free ofscandal and shame. Surely, ol' Gipp would unclerstancl, given the circumstances. The glitz and glamour of syllabus week have sizzled off. The South Bend sun is slowly slipping into its six-month period of hibernation. Even the Viewpoint articles are stuck in a rut. It seemed that the only interesting thing in our sleepy little city was that teeny tiny billboard mix-up. 
But did you sit back and let another month drag on, dull and deprived of drunken mistakes? Nay! In true collegiate fashion, you rose above and beyond my expectations. You took the torch and proudly pounded clown your forties, knocked back your Natty Lights and powered through the hours. You made rash decisions and childlike choices without considering a single consequence. And, honestly, the Gippster could not be happier. You see, my raucous little rascals, I am like a proud papa each and every time one of my loyal readers tips me with a tale or two. But before I shed a tear of jubilant joy, let's dive right into some of the more recent rumors! 
'Twas a Friday night like any other at duLac. The floors of Hesburgh were packed with diligent Darners. Every girls' dorm was alive with the sound of hair dryers as each lady laboriously looked for the perfect combo of jeans and a cute shirt. And somewhere far clown South Quad, a group of boisterous boys was preparing for a night out on the town with some chill music and chillier beers. To their inebriated eyes appeared a younger member of the dorm, looking to mooch some much-needed libations from his peers. In the spirit of Notre Dame's genuine generosity, the mature young men made said spirits available and, after some cheerful chatting, they sent him on his merry way. 
During their clisorclerly descent from the heights of the dorm to the overpriced cabs waiting below, one member of the herd decided to display his dexterity. In a foolish feat of manliness, he leaped from the top of the stairwell on his· way clown, attempting to smack the stairs above with his hand. (What this act was meant to accomplish is a mystery to Gipp, but I'm sure every little lass within a one-mile radius sensed that something impressive was taking place nearby.) 
The daft little daredevil smacked the stairs, all right, but not with the body part he intended. As his cranium connected with the jagged edge above him, a most impressive spout of blood began to gush from the head of this luckless lad. The group around him scrambled for a solution to the sticky situation, and just as they thought all was lost, their younger friend appeared again! "Don't worry," he shouted. "I'M TRAINED." As the boys inquired as to what exactly he was trained in, their newfound friend grabbed the (now disgusting) head of the battered boy and planted a big ol' smooch right on his forehead. 
While this didn't exactly solve, well ... anything at all, really, it did provide a bit of comic relief in an otherwise disastrous state of affairs. The younger gentleman took off running, and the daredevil was quickly delivered to a doctor so that his friends could proceed to get their funk on. And while this night may be no more than a drunken memory for the group involved, Gipp thinks it's safe to say that the two will be blood brothers for life. How sweet. 
Not far from this scene, another tasty turn of events was taking place near iVIain Circle. After an evening of imbibing at one of the countless classy downtown establishments, a Domer dame was biking back to campus (quite the safe situation, it would seem). Coincidentally, one of Our Lady's most notable athletes was dropping off an acquaintance in the circle at exactly the same time. When he spotted this sweet specimen, he sensed an immediate connection, and rolled clown his window to woo her. While she firmly informed him that she was a true lady, she would in fact be DTS (clown to snuggle). The joyous jock happily accepted these terms, and she abandoned her bike for the comfort of his car. 
After a Nicholas Sparks-esque night of snuggling and discussing their respective hopes and dreams for the future, the two drifted into a peaceful, platonic slumber. But at some point in the wee hours of the morn', the unfortunate athlete made the mistake of sneaking over to her side of the heel. With a feat of strength comparable to that ofHercules, or perhaps those scary studs that lift semi-trucks with only their teeth, the little lady threw the poor player out of the bed! He realized tliat this was a force to be reckoned with, and kept his careful distance for the rest of_the night. In the morning, like a true gentleman, he dropped her off near her abandoned bike so she could make the appropriate cycle­of-shame back to her dorm. Gipp feels a wee bit bad for this unlikely victim of sleep violence, but perhaps it will teach him not to procure a snuggle partner in the darkened corners of Main Circle. 
There you have it, folks. Another month of salacious stories and titillating tales, brought to you by your faithful Gipper. I live to serve, little ones. But don't forget: I can only serve up my delicious dishes of raunchy rumors with help from all of you. So don't sit back and let the rest of the semester go by untainted. Get out there and make some mistakes, Giplings! And remember, nothing reinforces the foundations of a friendship like publicizing your pal's most mortifying moments! Peace, love and tip yo' Gipp. 
I want your bad romance, 
The Gipper 
P.S. -If your tip gets published, Gipp will provide you with a pretty little prize. Let the rumors start rolling in!

Another Touching Moment Brought to You by SDH

.ho said chivalry was dead? He 
obviously never had the chance 
I 
. to eat at South Dining Hall. I had worried that living off campus this year would mean the end of long, drawn-out dinners spent people-watching and procrastinating. I lamented the fact that my days of allocating an hour and a half (OK, two hours) for dinner were over. How silly of me. Of course I got a meal plan. I moved off campus to live 
independently. To experience life outside the bubble. So, naturally, I'm shelling out so that I can eat at the DH. 
I 
But that is beside the point. My original argument that chivalry is alive and well among the Notre Dame population stems from a chance encounter during the 6:00 
p.m. dinner rush at South. I was meeting two .of my housemates for dinner before I had to be at an information session about a possible employer. (Take it from Billy Madison, kids: Cherish your time before the real world comes a-knocking and it's time to find health insurance. Cherish it.) Theywere late, of course. 
So there I was feeling a little like Nemo, just waiting to be found, but if I wanted to eat before this meeting, I was going to have to be brave and forge on without them. I maneuvered my way around a packed salad bar and bypassed the hot food section altogether (Carl's Chicken draws a crowd, it seems) when suddenly it hit me: Things had come full circle. Here I was, a senior, about to face the debilitating reality ofeating alone in a standing-room-only dining hall. Well, que sera, sera. I found myself a spot at the end of a table occupied at the other end by three girls enjoying their meals. That was supposed to be me, but no. Thanks, roomies. 
I tried to look inconspicuous as I picked at my meal and read that day's Ohserver(which I had already read twice, but I sure as heck wasn't about to be the kid who sits and eats silen~ly by herself). That's when it happened. I heard the screeching of a chair at the other end of the table and then all of a sudden ­
"Hi! Do you want to eat with us?" 
There in front of me, waiting expectantly for an answer, stood one of the freshman girls from the other end of the table. I am not some cynical senior who assumes that any and all strangers are underclassmen. I made this assertion on fact, not assumption. One word: lanyard. One look at the freshly minted, crease-free student ID card that hung around her neck and I just knew. There she was ­the headshot version of the girl standing in front of me -smiling up at-me with her first-day-of-school-smile from inside the protective plastic case of the standard issue Notre Dame ID Card Holder (available at your local Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore). 
Contrary to the seemingly endless games of Frisbee played on South Quad each day that the mercury rises above 45 degrees, summer camp is over. It's time to get a wallet-or one of those Vera Bradley change purses ofwhich the bookstore is so fond. At the very least, remove the lanyard from around your neck and let it hang from the pocket of the North Face fleece you'll invariably be wearing within two weeks. Don't be fooled by this brief foray into sunshine and mild temperature. Camp Notre Dame is a fleeting phenomenon. But, I.digress. 
I politelyde~lined. I assured her that I had friend' coming any minute. By the look on her face, she didn't buy it. It felt like a scene from some chick flick where the leading lady gets stood up at a crowded restaurant and has to convince the overly attentive maitre'd that her date is indee~ going to show. Where were my roommates? Itcouldn't possibly take them this long to walk over from Jordan. 
My freshman friendsmiled·and returned to her end of the table. "I'm a senior!" I wanted to scream. I have friends, really, I do! But then I realized that this girl had more guts than I ever did on my second Monday of freshman year. Good for her. Awkward for me. Embarrassing and a little cringe-worthy even, but good f!:>r her.

HUMOR 

Maria Lynch 
Idealistic freshmen come to campus hoping to have the perfect roommate: a best friend who doesn't smell and sleeps like a rock, who will get their jokes and watch Scrubs reruns with them, who will cheer them on in their Quidditch matches and help them understand their chemistry homework. Unfortunately, it's never that simple. Your roommate will inevitably have annoying habits, like an inability to decide what to eat in the dining hall, a frightening dependence on the snooze buttonoraninexplicableaddiction to has-been TV shows like One Tree Hill I've seen many friends try to be roommates and fail miserably, while two people who would never hang out in the real world have awesome roommate chemistry.

about how much I hate you." And then I laugh. She gets my point, but she won't hold a grudge because she's not really sure if I'm mad or not. Ifyou need more sarcastic comments to throw at your roommate, I suggest watching Will Ferrell's infomercial "Dissing Your Dog." 
While you might think having different political views would be a downside, I beg to differ. Just like a romantic relationship, your platonic roommate pairing needs to stay spicy. As much as her "Ronald Reagan was the best president ever" rants make me want to throw up, they're not nearly as bad as, "I wanna be Sasha Obama's best friend." "So do I." [Awkward pause]. That's boring, and having a boring roommate is worse than having an occasional fight about the merits ofmeat with a roommate who is a card-carrying member of PETA. The only exception is if your roommate is voting for Palin in 2012, in which case you're too different and it will never work. 
The ideal roommate relationship is symbiotic. Your roommate needs to depend on you for something. For guys, this might mean that each ofyou has a different favorite flavor of protein shake. You need to be on good terms with your roommate so you can have a vanilla Mus elem an shake with the cookies your mom sent you, and have your roomate know that if he annoys you now, he won't be able to satisfy his chocolate craving when it's that time of the month. 
For girls, clothes are usually at the center 
of an interdependent relationship.

good-looking. In my case, my roommate has the tiny, blonde, tan, conservative Catholic market cornered. I am none of those things. The rare person whose dream woman is a tall, super-pale, freckly girl won't accidentally fall for my roommate. This is a good thing because then there's no competition. I give her automatic dibs on all guys shorter than 5'5" (which eliminates at least 50 percent of ND males), while she lets me claim anyone who has the makings of the next Andy Samberg. 
Finally, you and your roommate must share a love ofthe game. Ifyou both love football, you two will always have something to talk about and be depressed about together. Even though I can't count the number of times I've been woken up at 7 a.m. by her Justin Bieber alarm clock, I thank God that my roommate is never the girl that accidentally cheers for the other team or flirts with guys in the fourth quarter. 
If, for some inexplicable reason, you don't care for football, at least make sure that you and your roomie have the same level ofapathy so that you don't annoy each other. DuLac has statutes banning burlap and decorative wood shingles in dorm rooms, so itshould have room for a rule that ifyour roommate is cheerful after a football loss, you are well within your rights to apply for an emergency roommate transfer. 
Whether you're a freshman worried about room picks or an upperclassman, the roommate market is dog-eat-dog. Just ask the guy who · gets stuck living with the transfer student. 0

EXIT INTERVIEW 
ASSOCIATE DEAN PETER HOLLAND 
Emily Yates 

Peter Holland is an Associate Dean for the Arts, a McMeel Family Professor in Shakespeare Studies for the Department of Film, Television, and Theatre, and a concurrent professor in English. He has a Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge and has written books on Shakespeare and pe1for1nance. He is the editor of Shakespeare Survey as well as many Shakespeare plays including "A Midsummer Night's Dream", which is part ofthe Oxford Shakespeare series. 
You previously taught at Cambridge in England. What made you decide to teach in the United States and specifically at Notre Dame? 
Notre Dame wrote to me and said, "We have a new chair in Shakespeare in the Department of Film, Television, and Theatre," and I thought, "That's wonderful!" This is the only Shakespeare chair in the world that is not in the Department ofEnglish. I had spent most ofmy career trying to persuade people in English departments that performance is worthwhile and now I spend time teaching students in film and theatre that Shakespeare is worthwhile. 
Why do you think so many people love Shakespeare? 
I think people love Shakespeare because he writes about people. There is no greater writer at exploring what happens [when] human. And that's exciting. He tells great stories, and ifwe learn, as we should do, to enjoy Shakespeare when we're very young, we find that it is just fun. I have a simple rule about Shakespeare: I hate any Shakespeare productions that are boring. I don't care whether they're done on trampolines and trapezes orwhether they're done in Elizabethan costume, as longas they really excite me ... Most people are taken to their first Shakespeare play when they are much too old. My daughter w~nt to her first Shakespeare play when she was three and she loved it! , 
Why do you think people are not excited about it? 
I think a lot ofpeople suffer because they are taught Shakespeare badly [in] middle school and high school. Theythinkthat Shakespeare is elitist and difficult and not for them. And then, ifthey see the right movies, or they see the right shows, they get excited all over again. That's what happened to me. My teachers at high school were not good ... but my parents loved going to the theatre and they took me when I was young. I started going to Stratford-upon-Avon when I was nine and I thought it was the greatest thing I'd experienced. I still get a buzz going to live theatre ... It's a peculiar feeling [when] I think [that] every time those actors are up there, [they're] doing the show for me. It's not like going to the movies where there isn't that connection. In theatre, "It's for me." 
Does Shakespeare take over all aspects ofthe art world, then? 
Yes, anywhere and anything. One of the things that's happened at incredible speed at Notre Dame in the last 11 years [is an outpouring of] Shakespeare events happening here: Actors from the London Stage, the Notre Dame Shakespeare Festival and so on. One of the things we've been doing with all ofthis is to [present] Shakespeare in different 
places and different ways. I have written about Shakespeare onYouTube because I think it's great. There is a wonderful rap version ofMacbeth ·­on YouTube done with Lego figures which is a riffon Eminem's [song] "My Name Is" is called, "My Name is Macbeth," and I just think it's hysterically funny. I show it whenever I have an excuse and I find many excuses. There is excitement and energy and fun in somebody doing that. 
What isyo11rfavorite language other than English? French because I understand it best, Italian because it sounds best when you sing it, German because it's most abstract, Latin because it's the foundation ofart and civilization, much more even than Greek, [and] Hebrew because it's the language ofmy religion. 
Productions ofShakespeare'splays by Actorsfrom the London Stagefamously contain limited costuming andstage design. Whatpositive and negative effects do you think this brings to the performance and production? 
I think the positive for AFTLS shows is always that it makes people watch the actors' craft. This semester we had "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and you got that exhilarating sense of watching very, very talented actors showing offtheir skills. I don't thinkthathappens quite as much in any other kind of theater. The negative side? Well, there are odd moments when you just wish there were six or seven, perhaps even ~ghrae\ors in the ~ast. But I will put up with the negatives for all of-the posit~ves. 
What are some things Notre Dame is doing to further Shakespeare? 
"Taming ofthe Shrew" at the very beginning of the semester was [put on] by the young actors in the Notre Dame Shakespeare festival. They were playing it in parks across the region and then the performance in front ofthe Dome with people on blank~ts sitting out having a picnic. We do work with the Robinson Community Center, which has its own Shakespeare company oflocal kids aged :up to about 15 who are doing full-scale Shakespeare productions. They talk about the way in which doing Shakespeare gives them confidence and makes them feel better about themselves, and it's wonderful that Shakespeare can help young people develop in that way -not as actors, but devel~p j~st as people. All ofthese things are what Shakespeare makes possible. It's academic study and it's fun and it's working with the community and it's reaching out beyond the boundaries ofNotre Dame ... That's got to be good. 0
