Until recently when placing a Long Distance Call you always met with the response, “We will call you.” Now on many long distance calls, the operator requests you to “Hold the Line” while she immediately proceeds with the call. ^Communication is established with a speed undreamed of a few years ago.	One of the requirements for
this “Hold the Line” service is that you give the Long Distance Operator the telephone number at the distant point This permits the operator to proceed at once without the delay incident to seeking the required telephone number in the directory for that point.

e coughed—the Nillain\
and the love scene had to be taken all over!

Madge Bellamy explains the. growing popularity of Old Golds in Hollywood "The 'hero* in a movie may easily become the 'villain’ if he coughs at the wrong time. A cough isn’t ever nice, but when it interrupts the taking of a movie scene, it’s a calamity I The high tension of movie work makes smoking a vital relaxation. But we relax with old golds. They’re as smooth as the polisbed man* ner of Adolphe Menjou, who himself is an old gold fan. While they’re the most enjoyable of cigarettes, OLD golds mean absolute 'fade-out’ for throat-scratch and smoker’s cough.” (SIGNED)	lQ

Spring
comes to
Duneland
Soon all the birds will be back in Duneland, Indiana Dunes State Park. The snows are gone now, and the great ice formations along the lake are likewise. If you are optimistic, you might say spring is here.
It will be spring flower time— the lupine will be on the old forest trails. If you have ever wanted to see the Dunes at their wildest, the time is on the way. The first day you have, put on your outing togs, pack a lunch or have one put up for you at Tremont station, and tramp the Park. You’ll see Mother Nature in the midst of her spring housecleaning.

The mosquitoes are back. And flourishing too, though they are not thoroughly acclimated. Those students whose love of leisure, or limelight, necessitated some illegal holidays following the Easter recess have also drifted back. Neither mosquitoes nor students have yet attained their normal healthy state—they wander about with little discretion as to where they flit or what they penetrate. The campus mosquitoes of this year are a sickly sort. The one I killed last night had an undersized neck and a gait that is associated with a whiskey tenor. When mosquitoes deteriorate we must blame ourselves. Their health is an index to our comparative soundness inasmuch as we are their food supply. The emasculating vacation, the nerve-wracking low returns on the examinations, and the tra-la-la effect of so much green grass, warm weather, and adventurous shrubbery—all these things have taken their toll from our constitutions. And if you doubt me just observe the next mosquito that bites you. It will stagger off as amazed as the negro who put codliver oil on his hoecakes.
When the students from the small towns, the very small towns, open the home paper these days to the locals they find bits like these: “Our Christian friend, Elder Berry, was seen planting onions in his back lot last Saturday morning.” “Another sign of spring: the printing office has had its win-, dows cleaned.” And if your home town is as small as mine the editor of the weekly monstrosity indulges in those personal touches that made American journalists of the last century so proficient with the brick bat and six-shooter. The twelve year old son of an editor must feel as public as the town pump when he reads something like this in his father’s paper: “The editor’s three boys are in high spirits over the change of underwear allowed by the welcome weather.” Spring shouldn’t have signs; soaps and cigarettes have ruined the word. But one consolation we small towners have: everybody in the village knows we are in college; indeed, they know of every course in which we flunk. And as for spring —those pink pyramids flanking the walk in front of the Administration Building are only magnolia trees elated with warmth and azure skies. As for a more prosaic evidence, the residents of Sorin are beginning to look with annoyance at the freshmen who habitually sprawl ovex' Sorin porch. But the look changes to one of delightful expectation at the recollection of that goodly body of water which has so often dampened campus garb and garbage. The sin of freshman inflation is listed in the category of tradition as sacreligious. All violators have a constipated conscience.
Henry Thoreau, the eccentric New England philosopher, lived alone in a hut that he built in the woods. He would eat no meat, do no unnecessary work, and enjoyed his life only in so far as it differed from the lives of other men. To him a watch and chain was more restraining than a ball and chain. Had Henry lived on campus his existence would have been pitiable, for here we not only live by clocks, but the clocks have fantastic arms that reach to every corner of the campus and regularly shatter the scholastic silences. But
a wandering bolt of lightening from the eternal skies became irritated at the petty clanging of our temporal bells, * and on Sunday night the bolt silenced the campus clock and bell with one fell blow. One cannot argue with lightning. Even the clocks know that, for now the convalescent timepieces ring out in humbler and quieter strain.
Some men die of old age, others of sleeping sickness, and an egregrious few swallow razor blades. The razor blade	•
expedient appeals to me through its novelty, though the moral	*
consequences are said to be appallingly uncomfortable. Lucifer is known for his warm receptions. Disregarding the means of your exodus, the fact tritely remains that all men indulge in a last onion. The university, however, disapproves of our attempting the swan song on the campus. Funerals interfere with classes, and are, at best, a morbid distraction. * As professors traditionally wander about unaware of the existence of actualities, and freshman inquisitiveness has repeatedly asserted itself in efforts to see if automobiles really will run over anyone planted on a highway, the road in front of the University has been closed. With the obvious advantage that the summer sessionists who take golf as their major subject will be able to paddle about in the misplaced water hazard without having to endure the jeers of passing taxi drivers.
The Easter formats were not too formal. The hours were rather informal, collars and corsages vied to outwilt each other, and as a refreshing change most of us had dates with girls who were just girls. Truly pleasant, to meet such ’ girls, after the regular diet, consisting either of those who live back of Studebakers and study English at the Palais, or of those who are openly taking college courses in how to be a rich man’s wife. The Villagers dance after vacation was a bit provincial, and the Naval Reserve Ball held on the same night drafted most of its recruits from our own Swiss navy. George Brautigan is getting the annual spring * K. of C. formal ready for next Friday, whereas Harley McDevitt heads the literary galaxy who are inaugurating a Formal Dinner Dance for the staff members of the campus publications. This affair of the literati is a plot of the editors, who wish to find if the contributors’ taste for beauty of phrase and diction is deep rooted enough to extend to other forms of aesthetics. A dance was given Tuesday night " at the institution in our rear—not Moreau. Upon being asked if he were going to attend that affair a campus philos-ophei’ sagely answered, “No, she knows I haven’t money enough to go to the K. of C. formal.” It is only such men . who makej life worth the daily shave. Quite some time ago Cinderella was fitted out by a hypothetical godmother for one of the Chicago Club formals. And by clever manipulation of a glass slipper the young lady secured a life partner ? all of whose ancestors had had gold fillings. Glass slippers are all very well, but when Cinderella wants her foot kissed she is no longer Cinderella. She is a very comic, and a rather tragic Ella Cinders.	—A. H.

SENIOR BALL NOTES
The ticket sale for the Senior Ball at the Palais Royale on May 10 is moving along in brisk fashion, according to Jack Reilly, general chairman of the dance. All those who contemplate “making the Ball” must have their first deposit of §5.00 on their tickets in before April 13. This is to enable the Committee to judge the proper amount of favors to be ordered.
The cost of each ticket is §12.50. They may be obtained from the committeemen in the various halls
Bill Butler is chairman of the Ticket Committee. His assistants are: Sorin Hall—Frank Havelick, Tom Markey, Earl Keezer; Badin Hall—Fred Wagner, James O’Connor, Barney Hugger; Corby Hall—Frank Belting, Frank Ahern; Off-Campus—Ted Havran, Norman Hartzer; Walsh Hall— Walter Donnelly; Lyons Hall—Daniel McNally.
Johnny Johnson’s Hotel Pensylvania orchestra which is to play for the Senior Ball is one of the most popular dance orchestras in the East.
The Johnson band has been the star attraction at the Hotel Pennsylvania for a year and a half; was- at the exclusive Club Mirador, New York City, for two seasons, and was a favorite of Palm Beach, Miami, and Atlantic City. Even a partial list of Johnson’s professional engagements is an impressive recital, including the best known and most exclusive and expensive entertainment centers all the way from New York to Florida, with stop-overs at Atlantic City and Philadelphia, and a flyer to London and Biarritz. He has also appeared at the Pelham Heath Inn, the Adelphia at Philadelphia, the Montmarte Club at Palm Beach, and the Embassy Club at Miami.
FOUR CONCERTS GIVEN BY GLEE CLUB ON ANNUAL EASTER TRIP
The Glee Club returned last Friday from its annual Easter trip, during which concerts were given in Cleveland and Canton, Ohio, and Rochester and Rome, New York. Thirty men traveled under the
leadership of Professor Joseph J. Casasanta, head of the Department of Music at the University, and director of the Glee Club and Band. The Reverend J. Hugh O’Donnell, C.S.C., accompanied the men on the trip in the capacity of chaplain.
The men departed from South Bend at noon Easter Sunday and arrived in Cleveland the same evening. The next night they gave their first concert in Cleve-
land s new Music Hall. The	fred J. WAGNER
concert was sponsored by
the Cleveland Alumni and the Notre Dame Girls’ College of that city. John Butler, soloist of the Glee Club in 1926 and 1927, was chairman of the concert. The men were guests at a dance following the concert at the Hotel Hollenden.
Tuesday afternoon the Glee Club entertained 1,500 people at the City Auditorium, in Canton, Ohio, under the auspices of Mount Marie College. A dance followed the concert.
Rochester, New York, was the scene of the club’s third concert Wednesday evening, where they were heard by one of the largest audiences ever to attend a university concert. Approximately 2,300 people were present in the Knights of Columbus Hall. The concert was arranged by the K. of C. and the local alumni, who also entertained the men at another dance.
The Glee Club dedicated the new Capital Theater in Rome, New York, Thursday. The men were greeted by a large audience, and were guests at the usual dance after the concert.
Owing to the illness of the sponsors of concerts planned in New York City and Long Island, tentative plans for these affairs were cancelled and the men left for Buffalo and Niagara Falls, New York, immediately after the Rome concert. After touring the Falls, the personnel departed for South Bend late Thursday evening.
It is estimated that 6,000 people heard the Glee Club on the four nights it gave concerts. A. J. Kopecky, Club soloist, and a member of the Glee Club for four years, was encored time after time during the concerts. Fred J. Wagner, president of the club, also entertained as soloist and was exceptionally well received by each audience. The banjo artists, Zeno Staudt and Edward J. Donovan, and the 'Happy Four, William McAleer, John Beljon, Zeno Staudt and Thomas Salmon, supplemented the regular program with instrumental and vocal novelties. Like Kopecky and Wagner, they too were encored by every audience.
The four concerts were a striking tribute to the directorial ability of Professor Casasanta, as attested by the very favorable criticism the club received at the conclusion of each concert. H. Jerome Parker, business manager of the Club, also deserves credit for the capable way in which he handled all arrangements on the trip.

The annual concert given by the University Glee Club took place Sunday night, March 24, in Washington hall. The program which consisted of sacred, classical, humorous and campus selections was fine in every detail, although the absence of the soloist, Anthony Kopecky, was regrettable. Edward Gore took his place very capably in the “Italian Salad” selection and in several solos.
The outstanding number was “Swingin’ Vine” with Fred J. Wagner in a baritone solo. As president of the club Mr. Wagner has been Professor Casasanta’s right-hand man in the work connected with the organization; as soloist Sunday evening, Fred pleased the whole audience with his soft, crooning voice, which was typical of the old South of which he sang. Edward Gore sang “When My Ships Come Sailing Home” in a manner that lacked nothing in solo performance. He was accompanied by John Beljon on the piano.
The program opened with two sacred selections, “Regina Coeli,” by O’Connor and “Innocentes pro Christo” by Palestrina; these were followed by “Agnus Dei” from Gounod’s Second Mass. All of these numbers showed a rich quality that was ideally suited to religious music.
The “Italian Salad,” an old favorite of the Club, was one of the most enjoyable numbers on the program. Musical terms and restaurant delicacies were tossed about by the chorus, led by Edward Gore, in true grand opera style. “Jazz Fantasia” which was directed by Professor Casasanta at the piano, was up-to-date melody from its opening “Hey! Hey!” to the final bars. Other numbers on the program, all of which were excellently rendered included “A Sea Song,” the “Song of the Volga Boatman,” Mother Goose selections as “Old King Cole” and “Peter, Peter, Pumpkin Eater,” and the campus songs, “Hike, Notre Dame,” “Down the Line” and the “Victory March.”
The supplementary program was equally as good. John Beljon played “Rhapsody in Blue” very capably and followed this with several songs in his popular “variation” manner. William McAlleer and Thomas Salmon, who are rapidly becoming the favorites of the campus continued to please with “Dream Train” and other songs. They were accompanied by Zeno Staudt on the guitar, who introduced several novelties in style of playing. Staudt was also heard during the intermission with Mr. Donovan, in a banjo duet.

APRIL 20 LAST DAY FOR JUNIORS TO ORDER PINS
Saturday, April 20, is positively the last day that the • Juniors may order their Senior Pins. It will be impossible to accept orders after this date so the members of the class are asked to cooperate with the committee in charge and get their orders in early.
It is obviously impossible for the committeemen to visit each individual member of the class so the orders will have to be taken at the following addresses: Larry Mullins, 323 Lyons; Gus Bondi, 7 Lyons; Mike Bishko, 250 Corby; Hugh Hayes, 801 St. Louis Blvd., (also in the Off-Campus office); Denny O’Keefe, 202 Corby; Ed England, 234 Walsh; and Bob Hellrung, 339 Walsh.	.

SENIORS ATTENTION!
All seniors who have not returned the caps and gowns issued to them for the Washington Birthday exercises are requested to do so at once. Failure to' return the articles by tomorrow, Saturday, April 13, at noon, will result in them being charged on the semester bill. The caps and gowns should be brought to 126 Sorin.

A convocation of all sophomore students in the college of Arts and Letters will be held today at four o’clock in Washington hall, for the purpose of conferring with the heads of the departments in this college, regarding the selection of a major subject for senior study. Following addresses by the heads of each department, the students will be given the opportunity to consult them concerning the selection of their major.

The English department of the University has received . an announcement of the foundation of a new magazine for the publication of creative efforts of university and college students. “Manuscripts” is the name selected for the new publication by its founder, Willis H. Kinnear of Indianapolis.
“Manuscripts” is expected to fill a need of college writers by offering them the opportunity to have published works of a high grade which might not find means of publication elsewhere due to the set criteria of other mediums.
Short stories, poetry, essays, critical studies, and woodcuts will be accepted and all material used will be paid for by the magazine. The magazine will appear monthly starting with the issue of next September.
Students in approximately one hundred and twenty-five institutions of higher learning have been invited to submit material. Further information may be obtained from the Reverend Leonard J. Carrico, C.S.C., head of the English de- -< partment of Notre Dame, or from any of the professors in the department.

This dance which has for many, years been one of the outstanding social affairs on the Spring Calender is to be held, as is the custom, at the Palais Royale in South Bend, Friday.
Chair-man, George Brautigan, capably assisted by • the personnel of Iris various committees, has arranged for the presentation of high class entertainment to add to the novelty of the evening. Already the Mound City Blue Blowers, a group of harmony kings without the conventional instruments, who are in great demand as radio entertainers throughout the mid-west, have been engaged to appear on the night of the dance. Together with these masters of harmony Frank Sylvano, popular radio artist from station KYW, Chicago, will be present to entertain the members and their guests. One of the leading orchestras in this section of the country will furnish the music for the occasion, and will greatly add to the novelty of the dance.
The number of tickets to be sold has been limited in order to avoid over-crowding at the dance, and as the dance is just one week from tonight it is advisable to secure them as soon as possible. The much coveted ducats may be procured from any member of the.ticket committee stationed in the various halls, or in Room 231, Main building.

PROMINENT SPEAKERS FEATURE LAW CLUB’S ANNUAL HOYNES’
NIGHT PROGRAM
Following their annual custom of tendering their felicitations in a special way to Colonel'William James Hoynes, LL.D., Dean Emeritus of the College of Law at the University, the members of the Law Club observed Hoynes Night, Friday evening, March 22nd, in the Lay Faculty Dining Room, with a banquet featured by the addresses of noted educators and jurists.
Gerald E. Roach, president of the Law Club, presided at the affair and presented the toastmaster of the evening, Professor Clarence Manion, of the Notre Dame College of Law. Professor Manion, in turn, introduced the prominent University officials, alumni, and guests, who had assembled with the members of the Law Club to felicitate the man in whose honor the Hoynes College of Law at the University was named.
The Reverend Charles L. O’Donnell, C.S.C., president of the University, was the first speaker. He told of how the Colonel, in addition to what he had already done for the law school, had established six scholarships for the education of boys studying for- the priesthood in the Holy Cross order. The next speaker, Dean Thomas Konop, head of the College of Law at Notre Dame, in his tribute called special attention to the Hoynes award of one hundred dollars, which is given annually at commencement time to a member of the graduating class for excellence in the study of the law and fitness for practice at the bar. Following these two speakers, Vitus Jones, G. A. Farabaugh and Dudley M. Shively, of the South Bend bar, John W. Eggeman of Fort Wayne, and M. M. Oshe of Chicago, prominent jurists, all of whom graduated under* Colonel Hoynes, added words of praise and love for him, each recounting some reminiscence showing the lofty place which the Colonel holds in the hearts of his students of former years.
Colonel Hoynes himself, when called upon to speak, limited himself to a brief expression of gratitude for the honor he had received. His words contained a note of sincerity, however, which could leave no doubt in the minds of those
present as to the humble appreciation of the Colonel for this showing of esteem and affection on the .part of the students of the law school and his other friends.
Besides the Rev. Charles L. O’Donnell, C.S.C., and the Faculty of the College of Law, the Rev. Charles C. Miltner, C.S.C., dean of the College of Arts and Letters, and the Rev. J. Hugh O’Donnell, C.S.C., prefect of discipline, were present to join in the felicitation of the Colonel. The South Bend bar was further represented by Walter Clements, Elmer Peak, H. J. Robertson, Paul M. Butler and J. J. Hemphling.
Following the speaking program the entire assembly arose and stood for one minute in silence in honor of the late Judge Dudley Wooten, former professor of law at the University, and a prominent figure at other Hoynes Night celebrations. Arrangements for the affair were handled by the following committeemen: Henry Hasley, chairman; Marc Wonderlin, Thomas J. Johnson, Jr., Edward McKeown, Thomas V. Hap-per and William J. Coyne.

COMMENCEMENT POET, ORATOR, AND VALEDICTORIAN SELECTED
The selection of three members of the senior class to the honorary class positions of poet, valedictorian and orator of the 1929 graduates, was announced recently by the Reverend Leonard J. Carrico, C.S.C., head of the department of English. The three seniors receiving the respective honors will have prominent parts in the commencement program next June.
Murray A. Young of Poteau, Okla., a senior in the College of Arts and Letters, and president of the Scribblers, was awarded the position of class poet. He has been a frequent contributor to campus publications and is an outstanding writer of verse.
The department of Architecture for the first time in the history of the University will be represented in one of the three honors by John P. O’Neill of Ogden, Utah, who has been chosen class orator.	•
The valedictorian of the class of ’29 will be Clair Blackall, of North Baltimore, Ohio. He is enrolled in the College of Science and throughout his four years college career has maintained an exceptional scholastic average of over ninety-five percent.
Scholarship is but one of the important factors considered in the selection of these representatives, personal qualities and abilities, also being carefully evaluated. The honor accruing to each of these men proves their worth and merits the congratulations of the Scholastic on behalf of the Uni--versitv.

SIXTH UNIVERSAL N. D. NIGHT EXPECTED TO SURPASS PREVIOUS RECORDS
The Sixth Annual Universal Notre Dame Night, Monday, April 22, shows every indication of breaking all previous records. The Alumni Office has received more widespread response from the fifty organized Notre Dame Clubs than ever before, and ten communities at present unorganized expect to launch definite Clubs on that Night.
To add to the spirit of the Night, the Alumni Office has arranged with a number of prominent radio stations to broadcast Notre Dame songs throughout the evening programs, so that those friends of Notre Dame who take no active part in the celebration may at least hear the stirring songs of the campus. '
Many of the members of the faculty and administration will address groups of alumni on that Night. The Alumni Office and the S. A. C. are considering details for some observance of the Night on the campus.

32 STUDENTS PASS; 17 CONDITIONED, AND SIX FAIL IN ENGLISH QUALIFICATION
EXAMINATIONS
Thirty-two out of fifty-five candidates passed the qualification examination for the English major, held on Sunday, March 10, and Sunday, March 17. Seventeen students were conditioned and six failed.
Writing, at 40% possible, was the subject of the first examination; while the second consisted of English Literature, at 35% possible, and Miscellaneous English, at 25% possible. Father Leo L. Ward, Professor Phillips, and Mr. Withey were the examiners in Writing; Professor Staunton and Mr. Smithberger in the English Literature; and Father Carrico, Professor Fenlon, Mr. Myers, and Mr. Moran in the Miscellaneous English. The passing grade was 75%; a grade between 63% and 75% merited conditional approval. A grade below 63% wTas a failure.
A meeting of the successful students was held on Sunday, April 7, in Room 222 of the Main building. Father Carrico, C.S.C., head of the English Department, addressed the students and outlined the courses they would have to take. Professors Phillips and Fenlon of the English Department also spoke to the students, stressing the importance of a thorough knowledge of English and the advantage of an early start in the writing of the thesis necessary for graduation.
Edward E. Brennan, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Letters at the University received the highest average in the examination. His mark of 90.5 was five-tenths of a point higher than the average of Emil L. Telfel of Newark, New Jersey, also a sophomore in the Arts College of Notre Dame and a member of the Scholastic staff, who gave him a close race for the honor.

FATHERS J. HUGH O’DONNELL AND P. J.
CARROLL ADDRESS K. C.’S
Short talks by the Reverends J. Hugh O’Donnell, C.S.C., and Patrick J. Carroll, C.S.C., featured the regular bi-monthly meeting of the Notre Dame Council of the Knights of Columbus held last Monday evening in the Council Chambers, • Walsh hall. Both speakers expressed their interest in the * council’s activities and reiterated their statements in previous speeches before the local Knights in that they were ever leady to assist them in their affairs as far as they were able. Father O’Donnell’s speech was exceptionally interestir..'- for in it he traced the history of the land upon which the University now rests from the very first knowledge which we * have of it down until the time when Father Sorin founded the first College upon it. .
It was announced during the business part of the meeting that the next initiation, enrolling candidates in all degrees of the order including the third degree, would be held on next Sunday in the South Bend Chambers. The first degree was exemplified last evening, and the second and third degrees will be performed on next Sunday, April 14. Following the initiation on Sunday a banquet will be tendered to the newly initiated in the banquet room of the South Bend club house. Lecturer John Dorgan, who has full charge of the banquet, announced that many prominent speakers from the surrounding vicinity have been secured to ad- * dress the Knights on Sunday evening.
During the course of the meeting, Frank Ready was introduced to the gathering as having been appointed 1-Lhe Editor-in-Chief of “The Santa Maria” for the one remaining issue of the current school year. He’ announced that the next edition of the official organ of the local council would be published on or about May 1.	•
For the musical entertainment of the evening John Dorgan obtained the Mound City Blue Blowers, and they proved . to be all that they were heralded to be, and even more, as it was generally agreed that they were the best set of mu- v sicians, without the conventional instruments, that ever graced the Notre Dame Council Chambers.

MEN YOU KNOW
From any angle that one may choose to view it, poetry is inevitably seen as something intensely personal; first, its flames burn whitely in the minds of its makers, and, then,
REV. PATRICK J.
CARROLL, C.S C.
are transmuted by them into finely objective mediums.
The inner personality, if one may be permitted the phrase, of any real poet is always fine and glowing; but that personality which those who come in contact with him know, is not always compatible in excellence with its more subjective counterpart.
However, we have in the Reverend Patrick J. Carroll, C.S.C., a poet who ever breathes congeniality and richness, from his cheery “Good Morning” to his best poetic utterances.
Too often a poetic career and a career involving contact with mundane practicality are regarded as two quite distinct affairs; too seldom is it seen that one is a distinct aid to the other.
But Father Carroll, in addition to the Professorship of English (which he now holds) has also been Vice-President of the University and discharged the presidential duties while Father Walsh was in Europe.
Father Carroll studied at the Catholic University of America from 1898 to 1900, laying there the foundation for a four year tenure of the Presidency of Sacred Heart College in Watertown, Wisconsin, holding this position from 1903 to 1907. From 1907 to 1909 he held the same post at St. Edward’s University, Austin, Texas.
For the next four years he was Professor of English and supervisor of the Scholastic at Notre Dame.
From 1913 to 1922 he was pastor of St. Joseph’s Church in South Bend, returning in 1922 to Notre Dame, where he has since been Professor of English with the exception of a • two year term as Vice-President, from 1926 to 1928. He is also supervisor of the Scholastic and chairman of the Board of Publications.
In 1926 he received his Litt. D. from Duquesne University.
But his activities as an author are our real concern here. In 1914 came a book of short stories, “Round About Home,” and in 1916, another volume of the same kind, “Memory Sketches.” Also, in this latter year, appeared his first collection of poems, “Songs of Creelabeg.” Then we have an eleven year gap, during which time, however, America, Catholic World, The Ave Maria and The Ecclesiastical World all saw him as a consistent contributor of verse, short stories, and essays.
In 1927 was published his first textbook, “The Man-God.” Really, however, one should not be so quick to denominate this fine interpretation of Jesus a textbook. A loving portrayal of the life of the greatest Figure in all history, it has been used as a Freshman Religion text here since September, 1927.
A short story, “How Shane Found His Soul,” was given honorable mention by Edward J. O’Brien in his annual selection of the best stories of 1927.
A poignant poem, “Mother Cry,” which appeared recently in America was reprinted in the March 23 issue of the Literary Digest.	-
His latest book of poems is “Heart Hermtiage.” As Professor Charles Phillips says in his Introduction, “Beauty, then, is the key to these poems.” And truly it is. In this book Father Carroll sings of God, of the Virgin Mary, of Nature and of common simple things, in an uncommonly distinguished manner.
Beethoven once said that whoever understood his music would be freed from the miseries that afflicted others; certain it is that who evei’ reads the poems in this volume intelligently and sympathetically, the while letting his brain sway to their gentle music, will find temporary freedom from pressing care and ever rubbing duty.
And, best of all, he can always return to the source of his solace and there drink again the choice wine of poetic beauty.	—m.h.l.

WESTERN RESERVE DEFEATED IN FINAL HOME DEBATE
In their final appearance in Washington Hall this season, Father Boland’s varsity debaters defeated the Western Reserve team on Friday, March 22. The question for debate was: “Resolved, that the public should own and control all hydro-electric power plants which offer electric energy for sale.” Professor Joseph Kelly of Franklin College judged the debate.
The argument centered around the matter of propaganda carried on by the power companies, propaganda which reached into the very school system of the country. The comparison or rates between public and privately owned plants came in for a good share of the discussion. Notre Dame, defending the negative, satisfactorily refuted the statements of the affirmative. The home debaters advanced the fact that hydroelectric plants had not yet been fully standardized and therefore should not be owned by the government. Furthermore, all reasonable attempts at control had not yet been exercised.
Professor Kelly awarded the decision to Notre Dame after a thorough analysis, in which he showed that the arguments brought out by each team were excellent, with the greater degree of proof advanced by the negative. Gittelson and Cohen excelled for Western Reserve, while for Notre Dame the work of Hanna, a freshman participating in his first varsity debate, was very commendable.
The following men composed the Notre Dame team: Charles Hanna, Arnold Williams, and Walter Stanton. William Carroll, Aaron Cohen and Roland Gittelsohn comprised the visiting team.
On Tuesday, March 26, the University’s affirmative team met and was defeated by Purdue University at Lafayette, in an extremely close contest on the same question. The smoothly flowing oratory of the Notre Dame squad impressed the large audience of 650 students, faculty members and townspeople; but according to Professor Claude Sifritt of Butler University who judged the debate, the Purdue team had the better audience contact.
Joseph McNamara was the outstanding speaker for Notre Dame, while W. C. Otto led the Purdue men. Comparative rates was the basis of the argument for both sides; and whether private monopoly was worse than political inefficiency. The other members of the Notre Dame team were Frederick Baer and John Keefe. W. C. Jackson and R. L. Zell were Otto’s teammates on the Purdue squad. ,
One more debate remains on the schedule, in which the local debaters meet the University of Detroit at Detroit some time in the near future.

CAMPUS CLUBS PLAYGROUND LEAGUE -
Campus Clubs wishing to enter a ball club in the Playground League, sponsored by the Department of Physical Education, must notify the Reverend E. Vincent Mooney, C.S.C., not later than April 18.
SCRIBBLERS
The Scribblers resumed their post-Easter activities in an atmosphere other than literary due to the new big-game preserve on the first floor of the meeting building. Mr. Has-ley, chairman of the Poetry contest, read the respective ratings of the various poems, the prizes for which had been awarded at the Scribbler banquet the Saturday before Holy Week. After John Nanovic had discussed the feasibility of bombarding non-campus publications by an organized effort of the club for out-side recognition, Mr. Joseph McNamara read a paper on the modern lady, ancient and contemporary.
A. I. E. E.
The Notre Dame branch of the A. I. E. E. held their usual meeting Monday evening at eight o’clock in the Badin hall “Rec” room. Addresses by two prominent speakers featured the meeting. Mr. Fenimore of the Indiana Bell Telephone Company spoke on Automatic Control and Control Apparatus as used by his company. Following this speech, Mr. Gilbert of the Westinghouse Electric Company (South Bend Dept.) addressed the men on Street Lighting.
GRAND RAPIDS CLUB
The annual Easter formal given under the auspices of the Grand Rapids club was held on the evening of Easter Monday in the Gold Room of the Hotel Rowe. Dinner was served from 8 until 10 and dancing enjoyed from 10 to 2. The affair was very successful socially and financially and due credit must be given James McDermott, Joseph-Deeb, and Jerry Roach, who arranged the affair. The music for the occasion was rendered by “Dude” Deitrich and his Rythym Boys. Approximately one hundred and fifty couples were in attendance at the dance which ranks as one of the most successful ever produced in Grand Rapids.
CHICAGO CLUB
Chicagoans from Notre Dame and other institutions of higher learning celebrated the end of Lent on Easter Monday evening at the Drake Hotel when the Chicago Club of Notre Dame held its annual Easter formal. The music was furnished by Coon-Sanders’ Original Nighthawks and Johnny Mullaney’s Syncopaters. The five hundred couples present used two ballrooms, the Main Dining Room and the Avenue of Palms, throughout the evening.
The colors of the University, gold and blue, formed the decorations, with the large Chicago club banner above the orchestra. Leather backed programs with the -club monogram engraved upon them were given as favors.
According to President Eddie Collins, the dance was the most successful that has been held, and all those who were fortunate enough to attend the dance will agree with him. Incidentally the dance was one of the largest in the history of social affairs at the Drake Hotel.
PEORIA CLUB
The first Easter formal of the Peoria Club was held in the Elizabeth Room of the Hotel Pere Marquette, Peoria, Illinois, on Monday evening, April 1. The program of dances was played by Biil Hogan’s Band from Chicago, from 9:00 to 12:00.
The ballroom was attractively decorated in the University’s colors, blue and gold set off by streamers and pennants of Notre Dame’s rivals in athletics. The lights were covered with gold and blue crepe paper.
The next scheduled meeting of the club will take place on Tuesday evening, April 16, at 7:45 p. m. in the Badin Hall “Rec” room.
PITTSBURGH CLUB
The Pittsburgh Club entertained with its formal Easter dinner-dance on Monday evening, April 1, in the Norse Room of the Fort Pitt Hotel, and it proved to be one of the outstanding social affairs of the Easter season in Pittsburgh. Chairman Phil Walsh was assisted by Dave Nash, John Roney, Jim Dodson, Dick O’Toole, Tom Murphy, and William Sietz in arranging the affair.
Two hundred couples were present at the dance, at which Dewey Bergman and his Webster Hall orchestra, Pittsburgh, played the program for dancing.
This is the first time the Pittsburgh Club ever attempted to hold an Easter affair and the results were such that steps will be taken to make the Easter dance an annual affair.
VILLAGERS CLUB
The regular monthly meeting of the Villagers Club was held Monday evening, April 8, in the Rose Marie tea room. Norman Hartzer, chairman of the club’s Easter dance, gave a report of the affair which showed the dance to be as successful financially as it was socially.
The Reverend Francis Boland, C.S.C., was the principal . guest at the meeting. He gave a short, but very interesting discussion on the economic problems that exist in this country at the present time.
WRANGLERS CLUB
There will be an important meeting of the Wranglers Club Sunday morning, April 14, at 10:00 a. m. in the Organization Building. At this meeting an election of new members will be held.

1.	After each touchdown, the ball shall be brought out j and the man who made the touchdown shall bite his initials on the cover.
2.	Hereafter, field goals shall only be kicked by gentlemen belonging to the leading fraternities.
*	3. In order to minimize the casualty list, tackling will be
illegal unless done above the head or below the feet.
j 4. If two teams shall be suffering from ennui (spelling and meaning not guaranteed), they may waive the privilege of active combat, and the game shall be awarded -to the team with the most idiotic cheer-leader.
,	5. In case of a tie at the end of the last period, the
coaches shall advance on the field at the fifty-yard line and shoot dice to see which team is victorious.”

- Pretty girls are the principal reason why the students at Ohio State University go to that school. This fact was ascertained by a questionnaire circulated by a sophomore in the school of journalism. No mention was made, of course, of the intention of securing an education. These were some of the answers: to uphold family tradition, to win fame as an athlete, to form social contacts, to satisfy dad, almost everything, in fact, except to secure an academic education.

1	A dispatch from the Purdue Exponent reads as follows:
“Two Ohio' State students believe they have established a record for ‘gratis’ rides. During their spring vacation they traveled a distance of 2,500 miles at a total cost of J seven cents each and visited parts of eleven states.
“During the five days of actual traveling the travelers , averaged five hundred miles a day by riding freight trains and accepting lifts from passing motorists. They had to pay two cents toll when they crossed the Ohio at Cincinnati and five cents when they crossed the Mississippi into Arkansas.
“Their journey took them through Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, . Virginia, Georgia (where they spent five days in Atlanta), Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, • and Indiana.

The University of Denver has a unique custom. It is an all-school sneak-day, an annual occasion when the students take an unauthorized holiday without being charged with cuts. This is the only occasion on which the students, with the exception of seniors, are allowed such a privilege.
A member of the Syracuse Daily Orange staff has laboriously figured that the average person spends 2,232 hours each year in work, or approximately one-quarter of the entire time. It advocates a Professor of Leisure, who would instruct the students in ways to spend their leisure time in profit. The Missouri Student makes this comment:
“We have a sort of sneaking idea that if the average student has plenty of money, he can spend his leisure time without any help from a professor.”

Senior canes are soon again to- be seen flashing on the Northwestern campus.
“The canes are to be of special make,” says the Daily Northwestern, “and each will have carved on it the name of the senior possessing it. They are of very fine rough malaca and may be purchased in any one of three different weights.
“The variety of weights makes it possible for a man to choose just the exact ounceage with which he is willing to burden himself, and, if he so desires, permits him to select an emblem of his class ranking which has the added utility of a weapon, in one case, or of an indicator in another.
“The tradition of senior canes on the campus is almost as old as that of green caps for freshmen and is observed with even more veneration.”

They turn out some good men at Emory University. One senior asks:
“Are the joys, the bliss, the thrills of a tender kiss worth the price of three hours’ time, one pack of Murads, and the gargle of Listerine one must pay? Or is the lingering ecstacy of a clinging embrace a worthy compensation for the lies, the effort, the sleepless nights and the powdered coat lapel. He states that as a student he has lost 2,578 hours of time on dates, traveled 1,659 miles to and from them, lost 17,893 hours of sleep, gargled 263 bottles of Listerine, rushed 923 girls, recovered 56,837 hairpins, and four times bailed girls’ brothers out of jail.”	’

The Wink Talking Picture Expedition is still hard at work on the problem of adapting talking pictures to this column as evidenced by the following communication from Commander Otto Zilch of the engineering committee of The Wink Talking Picture Expedition:
$ £ $ $
. Dear Chief:
When I last wrote to you we were studying English in one of the prominent local pool parlours. After a rather intensive study that took practically a whole day we began to appreciate that there was little left for us to discover in this particular field except a method of paying for the rent of the table. Do not underestimate the difficulty presented by this problem as the boy at the counter was one of the largest difficulties we have encountered. At length we hit upon the happy solution of walking out the back door disguised as a couple of pool tables. This would have been much easier if we had not had holes in our pockets.
When we had escaped we decided that we might be able to learn something from the moving picture industry and so spent the next week in viewing Nasaltone presentations at the local theaters. If you can use your influence to get us a few passes we will certainly appreciate it. I hate to seem sordid, but how about an advance on the salary?
•	Yours very truly,
OTTO zilch,
Com. of W.T.P.E.
Since the above letter has been received word has come that the boys at last have something .definite in view and we hope to have something of interest' to report to you next week. It is our intention to spare no expense in making The Wink practically alone in its field ;a survey of this field is now being carried on by local engineering students who make preliminary reports to the effect that it might be an improvement if the field were to be left entirely alone.

-	UNIVERTAL NCTRE RAME MIU
.	College graduates are just beginning to realize the value of their education and the very practical
value of continued contact with their school and with their classmates. The matter of education is largely individual, but contact requires organization. It is in answer to the recognition of this value and the advantages that have come to those schools which organized early that Alumni Associations have devel-? oped so rapidly.
5 Notre Dame, although far behind many of the non-religious schools in alumni development, is pro-L gressing rapidly, and is well in the fore of the American Catholic colleges. The development of our Local Alumni Clubs, in all parts of the country, has been an outstanding feature of this progress.
Universal Notre Dame Night, instituted five years ago, has been a source of inspiration in the organization of these clubs and in their individual progress. ,
Those of us on the campus miss much of what Notre Dame can mean to men who have enjoyed these surroundings and the beautifully balanced life that the campus offers. But away, there are thousands of x Notre Dame men whose memories of Notre Dame contrast sharply with their surroundings. It is a freshening of mind and body for these men to meet with other men whose memories can paint similar pictures. It is to the educational and social life of these men what a retreat is to their spiritual life, and , in fact itself breathes much of the spiritual for them. '
When you have gone from Notre Dame you will appreciate these things that are impossible to express. In the meantime, it cannot but inspire the whole campus to know that on the Night of April 22, thousands of men who have spent years on the campus as we have are going to return in spirit to Notre - Dame.	—J.E.A.
,	ENTERTAINMENT AND ENNUI
The student attendance at either the Glee Club or the Band concert was not remarkable. Approximately four hundred of us out of a student body of twenty-seven hundred went to the Sousa Concert. Even the “Monogram Absurdities’’ were not supported as they should have been. Were it not for the outside support it is doubtful is the “Absurdities” would have been much in the way of a financial success. That, too, despite the fact that the “Absurdities” was given primarily for the students. The performance > was of the students, by the students, and for the students.
The obvious conclusion to be deduced from these facts is that we are not particularly zealous in i backing campus activities. Now this may seem rather unimportant to some, yet others of us regard the moral support given to drama, debate, and music as a manifestation of school spirit that is as loyal and elemental as the backing given to athletics.
It	is granted that Washington Hall is not to be classed with a number	of bizarre and exotically
*	decorated local theaters. Moreover, it will not house a large percentage of the student body. But we
cannot	have any reason for constructing a new auditorium when the one we	now have is hardly ever
■:	filled.	If students want good entertainment, and if they would be proud of a	new hall, they must first
prove to the school authorities that they are interested enough in the presentations to provide a good house.
And if you decide to go to a lecture, drama, or concert it is only justice to those on the stage and in 1 the theater that you arrive on time. The floors of Washington Hall have been strained by many footfalls, and now in their age they creak and groan at every step of the late invaders. In a Chinese theater the actors stop the performance until a late arrival walks to his seat, or until an offending infant ceases ' to cry. But the Oriental influence has never penetrated campus confines, and consequently actors and audience are placed at a decided disadvantage with the advent of every tardy student. Entertainments in Washington Hall are for your benefit; patronize them, with a timely patronage.	—A.H.
Old Jose
WALTER M. LANGFORD
OLD JOSE sat in front of his store, his general merchandise store. Surely there was nothing uncommon in this, for had he not sat propped back against the wall in his sturdy cane chair almost every day for seventeen years—or was it even longer? Yes, but in some unaccountable manner he did not seem to be the same this morning. Normally his fine though aged face fairly exuded peacefulness as he basked thus in the early morning sun. His gray and semi-bald head would be resting comfortably against the wall; his arms would be folded on his breast. Happiness and satisfaction were clearly his in their entirety. Strangers could not help noticing the old gentleman as they wandered past. “Ah, que contento!” they were wont to murmur as they envied him the peace of heart and of mind that was his. But today a change was apparent. His brow was furrowed with wrinkles which could come only from worry. The customary peace and contentment were unquestionably absent. Often would he lean forward, hands clutching his knees, and peer anxiously down the narrow street. He seemed to expect someone. He was worried.
Jose DeLeon was a pioneer of the Rio Grande Valley; he was a veritable landmark in Macauley. He had erected the first building in the town, the same building against which he was even now leaning He had been the first mayor of the little city. He had always been, and still was, Macauley’s leading citizen.
Difficult indeed would be the task of finding a man more noble, more beloved than old Jose. Anyone with such an honest, frank, loving countenance could not but possess a great heart, filled to overflowing with peace and contentment. Children loved him; they saw in old Jose a kindred spirit, someone who was always so kind and generous and sympathetic.
A traveling salesman approached old Jose at a brisk walk. He was just a typical salesman: portly, affable, talkative, deferential. He greeted the old Mexican storekeeper effusively.
“Greetings, good friend Jose. Bonus—bonus—aw, how the devil do you say it in Spanish?”
“Buenos dias, sefior. How are you thees morning?” “Yeh, that’s it. Bonus dias. I’m going to learn your blooming language yet, ain’t I, Jose?”
“Quien sabe, senor? You are the good talker in the American. One day you maybe can talk well in the Spanish too. Who can tell?”
“Sure, just give me time and I’ll be hiring myself out as . an interpreter. Say, Jose, you’re getting pretty hefty, ain’t you?”	,
“Hefty? No understand hefty, senor.”
“Aw, you know, big, fat, heavy.”
“Ah si, senor! Muy corpulento.”	A
“Yeh, I guess that’s it. You must be loafing too much.”
“Heh, senor! No have much business. Sit in chair all time.” “Why should you worry about business, you rich old devil?”	•
“No, no, senor. No gotte too much money.”
“Maybe you ain’t got too much, but you’ve got more than the rest of the town put together.”
“Ah, you no understand how poof I are.”
“Yeh, you’re poor just like Henry Ford.”	'
“Senor, you are so joking;”
“Well, what can I sell you this trip, Jose? Some ice- -skates?”	-
Old Jose laughed long at this. “You are too funny. I no need skates for the ice, but you are come in the nickle of * time, senor. Bring to me many sacks to hold the cotton. The picking start in two, three weeks.”	‘
After their business was transacted and the salesman had departed, old Jose stood in his doorway and was once more • different and worried. He gazed expectantly down the street. Presently he leaned eagerly forward and peered more intently than before. A man was running down the middle of the * street. As he approached Jose he began to wave his arms, excitedly and to shout.	•
“She is come, papa! My leetle baby is here. She is a boy. We have named it another'Jose.”-	•
“Gracias a Dios! Another Jose. Que bueno!”
Five minutes later old Jose sat propped back against his store as had been his custom for seventeen years—or- more. His head rested comfortably against the wall: his arms were ' folded on his breast; happiness beamed from his fine face. A stranger passed, and murmured in passing, “Que contento!”

Warning--No Professors Allowed
JOHN W. GIBBONS
64'W'T "T’RITE a two-thousand word article for the % /> / Scholastic,” said the Power-that-Beeze.
y y	“Sure—glad to,” I responded quickly before
,,	he could change his mind. It was yesterday,
and we were sitting in the Cafeteria. The sudden request gave me an immodest thrill, for we are taught in Journalism class that public recognition is a feather in anybody’s iron hat. So I jumped at the chance.
“What on?” I asked innocently.
“Young man,” replied the Power-that-Beeze., looking teri ribly pained and giving me a fishy stare, “the modem author •> never asks what he shall write about. You are allowed free and unconfined choice of subject matter”
Thinking this over later in the privacy of a street-car, I wondered why it had never occurred to me before. Of course that editor was right! “Free and unconfined choice of subject matter,” indeed! Why just offhand there in the street’ car, I remembered having read essays and poems on such “unconfined” things as shoes and moustaches and girls and post-office pens and love and mustard plasters and George Washington and budget appropriations for street cleaners in La Porte, and many others. What must that editor think of me after such a slow-witted display of ignorance? Hadn’t I just finished reading a particularly brilliant piece of sopho-’ moric literature dealing with apples ? The thesis might have been “Apples—Their Influence on American Culture.”
So I stayed on that car, and finally arrived at the library. The whole thing worried me. If subjects were free as a . Scotch blessing, what about the methods of treating them?
' It was about time for me to find out how things are being done at Notre Dame. . . .
* Seven hours later, I staggered home, weak and perspiring.
This morning finds me much improved, thank you, but . weighted down with the responsibility of broadcasting a vital message to all guileless youths like myself who think they might break into print. Boys, it’s true your subjects must be extremely “free and unconfined.” But, alas, that isn’t all. In fact, as long as they remain reasonably decent, irresponi-ble subjects can be laughed off like the eighth cut. But the treatment—ah, here is the true mark of contemporary gen-ius—the treatment, too, must be free. Modern essayists are supremely subtle, extremely clever/and their methods cannot be adequately expressed in one phrase or sentence, like “diversity,” or “informal.” Let me explain.
, Let us suppose that you are going to write an essay for the Scholastic. You will finally select from an infinite assortment the subject “Straw Hats.” (This may be the i very best, having been employed several thousand times, but it will do since my conscience forbids “Lingerie,” or “The Back-Seat Driver.”) To begin with, as the surgeon remarked when asking for a knife, will you collect all available material
, pertaining to straw hats? You will not! If you are modern, and consequently correct, you will begin by studying carelessly either astronomy or metallurgy.
The next step may be to decide whether the embryonic masterpiece shall take the form of prose .or poetry. With a background of astronomy, it will ordinarily be poetic. On the other hand, there are exceptions, since the dominating rule is “freedom.” If you have reviewed integral calculus, or themodynamics as a preparation, (many evidently follow this system), chances are it will be a prose selection. Again, however, there is no certain way of finding out. It appears that most writers are now disregarding this question altogether. Then when the work is completed, it only takes a few minutes to read it over and decide whether it is prose or poetry. '"This is a great time-saver.
Having fortified yourself with this unconfined background, you are -in a position to begin writing. In some cases, it is quite permissable for the author to have some idea, if any, of what he is going to write about. This depends upon the “mood,” but since the modern question of mood is a study all by itself, I won’t bother about it here. In no case, however, must the reader be put wise. You have probably noticed this yourself. If the article on “Straw Hats” is to be published, it must begin with an aimless discussion of social conditions in Alaska, or the celebrated compositions by Brahms, or something equally generic. Above all, avoid being explicit in any statements. Be modem.
After such an introduction, gradually swing around to Indiana politics, or Rupert Brooke. Sharp epigrams are very appropriate vehicles for changing the direction of attack, but keep away from Russian literature or prohibition because they were used last semester. When the article is well along, you may speak sarcastically of dear old Senator Heflin, and mention casually that he was seen wearing a straw hat. This, of course, is the keynote of the entiro essay. Pass it up lightly, though, and launch into something breezy such as the ethics of journalism, or Wall Street speculation by the masses. If you dwell too long on Senator Heflin’s hat, the work is spoiled. The title is “Straw Hats,” but that is no'excuse to make this topic lugubrious.
It is customary then to quietly conclude the article with a raw paradox, such as “Malthus was Wright.” Any reader who cares will at once perceive the significance, knowing Wright to have been an aviator, and in addition you will get the reputation for possessing great mental exubrance. If you don’t know any clever things, it doesn’t matter, so lone as you don’t say any more about “Straw Hats.”
And there you are, boys. Such do I believe is the method used by our twentieth century word riveters. It is a wonderful system, too, as everyone will agree. To scorn the obvious; to ridicule that literary form which allows its framework of logical sequence to be visible to the reader; to set our ideas fashionably in riddles or bury them in impressions where only the erudite may hope to find their squashy substance; let this be our credo. I for one hope to someday obtain that ideal style. Then when the Power-that-Beeze asks for a little contribution I will reply:
“Six and seven-eighths, or a quart of milk.”

Baseball Team Returns From Triumphant March Through Texas
Millsmen Win Six Out of Seven Games on Annual Southern Trip
Following the example of major league clubs, the Notre ■f Dame baseball team departed on its annual southern jaunt on March 29. But the Irish ball-tossers met with consider> ably more success than has been the lot of most Big League outfits in Dixie this year. Six of the seven opponents who took the field against the Millsmen were vanquished in well-played games. The only team which managed to check the - visitors’ onslaught was Texas A. and M. College, which took the final game on the Ramblers’ excursion list by a 7-4 score.
The team marched through Texas just like Sherman marched through Georgia, sweeping all opposition before them. The ring of Notre Dame bats can still be heard on many of the Lone Star diamonds, while much praise is forthcoming for the brilliant fielding displayed by the visiting > nine.

Such popularity must be deserved!"
To an outsider, the time and trouble taken to produce a Chesterfield might seem as unnecessary as the sabre-scars so proudly worn by students of pre-war Heidelberg. But popularity is much the same the world over — you don’t get it for nothing.
But any short-cuts in the time it takes to cure and mellow the Chesterfield tobaccos, or one step the less in blending and balancing them
— would end up in something that wasn’t Chesterfield. And you wouldn’t like that.
So we’ll stick to our old system—getting the right tobaccos, blending them the Chesterfield way, never sacrificing character, body, flavor to mere mildness.
We want to keep our popularity, now that we’ve earned it—and we know no better way than to keep on earning it!

TENNIS TEAM PREPARES FOR STRENUOUS SEASON
Tennis will this year assume its proper place in the sphere of Notre Dame athletics, according to the comprehensive schedule recently approved by the S Faculty Board of Athletic Control. Nine dual matches have been slated for the Irish racket-wield-
ers, four- of which are to be played on the home courts. The feature event of the season will be the Central Intercollegiate meet at Chicago on May 16, 17, and 18. The outstanding players of the Middle West will be seen in action at this meet.
A squad of veteran performers, all of whom took part in match play last year, will again be available i f; for this season. Captain Griffin, “Bud” Markey, and “Hank” Burns, all monogram men, head the list of candidates. These men are being hard pressed for then- positions by John Cianci, “Bud” Kane, “Bill” ? O’Connor, and Leon Zabriskie, who comprise the remainder of the veteran group. John O’Brien is the most likely-looking of the newcomers to the squad.
Interest in the net game has reached a high pitch this year. Twenty-five men responded to the initial
call for candidates, and it appears quite certain that this number will be greatly augmented with the coming of suitable practice weather.
The schedule follows:
April 27—Western State, at home.
April 30—Drake, at home.
May 3—Armour* Tech, at Chicago.
May 4—Grinnell, at-Grinnell.
. May 7—Northwestern, at Evanston.
May 10—Minnesota, at home.
May 13—Michigan State, at home.
May 17, 18, 19—Central Intercollegiates, at C^§ cago.	-
.... May. 31—Marquette, at Milwaukee.
June 1—Wisconsin, at Madison.

People often ask the question, “Why isn’t 9:5 recognized as the world’s record for the hundred?” It appears that the Swiss watch-makers, who are considered the best in the world, claim that a watch cannot be split accurately in less than fifths of a second. For this reason the International Amateur Athletic Federation refused to recognize any record
not better by at least a fifth of a second than the old record. The A. A. U., however, recognizes 9:5 as the American record. '

Smoker
Tips 16 on Big Secret
Norwood, Ohio Oct. 8, 1928 Larus & Brother Company Richmond, Va.
Gentlemen:
In the past twenty years I have been a consistent smoker. I was always anxious to smoke a pipe; but no matter how often I tried, I soon changed my mind. I have tried all .kinds of pipe tobacco, but not once was I satisfied with the taste of any of them until just recently I gave my pipe another trial.
It was my luck to choose Edgeworth this time, with the results that I am still using it and will continue to do so. I only hope that you will continue to give that same mild, high-grade quality in the future.
I have started not less than sixteen men to start or give Edgeworth a trial, and they are still using that same unequaled non-biting tobacco to this day. I can recommend Edgeworth tobacco to anybody who enjoys a cool non-biting brand of good tobacco; and as long as I enjoy same, you can rest assured that I am going to be a good ad., and many a pipe smoker will be asked to give it a fair trial, and they themselves can act as judges.
I always give praise where praise is due. After I was convinced of the wonderful quality of Edgeworth I could not help but tell you people the same as I have been telling and will in the future tell others.
Hoping that you will continue with the same quality in Edgeworth, I am
Very truly yours, (Signed) Joseph J. Stahl Edgeworth Extra High Grade

Conquering the Cascades
SNOW falls every month in the year where the Great Northern crosses the Cascades. Steep, tortuous grades increase the difficulty of the railroading problem. Nature has stubbornly resisted man’s effort to conquer the range.
X
In January, 1929, the new Cascade the tunnel was opened. Man, with elec- our
tricity as an ally, had conquered the Cascades.
The eight-mile bore was driven in three years—a
record impossible without electric power. And electrification has been extended to the entire 75-mile route through the mountains.
The conquests of electricity on the land and on the sea, in the air, and underground, are making practicable
impossibilities of yesterday. As vision encompasses wider horizons, electricity appears as a vital contribution to future industrial progress and human welfare.
