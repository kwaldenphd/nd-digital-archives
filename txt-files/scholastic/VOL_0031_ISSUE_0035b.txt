On Wednesday the Laetare Medal will be formally presented .to Hon. T. E. Howard, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Indiana. Doubtless Mr. Howard appreciates the honor that is conferred upon him and which is justly his due; and others will recognize in him all those good qualities for which the medal is given. It would be superfluous to state what those qualities are. Suffice it to say that the recipient must have fulfilled the promises of a useful and honorable life to merit the distinction; and of one so well known as Judge Howard it is not necessary to say that it is merited in the highest sense.

.University who have won distinc- specimens .of artistic taste and
tion in the field of journalism attribute their success in great measure to the training and practice received here. Now that this training is to be rendered thorough and systematic, and increased facilities afforded for practice in all branches of the profession, there is no reason why Notre Dame should not send forth every year a certain number of men particularly well equipped for a career .in journalism. Thus will our Alma Mater widen her sphere of usefulness and add another claim to the many she already possesses to the patronage of those interested in the work of education. We envy
the one to whom the honor endowing a chair of journalism Notre Dame is reserved.

Our Bandmaster.
During these days of Commencement our music-makers are called upon to furnish entertainment for the visitors. For three evenings, at least, the band will strive to make timego merrily with our friends.. In this issue of The Scholastic we present to our readers the man that has directed, instructed and brought our band to its present condition, and who has charge of the entertainments. The work of Professor Newton A. Preston during the past year was no easy nor small task. Few persons realize how difficult it is to train a crowd of inexperienced men to take up the many different instru-. ments and - master them so as to produce harmony. Before a good band can be. had, each player must be taught to handle his instrument as carefully and. accurately as though the whole effect of the piece depended on his individual , playing. Such as our band is, we < hope our guests will find no small amount of enjoyment in listening to it. Whatever success our musicians have made is due to the efforts of their leader. Remember that he has been training them

—The publisher desires.to state that advertisements for The Daily Scholastic must be sent in not later than four o’clock p. m. .
—The concert by the band last evening was highly appreciated. Prof. Preston has reason to be proud of his musicians and they are proud of their leader. -
—The genial Dean of the Law Faculty has concluded his lectures and renewed his youth, as he always does at the end of the < year. He is all fight—always all . right.	r
