She scribbles notes. She hands in the homework and takes the tests. She sits next to you in class, and she seems like just another Notre Dame 
student. But, she isn't -she is a mother. Or, she has given up a child for adoption. Or, she has terminated a past 
pregnancy. A child, and perhaps a family, might be in her near future. 
"Whatever her situation, these are things you can't tell just by looking at 
her. 
We have student-athletes and student-workers, but student-mothers? Yes, even here at Notre Dame. Some are married, others are single. Some have parents and spouses to fall back on, others are alone, struggling solo with motherhood. 
And while fellow students complain about academic all-nighters, early morning exams, or a fledgling football team, these women carry a far heavier burden.

Scholastic's Kelly Faehnle shows that it doesn't take much to turn these plans upside down.

INext Time, Try Hitchiking American Airlines discontinues all flights out of South Bend Regional Airport 

ANNIEROBINSON 
0 nNov. 1,.µie lights attheAmeri­. CaIJ. Airlines check-:'i:n desk at South Bend Regional Airport · went out. Permanently. American Airlines has discontinued all of its flights from South Bend Regional Airport to Lambert-St. Louis Interna­tional Airport. The aviation behemoth's decision came as the company decreased the number offlights departingfrom its St. Louis hub by 50 percent and replaced the remaining flights with smaller re­gional planes. "What is serious about the situation is that in South Bend's case, it was the only American Airlines service that we had," says John C. S challiol, executive director of the St. Joseph County Ai­port Authority Administration. "Air­ports had no say in this,'' he adds. "This is a reflection of bad times for airlines since 9/11," says Pat Walsh, vice presidentofbusiness services for Anthony Travel at Notre Dame.

On Oct. 1, Schalliol and Anthony Travel representatives approached Ameri­can Airlines with a compromise. Schal­liol proposed that the airline company compensate for the discontinued South Bend-St. Louis connection with a new service from South Bend to Dallas/Ft. Worth International Airport.

(I The Death of Football 
Although the 2003 Fighting Irish football team has had a rough go of it this year, certain winning traditions in the program seem to remain unbreak­able. Saturday the team beat Navy for the 40th consecutive time. Forty! There are three constants in life: Notre Dame will always beat Navy, Dustin Diamond will never portray a character not named 'Screech' and Notre Dame football will always return to prominence, regardless of what anyone says. From Nov. 8, 1963 (the last time Navy beat Notre Dame): 
''In early September, the football coach of a prominent eastern university made this prognostication about Notre Dame's c~ances in 1963: 'Coach Hugh Devore definitely has his work cut out for him. Ifthis team goes 5-5, it will be a tTemendous accomplishment.' 
Now, with only four games remaining, a 
5-5 record ... would be a near-miracle . 
... Ifthe Irish are to con~~ back ... (a) miracle 
is to happen."

3Dining Hall Food It's "quantity over quality'' taken to its most shocking, horrible extreme. Mass quantities ofleathery, meat-like products and pasty, tasteless side items sure don't hit the spot. Given a choice between rat poison and spicy sea nuggets ... well, youknowwhatto do. 
2Parietals Welcome to the wonderful world of Puritanical gender relations. Combine this astoundingly archaic tradition with the aforementioned heating problems, and the Notre Dame experience closely resembles living in a log cabin in 1600s Virginia.

If you can afford the fashionable green Lacoste golf shirt you wear instead, you can probably take the hit on the charity-supporting The Shirt purchase.

On the one hand, cold weather is cold. On the other hand, cold weather does provide endless fodder for the campus' experienced cartoonists. Lucky us.

She gave over $200 million to National Public Radio, a deserving cause. We'll refrain from pointing out the irony that a benefactor of a prominent conservative institution is giving money to a not-so­conservative media outlet.

At an academically rigorous institution such as Notre Dame, there is bound to be an air of competitiveness between the various disciplines. Students from different colleges and majors are always trying to proclaim the superiority of their education in comparison to other fields of study. O~en heard is the contention of an engineering student that, "Without engineering, there would be no buildings," or an English major that, "Without English, there would be no words:• These various proclamations beg the question:Which major allows you to have the most fun?Well, through a great deal of hard work, and a few papercuts (seven), yours truly did a little research and found out which majors· are most likely to offer late classes, allowing you to party the night away.

Jenny's si~uation was unique from the start because she worked at the Women's Care Center"(WCC) when she found out she was pregnant. She had come across the WCC at a Cen,. ­ter for Social Concerns open house her freshman year, and signed up to volunteer. She continued working there during the summer, since ,she lived in South Bend, and into her sophomore ye~r as well. In August between her sophomore· and junior years, ·she actually\administered her own pregnancy test, a :service that · the WCC offers for free. The test result: positive. .. 
'_'All ofa sudden," Jenriy says, "you feel like your world is just crashing down .· around you, And you had this plan ... [but] all that changes in the two minutes that it takes to ruri the test. Most women find that terrifying." . · -_ 
. Various Notre Dame resources try to assist these women. Health Services is one of the first places women tend to go, because the physical signs of pregnancy. ar~ the first to wo~ry them, says Kleva. She says that her first move would be to einpathize with the woma:n and reassure her. Kleva has been with Notre Dame for lOyears, but it is her previous experi­ence that p.elps )le(syinp~tliize with t)lese women the mos~: she spent 13 years: as a _

reunification with the Catholic Church ifthe woman chooses. 
Most women who come to Catholic Charities, and to the other Notre Dame resources, have already made the decision that theywill carry the babyand now are looking at the.option of adoption versus keeping the child. Catholic Charities provides assistance for adoptions. Bur­lingham describes the typical woman who chooses adoption: "She has to be intelligent enough to understand what being a parent means and to know that she is not ready at that point in her life. Secondly, she has to have enough love in her life in order to trust other people. If she can't trust other people, she's never going to be able to relinquish her child to another family forever.'' 
Because of the wisdom, love, and trust that the decision requires, Burlingham insists, "Girls who choo~ adoption to­day, of their own free will, are girls who would be good mothers someday, but the timing is not right.'' 
Dr. Susan Steibe-Pasalich, the direc­tor ofthe University Counseling Center and a concurrent assistant professor of

Living itnow 
Two single mothers balance Notre Dame student life with raising their children 
April Driver and Cecilia Stanton­Espinoza know what it's like to he simultaneously students and mothers atNotre Dame. Theyhave a few things in common: They are attending Notre Dame, living in University Village, and raising baby Boys as single mothers. But the similarities end there. Cecilia is a second-semester sophomore romance languages major raising her six­month-old s.on.Samuel. April is finishing her Chinese major and Russian supple­mental majorthis semester -a semester early -and raising her 22-month-old son Logan. And while things have gone fairly smoothly for Cecilia so far, April has traveled a rough road the past couple years. The disparity between these two women's experiences illustrates the com­plexity involved: No two students are the same, so no two situations are the same, an9 the complications are worked out in

Spirit of Philanthropy 
Benefactor Joan 8. Kroc left millions to Notre Dame in her will 
EMILYPALADINO 
In a spirit of generosity and dedication to the pursuit of peace, Joan B. Kroc, the charismatic philanthropist who founded Notre Dame's Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, left $50 million to the institute upon her passing in October, which is the larg­est single gift in university history. Kroc, the widow of Mc­Donald's founder Ray Kroc, was a close friend of the Rev. TheodoreHesburgh, C.S.C., and left the money to the uni­versity in Hesburgh's name. The donation will establish the Rev. Theodore M. Hes­burgh, C.S.C., Fund for Graduate Peace Studies. Joan Kroc first met Hes­burgh at the University of California -San Diego in 1985, when he lectured on the importance of peace studies at the university level ternational Studies. In all, she contributed $69.l million to Notre Dame. 
"There's no question that, because of her generosity, we're going to have the best Peace Studies program in the whole world," Hesburgh says. 
Kroc Institute Director Scott Appleby first met Kroc while serving as a fellow 


and efforts at Notre Dame to 
institute a peace studies program. 
The auditorium was packed, but one woman in particular stood out in the crowd. "I noticed that this lady in the front was very intent on every word I said," Hesburgh recalls. 
After the speech, the woman ap­proached him and said that she was impressed by his work and wanted to support his cause. She left without tell­ing Hesburgh her name. 
Six months later, he received a phone call from Kroc, the woman who had ap­proached him at the lecture. Kroc, who had no previous affiliation with the uni­versity, gave $6 million to the university in order to establish the Kroc Institute. 
Hesburgh kept in close contact with Kroc over the years, and she continued to contribute to the peace studies program. In 1988, she gave another $6 million to the university to build the Hesburgh Center for International Studies, which houses both the Peace Studies program and)the Helen Kellogg Institute for In-

Hesburgh Center for International Studies. 
for the Institute nearly six years ago. He became director in 2000 and kept in close contact with Kroc, whom he describes as a very private woman. 

The money will be used mainly to ex­pand the institute's masters program to two years, Appleby says. The program currently has 24 masters degree candidates from 17 different countries, so most of the students do not speak English as their primary language. As a result, these students need more time to perform reading-and writ­ing-related activities. A two-year program would enable the students to spend more time researching and reading, in addition to doing field research. 
Under the redesigned program, students will spend their first two semesters in the classroom, perform fieldwork away from the university in their third and then re­turn to campus for their last semester to synthesize their academic work and hands­on experiences. 
Field research is an important new aspect of the program because it will help peace studies students to "develop and apply their book knowledge and their academic knowl­edge in a concrete peace-building setting," Appleby says. 
Although the gift is for the graduate program, Appleby says he believes that undergraduate programs will benefit from Kroc's generosity as well. ''As you can imag­
ine, with a gift that big and tlrnt much money, we'll be able to hire excellent pro­fessors who will also be teaching our undergradu­ate students," he says. 
Peace studies graduate student Josh Moore says that although he never met Kroc, she did make an effort to reach out to the students in a personal way. Even after she found out that she was dying, she sent each student in the program two books: 
Face to Face With the Bomb, 
a photographic essay on nuclear weapons, and 

JiJ,ar isa Force that Gives Us Meaning, "She was dying, and yet she was thinking about nourishing our consciences and minds in a personal way," Moore says. 
"We feel that we're endowed with a certain responsibility to carry on the legacy ofJoan Kroc," Moore says. "How do you repay that? You try to stay as true as you can to her mission and her sensi­bilities. You work for peace and justice in all aspects of your life," he explains. "To go through the program and do nothing would be ungrateful." 
The graduate students in the Kroc program contributed money to plant a tree outside the Hesburgh Center for International Studies in memory ofKroc. The blossoming i:r~e will be planted and dedicated later this fall. Under the tree, a bronze plaque will read, "In memory ofJoan B. Kroc: Mayher legacy ofpeace blossom within each of us and in our communities around the world. From the graduate students of the Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies." D

Thinkin' 'bout Drinkin' 
A new study continues the ongoing debate over campuJ alcohol use· 
ANNEHELTZEL 
Notre Dame's Irish-Catholic character has always led to cer­tain preconceptions about the campus' alcohol consumption. Students, faculty and administrators continuously debate how Notre Dame's drinking cul­ture compares to that of other schools. Recent studies indicate thatNotre Dame might be more susceptible to instances of heavy drinking due to several factors pertaining to the campus culture and its student body composition. Dr. Henry Drug Education, Notre Dame is average in relation to -other schools with respect to alcohol intake. Firth says that altho11gh five to ten years.ago alcohol consumption at Notre Dame was above average, num­bers are going down due to the recently tightened alcohol policies, along with the fact that more students coming into the school are choosing to abstainf~om drinking. Although 44 percent ofall col­lege students are binge drinkers, surveys show that 77.5 percent of Notre Dame students drink once a week or less, and 

67.1 percent ofstudents consume four or

common at a predominately white school, 
making Notre Dame more susceptible to 
binge drinking. 
Wechsler's work, though highly con­

troversial, has had significant influence

across the country. According to Firth, 
another highly influential source of in­
formation is College Drinking: Changing the Culture -the largest report currently in circulation regarding alcohol and al­. cohol policies on college campuses. The report,to-chaired by

he says are associated with heavier drinking. "Binge drinking" is defined as the consumption of five or more drinks in a row at least once in the past two weeks by males, and four or more by females. 
Wechsler says those factors relevant to Notre Dame are its low diversity, high level ofathletic interest and competition, location in the North Central region of the United States and religious affilia­tion (non-fundamentalist-Protestant). Wechsler's studies show that college ad­ministrations wishing to reduce alcohol problems should take into consideration the demographic diversity and student body composition of their universities. 
According to Gina Firth, director of Notre Dame's Office of Alcohol and less drinks in a drinking situation. 

Despite these statistics, Firth says Notre Dame does show typical signs of a binge-drinking school, such as its homogenous student body. Since Notre Dame is comprised primarily of white, upper-class Catholics, its student body could be considered more susceptible to situations of high alcohol intake. 
A recent report of Wechsler's fea­tured on CNN.com states that white males and younger students have higher drinking rates than do African-and Asian-Americans, females and older students. 
Wechsler, as quoted by CNN.~om, says that when young, white males fn:­teract to the exclusion of other groups, 
that as binge-drinking levels rise, so do incidences ofsecondary problems. Firth does, however, consider the term "binge drinking" to be subjec­tive, as the determining factors ofa binge drinker could either be under the legal alcohol limit or far past it, depending on the physical makeup of the drinker. 
One extreme complains of the overly indulgent lifestyle here, while the other claims there is a complete lack ofa "party · scene" due to rigid"r~gulations that are widespread across campus. However, no matter where personal opinions fall, Wechsler's study shows that Notre Dame's demographic characteristics make the student population statistically . more likely to be deemed at risk for binge-drinking behavior.

Marco, as the rooms' residents call him, is the first glimpse of the spirit and cheerfulness of this quad. 
"We knew we had a penguin. We just built the room up from that," resident Sarah Sibley says. 
The four sophomores who reside in the room -Sibley, Jessica Maciejewski, Jacquelyn Kramer and Kaity Redfield -are especially proud of the array of colorful decorations within. The multi­colored lights that line the tapestry window curtains, various movie and art posters that cover the walls, and vivid cof­fee tables hand-painted by Sibley, give the room an eclectic feel. 
"We got a lot of stuff for free," says Sibley. "I found the carpet and the fu­ton behind Lyons Hall last spring. And the rest of the stuff we collected from a bunch ofyard sales over the summer.''.

Well, Gipplings, our fun in . the sun is finally over. After a few unseasonably warm weeks, the Bend's cold hand of winter has :finally grabbed. us. And this seems to 
. put some students ina mood so foul that even a football victory combined with a few Gipp "seamen" puns wouldn't cheer them up. That's perfectly fine though, as these next few tips should. allow the Gipp to fulfill his gratuitous joke quota for this week. 
Not That There's Anything Wrong With It 

First, we travel back to this past week­t!p.cl, and meet a birthday girl who says she 
.. had the noble a:nd classy 20th b-day wish ofhaving all ofher friends get some sweet lovin'. Now, the Gipp wasn't provided pseudqnyms, so he'll have to giye his own names to our five-member cast of char­acters: Tipster's Dirty Roomie, Destiny, Ginger, Ace and Gary.. 
. ,The drama began when Ace (Destiny's boytoy) and Garydecided thattheywould sincerely enjoy witnessing Roomie, Des­tiny, and Ginger enter into some type of arrangement dubbed "a triple kiss." Why the hell not, replied the ladies. But, alas, their acceptance was contingent on one minor detail: Ace aiid Garymustswap spit too. So," as the story always go, the females lived up to their end ofthe bargain but the males reneged. Ah, the old "you go first" 
.trick-brilliant. 

Roomie proceeded to tell Gary that he will, in our tipster's eloquent phrasing, "get laid" if he tickles Ace's tongue. Destiny swears that she will never lay next to Ace again ifhe doesn't do as he promised. 
We all know that sex sells, and appar­ently it persuades, too. "This was no peck ... everyone at the party saw it," says our birthday baby in describing the encoun­ter. Then, in logic-defying fashion, the two couples joined forces in the upstairs bathroom for four times the fun. 
Inour·denouement, both gents gotlucky (Ah! Crucify those bastards, ResLife!), but they weren't winners in all senses of the word. As expected, the subsequent ridicule was harsh, and probably was expressed best by the· "Go Ace, Love Gary" signs that appeared on an interhall football field the following afternoon. Hmm, maybe that's why Alumni's players are known to be 
softies. 
Usually, this space would be reserved for Gipp's standard post-tip social com­mentary. But in this case, he seems to have no witty comments to add, or at least no witty comments that wouldn't step on some very sensitive toes. So, um ... moving on ... 

REBELLION Seriously, officer, I've just been working my legs a lot at the Rock... 

Do You See What I See? 
Would a Gipp column be a Gipp col­umn without lowbrow urine jokes? Don't answer that. 
It has been brought to the Gipper's attention that certain flaws exist in the architectural design ofour campus' most recently updated edifice. The Gipp is sure that when the clever engineers dreamed up tinted glass that would allow restaurant patrons to see out but not passersby to see in, they didn't run through this scenario: You're eating a pre-game cheeseburger and enjoying "Beer #507'' from the sophisticated list, when a subway alum six cans deep into his tailgating routine decides to cut the port-a-pisser lines and relieve himself on the innocent-looking wall of a nearby building. He sees only brick and black glass, butyou get a free show. "Heywait­er, nix that lemonade order, please." For some asinine reason, probably something like "Pleasing customers" or "Not ruin­ing business," the staff ofthis eatery sent an employee outside to warn the clueless performer . 


Bootleggin', ND style 
Sure, the whole marshmallow debate is old news, but this one was too good to leave unpublished. The Gipp recently received a pictorial explanation of ex­actly how those sneaky students slip by stadium security (see photo). The Gipp usually doesn't allow tipsters to use the Gipp's pen as a campus-wide micro­phone to spread their propaganda, but he'll make an exception this time: "This reader wants to express his disgust at the rest of the seniors for being scared of the ushers and not continuing the tradition," concluded our tipster. The Gipp agrees. They can't possibly have 2,000 pairs of handcuffs. So listen up, seniors. If everybody smuggles in a bag or two, nobody can get in trouble. Plus, confiscating your empty ticket book isn't too much of a threat at this point. The Gipp strongly urges you to unify and make your last halftime a memo­rable one. 
Nothing brightens the Gipp's day like the combination of tricked-out mirrors and four-ways. If only we had photo­graphic evidence ofthose first two tips ... Have a great Turkey day, all. Next time we meet, we'll be having white dreams. Of Christmas, you perverts. D

. d lead you to Collegeville, 
esota and the campus of St. Johns University, a small all-male Catholic liberal arts college about 7 5 miles outside of Minneapolis. But this is no ordinary small town. Here, football is king, as the Division IDJohnnies now have won conference titles in 10 ofthe last 13 seasons. And behind it all is a man who himself is an institution. 
A unique man with an even more unique coaching style,J ohn Gagliardi (pronounced guh-LAHR-dee) is now in his 51st season a t the helm ofSt.John's. He began coach­ing football at the age of 16 when his high school coach was drafted during World War II. As captain, Gagliardi took over the reins and hasn't put them down since. 
And just this last Saturday, on a day which saw Notre Dame beat Navy for the 40th time in as many seasons, Virginia Tech fall at Pittsburgh, Miami lose for the second straight week and Oklahoma hang 77 points on Texas A&M.. before the fourth quarter, Gagliardi quietly became the win­ningest coach in college · football history. With St. John's 29-26 win over Bethel, the Johnnies clinched another conference championship and Gagliardi recorded his 409th win, surpassing the mark that Eddie Robinson set in 1997 with Division I-A.Ns Grambling. 
In his 5 5 seasons as a college head coach, Gagliardi has won three national champion­ships (1963, '65, '7 6) and26 conference titles. More impressive, however,:are his coaching tactics. As a football player in high school, Gagliardi encountered many things about

practice that he did not like. He, therefore, has put together a list ofthings that he does not allow during his practices. They are referred to as his ''Wmning With Nos," which include: 
No blocking sleds or dummies. 
No scholarships. 
No spring practices. 
No compulsory weight-lifting program. 
No whistles. 
No "Coach." Players call him John. 
No tackling in practice. 

1-------------------------Gagliardi takes out all that is not entirely necessary from his practices. And all he simply does is win. 
Short practices. Ninety minutes or less. 

No cuts. Everyone who tries out makes 
the team. 
No calisthenics. 

Yes, thatis right, no calisthenics. Well, his 
version ofcalisthenics includes ear stretch­
ing, in which the player takes his lob~ by 
the fingers and pulls them back and forth, 
up and down. Another favorite is the nice 
day drill, during which a player lies on his 
back, looks at the clouds and pronounces, ·"Nice day." 
And there is no question who the leaders 
ofthe team are. Gagliardi simply makes every 
senior on the team a captain. Thatway, they 
can all put on their resume that they were 
captains. 

So while at thousands ofhigh schools and

Senior defender Melissa Tancredi from Ancaster, Ontario is the core of the Irish defense that has allowed a mere I I goals in their 22 games this season. She grew up playing forward and was not moved to the backfield until halfway though the 2002 season.Tancredi leads the defense in scoring with three goals and five assists and recently was named Big East Defensive Player of the Year. 
What position did you play growing up and in high school? Forward. 
Why were you switched from forward to defense in the middle oflast 
season? 

Because of all the injuries in the back, they needed someorie to step in, arid with my size and athleticism I was called upon to fill that spot. My coaches always thought I would make a great defender, but I never really gave it a chance. Ifyou ask me, it was their plan the whole time. Don't let them tell you otherwise. 
What has been the most difficult part of the transition? 
Being aw~re that mistakes made in the backfield can cost your team the game. I found this out the hard way. · 
What is your most me:m.orab~e moment as a Notre ]Jame socce:r player?

Mathieson's work ethic is well-known by both his coaches and his teachers. "A lot ofcoaches along the way knew that I liked to do well academically," he says. "Likewise, teachers encouraged me with hockey. It has been a give-and-take re­lationship along the way." 
An average day for Mathieson consists of balancing practice and homework. Mathieson estimates that he works about four to six hours a day on home­work, in addition to attending classes and daily hockey practice. However, this tight schedule keeps Mathieson on track. "I know that once I am done with dinner, I have got to get to work because I just don't have the time to waste," he says. 
Not surprisingly, Mathieson's hockey career began at an early age and of his own volition, choosing hockey over his

ENGINEERING A VICTORY Always on the run, Mathieson hopes to work with jet engines after college. 
familial spgrts: His father was a swim­mer at the University ofMaryland and his cousiris were baseball players at Virgini_g_Tech~ . 
Mathieson developed a love for 
hockey while watching Washington 
Capitals games as a young boy. The 
intrepid Mathieson starred on his high 
school hockey team as a four-year let­
ter-winner, two-time captain and team 
MVP. 

Mathieson had another passion in 
high school: aerospace engineering. 
However, his dueling interests made 
choosing a college difficult for Ma­
thieson. 

"Maryland isn't much of a hockey hotbed, so I had to get out ofthe state," Mathieson says. After playing for a year in Chicago, Mathieson discovered Notre Dame to be the perfect setting to showcase both of his talents. "It's a school that had aerospace engineering, which is something I've always wanted to do, and hockey on top of that," he says. "I was drawn to it." 
After entering into Notre Dame's 
Class of 2004, Mathieson successfully 
walked on to the hockey team. It was 
not easy, however. "Being a walk-on 
freshman, you don't speak up quite as 
much, but as you got into the role, you 
learn what you can say." In his first two 
years, Mathieson quickly made a niche 
for himself on the team. 

Mathieson has tackled different roles 
during his hockey career. During his 
freshman and sophomore years, Ma­
thieson played 35 games for the Irish, 
with one goal and one assist. With 
strong defensive recruits choosing to 
play for Notre Dame, Mathieson was 
bumped out ofthe spotlight for the Irish 
and played only nine games during his 
junior and senior years. However, he has 
continued to impact the team. 

"At some points he has played more 
than at other times, but whatever role 
he's had, he's accepted it," Poulin says. Mathieson has also contributed to the recent marked progress of Notre Dame's younger players. "He's been an ideal role model," Poulin says. "[Ma­thieson] shows the freshmen that they can do this. So, when they feel totally . overwhelmed, you can point to T.J. and 
say, 'here's an example of proper time 
management at the highest level."' 
Now that Mathieson's collegiate hockey career is coming to a close, he has begun to look into the future, even though he indicates that it is still up in the air. 
Although unsure ofwhat career path to take after Notre Dame, Mathieson's work as an intern at General Electric Aircraft Engines in Cincinnati, Ohio this past summer helped him get a feel for some real-life aerospace engineering. 
Mathieson's work dealt mostly with jet engines and completing stress analyses of the engine turbines. After reviewing this data, Mathieson worked on modeling a program to run tests on a computer and wrote reports on their :findings. 
"It was a great experience for me," Mathieson says. "I learned a lot about how things work in industry and how things I learned here are applied out in the real world. Here, you solve problems that other people have already done/but out there, you solve problems thatno one has solved before." 
Mathieson is now considering entering into a technical field and continuing to work with jet engines. But he has not yet committed to any particular future ca­reer. Mathieson is also a candidate for the esteemed Rhodes, Mitchell, and Marshall scholarships for post-graduate studies. 
"I know he is considering being an astronaut," Poulin says. "I'll be cheering for him at Cape Canaveral: when the shuttle takes off and T.J. Mathieson, the former University of Notre Dame hockey player, is driving the thing." 
A student-athlete in the truest sense of the term, T.J. Mathieson exhibits the qualities that bind a team together. Whether that is a hockey team or an engineering team, Mathieson has shown that he has the ability and the drive to go places -possibly even outer space. Now, he is left with only one athletic aspiration to reach: winning a national championship. Mathieson's career, how­ever, has been successful no matter what the result of this year may happen to be. Poulin says it best: "[Mathieson] has really got the best of both worlds." .

Junior point guard Chris Thomas returns to lead the Irish 
men's basketball team 
JIMMYATKINSON 

He is No. 1 -the only player ever to wear that number at Notre Dame. And it suits him well. A unique player in a class all his own, ju­nior point guard Chris Thomas is Notre Dame's returning leader in points and assists from last season. After leading the Irish to the NCAA Sweet Sixteen for the first time since 1987, Thomas returns once again to 
anchor the Irish backcourt and pace the at­tack. 
As co-cap­tain of this year's squad, Thomas leads the team not only in :j offensive statistics but also ....---· in character. His ability to 
\ ta~e control ofa game ~arks him as a playmaker. His ath­
leticism and confidence make ~nyone believe that he is the real deal. 
The first Mr. Bas­ketball from Indiana to attend Notre Dame, Thomas led his alma mater Pike High School to a state championship in his senior season. One of 12 McDonald's All-Americans, he arrived at Notre Dame with the expectation that he would make an immediate difference. And he did just that, setting the pace from , the get-go when he recorded a triple­! . . : _: .• (\ double in his first collegiate game as a 
/ · · -; . _ true freshman. In that game against -<~!. ··-: New Hampshire, he also shattered ·,;:_"i~~ -dtrM'~) ~he N~tre Dame record for steals 
~ m a smgle game. He came away 
26 SCHO~STICSPORTS 

with 11, breaking the previous record of seven set by Ray Martin in 1974. Since he set foot on this campus, Thomas has been the starting point guard for the Irish and is helping put Notre Dame men's basketball back on the map. 
On May 6, Thomas disheartened Notre Dame fans by entering his name in the 2003 NBA Draft. But, after be­ing named the National Freshman of the Year in 2002 and an honorable mention All-American in 2003, he had all the credentials and talent to make it in the pros. 
During the following weeks, Thom­as carefully considered his options, al­ways returning to Notre Dame in the back of his mind. He worked out with several NBA teams in pre-draft camps, · including the Boston Celtics, Seattle Supersonics, Orlando Magic, Miami Heat and Phoeni~ Suns. Thomas' goal . was to be drafted in the first round. Ifhe felt as though th.is was unattain­able, he said he wouldreturn to school. He took care never to hire an agent, which would have made him ineligible 
to return to NCAA competition. 

On June 16, Thomas, predicting 
that a second-round selection would 
be the best that he could hope for, 
withdrew his name from the draft just 
days before the deadline. He returned 
to Notre Dame and allowed fourth­
year head coach Mike Brey and the 
Irish faithful to breathe a collective 
sigh of relief. 

The process was not without its ben­
efits, however. Working out with pro­
fessional basketball teams made him a: 
better player. "It improved my game 
a lot,''. he says. "I was playing with 
the best playei:s. I was playing with 
smarter, faster, more atl?-letic players, 
and the more I played with them, the 
more I caught up with them." 

But Thomas 110 longer wishes to talk 
13 NOVEMBER 2003 

about the decisions he.made regarding his professional status. "To be back here at school and get the season un­derway, that's what I've been waiting for since I declared I would be coming back," he says. "That's in the past. I'm moving on. I'm looking forward to the next game." 
Nor has he had any regrets about backing away from the NBA. -"Ever since I did that, I felt a huge weight lifted offmy shoulders, because I real­ly thought I made the right decision," he says. "From here on out, my focus is on the Irish and making each one of these players on my team better." 
With his selfless attitude and crafty ability to dish the ball off to team­mates, it is no wonder why Thomas prefers his No. 1 jersey. He started wearing No. 1 during the Indiana­Kentucky high school all-star series 
following his prep career. "I felt that 
it would be an opportunity for me 
to establish my name at Notre Dame 
and it's worked out so far," Thomas 
says. "I asked Brey about it and he 
said I could have it and after that, 
everybody told us I was the first 
player [to wear that number]. Now 
I'm sure there will be many more 
players." 
Thomas easily has stepped back into 

his role as leader of the Notre Dame squad. In the first exhibition test of the season against Hoop Group, he played 38 minutes, led the team with 25 points, and finished with nine · assists and only one turnover. More 
impressive, however, was the effective teamwork between Thomas and soph­omore guard Chris Quinn, who played 33 minutes and finished with 12 points. The two guards assisted each other for 
a combined 11 
points. 
Certainly, 
Quinn can 
be expected 
to contribute 
much more this 
season. Thom­
as definitely 
expects good 
things from 
the two guards. 
"We're going 
to surprise a 
lot of people 
this season," 
Thomas says. 
"Not many 
people have 
heard [Quinn's] 
name." 
Accordingly, 
Brey's game 
plan will rely 
on the two 
guards to set 
the pace for 
the rest of his 
team. Before 
the exhibition 
game last week, 1 he pulled them 
over just be­
fore the tip-off 
to have a word 
with them. 
Brey instructed 
the two guards

that he wanted them to control the 
game. "I said, 'You should control the 
game with two guys like you on the 
floor,"; Brey says. "They love playing 
with each other [and] they know how 
to play off each other." 
It is no surprise that Brey puts so 

much confidence in his backcourt. Thomas' ability to single-handedly change the pace of the game with his quick speed and hands may be his strongest attribute. Yet, it may also be what he needs the most work on. A fast and confident guard, Thomas occasion ­ally becomes overconfident, which can lead him to speed up the game's tempo unnecessarily. But with two years now · under his belt, Thomas seems like he is settling into a more mature role on 
the team. 
And the team is in need of a play­

maker with the departure ofthree-point 
specialist Matt Carroll. 
Brey certainly has given Thomas his 

approval to be that playmaker when 
necessary. "When we do stall, and 
you sense we need a play to get out of 
trouble, he's the guy, he'll always be the 
guy, and we better get the heck out of 
his way and let him be the guy, quite 
frankly," Brey says. 
While Thomas has not indicated 

yet whether or not this will be his 
final season in an Irish uniform, he 
is focused on the present. He has no 
individual goals at this time, only 
team-oriented ones. "I just want to 
make each player better," he says. "I 
want to be the best teammate I can 
be ... [and] I want to help this team 
win the championship." .

Major Decisions to be Made 
The age-old question: Sell your soul or work in a liquor store? 
I'm about to register for classes for my last semester at this hallowed institution, and all I can say is that I'm jealous of those who are graduating early. It's not because I'll have a hard course-load next semester. Technically, I could graduate at Christmas as well, with a degree in Film, Television, & Theatre and a respectable GPA. However, inmyongoing attempt to make myself a more well-rounded unhirable person, I'm going to stay an extra semester and take a back-breaking grand total of two classes so I can finish my English major. Two. Count 'em. No, I'm jealous ofthe early graduates because they're actually getting out of the beer-soaked halls of academia, and entering the oh-so-scary real world. To me, that's a big step, akin to a 
--------­
baby bird leaving the nest. Only in 
this case, the nest is a patriarchal, intrusive institution dedicated to churning out baby birds who conform to Catholic doctrine, and Mama Bird is sending out bills for $100,000 worth ofdebt. All ofthat for a major you weren't even sure you wanted in the first place. 
There are no hard and fast rules for choosing a major. Two schools of thought do exist, however. Thefirst method is, ofcourse, to study what interests you. Ifyou enjoy follow­ing current events, political science may be for you. Ifthe Internet is your thing, computer science will be, too. Ifyou like to get high and discuss Voltaire, then you are a PLS poster-boy. And so on. 

The other school ofthought is the one which dictates that you choose your major with an eye toward a future career. Pre-meds are, ofcourse, a prime example ofthese high-strung individuals. They spend three years slowly freaking out about the MCATs, only to spend one frantic year wondering ifthey'll be forced to go to a tiny, disreputable medical school on one ofthe Caribbean islands. 
Business majors are another example of the latter school of thought. At this point I should add the disclaimer that I came to this school fully intending to be a business major. This intent lasted until my very first business class. Everything was going fine at first, but a few weeks into the course, I'd notice a small, sharp pain in my chest. That's when I realized that my soul was

being slowly, methodically sucked from my body. 
I feel strongly about the business major, mostly because I believe that it is a somewhat less-than-noble academic pursuit. First, the majority ofthe people who choose business as a major do so because they are interested inmaking money after they graduate, as opposed to being interested in studying the art ofbusiness. I say "majority'' because there are a couple rare birds who actually were interested in the business world before they began formally studying it. You know these types. These are the guys who in high school wore starched Polo shirts to class and always had a thermos full ofcoffee and the stock page ofthe local paper. 
The second reason that I question the academic legitimacy of 
its doors: "Give me your slackers, your athletes, your huddled freshmen yearn­ing for an easy B." An application pro­cess would ruin the b-school's street credas a four-year daycare center for the guy who's just going to graduate and go to work for Daddy's Company. Maybe I'm being a little harsh. After all, I'm enrolled in two· majors thatwelcome all comers. Never mind thatsaid majors have a rather limited appeal, attracting those who are bound either for grad school or for their parents' basements. And maybe, just maybe, business majors are smarter than I give them credit for. One ofniy roommates is a finance major with a high GPA, cur­rently getting job offers in the high five-figures from companies in NewYork.and Chicago. Meanwhile, I'm contemplating a job at a liquor store to complement my two ~lasses next semester. Who's the idiot now? D 
the business major is that it justreeks of practicality, which, per myunderstand­ing, is a cardinal sin of degree acquisi­tion. Apparently, Domers are a pretty practical crowd, because a whopping one-third of the school is enrolled in 
Mendoza College. 
This has led to the administration's publicruminationsaboutlimitingthe number of business students, perhaps 
requiring applications for admission 
to the college. This has sent, I'm sure, scores ofpeople into a panic. Business has long been the catch-all major· for thosewhohaveabsolutelynootherin­

Go Beyond Grape 
Authentic Italian dining is not far from Notre Dame's campus 
imported wines LITTLE ITALY Francesco's authenticity isn't just limited to the food.The and beers. A atmosphere compliments the menu. 
CHRISTINEARMSTRONG 

Muhammed Ali and Jerry Lewis know that sometimes it's worth going the extra mile to enjoy a great meal. At Francesco's you will enjoy the kind of meal that attracts celebrities -literally. The restaurant, a 15-minute drive from campus, may seem to be the perfect escape from Notre Dame, but once inside you realize that you really have not left the school at all. Diners who appreciate authentic Italian cuisine should treat themselves to an evening here: It is well worth the time to ven­ture beyond Grape Road for a little taste of Italy. Owner Francesco Catanzariti and his family treat guests like relatives stop­ping in for a warm meal. Catanzariti's family has a rich history and intimate relationship with the Notre Dame community, which is evident from the entranceway walls adorned with photo­graphs ofboth the Catanzariti clan and their Notre Dame cousins. The stone decor, array of photos, cozy fireplace and soft background music create a welcoming ambianct;: reminiscent of a family dining room. Catanzariti and his family emigrated from Calabria, Italy, to the United States. During his 25 years as a univer­sity chef, the Notre Dame priests helped Catanzariti learn English. Then, in 1983, his culinary expertise led him to embark on his first business adventure: An Italian eatery that he operated for three years on Ironwood. In 1984, Cat­anzariti also began remodeling a house on Lincolnway West, and a year later the Canzariti family opened the doors to Francesco's. Catanzanariti's son and restaurant manager,Joe Catanzariti, says that for­mal meals and parties make up the bulk of business. The banquet room, which displays a mural designed and painted by Notre Dame architecture students, is a favorite for Christmas parties, rehearsal dinners, Junior Parents Weekend din­ners and graduatiop. celebrations. "Foot­ball weekends are big here. It has slowed 
down a little 
this year, and I ,.· 
think it is be­cause the team isn't winning like they used to," Francesco 
Catanzariti 
says. 
The menu offers a variety of traditional Italian appe­tizers, entrees and desserts, as well as both 

fresh green salad or pasta fagiolo soup is served with each entree. The house salad is a simple combination of fresh greens, tomatoes and onions topped with a homemade Italian dressing. The soup has a tomato base, beans and pasta, and is a good beginning to the delicious meal to come. 
It was difficult to choose from a va­riety of reasonably priced entrees that include. Italian favorites such as pasta calabrese, :fettucini alfredo and eggplant parmiginana. Seafood lovers can enjoy such favorites as seafood canneloni. We selected the chicken parmigiana and spinach lasagna. Though it took some time for the en trees to arrive, they were well worth the wait. The chicken par­migiana plate included a sizeable piece of chicken and spaghetti topped with a rich Italian tomato sauce. The spinach lasagna plate was tasty, with a simple tomato sauce, but perhaps disappoint­ing for those who enjoy more flavorful dishes. 
It was difficult to choose a dessert from among such tantalizing options as amaretto cheesecake, tiramisu, and cannolies. These desserts can be complemented by a cup of cappucino or espresso. We settled on a divine slice of cheesecake drizzled with raspberry sauce. 
The restaurant also provides an op­portunity to enjoy some great conver­sation. Francesco Catanzaniti's warmth and honesty make him a favorite among guests. He chats with customers both during and after meals and is eager 
to tell you about both of his families -the Cat­anzaritis and Notre Dame. He fondly recollects. his days work­ing at Moreau Seminary, .the Fatima Retreat Center and the dining hall. His affection for Notre Dame is shown through 
his stories about Monk Malloy's days as a student and ofthe friendships he made with university priests. 
Francesco Catanzariti encourages stu­dents to come out for a meal. A few years ago,J erry Lewis and the cast of Damn Yan­kees traveled from Chicago to Francesco's to enjoy a meal. Likewise, Muhammed Ali has been known to drop down from Michigan for some restaurant specials. 
Francesco Catanzariti says, "It's a hard business. You have to advertise to get people to come to us. Once they come, they always come back." D

snare drums tapping in measured rhythm, shining brass instru­ments gleaming as fingers dance over their keys, and brightly colored flags swooping and flying in time with the music: All ofthese images normally are associated with the marching bands that parade across football fields in the crisp autumn air. The latest produc­tion to head for the Morris Performing Arts Center in downtown South Bend, however, is not your traditional drum corps presentation. Blast! combines traditional elements ofmarching band field shows with the flash ofa choreographed stage pro due­tion in the tradition of such shows as Riverdance and Stomp. In an interview on the Blast! Web site, creator James Mason describes the show as a "Dis­pey:esque'.~ animation thaLcomes toJif~ bn a theater stage. The show currently; inhabits the theater stage;·but its-roots founder, businessman Bill Cook, ere­ated it with the intent of providing a musical outlet for the young people of Bloomington. He hired James Mason, a veteran of several drum corps, as the director. Under Mason's direction, the corps soon began to travel and attend competitions, placing 10th in its first appearance at the Drum Corps Inter­national World Championships. Their score was the highest ever attained by a novice group. In 1991, the corps won the World Championship. 
In a 1995 interview, Cook explained that the secret to the corps' achieve­ment was "experience, a work ethic that goes beyond saying '.I worked hard."' The success of the corps in­spired Mason to start exploring new creative ideas for performances. The group continued to compete until 1993, when Cook and Mason decided it was time to take the corps to a new level of performance.

The youthful ensemble is composed of talented musicians and performers in their 20s and 30s, most of whom performed with marching bands and drum corps while attending college around the country. The group. then abandoned the moniker "Brass The­ater" for something that would.better describe the energy level and excite­ment of the new show. The new name, Blast!, was exactly what they had been looking for. 
Soon after, the new ensemble traveled to London to debut Blast! The show premiered in London's West End the­ater district in December 1999 to solid reviews. Performances began to sell out regularly after the cast appeared on two 15-minute television segments for the BBC. The combination of bright col­ors and familiar, stirring music enchanted the crowds in London until the show moved back to the United States in 2000. The show opened at the Apollo Hammersmith Theater in Boston on August 23, 2000. That same year, another PBS special aired, this time an hour-long look at the show with a behind-the­scenes look.

A former campus band returns to its roots at Notre Dame 
l ! 


RYANRETARTHA 

The long road to success has 
brought Umphrey's McGee full . circle. Originally a Notre Daine . campus band, the group returned to its alma mater on Oct. 31 as the head­liner at Legends. With a growing fan base and emerging presence on the national music scene, the band proved it has come a long way from its humble beginnings. 
Joel Cummins, Mike Mirra, Brendan Bayliss and Ryan Stasik combined two campus bands to become the Notre Dame Undergraduates in December 1997. After their days at Notre Dame ended, they decided they had what it took to be successful in the jam-band music scene. Only months later they released their first album, Greatest Hits Vol. III. 
In 1998, the band picked up drum­mer Andy Farag before releasing their sophomore work, Songs for Older Women.Jake Cinniger added his guitar talents in September 2000. Recently, founding member Mirra left the band to pursue medical school. 
"If that's what he wants to do, then we wanted him to do that," Cummins says of the loss. "We totally support him." The loss was compensated for · by the acquisition of drummer Kris Myers, which finally rounded out the unique Umphrey's vibe. 
That sound is made up ofeverything from driving funk beats to electric melodies in the vein of Pink Floyd. Umphrey's also relies on heavy percus­sion solos a la Rusted Root and more traditional guitar solos reminiscent of Queen and The Who. 
Although their repertoire grew with 
the recent additions of the live album 
One Fat Sucka in 2000, a DVD released 
in 2003 and their third album, Local 
Band Does O.K., the band's true love is 
the spontaneity and unpredictability_of 
playing live shows. · 
"I enjoy creating music in the mo­
ment," Cummins says. The former 
music theory major is always experi­menting musically and craves the chance to improvise on stage. "We try to stay away from cli­ched ideas," he says. The band's instrumentals and long jams display a wide range of musical genre, technique and creativ­ity. 
This range is due large­ly to the band's eclectic spectrum ofinfluences. 
"Everyone in the band is a huge fan ofZeppelin and the Beatles," Cum­mins says. "We're also big fans of the whole Miles Davis thing." 
Umphrey's also takes much of its influence from present-day bands. In 2002, the band was invited to play at the famous Bonnaroo Music Festival in 1\tianchester, Tenn. The festival is a "who's who" of today's best jam bands. Getting the chance to play Bonna­roo put the band face to face with some of their biggest influences and favorite bands. 


COMFORT ZONE Umphrey's McGee hasfound success as a niche . jam-band beyond Notre Dame. · 
"Tortoise, Flaming Lips, I really dig them," says Cummins. "Everyone in the band really enjoys Ween and Phil Lesh. [Lesh] was actually a big fan of the band. That was very cool, something I'd never imagine would happen." 
And now, the band's long, strange trip has brought them back to Notre Dame. In what was indisputably one of the best shows Legends has seen, Cummins and his crew gave the capac­ity crowd everything one would expect from a first-class jam band: excellent. music, incendiary solos and fantastic, full-band jams. 
The line to get into Legends began forming early on Halloween evening, a testament to the band's loyal fan 
base. Many of the band's long-time 
fans, often known as Umphreaks or 
Umphiles, made their way to the front 
of the stage and mirrored the band's 
energy and enthusiasm. 

Umphrey's has found a niche in the 
jam-band scene at Notre Dame and 
beyond. The band largely spreads its 
music by way of CD-swapping, and by 
band members' encouraging concert­
goers to record and distribute their 
live shows. 

Now, the bandJ.s looking toward the · future. "Medical insurance," Cummins quips. "That's a big goal." 
"Our goal is to do this as long as we 
can," he adds on ·a serious note, "to grow 
every step of the way and have as many 
people as we can get to listen to our 
music and, hopefully, enjoy it." D

Loving Life 
Women, rejoice! We have the ability to become pregnant. Only women are granted the blessed possibility to bring forth a new life from their bodies. The beautiful and dignified physical demands placed onwomen's bodies throughout pregnancy culminate in labor and the birth ofa new person. Thestrong, immedi­ate bond between a mother and child is unlike any other relationship in existence. Women everywhere have the opportunity to partake in this amazing, life-changing experience. Pregnancy is a bond that women from all backgrounds share, regardless of time period, geographic location, race, class or education. As with any privilege, this tremendous power comes with a great responsibility. It is this sometimes overwhelming responsibility, coupled with strong societal views thatsometimes can cause pregnancy to be regarded as less spectacular than it truly is. I spent the last two years living and working at a home for pregnant women in Phoenix -Mag­gie's Place. Many of the women there com.e from abusive backgrounds, some were once homeless, . some are recovering addicts, all ofthem are about

from this joy. However difficult, pregnancy and parenting outside of the ideal situation is still a miracle to be revered. 
"You're only at four centimeters. I am going to speed up your Pitocin drip. Thiswill make the con­tractions longer and more intense, but hopefully you will dilate faster and we can get this baby out." 
"Okay," she replied so calmly between sweat­producing contractions. By this time, we had been at the hospital for eight hours. Tara was two weeks late delivering her son and had been extremely un­comfortable for the last month. · 
As wesatin the delivery room, I hoped thatTara's parents would decide to accept her decision to be a mother. Ov~r the past two months, Maggie's Place had been the source of love, support and prenatal care for Tara and her soon-to-be-born son. 
Tara was assured at her doctor visits that the little guy was perfect. Theultrasounds revealed a healthy

10-pound baby. Even with this confirmation, Tara was concerned that her past may have negatively af­fected her son. During the beginning stages ofher labor, Tara continued to worry, "Whatifsomething is wrong? How could he be perfect after all I have done to him?" 
When Tara got pregnant, she was living on the streets, addicted to meth. She took a pregnancy test when she was three months pregnant. Tara was scared that she would not be able to care for a child. Her parents shared this fear and asked her to terminate her pregnancy. Once Tara decided to be a parent, she stopped using drugs, found Maggie's Place and moved in immediately. At Maggie's Place, Tara made miraculous strides. By the time we made the final trip to the hospital, I was confident that Tara would be a wonderful, loving mother. 
"Ahhhhh. Owwwww." The contractions were very strong now. She was dilated to 10 cm and ready to push. This gorgeous, six-foot-tall woman was breathing hard as she labored. Her long blonde hair was wet with. perspiration when she began to birth her baby . 
After supporting Tara through the first ten hours of labor, I was thrilled to see her mother come through the door just in_tim:e•to watch the birth ofher grandson; : · 
He was beautiful. She was amazing. They were perfect. 
During my two years at Maggie's Place, I have seen many stories like this. Each woman· that walks through the door is scared about pregnancy and becoming a mother. Each baby that is born from these strong, beautiful women is a miracle. Whether the moms choose to parent their children orto place them for adoption, it is clear -these women love their children, in the truest, most sacrificial sense. 
Every woman faced with an unplanned pregnancy has a different story. Every mother has different fears· that cause her to be apprehensive about parenting a child. It is difficult to know exactly what a woman needs when she comes to you with worries about an unplanned pregnancy: Her life is about to make a radical change. First, listen: She may tell you what she needs. If not, on-going love, support and en­couragement are things every woman needs to be a great mom. Resources for housing and healthcare are the next important step. Then, a lifetime supply ofdiapers; .
