SIXTEEN BENGALEERS AWAIT OPENING GONG
Max Marek
A Bengaleer comes home.
MAX MAREK WILL BE HONORARY REFEREE
An old Bengaleer returns tonight. Max Marek, heavyweight champion of the Bengal Bouts in 1935 and since turned professional will serve as honorary referee for the Bengal Boxing Show finals.
Marek has been fighting professionally since 1935 in the heavyweight division. He has a great reputation for being one of the gamest and fightingest heavyweights in the Mid-West, and in the country. In 1936 he won the Illinois state heavyweight championship and defended it successfully for a year.
Max, in his amateur days had the distinction of defeating Joe Louis, in the finals of the National A. A. U. tournament in 1933 when both boys were light heavyweights. The Louis-

Full House To Witness Battle of Champions
By Graham Starr
‘•And in the blue corner we have..” Line Coach Joe Boland’s voice will boom out towards the darkened stands, all eyes will be focused on the flood-lighted ring, a gong will sound, and the Seventh Annual edition of the Scholastic sponsored Bengal Bouts will be under way!
'Yes, tonight is the big night! Beginning at 8 p.m. and until the sounding of the final gong or the last count of ten, eight champions will be crowned kings of their respective weight divisions at the University Field House.
Honorary judges of the finals will be Elmer F. Layden, director of athletics, and Mr. Frank Lloyd, comptroller of the University.
The cream of the boxing Fighting Irish, 16 men strong and true, after weathering weeks of intensive practice and more especially the stiff competition of three nights of gruelling preliminaries, rested yesterday, and should be in top condition for the fray tonight.
Bouts Promotor Charlie Callahan, Lexington, Mass., sees no reason why this year’s rounds should not climax them all—the turnout (80 men) has been the greatest yet, the quality of the entrants has surpassed that of other years, the training period required has been increased, the physical requirements have been made more rigid, and registered A.A.U. officials have been obtained for the finals as they were for the preliminaries.
Credit for the training of the boxers goes to Mr. Napolitano, and assistants, Phil Walker and Ed Broscoe.
With not a dull moment, the evening will be crammed full of activity, what with the antics of “Killer” Kell and “One Horse” Race, in their battle of the mastodons.
Tickets are 25 cents, and may be purchased from any Scholastic reporter. Proceeds will go to the Bengal Missions in India.
Honorary Judge Layden Looking ’em over.
SPORTSMANSHIP CUP AWARDED TONIGHT

An added feature of tonight’s finals will be the presentation of a gold trophy to the Bengal boxer who has displayed the finest sportsmanship during the course of the bouts. The trophy is donated by the “Huddle” campus candy store.
Mr. William Sheehan, owner of the “Huddle” stated that the winner will have to win approval of all judges that officiated at the bouts, both preliminaries and finals. It will be presented immediately after the final bout by Elmer Layden, honorary judge.
The trophy is of gold with a figure of a boxer on the top and suitably inscribed. The aim of presenting the award is to promote clean sportsmanship in the Bengal bouts.
Timekeepers will be “Chet” Grant and Jim Quinn.
The Athletic Association and Director Layden donated new gloves, jump - ropes, mouthpieces, and a punching bag.

JITNEY PLAYERS TO PRESENT "THE RIVALS" TOMORROW IN WASHINGTON HALL
The Jitney players, first troupe of strolling performers to achieve any widespread distinction since the days of Moliere, will present their interpretation of “The Rivals” over the footlights of Washington Hall on Saturday.
March 19. Taking for their motto the w Deirdre: “We have no country but the roads of the world,” these modern descendants of the strolling players of the past differ from the other touring companies in that they have no resident theatre, and are the only company in the world at present that can boast this distinction.
Fifteen years ago, a young man named Bushness Cheney, lately graduated from Yale, had the vision and foresight to foresee a changing theatre. With his bride, Alice Keating, he gathered together a group of young pioneers and set forth to make what has since become theatrical history. After the death of Bushness Cheney, his wife carried on, and in the spring of 1935, she was joined by Douglas Rowland, who had long been an actor in the company, and Ethel Colt.
Together they formed a new corporation, but with the same ideals and purposes of the old: to keep alive the great plays of bygone years as well as those of the present day, and to bring them to audiences who perhaps would otherwise grow up all over the country without a glimpse of the living “flesh - and - blood” theatre.
With their compact caravan, the Jitney players can and do, go everywhere—whether there is a theatre, stage or not—wherever the audience can be found — and that is truly everywhere.
Featured in the cast which is making a current 12 week tour through 20 states are: Alice Keating Cheney, Douglas Rowland, Pendleton Harrison, Bettina Cerf and Franklin Downing.

Two incentives for students to keep high scholastic averages were pointed out this week in a letter sent to all Notre Dame students by Rev. J. Leonard Carrico, director of studies. As in previous years relative standings will determine the order of students for the choice of rooms. Besides this the greater limitation placed on the number of students to be enrolled will mean that when the capacity is reached in each class those students having the lowest averages will be dropped from the register.
The period of preregistration will extend from April 4 to April 11. A five dollar deposit will be required of each student for academic registration. Room registration will require another five dollars. The latter will be refunded in case the student is unable to attend the University in the fall.
If a student fails to preregister with the dean of his college at his scheduled time his room reservation will be cancelled, and any application for employment on the campus will be void. In such cases students

DR. GURIAN TO GIVE EVALUATION OF EUROPE'S BALANCE OF POWER IN HALL WEDNESDAY
FROSH ELECT SAGAU CLASS PRESIDENT
On of the most important lectures of the year will be given in Washington Hall Wednesday night, March 23, by Dr. Waldemar Gurian, of the department of politics. Dr. Gurian will speak on the political and spiritual significance of the changes now taking place in Europe. Few men in the world today are as qualified to talk on this subject as ,____________.___________________________
Dr. Gurian. He has written three v
books: Bolshevism: Theory and Practice, The Future of Bolshevism, and Hitler and the Christians which have been translated into English, Dutch, Italian, German, and French. Another book is now ready for publication in England. He is a contributor to such publications as Foreign Affairs, Dublin Review, Commonweal, Blackfriars.
Dr. Gurian will attempt to evaluate the drifts in the balance of power in Europe and the underlying principles of these drifts. The German annexation of Austria and the increased activity in Spain has, and will have, a tremendous effect on the old pre-Hitler balance.
Because of the apparently sudden and violent changes in the map of Europe as it exists today, the lecture of Dr. Gurian is of particular importance to the college man who would have an accurate picture of conditions as they are.
The lecture will start Wednesday at 8 o’clock. It will be the first public address of Dr. Gurian since joining the faculty last September. Before coming to Notre Dame, Dr. Gurian was a teacher at the Academy of Politics in Berlin, a lecturer at the University of Frieburg, Switzerland, and editor of a Catholic newspaper Kol-nische Volkszeitung.
Set Easter Duty Date
The muffled scrape of leather on tiled floors, the gentle thudding as students file in and out of pews will be heard from early morn until 12 o’clock on March 22 when Notre Dame en masse makes its Easter Duty.
As an annual feature this event has had great success in past years and with the daily Communion average at present around 1700 it is expected that this year will be no exception. Every student, although he may already have made his Easter Duty, is expected to cooperate with the religious department and receive Communion on the appointed day.
The usu.al Confession and Communion facilities will be at the students’ disposal and all are urged to use them to their fullest extent in order to make thise phase of the religious program as successful as possible.

At the second meeting of the Military club in Badin Rec, election of officers was held with Joseph A. Callahan, senior from Woodhaven, New York City, elected president, George Haggerty, a junior from Flushing, N. Y., vice-president; and Francis Sweeney Tuck, sophomore from Hayden, Ariz., secretary-treasurer.
Committee chairmen were appointed: Charles Beasley, constitution committee; Stanley Partyka, chairman of the program committee, and Walter Hagen, Jr., as chairman of the liaison committee.
At the next meeting, announcement of which will follow later, a constitution will be submitted and an official name for the club will be selected by vote. Tentative plans will be discussed concerning the Memorial Day exercises in which the club is expected to take an active part.
Registrar Robert B. Riordan, major in the field artillery reserve of the United States army, faculty advisor of the club, will discuss the army’s “Five-Paragraph Field Order.”
President Callahan will give a talk on “Scouting and Patrolling.”
The meeting closed after an open discussion in which Major Riordan discussed the military traditions of the University that might be carried on by the club.
That the fading “O’Connor-Callahan-Reardon-Mulligan party” would have a worthy successor seemed likely today after the final results of the Freshman election were announced officially by John R. Kelley, treasurer of the Students Activities Council, and commissioner of all class elections this year.
In the typical style of the aforementioned “fading party” the freshman politicians behind the “Saggau ticket” scored a clean sweep in the final balloting. The new freshman president is Robert Saggau, Brownson Haller, out of Denison, Iowa, who defeated his opponent, William Hennessy, Zahm Hall, by a count of 245178. Saggau led his rival in the primaries by 45 votes.
Candidate for the vice-presidency, William Mulvey, Freshman Hall, overcame a slight deficiency incurred in the primaries to triumph over Bill Bryar, Cavanaugh, 255-176. Gordon Love, Freshman, was victorious in the race for the position of secretary over Bill Sturm, Zahm, by the wide margin of 252-166. Homer Ferguson, Cavanaugh, the last man on the ticket, made the victory complete when he outstripped Bill Wilson, Freshman, for the office of treasurer.
The election was held Tuesday, March 15, in the Carroll Rec Room. Balloting took place from 1 to 4 p.m.
White Hussars Please
Herbert Petrie and his White Hussars visited Notre Dame last year as an entertainment organization practically unknown; their audience that year was composed of those persons who were mostly curious and attracted by the title, “White Hussars.”
In a brief two hours the same White Hussars under the direction of Mr. Petrie not only settled the doubts of any curious persons in the audience, but established a reputation which made their second appearance last Friday night on the campus a “not to be missed” event. '
Composed of three trumpeters, two trombonists, a harpist, a pianist, and a male soloist, the group pleased even the most skeptical in one of the most popular programs to be presented in Washington Hall during the current year.
Among the more popular selections during the evening were the following: Overture, “Poet and Peasant,” by Suppe; a harp solo, “Winter” rendered by Mary Proesel; “Triumphal March” from “Aida” by Verdi; “Barcarolle” by Hoffman, the “Indian Love Call,” and “The Lost Chord” by Sullivan.

Annual Philosophical Disputation Last Week Heralded as Most Successful Ever Held
By Paul R. Locher
Germany annexes Austria — and the newspapers seethe with excitement and speculation concerning various political and economic implications. Then as the tumult on the front page gradually dies, repercussion appear in the form of random articles cropping up on subsequent pages, which emphasize the social and cultural changes which are taking place.
Such a dispatch is the significant news that Bruno Walter, eminent conductor, has been forced to resign the directorship of the Vienna opera, because of his Jewish ancestry. In another recent news item we learn that Toscanini has cancelled his intention to participate in the annual music festival at Salzburg, Austria. This cancellation brings to mind his previous refusal to attend the annual Wagnerian Festival held at Bayreuth, Germany, because of Hitler’s unfavorable treatment of fellow musicians. To further emphasize his point of view, Toscanini had then made the long journey to Palestine to conduct the opening concert of the new Palesinian Orchestra in Tel Aviv.
But such loss ultimately may be America’s gain. Toscanini has already signed a three-year contract to conduct the NBC Symphony in radio and concert performances, beginning in October. In the interim, Carlos Chavez, Mexican composer and conductor of the Mexico City Symphony, is guest conductor, to be followed in successive concerts by Artur Rodzin-ski of the Cleveland Orchestra, Pierre Monteux, foremost conductor of France, Sir Adrian Boult from London, and Bernardino Molinari, who will come from Rome.
In the uncertainties of Europe, America looms as a haven for political refugees, and some enterprising organization will undoubtedly grasp the opportunity to secure eminent conductors and musicians of the caliber of Bruno Walter.

Last Friday night the student body in Washington Hall gave enthusiastic guarantee to the success of visiting entertainers with an intelligently arranged program. Since Mr. Herbert Pertrie, director of the White Hussars, had absorbed the dynamic spirit of his former leader, John Philip Sousa, he brought to Notre Dame a fine knowledge of organization and direction in the presentation of his group. Selection followed selection in rapid-fire delivery, which had the slight disadvantage of confusing an audience which would have liked to (Continued on Page 20)

One of the outstanding events of the current schoolyear carved a definite niche for itself in Notre Dame history when the annual Public Disputation in Philosophy, conducted under the auspices of the Schoolmen, was presented last week in Washington Hall. The disputation which had for its honorary guest the Right Reverend Thomas V. Shannon, • Ph.D.;
LL.D., ’21, pastor of the Church of St. Thomas the Apostle, Chicago, dealt with the thesis, “The Natural Law,” and
Msgr. Shannon was a crowning climax to a series of events honoring St. Thomas Aquinas, the Patron Saint of Catholic Schools. William Mahoney, President of the Schoolmen, presided as chairman.
Impetus was given the disputation by James Nerney, the first speaker, who considered the topic, “Saint Thomas, Apostle of the ’Modern Mind.” In definite, concrete terms the speaker emphasized the point that despite the attacks of the phenomal-ists, sensists, positivists, and various other philosophies on the Scholastic concepts, the philosophy of St. Thomas has continued to remain invulnerable.
The overflowing crowd, which packed even standing room in Washington Hall, next heard George Keen-en present his paper, “Thomistic and Positivistic Views on the Natural Law,” in which he compared the interpretation by St. Thomas and the opposite argument as presented by the Positivistic school.
Edward McDonough was the formal defender of the thesis, “The Natural Law.” In turn he considered .. the existence , immutability, and knowledge of the natural law. Considering the first point, Mr. McDonough established both the existence of the natural law and the distinction from the eternal law when he pointed out, “The natural law is the participation of the eternal law by rational creatures; it is the light of natural reason, as. it were, by which we discern what is good and what is evil.”
Further proof for the existence of the natural law was stated by the defender in the proof that if creation
E. Sisk
is acknowledged, it depends upon the Divine Wisdom to order all creatures effectively to their ultimate end, which can only be accomplished through the principles of the natural law.
“The natural law,” said the speaker in defense of its immutability, “is intrinsically immutable from the fact that it seeks to save the essential relations of things which arise from the very source of the natural order, and these relations are themselves immutable.”
As for the extrinsic immutability of the natural law, Mr. McDonough showed that God may not abrogate the natural law, because such an act would permit man to do evil.
In the third and concluding argument of the thesis the speaker stated the proof of the universality of the natural law by showing how such primary precepts arise from men’s nature as a rational animal, and because these infused essences are universal, every man is aware of such precepts—the natural law.
Formal objectors were James Blunt, William Botzum, Thomas Kavanagh, Jerome Ledvina, and Frederick Crollard who offered formal objections at intermittent times for the defender to answer during his proofs.
Ledvina and Crollard
Following this, the disputation took on the aspect of a mass public discussion group in which Robert McGrath served as director in answering objections from the audience at large. The amount and content of the public objections were so overwhelmingly large that they set up conclusive proof of the intense interest of the audience in the whole of the disputation. The shortness of time forced the popular public discussion to be finally terminated.
In his comments Monsignor Shannon struck a true note when he remarked that the disputants would carry one rare possession into life— a clear, organized conception of Thomistic Philosophy, and he emphasized the inestimable advantage of the atmosphere in which the participators had obtained their training.

Little Red Schoolhouse
The following editorial is taken in part from the Canisius Griffin of March 4, 1938. The text is self-explanatory and so we will go right into the meat of the editorial.
“It is not surprising to find publications printed by students of certain institutions of so-called higher learning copying the literary antics of conscienceless newswriters in printing calumnies and half-truths about reputable persons and revered traditions. The latest examples of collegiate slurs and slanders appeared in recent editions of the C. C. N. Y. Mercury and Quarterly. The vicious remarks were directed toward Catholic nuns and the Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.
“The City College of New York is an institution supported by the taxes of the citizens of that locality. This latest sample of unrestrained expression of polluted thought of students connected with this particular college causes little surprise. City College is a hot bed of juvenile Communism. It is a little RED schoolhouse. The students have learned their lessons well, and are now printing the lies and the prejudiced propaganda on which their minds have been fed. The sad part about the whole affair is that loyal Americans and true Catholics are paying taxes to produce such un - American and indecent scoundrels.
“When criticism is directed towards this type of depraved journalism, the cry is long and loud that the • freedom of the press is being oppressed. Freedom does not imply license. Freedom of the genuine variety is limited to the reasonable laws of truth and decency. The naughty young men on the staffs of the City College papers should begin to realize that honest Americans are sick and tired of the Moscow-methods corrupting the body of modern journalism. Americans want the truth, and nothing but the truth, even in student publications.”
IRISH PERFORMANCE WELL RECEIVED
The University Theater presented an Irish performance last night in observance of the feast of Saint Patrick. The program consisted of a number of feature acts, all of which were woven around the “Home Coming” celebration in honoi' of the return of two long absent but very successful sons of Ireland.
The scene of the play, in which all of the participants were bedecked in Irish costume, was set in a tavern in an Irish village and gathered there were the bosom friends of the returning voyagers. The revellers who were making merry sang many Irish songs. These included “I’ll Take You Back Again Kathleen” and “Danny Boy” sung by Morris Frank; “Where The River Shannon Flows” and “Father O’Flynn” by Benedict Murdock; “Tumble Down Shack In Athlone” by Frank Ciolino; “Rose of Trallee” by Mark Ertel; and the “Wearing of the Green” by John Gordon.
The two dance numbers given by Phil McPharlan were well received by the audience. Two other specialty acts included the recitation of “Shanahans Old Shabeen” by James Mer-rion, and the story of how Ireland was made by Harold Sitt.
Offer New Courses
The Department of Sociology recently announced five new courses for next year, which will be offered in addition to the courses listed in the present University catalog.
Two of these courses, “Population Problems” and “Immigration and Assimilation” will deal with the growth and distribution of population, including problems of quality and immigrant adjustment. Two will deal with primitive man, “Cultural Anthropology” studying the social life of Eskimos and other uncivilized tribes, while “Prehistory” will consider the recent archeological findings which throw light upon early man and his culture.
The . fifth course, “Sociological Concepts,” will consider some of the newer viewpoints in social psychology as well as general sociology. The course in “Social Research,” previously limited to sociology majors, will be opened up to students who plan on taking up graduate work in any field after receiving the A.B. degree. The introduction of these new courses will strengthen the program in general sociology which, in the last two years, has been made entirely distinct from the Graduate Curriculum in Social Work.

too much inclined to wander and reminisce and sentimentalize a bit. Nor was he exactly a Mr. Chips. But he had the precious faculty of stimulating his students to discover for themselves more than they could have hoped to get from a mere formal lecture with all of its bewildering array of notations and authorities and references and footnotes and general obscurity.”
Professor Engels finds that the best work of Charles Phillips is found in his prose. “I do not think that he 'was a great poet,” concluded Professor Engels, “but I do think that he was sometimes a good poet.”
The March issue of Columbia contained an article entitled “Why Catholic Criticism” written by Professor Hasley, also of the English department. Professor Hasley discusses the urgent need for a Catholic criticism and the initiative that should be exerted by Catholic editors, publishers and writers.
Professor Richard Sullivan, also of the English department, published an article recently. This was a sketch, “The Two Bears,” which appeared in a recent edition of Scribner’s.
Issue 'Scrip' Next Week
Charles B. Nelson, editor of Scrip, the University’s quarterly literary magazine, announced late this week that Monday morning has been set as the final deadline for submitting contributions to the third issue of the publication which will be released next Friday, March 25.

Green
No matter what you think of their food, you simply must give the dining hall head credit once in a while. Take yesterday for instance. Did you ever see such an effective color scheme? Cake with shamrocks, pistachio ice cream, green olives, green celery, green soup, green lettuce, green cherries in the fruit cocktail, green cabbage, green trimmings on the potatoes, etc., etc.

Sign of Spring
The other day on a window sill on the South Side of Sorin two newly cleaned pair of white shoes were drying in the Indiana sun.
Planned Economy
In a Senior hall Thursday night one of the boys turned off his lights at a quarter to ten and lit three candles. The idea, we are told, was to see what the prefect would say. In five minutes the prefect came stomping around on his evening check. He saw the candles and he wanted to know what the big idea was. Said the felow: “I just thought I’d save the University some electricity.”
•
Directory
And here’s a suggestion from one of our friends who does quite a bit of travelling during the summer vacation. This fellow says that many students find the directory helpful when they are stranded and want to find a classmate to cadge a meal or room. Our friend suggests that in addition to just the bare directorial facts of name and address there should be such useful information as type of accommodations available, quality and quantity of the food, peculiar habits, pet names, number of children (details on all female children over 16), number of cars, rising time in the morning, general hospitality rating, number of pets and do they bite, whether family is for or against Roosevelt, etc.
Members only
Several seniors, out for some much needed relaxation, went downtown to bowl. They tried the usual alleys and found them all busy. A Senior lawyer in the group suggested the Eagle’s club house on Michigan up near the hamburg joints. The others demurred at first because they did not know if it was on the list. Finally he won them over, and over they went. The alleys were busy so the
boys walked over to the bar to eat pretzels until one of the alleys was available. The senior lawyer looked the bartender in the eye and said, “I’ll have a bottle of Drewry’s.” The bartender gave him one of those disdainful looks and said, “Members only!” The senior lawyer thought a second and then said, “What kind of draft beer do you have?” The bartender looked at the: fellow for 15 seconds without speaking, gave him a dirty look, and said with a note of finality, “Members only!!!” The senior lawyer looked exasperated and a bit hurt. In a sincere voice he said very meekly, “Okay then, I’ll have a glass of members.”

Could she cut the steak?
We’re a bit skeptical about printing this item, but we feel that it is our duty to do so since it is another of those things that happens around here during the week. The item: It was reported to us that a girl ate dinner in the dining hall last Saturday night.
We would like to know the girl’s name so we could contact her for an interview on the food, the table manners of the boys, the conversation, and her general impressions.
Tonight
After weeks and weeks of all sorts of hullabaloo and propaganda the Bengal Bouts are finally here. If you want any kind of a seat you better be there early. Everybody’s going to be there: Students with maxima cum laudes, students with five deficiencies, just plain students, and fellows that just go to school here; laundry girls, town girls, girls from Dogtown, out of town girls, but no girls from across the way; professors, professors’s wives, professors’ children, and even some children of professors’ children; Dome cameramen, newspapermen, nightwatchmen, janitors, maids, street car conductors, business men, ex-convicts, (but not Mrs. Roosevelt nor Jimmy Braddock) timekeepers, referees, judges, seconds, sixteen fighters, Race, Kell, and the entire Scholastic staff.
Don’t miss it!

CAMPUS REACTION TO HITLER IS TOLD
•
The most talked up subject throughout the campus this week in regard to international affairs was Reichsfuehrer Adolf Hitler of Germany recent invasion into Austria.
The following students interviewed during the week expressed their opinions as follows:
Bob Egan, Senior, Walsh Hall:
“I think that it is a threat to world peace, not only to the peace of Europe but indirectly a threat to our policy of isolation in the world affairs. It will undoubtedly lead to the weakening of Czechoslovakia’s stand as a democracy which will lead to war in Europe in the very near future. It will be interesting to note Premier Mussolini’s action to this in regard to Hitler’s recent movement. As a result of Hitler’s movement into central Europe Mussolini will undoubtedly have more or less free sway in extending Italy’s influence around the Mediterranean.”
Tom Roche, Junior, Howard Hall:
“According to Major J. S. Barnes, eminent world traveler, he states that it is a good thing that Hitler did take Austria, because by that it detracted the thought of war with other countries for the time being. In other words Hitler’s recent march into Austria will cause an equilibrium to be brought about.
“The fact that Hitler and Mussolini are allies does not mean that this is the only way in which they can accomplish things together, but it is the only way that a dictator can remain in power. Looking from another angle at this situation, I think that this recent movement on Hitler’s part will stimulate a wide range of interest among the different college students in regard to international affairs.”
John Dwyer, Sophomore, Carroll Hall:
“I think that Hitler should stay out of Austria, because first of all he is breaking a pledge which says that Austria should have her freedom. Most of the residents along the northern border of Austria are Germans, and it is through their influence that the Austrians have given way. Hitler, encouraged by this success will next endeavor to take over Czechoslovakia, and will bring the continent to a point where war will be inevitable.”
John Murphy, Freshman, Brownson Hall:
“I think that without a doubt it will cause an international crisis. While England may protest they will take no action in Europe, but if Germany still persists in wanting colonies they will protest.

BASKETBALL BANQUET PLANS COMPLETE
•
Notre Dame Villagers are adding finishing touches this week’ to plans for their annual Basketball Banquet to be held Tuesday evening in the Columbia Club. Tim Galvin, Hammond, Ind. attorney and prominent alumnus, will act as toastmaster, it was announced this week by John Monahan, chairman of the banquet.
Speaking on the program to follow the dinner are Reverend Wendell Corcoran, C.S.C., pastor of St. Joseph’s parish in South Bend; Douglas Mills, head varsity basketball coach, University of Illinois; Tony Hinkle, head basketball coach, Butler university; Bill Fox, sports editor, Indianapolis News; Dick Miller, Indianapolis special sports correspondent; and Col. George Freyermuth, mayor of South Bend. Also mentioned as a guest of the Villagers was Adolph, the “ahpool” man, for 24 years unchallenged in making transactions and change by means of his deadly underhand lob.
A basketball autographed by all the members of the 1938 varsity basketball squad will be raffled off as a door prize.
Members of the Notre Dame squad will be presented by George E. Keo-gan, coach, who will also introduce coaches of local and nearby high school teams.
Tickets will be sold until the day of the banquet by members of the Villagers club.
Bookmen Meet
Rev. Charles Miltner, C.S.C., Dean of the College of Arts and Letters, addressed the Bookmen Wednesday evening. He chose as his topic, “The Problems of Democracy.” Father Miltner was of the opinion that democracy would be able to meet the strain being put upon it at the present time. !
At the: next meeting, to be held March 30, Frank Cunningham and Jim Gorman will address the club on “The Magic Mountain.” Prelimianry plans were drawn up for the Communion Breakfast to be held April 1.

Double Deal.
“Gosh, Roomie, she’s a honey! Nice blue eyes, wavy hair, has a little accent that gets you—and what a dancer!
“H-m-m. Sounds good. What did you say her name was?”
“I didn’t tell you her name, wise guy—I don’t know it myself, but she gave me her phone number and address, and told me to call her tonight before seven if I want a date. By the way, I can borrow that suit of yours that you had pressed, can’t I? I ripped the knee in my one-and-only, getting out of a cab this afternoon
“Borrow my suit? Well, I’d like to let you have it, Bill, but I’ve got a date myself tonight.”
“You have! That’s my luck—say, I’d better call her and tell her I won’t be able to get out tonight.”
“I’m going down to the booth— give me her number and I’ll give her a ring for you and fix it up.”
“O.K. Say, listen, tell her I got visitors from home or something like that, will you?—and tell her I’ll call her up tomorrow.”
In telephone booth: “Hello, who is this speaking? Jennie? How are you, Jennie? No, this isn’t Bill—it’s his roommate. Why didn’t Bill call? Why ... ah ... he was suddenly taken over to the infirmary—yeah, over to the infirmary. He won’t be out for a few days. No, it’s nothing serious—just a little touch of fever or something. He told me to call you and ask you if it would be O.K. for me to,substitute for him tonight —that is, if you don’t mind. You don’t. Fine. At eight in front of Spiro’s? See you then, Jennie. Goodbye now.”

You gullible watch out for this modification of the shell game promoted by the trio of Quinn, Don-nolly, and Mulhern. The gag is to have you give a number from minus 10 to plus 75 to one of the boys— the number unheard by the other two. Then one of the other two turns his back, and the one to whom you gave the number apparently puts two coins on a spread out newspaper. The fellow with his back turned is then told to look at the coins. He takes a quick look and snaps your number out. It’s uncanny, and Eli Abraham’s idea to put it on a profitable basis has possibilities.
Here and There.
A. walk down Walsh Hall’s second
floor the other night would have sent any educator home with question marks in his eyes. A heated game of “pick-up-sticks” was going on in Joe Moore’s room with Frank Prusha arguing with Al Butler over the fine rules point of whether or not one could pick off the red sticks with the black one. The radio, unheeded, was wailing out “The Spanish Cavalier” and someone was shadow-boxing over in a corner, a couple of crossword puzzlers were gnashing their teeth over a four-letter word for cucumber, and Don Currier was futilely trying to unmesh the intricacies of Public Utilities. College life in the raw! . . . One of the radio program’s fastgaining favor among the students is Mary Margaret McBride’s cooking talks “because,” as one lad explained it, “of her spontaneity and informal way of presenting her program.” A domestic science c-surse isn’t too far in the offing if this keeps us . . . Over in the library an apparently guileless lad has been asking the librarians for a musical dictionary. After the librarians spend a half hour or so looking for it, and then apologetically tell him that they can’t find one, he turns and walks out with a rather dejected look on his face . . . Last week

Jack Firth sent a shirt with a detachable collar to the laundry. Only the collar came back, and now Jack is afraid to send that in because only the shirt might come back, and you can never tell how long things like this might keep on going . . . The time will soon arrive when the seniors can go home and say to their fathers, “Pop, you’ve worked for me long enough—now you can get out and work for yourself.” That full moon you’ve seen rising out of Sorin sub is the pate of Burnett Calix Bauer, who had all the fuzz scraped off his head as a Lenten penance.
Burnett can now comb his hair with a towel . . . TONIGHT’S THE NIGHT! For the measly sum of two-bits this night you can witness 24 rounds of the fastest, cleverest boxing this side of the Rockies. Sixteen boys will be out there giving everything they have in both hands for a worthy cause. Joe Race and Paul Kell promise a brawl that will make the professional grunt-and-groaners look like a bunch of tea-sippers. So, if you haven’t a ticket as yet dig down for the price, and we promise the dividends you’ll get from it could incite a senatorial investigation. . . .

In Advance
THE SUCCESS of this year’s Bengal show has been assured before the first fighter steps into the ring tonight. Back in January work started to make these bouts what they are and the subsequent return thus far gives us reasonable hope that last year’s record will be beaten in a monetary sense. However the final returns from all districts have not been tallied as yet and we cannot speak with authority on that point. However we can speak with every emphatic authority when we express our indebtedness to those men who worked with us in making tonight’s bouts what they are.
Our deepest indebtedness goes to Mr. Frank Lloyd, without whose help the bouts could not possibly approximate the position that they occupy today. Our deepest thanks to him and to the Reverend Francis Quinn, C.S.C., of the Bengal Mission Band whose kind suggestions and aid helped us immeasurably.
Our three trainers, “Nappy,” Phil Walker, Ed Bros-coe have made the bouts what they are fistically. Since those first days in January when the training grind started Napolitano and his two assistants have supervised, developed, and brought along the sixty odd boys that entered the fights. Thanks to them you will see
the finest conditioned fighters that ever stepped into a Bengal ring. Thanks to them from The Scholastic.
Space limits us from adequately expressing our gratitude to the numerous other men who aided us. Charlie Callahan who filled Jim Waldron’s empty shoes admirably, McAllister whose valuable suggestions and aid gives us the set-up you will see in the gym tonight, the managers’ organization, an integral part of every athletic event at Notre Dame.
For adding a very definite goal for good sportsmanship to the bouts we thank “The Huddle,” campus candy store, for contributing the cup that will be awarded to the fighter who has exhibited the finest sporstmanship during the course of the bouts. Such things have added greatly to the bouts.
The remaining men we wish to thank are listed in the upper left hand corner of this page. Each and every one of them gets our heartiest thanks for aiding in presenting another great Bengal Boxing Show.
Justification?
COMMENTATORS on the recent German - Austria combination must accept one of two alternatives in explaining Hitler’s advances: either he had a perfect right to declare himself dictator over Austria in the way he did, or he was totally in error.	.
Those who accept the first premise attempt to argue that ex-Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg violated the Berchtesgaden agreement of February 12 by calling for a plebiscite to determine whether , or not Austria’s independence should be preserved. The 'Nazis further contend that the provisions of this plebiscite were designed to discriminate against the Nazi National-Socialist'party by placing the minimum voting age at 24 which would exclude a great number of the Austrian Nazis.
“Since fellow-dictator Schuschnigg'attempts to do such a thing,” if we may interpret Hitler, “he has broken our agreement, and, therefore, I have the right to take control of Austria, set up concentration,. camps there, purge Vienna, Innsbruck, and every other' piece of Austrian ground of Catholics and Jews, and, of course, all of this assumes that I will teach young Austrians my ‘big-apple’ —the goose step.”	'
But if this reasoning were true, broken agreements with Berlin would have justified an invasion of Germany^ a dozen times or more since Hitler has wielded the ruling^ • force; yet in those circumstances where Hitieri<cancelsX<J-such a treaty or agreement without the consent^ of other party or power, that, for the Nazis, is one of the ‘ all-inclusive liberties of a dictator.
If nothing else, the attempted justification of Hitler’s invasion of Austria on the grounds of a broken agreement materially demonstrates to every right thinking person that treaties and agreements are still “mere scraps of paper” for Hitler or any other dictator if the provisions become a future hindrance to other plans which are more advantageous.	■

Meeting a Challenge
“You do not often find young men and young women in our Catholic colleges reading a Catholic newspaper or magazine”—the ave maria, Feb. 12, 1938.
The Editor’s words imply both a rebuke and a challenge. The rebuke we do not wholly deserve; the challenge we take up, and pass on, by presenting a brief digest of articles that appeared in February issues of some Catholic magazines on our newsstand. February, as you remember, was Catholic Press Month.
AMERICA
Hilarie Belloc in Contending Forces That Are Clashing in France presents a brief survey of the facts underlying the forces that are striving for superiority in France today. He approaches this subject by pointing out the active stand the Church has always maintained with regard to moral principles involved in private property, wages, and work. Certain intellectuals throughout France have failed to bring to light the real meaning of the interest of the Church in the masses. (Feb. 6)
Father Martindale, S.J., a noted authority in the Classics and Scripture, turns his deep insight on the questions of the proletarian state. In A Proletarian State Does Not, Can Not Exist he reaches the Catholic viewpoint in an unusual manner. His version of the proletarian state might shock some people who think that such a thing exists. It is quite impossible to live up to the true meaning of the term on account of the political and economic attitudes of those who are in power to dictate such policies. The end of the proletarian state, which is Catholic, fails either in Capitalism or Communism, because the means used are definitely unorthodox. (Feb. 19)
In his article Are Men More Marvelous Than Mountains On The Sea John Moody, the man who typifies the ideal financier in the business world, departs from the material and rises to the spiritual level in his expression of man’s quest for happiness. A fellow passenger on a Caribbean cruise is overwhelmed by the beauty around him. Mr. Moody, in philosophical vein, clears up this bewildered attitude of inferiority by showing that
man, composed of body and soul, is superior to anything in inanimate nature. (Feb. 6)
Francis X. Connolly, in Words Beguile With Fictitious Meanings warns the reader of the fictitious use of words. Aptly propagandized articles become pursuasive unless the reader is able to read the real meaning between the lines. (Feb. 6)
Gault Macgowan, Neiv York Sun correspondent and a non-Catholic, defends the Catholic Church from attacks, of radical propagandists. His article Farewell Fifth Column! Long Live The Sixth Column1, paints a true picture of the happenings in Spain and at the same time omits the blood curdling episodes one has read elsewhere. (Feb. 12)
Thomas M. Gorman.
THE COMMONWEAL
In Maritain Looks at Franco, the conflicting opinions of this great philosopher’s interpretation of the Spanish situation are clarified by C. J. Eustace. A very good supplement to Mrs. Sheed’s lecture on Chesterton is the article by Henry P. Tunmore which examines G. K.’s handling of the essay both from the point of view of form and philosophy. (Feb. 4)
F. A. Hermens discusses Proportional Representation in a democracy. He claims that the utilization of this principle would have saved the Austrian government from the downfall for which it was heading. (Feb. 11)
Mary Small tells us all about the Great Wall in her essay Chinese Walls, but she does not stop here. She takes us all over China and in the course of the journey gives us a description of other walls not so famous but just as imposing. (Feb. 18).
Mr. Goetz A. Briefs: The Trend in Population: His analysis takes him into the realm of such topics of current interest as the effects of socialistic
teachings and changing standards of morality. (Feb. 18)
Francis J. Detscher
THE AVE MARIA
Katherine Yehle calls Dr. Alexis Carrel’s favorable comments about the miracles of Lourdes the “Concessions of a Scientist.” They are a departure from the traditional contempt which scientists have shown towards matters of faith and mystery. The publication of Man, The Unknown is “an especially shining target for the unreasoning men of reason.” (Feb. 5)
Katherine Burton, What is a Catholic Theatre? sees in the Catholic Repertory Theatre of New York the beginning of a Catholic Theatre Movement. It will be successful only if it follows a very broad meaning of« the word “Catholic” and avoids the “holier than thou” attitude which has infected similar movements. Any genuine play not contrary to Catholic principles would be good material. The author sees in the movement a tremendous weapon for breaking down prejudice in the minds of Protestants. (Feb. 12)
There is nothing inherently evil in a dictatorship. A dictatorship can organize society on the basis of Catholic principles. That much has been proved in Portugal. In Peaceful Evolution of a Dictatorship, Author Peter Pernes points out how Portugal has been saved sans revolution by Oliviera Salazar. The Portuguese system gives the dictator, elected by the people, absolute power for a seven year term. It still looks dangerous. The check and balance of powers is missing. (Feb. 19)
“The experience of business simply bears witness to the fact that God, who has created human nature, knows what works best for it.” This is the statement of James A. Magner, author of Business and Religion, who vividly explodes the theory that business is one thing and religion another. (Feb. 26)

THRILLING PRELIMS SET STAGE FOR FINALS OF 1938 BENGAL BOXING SHOW
TRACKSTERS TAKE IN BUTLER RELAYS
By Donald A. Foskett
They’ll be out there scrapping tonight—sixteen clever, hard-hitting battlers, who spent the first three nights of this week proving that the old story of “the survival of the fittest” still applies as strongly as ever to this grand old game of boxing. With an amazingly strong field of mittmen arrayed for the prelim-
inaries, tonight’s competitors hooked and jabbed their way down through the semi-finals—the greatest in Bengal history—and will appear in the big ring of the fieldhouse tonight as a typical group of Bengal finalists. To use an old, familiar phrase— “Enough said!”
Starting off hostilities tonight in the 118 lb. class will be two newcomers to the Bouts — Bill Beachel and Bob Sanford.
Sammy Dolce, defending champion, will oppose Vince Gurucharri in the 126 lb. class. Dolce, with his “windmill swing,” scored a first round technical K.O. over Jim Mc-Nerthney in the semi-finals, while Gurucharri took Tom Powers in a 3-round decision in the preliminaries.
The 136 lb. class brings together Tom O’Malley, 1936 finalist, and Norbert Schickel. O‘Malley beat Jim McNulty in the preliminaries, and then scored a technical K.O. against Charley Taylor in the semi-finals. Schickel took a decision from Mike Kelley in the prelims and repeated the stunt against Babe Putnam in the semi-finals.
In the 142 lb. class Jim Brown, defending champion, will fight Jim McGovern. Brown won from “Whitey” Melcher by a technical K.O., and took the decision from Paul Purcell in the semi-finals. McGovern beat Red Gower in the prelims and then went on to defeat Jim McNamara in a semi-final bout.
Ollie Helland, another defending champ, and Dick Leahy will tangle in the 147 lb. class. Helland defeated Tom Roach in the semi-finals, and Leahy beat “Slim” Thompson on the same night.
The 160 lb. bout brings together Vince Dollard, a veteran, and Bob Ronstadt. Ronstadt defeated Boh Blake in the prelims and then took over Charley Paterno in the semifinals. Dollard won over Harry John in the semi-finals.
Bruce Hebemstreit will meet Lloyd Harbert in the 175 lb. class. Heh-ernstreit beat Joe Semenczk in the semi-finals. Harbert won over Paul (Continued on Page 17)

Tracksters Win C. C. C.
Meet Easily
The 1938 Irish track squad strengthened its right to be called the greatest of all Notre Dame track teams, by sweeping the annual Central Collegiate Conference meet, held last Friday and Saturday in the local gymnasium, with an unparalleled score of 56 points. Pitt, placing second, could only score in five events for 24% points; Michigan State in third had 23, then came Marquette with 17, Drake with 10, Kansas State with 9, Wayne with 7%, and Michi-(Continued on Page 20)
Spurred by brilliant victories in the C.C.C. Meet last week, the Notre Dame track team is pointing at Indiana and Michigan as they journey to Indianapolis tomorrow for the Butler Relays. Indiana’s tremendous strength in the relays and some flashy Michigan sprinters promise plenty of trouble for Coach John P. Nicholson’s men.
Coach Nicholson says: “The older I get, the more firmly am I convinced that the psychopathic training of track men is as important as their physical training.” He goes on to say that the splendid results chalked up in the C.C.C. Meet, by such men as Greg Rice, Bill Clifford, and John Francis, may have a detrimental effect tomorrow. It seems track teams are seldom “hot” two weeks in a row. Although Nick says “we’re going to shoot the works,” he feels Michigan will win the meet.
In the individual events, the Irish specialists promise considerable pointage. Bill Mahoney and Bob Lawrence will probably handle the high hurdles. In the pole vault, Dan Gibbs, jumps have been superb this year, should win easily. He will be helped by John Dean and Hal Langton. Then, with Dan Gibbs in the broad jump, Bill Faymonville in the shot put, and Steve Coughlin, Bill Tucker and Bill Clifford in the sprints, the Irish should place in these events. Clifford is “running steady” according to reports, and should make a fine showing against the fleet-footed Hoosiers.
The mile relay, which promises to be spectacular, will probably include John Francis, Hank Halpin, Ed Bernard, and Bill Mahoney or Pete Sheehan. In the two mile, Greg Rice, Pete Sheehan, John Francis, and Curt Hestor will do the running. In the mile team race there is a possible choice of Jack Martin, Steve Szuma-chowski, Curt Hestor, Greg Rice, Bill Donnelly, Gene Gormley and John Francis. The Irish mentor says that both Rice and Francis can set a much faster pace than they have shown the spectators thus far this season.
Tentatively, the distance medley relay will find Halpin in the quarter mile, Hestor in the half, Francis in the three quarters, and Rice in the mile. When asked about this set-up Coach Nicholson said; “They’re good, but Indiana’s better.”

KELL - RACE ALL SET FOR MURDER
CAGERS CLOSE BRILLIANT YEAR WITH WIN OVER DETROIT TEAM; 45 TO 31
By "Joe Jab"
Dear Mark:
The big event is just around the bend. Tonight, the “Killer” that is Kell meets the “Racehorse” that is Race in the sudden-death bout for the Bengal rastlin’ title. There will be only one fall. The winner will be King for a year. If it is Race, he will indubitably retire as undefeated Champ. If Kell wins, he’ll probably be back next year to defend his laurels against some very good rastler.
Mgr. “Stoop” will be in Kell’s Korner. Kell’s last words to me was, “I’ll plant him (Race, of course) in the nickle bleachers.” That’s all the guy would say. He refused to tell just how this would take place. He didn’t reveal that he would spin Race like an autogiro or if he would make tht, toss like a hammer-throw that used to be an event in the field meets.
Race is very confident too, but he’s not subtil like Kell. He very bluntly admits that he will retire undefeated. We wanted to second the “Racehorse,” but he prefers to have his new mgr., Madame Conchita Cowals-ka, in his corner. This in itself will be a novelty — having a gal in a fighter’s comer. Well, one thing is a possibility, if the Mme. can’t give the “Racehorse” some pointers on winning, maybe she can give him some inspiration.

The Fighting Irish of Notre Dame closed their 1937-38 basketball season and nine seniors ended their varsity careers with a sparkling 45 to 31 victory over one of the finest University of Detroit teams in history. The game was one of the best ever played on the Detroit university’s floor. In keeping with
Spring Football Starts
Coach Elmer F. Layden issued his annual call for varsity spring football practice early this week. Some 200 candidates answered the call.
Freshman members of the team had been out two weeks previous at the first sign of thaw and are well moulded into shape at this writing. However, the same cannot be said of the varsity men, and Layden and his assistants will have work on their hands getting them into shape and finding suitable\replacements for the many star seniors graduating in June.

The final fight of the evening will see Johnny Cavalier meeting Bob Schorsch in the heivyweight division. Cavalier won from Wied-locher in the prelims and then took Bucky Ryan into camp. Schorsch defeated Larry Petrosius in the prelims and followed up with a win over Phil Dahar, ex-champion.
all of their recent performances, the Irish were bested in scoring in the early part of the game, trailing by five points at one time, but finally came up to take the lead at the half by three points, 21 to 18. In the second half, however, the Irish took complete control of the proceedings. All of the first stringers began scoring and ran up 24 points while tightening up their defense to hold the Titans to 13 points.
Johnny Moir added ten points to his total with five field goals. Moir’s record for three years is 780 points, a new Notre Dame scoring record. This mark was 233 points better than the old one made by Ed Krause. Every point Moir made this year—and he made 230 — increased the record margin.
The two Irish guards, Tommy Wu-kovits, and Earl Brown, followed Moir in scoring with nine points each Bob Calihan of Detroit scored as many points as Moir but six of his ten were made with free throws.
The victory was the 20th of the season for the Irish out of 23 encounters. The veterans on the team have compiled an amazing record of 62 victories out of 70 games in the last three years.

SPLINTERS FROM THE PRESS BOX
FENCERS END SEASON AT ST. LOUIS
By John F. Clifford
FOR BENGAL
Aside from the fact that tonight’s finals of the Bengal Bouts will produce the greatest exhibition of give-and-take warfare seen in these parts since the Pitt game of last fall, those boxing fans who attend the Bouts tonight will be •helping to support the Bengal Missions conducted by Notre Dame in India. The Bouts have always had, since their inauguration seven years ago, the two-fold purpose of stimulating an interest in boxing among the students (with the possible formation of an Irish varsity boxing team in the not-too-distant future) and helping to make possible a new chapel or hospital in the wilds of the Indian jungle. It is our sincere hope that the 1938 Bouts will prove as successful financially as the preliminaries indicated their success in the realm of sport, so that this second purpose may be more fully realized.
We are already represented by a ping-pong team, a hand-ball team, and a hockey team in the intercollegiate field. Perhaps some day the Board in. Control of Athletics at Notre Dame will smile benevolently on the efforts of the Scholastic and all others who have helped in promoting and encouraging a campus-wide interest in student boxing, and give boxing a minor sport rating. With over 75 answering the call for training for one tournament, a boxing team would not be wanting in candidates. The Rockne Memorial should be able to supply the needed training facilities, and “Nappy” Napolitano and his assistants have demonstrated that Notre Dame need not go outside its own domain for coaching talent. If ping-pong matches are possible, surely Notre Dame, the school of the Fighting Irish, should be able to schedule intercollegiate boxing matches!

MAULING MASTODONS
Reports from the training quarters of Joe Race and Paul Kell indicate that this “Beef Trust” has already made the Conners-Tancredi act as docile and playful as a couple of kittens. These artists of the Grunt-and-Groan have a program ready tonight that will bring down the house. In Race’s corner a Miss Conchita Cowalska, the Belle of the Sunday P.M. Swing Sessions, will cheer her “beeg, strong boy” on to inglorious victory. Killer Kell has acquired the services of Big Stoop as his (man) handler during the fracas. Race, defending Champ, has promised to go the limit to retain his title this year.

HIGH LIGHTS
When Greg Rice stepped off his new record of 9:19.6 in the two mile during the C.C.C. meet last Saturday he ran the last quarter in the same time that Glenn Cunningham took for his final quarter in his 4:04 mile at Dartmouth— 60.2. He did the first mile in 4:42 and the second in 4:35 . . . Regulation Golden Glove 10-ounce boxing mitts will be used in the Bouts tonight. The ring has been donated by the Studebaker A.A... Nick has his share of temperamental athletes on this year’s squad: Ed Beinor had a pulled tendon for the C.C.C. meet but ended up with a first place and his best heave of the year in spite of his “handicap.” Greg Rice had everything from stitches to shin splints before his record-smashing two mile performance. . . . Coach Jake Kline is expecting big things from his sophomore candidates for his baseball nine this spring. He has had two working out with the first infield already. . . . The members of this 1938 track squad have accounted for new records in five of the indoor events during their varsity careers at Notre Dame—mile, two mile, 880, 60, and pole vault. . . . Bill Faymonville eats about a half a dozen candy bars an afternoon when he is competing in the shot put, putting a terrific toll on Adolf’s profits for the day.
The 1938 edition of the Notre Dame fencing team will close the books Saturday night at St. Louis when they wind up a very prosperous season against the Washington University Bears. Writing their last chapter for Notre Dame will be Captain Zerbst, Mercado, de la Vergne, and Mahoney who in the past eight weeks have parried the Irish to a record of six wins and only two defeats.
In order that these veteran swordsmen may make their last appearance in Gold and Blue a memorable one, Coach de Landero has promised that they will bear the brunt of battle against the Bears.
From St. Louis comes word that Coach Alex Solomon of Washington will have a strong front-line defense to throw up against the Irish. Leading the attack will be Captain Harold Abrams, novice foil champion of the St. Louis district, and flanking Abrams will be two well-tried campaigners, Bob Shotliff, and Wayne Will-man. Besides this big three the Bears will rely on Carl Lattner, a veteran returning to school after a year’s absence, and Sophomore Bob Huffolst who also can hold his own in first class competition.
The Washington team is particularly strong in the sabre event, and only a few weeks ago trounced a very good Illinois sabre quartet 4 to 0. Consequently, Zerbst, Scarlata, and Gavan will need all their stuff to get past the Bears. If the sabre-men can come up to top form Coach de Landero will have no hesitation in placing his chips on his boys, providing also—that the epee and foil teams keep on improving. However, past experience proves that whenever a member of the coaching profession does not actualy come out with a “They’re too strong for us,” or “It looks rather hopeless,” the chances are he is more than hoping for a victory. And so the Irish fencers ought to bring back another success story to round out the last pages of their ’38 edition.
Nine men will entrain for St. Louis. Captain Zerbst, Scarlata, and Gavan to compete in sabre; Mercado, de la Vergne, and McEneamey in the foils; and Graham, Colgan, and Mahoney in epee. If this array is not sufficient to stop the onrush of the Bears, Coach de Landero will have to lend a hand himself. This will be hardly necessary, howover, since winning their last meet means a great deal to the seniors and they will perform in the clinch just as well as all, in the succession of de Landero coached teams, have done.

Brushing Up

Bits About the Bouts
Max Marek, the honorary referee for the Bengal Bout finals tonight, was a finalist in the 1933 Golden Gloves in Chicago. He won his bout against New York’s representative and then beat a boy from Ireland in the International Golden Gloves. Maxie fought under the CYO colors and was awarded a scholarship to Notre Dame by that organization. College life did not agree with Max, and after two years here he left school to try his hand in the professional fight game.
Max was crowned heavyweight king of Illinois a short time after turning pro. He recently relinquished the title to Harry Thomas. The latest fight Marek engaged in was against Pal Silvers of Brooklyn whom he decisioned in 10 rounds. One of Max’s chief claims to distinction is that he has beaten Joe Louis ... he turned the trick in the 1932 national AAU bouts in St. Louis.
The referees in the prelims were Georgie Nate and George Van Der Hey den. Nate was 10th ranking bantamweight in 1931. Van Der Heyden won the 126 lb. Golden Glove championship in 1933. Van then entered the International bouts as a member of the Chicago team and KO’d his opponent from Ireland.
Judges for the prelims were Frank Coughlin, ’20, and Bill Sheehan, ’25. Director of Athletics Elmer Layden and Coaches Boland, Grant, Benda, and Cerney were interested spectators Monday night. (Probably looking for backfield candidates.)
Rime without resin: The opening night crowd was perhaps the largest in the history of the bouts—but the One-Eyed-Connelly’s cut down the gate considerably. Advance reports indicate that tonight’s crowd will be another record-breaker. The question of the day: who’s going to get the Sportsmanship trophy which the Huddle donated. Joe Jump, the lone Indian representative in the bouts, lost to Vic Vergara on Monday . . . Joe floored Vic in the first minute of fighting, but V e r g a r a finished strongly to get the nod . . . the bout was a thriller and the crowd responded accordingly. Some of the contestants found out after the opening bell that getting into condition is not a simple matter of working out two days in advance.
Faux Pas: The following excerpt from the Des Moines Register has nothing to do with the Bengal Bouts, but it does provide some comic-relief . . . (we hope):
“Some of the fans who heard the broadcast of the games in the recent
DE LANDERO'S MEN
VHN MATCH
•
Notre Dame tallied a victory over Cincinnati last Saturday night. With three veterans making their last home apeparance they slashed out a 12-5 triumph. These veterans, who led their team to its sixth victory in eight starts, are: Capt. Jack Zerbst of sabre fame, and the two mainstays of the foils—Pierre de la Vergne and Vic Mercado.
Banishing all fear of a letdown after a series of victories, Captain Zerbst stepped in to open the tourney with a 5-1 victory over McCowen. Keeping pace, Scarlata slashed out 5-0 victories over Bucher and McCowen. Zerbst came back to make it unanimous by a 5-0 victory over Bucher to give the Irish a 4-0 lead.
Following the example the epee men gave good accounts of themselves. Graham worked on Griffith for a 2-1 win. McEnearney nosed out a 3-2 victory from Goshorn and was followed Colgan’s net of 2-0 over Griffith. Guerin lost the last bout to Goshorn 2-1.
In foil the Cincy boys began to bear down. Mercado and de la Vergne both were downed by 5-4 scores, by Griffith and Goshorn respectively. McEnearney reversed the proceedings, however, by a sweep of 5-0 over Alexander. Harris also came through with a 5-4 victory over Griffith and Sayia followed with a 5-3 victory over Alexander. Colgan defeated Griffith 5-4, but Goshorn evened that up with a victory over Harris by the same score. Leising closed the meet with a 5-1 victory over Alexander, thus giving Notre Dame her final tally of 12.
The outstanding event of the evening was the performance of the Irish sabre men in completely dominating the team from Cincinnati. Captain Zerbst was touched only once in his two bouts, and Scarlata and Gavan were touched only once in their single bouts.
Coach de Landero used as many as 12 men during the evening, and all but two of them scored for the Irish. Captain Zerbst, Colgan, and McEnearney scored two points apiece to lead the attack.
For Cincinnati Goshorn was outstanding, scoring four points out of the five made by the visitors.
girls’ tournament had a good laugh when the announcer said: ‘Dorthy Soandso, a substitute, is going in. No she isn’t, she forgot her slip.’ He referred, of course, to the slip of paper the substitute carries to the scorer, giving the latter her name and the name of the player to be displaced.”
Interhall Volley Ball
With all lights on the “Bengals” little was done this week toward the interhall volley ball tourney. Practices were held by the various halls and the teams began to take shape for the games starting next week.

(Continued from Page 16) gan Normal, Butler, and Western State each with 6.
Aftei- the first three events, the pole vault, the shot put, and the mile run, the Irish had 28 points—more than enough to win the meet. In piling up these points, the men in blue and gold won all three events, and altogether took 7 out of 15 possible places. Gibbs vaulted 13 feet to win,, with Dean and Langton in part of a triple tie for second. Francis strode in easily ahead of Southworth of Butler, and Rice, winning the mile in 4:20.2, while Beinor made his greatest heave of the season, 47 feet, 7% inches, to win the shot put by an inch over Faymonville. Notre Dame scored at least three points in every event but the low hurdles, taking four firsts, five seconds, three thirds, two fourths, and two fifths.
Johnny Woodruff, Pitt’s Olympic champion, was the highest individual scorer, winning the 440, the 880, and anchoring the first-place mile relay team; but Notre Dame’s Greg Rice came through with the most outstanding single performance, winning the two-mile run in new gymnasium and meet record time of 9:19.5, despite a severe “stitch” in his side. This was his best time for the two-mile since his 9:14 race at the N.C.A.A. Meet in Los Angeles last June. In the mile, Rice was under orders to run for second place behind Francis, but Southworth of Butler passed him suddenly on the home stretch and beat him out for second place by about a foot, as Greg came through with his finishing kick just a little too late.
In the sprints, Greer of Michigan State and Bill Clifford of Notre Dame established themselves as the best dash-men in the Middle West, with Greer’s :06.2 final heat being just a little too fast for Clifford to match. In the high hurdles, Woodstra of Michigan State tied the meet record of :07.5, taking first place, while Lawrence and Captain Bill Mahoney of the Irish placed fourth and fifth behind him. Johnny Woodruff just beat Carr of Marquette in the 440 yard run in :50 flat, with Pete Shee

han tightening up on the last straightaway and barely taking third ahead of McKee of Pitt. Shurilla of Marquette beat Woodstra of Michigan State in the low hurdles in :07.2, with no Notre Dame men getting as far as the finals. Bennett of Pitt won the high jump at 6 feet 2% inches, with Sophomore Ted Leonas in a triple tie for second, ahead of world indoor record holder Burke of Marquette.
The half mile was probably the most interesting race of the day, with Johnny Francis setting the pace all the way and losing to Johnny Woodruff on the last straightaway by so slight a margin that both men were caught in the same time—1:54.3. This was 9/10 of a second slower than Francis’ winning time against Indiana last month. The mile relay was run off in two time-heats, with Pittsburgh beating Marquette in the first and Notre Dame beating Wayne in the second. According to comparative times, Pitt was declared the winner in 3:21.5, Marquette second in 3:23, Notre Dame third in 3:25.7, Wayne fourth in 3:26, and Butler fifth in 3:26.7. The Drake team which beat Notre Dame two weeks ago to tie the meet in Des Moines at 52-52 finished very poorly, coming in last in the second heat.

giving them the run-around. They have been wanting to know just who is going to win. Like if I really knew would I tell anyone but go and lay a nice bet on the sure-winner. It should not be tough to pick a winner though. “Punch ’em Paul” has been working extra hard. He’s drawn thin for tonight and is in fine fettle to grapple with the “Racehorse.”
We don’t know just how good the “Racehorse” will be without his ex-mgr, “You-Can’t-Rob-Us” Kovalcik, in his corner. “Our Boy” is not exactly a brain-truster, and sometimes he needs a little guidance that maybe the Mme. can’t give him.
And so you can record us as pickin’ “Killer” Kell over “Our Boy” Race.
With the Mme. in Race’s corner anything is liable to happen tonight. We fear for the worst. Matter of fact, we don’t expect to sit in our customary press box reservation. We don’t want to be catchin’ either Race or Kell as one or the other comes floating like a fly ball into center field.
Kell’s threat or promise, however, of pitchin’ the “Racehorse” into the nickle bleachers doesn’t make any seat exactly a safe one.

POETRY
A Sonnet Written November 11, 1937, by Amy Brook Maginnis: A breathless cry against the cruelty of November toward a soft summer. The poet achieves through a fine use of imagery and contrasting color words a very definite feeling of the forlomess that is November’s when “summer’s yellowing form. . . . lies pierced with sudden wounds of mortal red.” The poet leaves us a little chilled. (America, Feb. 12)
Physicist in the Snow, by Marshall Schacht, through a well chosen use of sensuous words, creates a gentle yearning to return to our childhood days when we looked at the beauty of things, the snow, and bothered not to look beneath for the tawdry, the earth. (The Commonweal, Feb. 4)
Valentine, by John Robert Quinn. Here we meet such a richness of imagery that we ignore the thought and take delight only in the sensuous gratification that it offers. The poem is almost as gusty as the month (February); yet there is interwoven a delicacy that is quite pleasant, best expressed by the line:
Warm throated winds embrace And leave their kisses in the blushing air.”
(The Commonweal, Feb. 18)
Portrait of My Mother, J. Corson Miller, evades the ever present danger of mawkishness in this subject and writes a truly gracious poem. The thought is one that carries its own emotion; hence the poet concerns himself with capturing a delicacy of phrase that is very effective. The whole thought of the poem is in the line: “The face that dreamed of me ere life was mine.” (The Ave Maria, Feb. 5)
