This issue of the Scholastic is a special issue devoted en­
tirely to the arts within the University community. Creative 
activity on this campus has, in the past, gone relatively un­
heralded. Within the practicing artists' circles, there is excite­
ment and enthusiasm. But the circles do not spread very 
wide, and most of the community is simply mis-uninformed. 
Consequently, artists and their work are held in a kind of 
uneasy suspicion not unlike common attitudes towards alchem­
ists, revolutionaries, or ordinary useless bums. It may be a 
dubious endeavor to popularize an essentially profound and 
highly disciplined activity in a magazine. Notre Dame turns its 
attention to art next week however, when the Mid-America 
College Art Association and the Society for Photographic 
Education will hold conferences on the Notre Dame campus. 
In an attempt to pursue the arts in a more than casual way 
on a popular level and to complement the upcoming confer­
ences, the Scholastic publishes this selected portfolio of the 
recent works of artists in our community. 
This portfolio was selected from the works of current stu­
dents and faculty members from the Art, English, and Music 
Departments of the University of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's 
College. The performing arts have not been included for 
obvious reasons. Architecture is another story for. another time. The portfolio includes music, traditionally a perforf!ling art, because of the general lack of awareness of that depart­ment's activities, and because music since John Cage has become conceptua!ized enough that it can be more or less reproduced graphically alongside the other arts. The selection of the pieces for publication was done by the artists them.: selves, their teachers, and by the Scholastic. The basic cri­terion used in selecting from the works reviewed was exemplary quality, with an emphasis on the experimental (somewhat syn­onymous with expressiveness). The final selection for publica­tion was often more pragmatic, dealing with magazine produc­. tion. The portfolio is intended neither as a comprehensive survey of the work of all the community's artists, nor as a compilation of the "very best work." Space, budget, and logistical considerations prohibited the former, and obvious philosophical considerations prohibited the latter. Rather, the portfolio is a limited collection of work presented to the com­munity. It is hoped that our readers will familiarize themselves with the work of some of the artists whose work appears in this portfolio, and will pursue a newfound interest in all the 
artists' activities in the community. 
The separation of photography from the plastic arts is 
purely arbitrary, consistent with the distributive nature of next 
week's conferences. The reproductions of the visual arts and 
of music in the portfolio are not intended as surrogates for 
the· originals. They are more like indications: a visit to a 
gallery or a concert is certainly more worthwhile. Only certain 
forms of literature and some lithographs are truly legitimate 
in print. 

The Scholastic is indebted to Dr. Thomas S. Fern, John 
David Mooney, Richard Stevens, Jim Dyer, of the .Notre Dame 
Art Department; to Sr. Rose Ellen Morrissey, H. James Paradis, 
Jim Raymo, Kathy McDonnell, of the Saint Mary's Art Depart­
ment; Mark Sears of the Notre Dame Music Department; the 
artists, and many others for their co-operation and help in 
assembling this special issue.

HERMENEUTICS OF AN ARTIST 
What is it that makes the artist a unique individual in society? While the arts are readily accepted by society and held to high value, it remains that the artist is an alienated individual. One may consider the environment of Notre Dame's community and its artists (presumably held in estrangement) as a microcosm of society at large. Surely, I hold this to be a true surrogate of the artists' dilemma here. A further discussion pertaining to this problem requires examination of the artist himself, his artistic education, and finally, the artist in ·relation to his environment. 
The artist is the epitome of the quest of every sensitive and concerned person. To proclaim oneself as an artist, one must accept the basic premise of the quintessential human dichotomy: that one exists both as an individual and social being. This proposes many difficult problems to the artist. Con­sidering he is an individual seeking self-discovery, yet still in an alienated state, how does he 'fulfill that activity? 
Indeed, it is a wonder that present society has created the artists it has. This, of course, relates to the educational process that alone stifles the creative acts of children today. A strong statement, perhaps, but consider the point that modern democ­racy has shown a total incapacity to distinguish between genius and talent. Today's technological society insists upon this: that talent is of greater value than genius. Man is a genius by the mere fact that he is a human being. Individually and collectively, I believe we have lost sight of the basic order these qualities present themselves while it would be redundant to state that we no longer uphold men to the position of genius. 
Genius is an inherent activity that is a necessary condition for talent. It is the action of turning one's mind, one's body, in the end, one's actions to anything one fails to understand. Another definition of genius is actually mere research. Isn't it true that a young child has an insatiable appetite for this ac­tivity? Why does it stop? 
Modern society holds talent as more efficient and less questioning since once one attains a large degree of talent, one becomes secure and complacent. 
The artist does not lose sight that genius is a prerequisite to talent. He is constantly asking questions, even if the answers are not completely known. His mind is Cartesian, his actions are seemingly absurd. 
Duchamp claims that art has absolutely no existence or veracity as truth with regards to the artist. No matter what the artist thinks he is doing, something completely independent of what he intended is the result. That result is, as a consequence, grabbed by society. Dammit, the artist doesn't count. The subsequent result is found in the limbo of art historians' judg­ment. And possibly the fate of the artist. 
A possible solution to this problem lies in art itself. Per­haps art should be a piece of reality itself rather than inter­pretations of reality. This philosophical question has permeated the works of major philosophers. Plato, whose ideas were later 
-articulated further by Marx, held that art impedes the transfor-

DIANA.AT LAKESIDE 
She stands in tan-warm twilight; still as the softskinned lake she's watching, one knee casually bent, 
as if those trim sun-seasoned legs had not been grown to tangle with a lover's legs, untangle, then wrap him tightly in. 
Her hair carved down to her shoulders like a brown-gold bell leaves not a wisp for the wild wrestle when mouth and hands storm, dishevel.

PARABLE 
I. Aaro"n Mahoney, all·knew, was a fine magician, a prestidigitator ·of-the first rank: Besides, he had a noble name. At least this 
,· much was certain. His act had been a success from the start, , in particular his breath-taking finale, wherein he locked one of h~s -assistants (pretty) into a cabinet and, wham bango, with a few calculated flicks of his wand, converted said maiden into a tree. This was all the more amazing because Aaron publicly denied any magic at all, and attributed his success to sleight of hand. Speculation on the reasons behind Aaron's claim be­came a popular pastime. Some maintained that his posture was a clever tactic in reverse psychology, that, .by pretending that his act was all mechanical, the curious would be induced to poke further and further into those mechanics and, when sufficiently exhausted, they would be forced to admit the x-variable of magic that Aaron had known of all along.

EROS 

The scene: Madison· Square Garde_n. Cardboard photographs of Keith Richards and Mick Taylor playing guitar, Charlie Watts playing drums, and Bill Wyman playing Bass, -stand in front of an imposing wall of buzzing· amplifiers. Center stage, in front of the cardboard Stones, is a bed upon which Mick Jagger and Bianca de Macias are making love. Mick cautiously pulls his head out from underneath the covers. 
The audience bursts into wild applause and cheering. The Rolling Stones! We want the Stones. YEA! AAHRAA! Nine­teenth Nervous Breakdown! 
Mick jumps out of bed. The audience is simply going wild. Mick pulls on his pants. SATISFACTION YOU MOTHERS! 
Mick's fly is stuck. . The audience reaches a peak of frenzied excitement rarely achieved in the Garden. 
Mick raises his right arm above his head as if to signal the band to start. · · · 
A nude thirteen. year old hippie chick is jumping up and down in front of the stage screaming; "_Mick, oh Mick! Please Mick!" 
The Stones explode into "Little Queenie." The audience, as if propelled by the explosion, surges to-. ward the stage. 
Go Go Little Queenie! . With an ins~ne desire· to have the Rolling Stone;, the audi­ence pours on.to the stage. · Whoa! Bet your mamma never saw you bite like ·that! The nude ~3 year old hippie ctiick is the ·first to.fake Mick down.· 
Mick only smiles knowingly. "Oh_ Mick I've always w~nted to· come." "What else can a poor boy do except sing for a rock'n' roll band." · 
The scene: Night. A room on the top floor of a nigh-class, big city hoteL Mick ·and -Bianca are sitting up in bed watching television. Apparently a western is on the screen, for the shouts of Indians, the rifle fire of cowboys, and the sound of running horses can be heard. Mick and Bianca seem to be enjoying the show. They, are both very excited, glued to th·e set and frequently jump up and passionately shout words of encourage­ment to those on the tube. "Go get 'em you bloody droogs!" 
"Yee Ha! Bang! Bang!" After several minutes of this exciting cowboy and Indian stuff, the sound of an airplane passes slowly overhead. What sounds like a falling bomb catches the attention of Mick and Bianca. "What the hell could that be?'! 
There is an enormous crash and a _human body falls through _the ceiling. 
"Holy shit!" Through the settling dust, a man dressed in_ a white jump suit and crash helmet can be seen rolling amid the rubble, laughing uncontrollably. ·· · 
Being quite shocked, Mick and Bianc~ are, for several minutes, 

at a loss for words. . This laughing human bomb eventually ,is_ able to pick him­self up. Still laughing he brushes himself off, which causes yet another dust storm. 
"Well, God Damn!" "Ha!· Ha! Ha! Woo Ho Ho Hee Hee Hi there," the Laughing Bomber manages to squeeze out: 
Mick and Bianca look at ·each other, grin. and shrug their shoulders.­The Laughing Bomber, seeing that Mick and Bianca· don't 
· seem_ to be very upset by his: fall through the ceiling, de­·Cides to make himself more at home. He_ struts across the ·room and sits next to Bianca on the bed. 

. Mick and Bianca are a bit perplexed by these events, yet they stillrnove_ over in order to make room for the Laughing Bomber. "Cowboys and Indians, well, that should be fairly exciting." Mick -and Bianca look at the Laughing Bomber with mild dis­
-dain and shake their heads. 
"No?" 
"Well, I guess it can be at first, but it gets pretty old.'.' . 

-"Yes, I know what. you mean." . Mick and. Bianca grunt .an ac_knowleagement. .. . .. ''Ha! Ha! WeH,; I don't have.-to rely _on TV for_ excitement.'.' 
Pause.· Mick_ and Bianca turn towards·_eac::h other, embrace, laugh, and begin to make love. 
_-"Well, God Damn!" the Laughing Bomber, being quite cur­ious, turns off the TV _and settles .back to watch. 

The scene: Mick, Bianca and jhe Laughing Bomber are sitting in bed as. before. The mess from the hole in the ceiling has been cleaned up. Through_ the hole one sees ·that it is now . day. -"You two certainly seem to' have had a good time.'' "Oh xea, it· was really exciting." · _ 
"Do yoll often have E!Xciting times?" "Sure, all the time.", . . . '.'.No shit?" ,"Wow.''. 
Pause. 

-"To tell you the truth, not oniy do l ball Bianca here, but ralso sin£! in a rock'~' rolr band and.•get rap~d by 13 year old hippie· chicks. Exciting times? _l'v~ never tieard of anything that can beat it."

"Well, it does sound pretty good. But personally; I've never heard of·anything that can beat jumping out of an airplane. Let me tell you-when you jump out of that hatch without a chute and all the urine in your bladder just shoots to the top of your stomach like on the biggest roller coaster ever conceived, well-it's the COSMIC RUSH of all time." 
"Oh wow! It sounds fantastic. You do it very often?" "All the time." "No shit?!?" "No· shit!" "Too much!" 
During the preceding conversation, Mick, Bianca, and the Laughing Bomber had all become quite excited by each other's explanations of what they did for excitement. Mick and· Bianca both had gotten up and knelt and bounced around on top of the bed. The Laughing Bomber even went so far as to get out of the bed in order to better demonstrate how his urine ·shoots into his stomach. But now, the three ·calm dowri a bit. They 
·.lay back and contemplate the gloriously exciting lives which they claim to live. · Mick thinks abouL what· a drag singing and balling had be­come for him recently.

He ·wants to know that COSMIC RUSH. Bianca thinks about what a drag it has been for her recently.· Always balling the same old rock'n' roll .star.

"Oh, nothing much. You?" 
"You tell me first. I asked first." "Until you dropped through the ceiling the other day, there was nothing I desired and didn't ~ave. r couldn't imagine being fulfilled by anything other than balling, singing, and being worshiped by little children. All my desires were being satis­
. fied. I can't really explain it, I know I'll always want to sing and fuck. I just want something more. What I really want fo do is jump out of an airplane." 
"You know I really think I know what you mean. Until the other day when I fell through your ceiling, I also wanted to do nothing except jump out of airplanes. Oh God! The thought of it. Falling through the air-the chill racing down your spine-that incredible moment when you smack into that old Mother Earth. I aways thought that it was the most fantastic experience any man could have. But, like you, I really don't understand why, I want some new excitement. I want to sing in a rock'n' roll band. I want to ball the lovely Bianca here and get raped by young children. At this time that's all I want." 
Pause "I ·would imagine that this situation would be fairly easy to shape to our liking." 
"I couldn't agree more." "Have any suggestions?" "Trade places. Let's do it right now." "ls it so simple?" 
"I don't see· why not." "Well, I'm ready." Bianca raises herself out of bed and clasps her hands in front of herself in a gesture of great joy. 
"I'll give you my jump suit and crash helmet. You can climb through the hole in the ceiling and have your first practice jump off the roof of this hotel. Thirty stories is just high enough for you to really dig it." 
"And you can just climb into bed and ball to your heart's con­tent." "That's great.· What can I say?" 
"Right on!" Let's drink to the hard-working people Let's drink to the lonely at birth Raise your glass to the good and the evil Let's drink to the salt of the earth 
Sing the Rolling Stones in "The Salt of the Earth." This· sound provides the backround music from the point after Mick's last line to the end of this little story. 
The Laughing Bomber takes off his jump suit and crash helmet and gives them to Mick, who because of his great excitement, experiences a little difficulty putting on his new clothes. Bianca's lewd overtures have gained the better part of the Laughing Bomber's attention. As a result, Mick's struggle with the jump suit becomes even more difficult when Mick can't find help when he asks how a jump suit should be worn. Mick, finally ready, climbs the handy ladder which someone thought to place nearby and is quickly through the hole in the ceiling. He smiles and waves good-bye. Both Mick and the Laughing Bomber immediately start running. They dive-Mick off the roof. He screams. The Laughing Bomber onto the bed-He tears Bianca apart.

Abide with Me, excerpt 
based on Protestant melody Abide with Me, Brock S. Burroughs. 
Kyrie 

_ Although represent the performing areas of music more than I do those of the composer, I find that anyone working in composing or performing new music today has a range of choices with regard to techniques and materials. Thus, -one may write music which uses traditional musical materials in tradi­tional ways, one may write music which uses non-traditional materials in non-traditional ways, or one may write music in 
-_ some combination of these two. My_ "composition" employs traditional materials in the form 
· of specified musical pitches for singers and organ, with random-pitched percussion instruments, and deals with a most traditional text-"Kyrie." The techniques of using them, how­ever, are non-conventional. The time factor is organized by five-second units, rather than by the more usual metrical rhythm. Thus, musical events have no set time values, in the sense that we usually think of quarter notes, eighth notes, etc., but are governed by elapsed time on a stopwatch. 
Despite its appearance on the page, this composition leaves no more to chance in the performance than a more traditional piece does; in fact, it is quite specifically structured. All the musical events are carefully ordered, but the notation used to achieve these events is non-traditional.

THE SCHOLASTIC 


The following conversation with Notre Dame poet John Mat­thias is taken from an interview by Patrica Fenian for the Memorial Library "Newsletter." Mr. Matthias' poems in the portfolio section are from his new book, Turns, referred to in the interview and to be published by the Swallow Press. 
Question: Robert Duncan has written of you as follows: "In part he is a goliard-one of those wandering souls out of a Dark Age in our own time, a Jack-of-all-trades mind, carrying with him as he goes in his pack of cards certain key cards that come ever into his hand when he plays: the juggler (as he was to be portrayed later in the Tarot), the scholar whose head is filled with the fame of learning and of amorous women, and the heretic remembering witch-hunts yet to come." Does that seem to characterize you, or is it really a kind of parody of your position as a poet? 
Answer: It was very generous of Duncan to write that. For a book-blurb, in fact. I don't think it's a parody of my position, but it's perhaps a more accurate description of Duncan himself than it is of me. 
Question: What are you working on now? Are your new poems an extension of what's going on in Bucyrus-lyric, narrative, and found elements in the same work-or are they completely different? I understand you have a new book ready for pub­lication. 
Answer: Yes, the new book is called Turns. It forms a diptych with Bucyrus which is its first side. Readers who were unable to discover the larger configurations in Bucyrus will find that claim pretentious, but there we are. I cut good poems from Bucyrus in order to build a coherent architecture and I'm cutting good poems from Turns to make it one with Bucyrus. The two should eventually be published as a single book. Bucyrus is a very violent book. Turns, I hope, is less so. Turns is often austere in dealing with themes which Bucyrus treats rather too extravagantly. Otherwise, there are a lot of similarities. They both mix lyric, narrative, and found ele­ments. They both mix prose and verse. They both play with the quarrel between formalist and Marxist aesthetics. They both deal with autobiographical, political, historical, and occult phenomena and attempt to establish relationships among them. They both should be read as books and not as a miscellaneous grab-bag of items that happened to get bound up together by accident. We all start reading poems in anthologies-which is a pity because it conditions us to think of the anthology as somehow the natural context. We ought to put down an anthology as soon as we get to a poet we like and go read his book. 
OCTOBER 27, 1972 
Question: Of course you've edited an anthology yourself, 23 Modern British Poets. Did you want us to find a lot of poets we liked and go read their books? 
Answer: 23 Modern British Poets was a necessary evil. We continue to suffer in this country from what I call in the for­ward "American Literary Jingoism." The British poets I most admired were quite unknown over here. I kept waiting for someone to do an anthology that represented a number of these poets, but nobody did. So I did it myself. The book, in fact, has made its impact-and has made a lot of people angry in the process by messing up some neat little tags and cate­gories usually hung on the British. And now it's at least a little easier to find the books by those twenty-three in American libraries and bookstores. The anthology will self-destruct in about five years. It won't be necessary any more. 
Question: Nathaniel Tarn when he was here two years ago made much of the distinction between the American language and the English language. I remember him lamenting that people didn't think of him as an American poet and the Juggler editor responding that he should try living here for three gen­erations first. You are often in England. Is it true that the vitality of the language is centered in America now? 
Answer: No. Tarn was in fact born in France and has lived in a lot of places besides England. He rightly resents being labeled British. But Tarn is really extraterritorial: a wandering Jew and an anthropologist to boot. His strengths are the strengths that come from not having roots. And yet he admires poets like Williams and Olson, poets for whom place (Paterson, Gloucester) is very important indeed. He'd like _to have a place too, and now that he's living in America he calls himself an American poet. It doesn't much matter, really. The best British and American poets are basically international (or at least trans-Atlantic) in their orientation, linguistic and other­wise. A lot of "American" poets live in England. A lot of "English" poets live in America. There's lots of moving around and one's speech patterns and habits are not forever condi­tioned by the environment one grows up in. The real contrast is between the vitality of the language in the mouths of those who love it and the death of the word in the bowels of those who hate it. And there are plenty of both types on either side of the ocean. 
Question: I've heard it said that the influence of Williams and Olson can be seen in your own work. It seems perhaps that Williams has out-lasted Eliot and Stevens, stylistically at least. How do you see the poetic line, as anything like the "measure" that Williams talked about? 
Answer: The poetic line depends on the poem at hand. I write differently at different times. "Poem In Three Parts" in Bucyrus is quite obviously, as you say, indebted to Williams and Olson­though to a lot of other people too: Pound, Duncan, Gertrude Stein, Kenneth iiexroth, Louis Zukofsky. When I was writing it J was wor',<ing ver/ closely with Peter Michelson-to whom the last section of Bucyrus is dedicated-and his influence is certainly important. But so is that of some very different poets, and, again, some of them are British: David Jones. Chri_stopher Middleton, and Geoffrey Hill. for example. The piece. of course, is largely synthetic. I took what I needed to get the job done. For other kinds of jobs one looks else­where: the short personal poems on erotic themes in the first section of the book have their source in Thomas Wyatt, for example. I have no particular distaste, like Williams and Olson, for traditional metrics. And I don't think Williams has out­lasted Eliot and Stevens. We need all of the resources we've been given. In fact the enthusiasm for Williams' poetics to the exclusion of all other possibilities among a number of poets in the fast ten years has produced a real dead end. We could do with a little elegance now, a little grace. 
Question: You mentioned earlier that one of the foci of both Bucyrus and Turns was the quarrel between formalist and Marxist aesthetics. In your poem "Statement'' in Bucyrus you seem to be quoting Christopher Caudwell, the Marxist critic, against himself. I understand that you take these matters up in your courses as well. Do you have anything like a system­atic aesthetic yourself that determines the shape of your work? 
Answer: Ifs more the other way around. I have some work that determines a not so systematic aesthetic. If I could make up my mind about aesthetics I could get on with the import­ant business of being a literary critic. But since I can't manage to do that I have to go on writing poems instead. 1 can some­times sound authoritative talking about these matters. but in fact I'm a chaos of contradictions. 
Question: Susanne Langer says somewhere that the chief reason literature manages to get taken seriously is that one can always treat it as somet'ling else than· art-or, back to Housman: people admire not the poetry before them but something else in it which they like better than poetry. Do you think this is a danger? Especially, for example, in a polit­ical poem? 
Answer: Well, let's try this. When one's writing well one can tum some of the most unlikely materials into art. When those materials are political one turns them into art insofar as one de-politicizes them: insofar as the political content is trans­figured by the imposition of form and so becomes aesthetic content 
Question: lhab Hassan has remarked apropos of "Poem In Three Parts" that Pound's kind of learning is dangerous be­cause it tends to make the poem· inaccessible to all but a very few of the initiated. Do you feel that's true? 
Answer: Not at all. When I use, say, occult materials in "Poem in Three Parts," it's no more necessary to understand how those materials function in the sources from which they're taken than it is to understand the secret recipe and produc­tion techniques that result in a drink called Pepsi Cola in order to feel the formal significance of a Pepsi label juxtaposed with three colors and four lines on a canvas. 
Question: You're not exactly coming on as a Marxist, are you? 
Answer: Shall I give the Marxist answers? They're just as true-given, that is, the operation of the ·dialectic which makes them also just as false-but they're not so interesting verbally. 
Question: In just the last few years your students have pub­lished in r.iany national and international poetry magazines. Michael O'Connor and John Stupp have been editors of Prism International, Rory Holscher won the Hallmark award and Steve Tapscott the Cornell Poetry Prize. A good number have gone on to do distinguished work in graduate writing programs. Do you find teaching writing enriches your own experience and therefore your work? 
Answer: The strange thing is, you know, that I really prefer teaching the more academic courses I offer, such as Modern British Poetry. All of those willful egos and hurt sensibilities in writing classes! Some people believe it's quite impossible 

• to teach such a thing as poetry writing. If I believed that, of course, I wouldn't try to do it. You certainly can't teach imagi­nation or inspiration, but you can teach-and . in fact teach effectively-technique and craftsmanship. I think it's useful for a young poet to ·stop thinking of himself as a romantic visionary and start thinking of himself as an apprentice crafts­man instead. Poetry, like music, involves precise disciplines _ that can be learned. If there's no imagination, of course, the technique alone won't produce anything more than verbal exercises. But imagination without technique is imagination in chains. I mean, think of going to.a piano teacher and telling him: Man, I'm full of music. What's he going to say? Sit down and start_ learning the scales;·_ right? Anyway,-to answer your question, I don't know what the feedback from the writing courses into my own work amounts to. I don't write a lot when I'm teaching. -I like to teach and -I · like to write. The two . activities are different enough that l;m seldom doing one when I'm doing the other. _Teaching certainly enriches my life, but sometimes one's ·work is enriched· when one's life. is impove­rished-and. the ot~e·r way around~-. It's· hard to· generalize · about these . things. It's certainly'. gratifying . to have had . so . many fine students in ·five ye·ars.~ · · 
Question: Do you find any' pattern among your students' an­thropological, structural° thinking·? : r-·\"'.as ·remembering that when John Logan ".'as here ·our students formed inadvertently practically a· Freudian. school in-the ·early sixties. 
THE SCHOLASTIC 


Answer: One should try very hard to avoid schools and pro­duce individual talents instead. Rory Holscher was a monu­mental theorizer as a student and carried a lot of people in his wake. But there were others at that time-I'm thinking of O'Connor, Hessler, Sherry, Stupp-who were more empirical and perhaps therefore a healthier influence. As a teacher I try to stay neutral on poetics, let alone philosophy. 
Question: You took quite a number of writing courses ·your­self at Stanford and Ohio State before beginning to teach and worked with some famous poets such as John. Berryman and · Stephen Spender and Yvor Winters. What do you think qualifies a man to teach such a course? 
Answer: Three things, basically: The authority and availability 
·ot his own work, his openness to work of quality which is en-· tirely different in kind from his own (e.g. is he open to good traditional work if his own is radically experimental), and his pedagogy-has he, that is, evolved a pedagogical method which allows him to deal in a rigorous and disciplined way · · with this rather odd and. specialized subject? In fact I never · took a writing class from Yvor . Winters because, while the 
. authority ·of his own work was considerable, his openness. to any writing even a· little different in· kind from his own was.· negligible. The authority of the instructor's own· work, never­theless, is his· first credential to teach such a·course. It should · be made available to his students early in the term:...:....on ditto · · if it hasn't been published-and discussed right along with theirs. Any sort of modesty on this matter seems to me en­tirely out of place. Notice the manner in which the Art De­partment here handles this: by inviting their students into the instructors' studios to work along beside them. Implicit in the second question-the man's openness to work different from his own-is his ability to discern quality in work very different in kind from what he's doing himself. Often that's 
· much more difficult than one might think. As for the que_stion of pedc1gogy, there seems to me no excuse just to sit around and ti.s., even though this is what happens most of the· time in most·writing courses at most universities. 
· _.Question: Just after you arrived at Notre Dame you wrote in · the ·Scholastic· that ."culture has got to be local, immediate, participatory. This, if for no other reason, because history is 
·a· bully.". Do you still believe that? 
Answer: _I think I'd tend now to make that a descriptive rather than . a prescriptive statement-and not be so pleased about it, either. I was defending the function of the Juggler at Notre Dame and arguing, if I can quote t~at paragraph you've got . 
there, that the primary function of a student literary magazine is to give the lie_ to dreary notions of Kulchur by defining the practice of writing as a natural and normal human activity. I argued that when we come to know about and care about the phenomenon of apprenticeship, then we begin to feel more at ease with literary art-and, by extension, with all those· other arts and crafts and skills we like or need to practice. 
-Question: You've said that sometimes one's work is enriched when one's life is impoverished. There are people who feel that writing poet.ry is certainly neither natural nor normal. In fact, the British crjtic A. Alvarez argues in his book The Savage God that modern poets are consistently driven to madness and suicide by taking on their backs the barbarousness of their age. 
Answer: Yes, I've read Alvarez: The press, you have noticed, gobbled it up. More vicarious kicks for the good and prudent burghers. I knew John Berryman; he was the first poet I ever 'met-when I was seventeen. His suicide was a great shock. I admire Sylvia· Plath, Ted Hughes, Robert Lowell and the o_ther poets Alvarez talks about in that book. But even reading is dangerous. Goethe managed to set off a string of suicides all across Europe by publishing The Sorrows of Young Werther. ,Thinking is dangerous. Getting out of bed is dangerous. But one wants to get out of bed, and think, and read, and live­and even write.. And, what's more, one wants to do these things with .some intensity. One takes the chances-one must~always. I don't think poets need to kill themselves, o.k.? Or to be encouraged to. Roy Fisher recently wrote a response to Alvarez I'd like to quote to you. 
The poets are dying because they are told to die. What kind of dirt is that? Whose hand jiggles the nerve, what programme demands it, what death-train are we on? Not poetry: some of us drink, some take the wrong kind of walk or get picked up· in canteens by killer lays-it's all tasteless to talk about. 
·Taste is what death has for talent. Then the civilization is filth, its taste 
· the scum on filth. Then the poets are going to be moving on out past talent, out past taste. If taste gets its gift wrappers on death-well­out past that, too. There are courts where nobody ought to testify.

Elsewhere, Steven Marcus was fixing these words to page: To the question, "What time is it in pornotopia?" One is tempted to answer, "It is always bedtime," for that is, in a literal sense, true ... time in pornotopia is determined by the time it takes to run out a series of combinations. Given a limited number of variables-that is, persons of both sexes with their corresponding organs and appendages­
. and a limited number of juxtapositions into which these variables may be placed, time becomes a mathematical function and may be defined as however long it takes to represent or exhaust the predetermined number of units to be combined. This is why The One Hundred and Twenty Days of Sodom represents one kind of perfection in this genre. (The Other Victorians; New York: Bantam Books, 1967, pp. 272-273.)

Could not have happened; he would have been noted as a minor eccentric. To see why, we must have recourse to an examination of the concept of Progress. The idea of Prog­ress contains a thoroughly teleological mode! of action. To progress is to strive for and achieve goals defined in the present but realized in the future. The more ideological and visionary the progressive becomes, the more distant his goals are placed in the future. However, what concerns us here is that the overriding model of Progress which has carried us through the industrial revolution, through the atomic age and into the present, is one which employs a model of future ful­fillment to assure everlasting frustration. That is, Progress has ­not been made to subserve larger human goals; instead it has asserted itself as the all-encompassing goal. 


The logic of Progress is like the logic of housework. Al­though it looks as though one is supposed to do something, all that really matters is that one keep busy. No -matter how trivial or grandiose the aim, serving a masterful means, doing work, is all that matters. Consequently, nobody gets any satis­faction which is not spurious. Even before one goal is realized, others are already being formulated and their means set in motion. The accomplishment of one task means only the be­ginning of another since the putative aim of the work is no better_ than an ·excuse to extract labor. So there are no true goals, no human purposes: they are all consumed by the in­finitely voracious appetite of -Progress. Although it appears as though things are happening, nothing of importance is brought about except by accident. Value resides merely in getting things done, whatever they are. _

Is it any wonder that recent artists have abandoned morphological art? 


When Marcel Duchamp carried the shovel into the gallery, he turned the world inside out. If the artist has the shovel, the critic cannot shovel the shit out of the·gallery. And there's lots more of that there too: Duchamp also brought his urinal along with him. 
Artists have lost their modesty. It's a (Y) 
(11) Kant does us the service of pointing to what is essen­tial. Before him, others had held that the sublime is connected in some way with· fear-a fear of threatening powers capable of harming us. Kant· recognized that the sublime is that which is "absolutely great." It is contrasted wi.th the Beautiful not by fear, but by a much deeper difference. The Beautiful has a 
-form which excites our mental faculties to engage in pleasant free play. Consequently, the Beautiful has a form which can be taken in by the mind, and indeed a form to which the mind responds affirmatively. The Sublime, however, is formless im­mensity. It is a power or an expanse so great that the human mind cannot take it in. It breaks the limits of the human imag­ination. In short, the Beautiful is that which turns you on, the Sublime blows your mind. 
Recent Sublime art has been trying to blow. our minds by breaking through those formal structures we utilize to grasp, 
· categorize; and understand the world, including the art world. Following Marcel . Duchamp's example, there is a desperate, but playful, attempt to escape the programmed limits placed upon art-limits wtiich come from a conception of the avant­
: garde closely allied with the idea of Progress. The problem is that art can never do the kind of (Jf .· (12) Left Hand. Right Hand. Both Hands. No Hands. (Per­. mutations are slightly different for men and women.) (P) 
(13) Max Kozloff, in an article in the current issue of Art­forum ("The Trouble With Art-As-Idea"), criticizes the recent

development of conceptual art for doing away with the struc­ture in terms of which critical evaluations can be made: "You can step the brake down to the floor and nothing happens" (p. 35). Right! "The unexpected is so expected that a self­defeating element is introduced into our dia~ogue with art" (p. 35). Right! He criticizes the conceptual artist for not coming . to terms with experience. Yet what is our experience? Experi­ence is Hiroshima; no self-respecting -!self-effacing) artist would try to feign it away. And value judgements are irrelevant in a world denuded of value. In an odd way, perhaps Kozloff's de­nigration of "art-as-idea" is based upon his belief that concep­
. tual art is a totally unexpected development in art. Yet he admits that "the abstract expressionists conjured up a timeless myth of the sublime" (p. 36). It is surely the Sublime as ex­pression of the absolutely great which plays itself out on the stage where art-as-idea tries to survive in the wings. Hiroshima was unexpected. Conceptual art is not. "The unexpected is so expected that a self-defeating element is introduced into our dialogue with art." After Hiroshima, what can we expect. Maybe tomorrow there will be no world? And what shall we expect of the artist under these circumstances? The artist's creative powers were symbolically destroyed by Hiroshima. It is not the artist who has come up with the idea of disconnecting the brake pedal. The surprising thing is that it took so long for conceptual art to make its stand (or its fall, as the case may be). The explanation may be that it has taken this long to re­cover. Hiroshima has had the same effect upon Twentieth Cen­tury man the promise of the sec·ond coming had on early Christians. Those early Christians did not busy. themselves with worldly matters. (N) 
(14) Now we are faced with the intriguing possibilities of an even more sublime (a contradiction-ha!) prospect.

So should we say one gains the world but loses his soul? -that the artist ,makes life into art only by surrepdering himself and his sacred position? No: we have ·already lost our souls. Hirosh_ima did that. The artist,. llke the rest of us, is trying to shift for himself.. (T) 
Elsewhere; I was in film school. People_ had given up making films about orgies for something less boring. Somehow, sex and cinema had been inexorably linked in the subconscious of Amercian youth, and "at the height 'at the sexual revolution it seemed unavoidable that this link would find its expression in film as students ·exorcised false idols by producing unmiti­gated smut. Sometimes our local processing lab would view the raw footage and threaten to call the D.A. After that hap­pened a few times, the footage of naked bodies was sent to an out-of-town processor. In the end, these skin -flicks turned out being an excuse to watch private acts or to get everyone you would like to see naked to undress before you at the same time. The other reason for making them was money. There were tales of filmmakers who-supported their serious work by mak­ing marketable, pornography. But there aren't many artistic possibilities in pure sex. It does not take very long to discover this-fact People_ were abandoning ............ : ... fo(art.

OCTOBER' 27, 1972 

I. Photographic Reality 
My birth came not quite one hundred and twenty years after Talbot and Daguerre developed the first primitive camera images. And yet in that short time, photography had become so much a part of our culture that a minor linguistical revolu­tion had occurred. As a child, I had no difficulty discerning the meaning of the word "picture." It was quite clear that when someone said "picture," he meant a "photograph." If one meant a "painting," "drawing," "cartoon," etc., he said "painting," "drawing," or "cartoon." These words all had very definite meanings, not to be confused with "picture" and "photograph." In fact; this distinction was so great that when someone said, "picture," meaning a painting or drawing, I thought it a strange and a very uncommon word usage-prob­ably incorrect. 
Aaron Scharf has written, "We have learned to see nature more or less as the average camera 'sees' nature." We see what we have learned to see, and the photograph has been the great teacher of the twentieth century. Our vision has been terribly confined, terribly conventionalized, by the effects of the photograph on our culture. Perhaps one of the stronger motives that has led to my own photographic experimentation is the desire to break out of this conventionalized vision. I am no mystic: my desire is not for the "transcendental!' It is, quite simply, a question of freedom. In this search to see the world as it is, perhaps I will learn to see it my way, from my own unique viewpoint. Already the world appears different to me than when I was a child, and I'm not talking about how things seem smaller as I grow bigger. 
II. The Problem of Photography 
The major act of an artist is one of expression. The diffi­culties of this task for an artist working in photography are compounded by many popular misconceptions of his medium. 
Danny Lyon has said that a photograph of an event is not the event itself, which is· a fairly obvious _assertion. Apparently few people are· aware of the implications of this statement consider the photographic energy expended in recreating and documenting events, either ·of the external or of the so-called internal, though more_ "mystical," variety. Consider also, how much photographic "appreciation," if not criticism, depends upon a photography of representation.· Imposing as narrow a conception as representation onto photography is as limiting to that medium as photography has ·been to our vision of reality. It may even be the cause of that vision. 
Photographs are .hardly true representations of reality, even controlled to that end. Theoretically, photographic repre­sentation is absurd. A photograph is an object, among the other objects that comprise part of what we call reality. The most it can accomplish as representation is metaphor, a du­bious accomplishment in light of a photograph's potential. 
A photograph is a visual construct manufactured by the reaction of light on sensitized material, which is then chemi­cally processed. The possibilities for i_nspired control and intervention during this process are endless. This visual con­struct need not be about anything. It is. And like most things that are, it provides an occasion for human experience. The form of a photograph does not make a statement, except as it defines itself. 
Ill. Art and Illusion 
· When Nietzche wrote that art is illusion, he_ meant that illusory moment when an artist's imagination is free, his heart willing, and his hands able. 
IV. The Art of Craftsmanship 
Michael Patrick O'Connor has written: "Freedom is· the recognition of poetry." The artist's conception of freedom 
THE SCHOLASTIC 

differs from the popular notion. Instead of coupling freedom with responsibility, he couples it with the obvious-ability. To be free by itself means nothing. Freedom takes on meaning only when it includes action. Ability is a necessity in any truly free activity. So an artist learns his· craft. If he does not know his craft, he cannot be free in his work. 
The artist's conception of responsibility is a responsibility to his work. As a highly disciplined craftsman, he realizes that any other kind of responsibility is artificial. A photo­grapher who works with a camera owes nothing to the reality which was the occasion of his. photograph. He owes every­thing to the image that results. He is responsible for that image, and, like any wise parent, he must turn it loose the moment it is born. 
V. Aesthetic Meaning 
We are, contrary to what my writer friends tell me, a word­oriented society. Images, photographs, may be everywhere around us. But few of us have learned to see. 
It is a most common occurrence for an artist to be asked of his work, "What does it mean?" Even the literati, who have learned to remain mute before paintings, are unable to refrain from asking the same question when confronted by a photo­graph. "Does it make a statement?" is a common art school criterion • concerning photographs. Recently, some. of my strongest photographs were eliminated from a show because 
· the curator could not read a "coherent statement" in them. 
As if painters were poets and photographers were novel­ists, we ask for words of meaning. However, the visual arts have their own language. Photography does not speak in English. It is necessary to learn the language before you can experience the art in it. In 1936. Laszlo Moholy-Nagy wrote, "The illiterate of the future will be ignorant of the use of camera and pen alike." The future is upon us. 
VI. The Meaning of the Aesthetic 
There are artists working in a language we all know: the poets and novelists around us. We may know the language, but again, few know the art in it. Poets and novelists are not essayists. They are riot expounding about the human experi­ence. They are using words to build powerful constructs that provide us with experience. 
Technological man, in this scientific society, demands precision. He desires immediate description followed by in­stant categorization. Observations and concepts are· easily handled in this manner. But art is not observational. It is not didactic, nor is it entirely conceptual. Aesthetic statement is not bound to metaphor. Insofar as modern man is precise, he remains approximate: . neutron, electron, proton, and neutrino still remain as earth, air, fire, and water. Art is, finally, the celebration of the approximate, the inexact, and the unknow­able.· 
VII. The Anti-Aesthetic Manifesto 
On April 26, 1930, Edward Weston wrote, "I can not, never have been bound by any theory or doctrine, not even my own." 
Dance the metaphor.
