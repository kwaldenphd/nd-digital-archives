Valuable Editorials?
Editor:
We have found great value in several of your editorials, and certainly feel that you are doing a fine job by informing the student body of your opinion on campus activities. We feel that this time, however, your editorial concerning Student Council appropriations was entirely uncalled for.
Your spendthrift attitude toward the Sophomore Talent Quest appropriation of $140 from the Student Council shows a lack of appreciation, support, and personal interest in introducing new student activities. Is that, not after all, the purpose of the Student Council, to promote new and greater class-sponsored activities?
We would hate to think that you, a fellow student who undoubtedly devotes a great deal of time to a student activity, namely the Scholastic, would value a contestant’s time in preparation of an act, so little as to remove his incentive of prize money.
Your mention of the Student Theatre in the same sentence with the Band and Glee Club, regarding remuneration for time devoted to these activities is rather ridiculous isn’t it? We are sure that the Student Theatre would be more than happy to hit the circuit occasionally if offered the opportunity, for the past productions certainly deserve more acclaim than the campus can offer.
We are proud to be members of a class that would take the initiative in providing an outlet for student talent and worthwhile entertainment for all. Help rather than opposition is necessary if any student activity is to succeed.
WHAT CAN YOU DO?
George R. Sweet William J. Vandeven
We believe we already did tvhat we could. The last “talent” show had very little talent and less tvorthwhile entertainment. Perhaps this one will, but tve think the Council would be tviserin backing a student play or musical. They’re almost always a success.—Editor

‘Hidden’ O’Donnell Trophy
Editor:
Tsk, tsk, tsk, but your Mr. Meaney should have made some inquiries before becoming so indignant about the present whereabouts of the O’Donnell Trophy. The blame—if any exists—for the trophy being “tucked away in the obscurity

of Charlie Callahan’s office” rests upon the Department of Publications.
Three weeks ago an eager Dome photographer called and insisted that he needed a picture of Notre Dame’s three football trophies immediately. While making the necessary arrangements for him our secretary found that the O’Donnell Trophy had not yet been engraved with the 1949 winner’s name. A rush job was arranged with a local jeweler over a weekend so it would be ready first thing Monday morning. That was three weeks ago—we have the trophies, but have seen neither hide nor flashgun of the Dome fotog.
It was bad enough having one employee of the Publications Department fail to keep an appointment arranged with some difficulty, but now another minion of the Publications Department must compound the discourtesy by accusing us of showing disrespect for the O’Donnell Trophy.
So, please, Mr. Meaney, step next door and tell your colleagues on the Dome to get their photographer over here immediately so we will no longer be the target of such scathing and unjustified criticism from your vitriolic pen and so

Small Problem
Editor:
I would like to call to your attention a small problem that arose last Saturday night at the Vaughn Monroe Show, in hopes that a solution can be found.
At 6:10 p. m. some ND students with their St. Mary’s dates, two professors and their wives and a handful of students without dates were stopped at the entrance to the Drill Hall by a watchman. He had orders to “keep everyone out.” Although every seat seemed to be
filled, abundant standing room was available along the sides. At 6:30 p. m. the order was rescinded and many couples went inside. At about the same time the last six to eight rows on the right and left were vacated as these people unable to see satisfactorily moved against the side walls; to be left standing throughout the show. The natural question to be asked: if standing was permitted at 6:30 p. m., why not at 6:10 p. m.?
I am sure that the 50 or at the most 60 people standing outside would have been willing to cooperate with any plan put forward with regards to where they should stand inside. Thoughtfulness and consideration are small acts in themselves, but they leave a lasting impression. I believe St. Mary’s and most ND students would like to be regarded as ladies and gentlemen and be treated accordingly.
This incident was unfortunate and further situations of this nature should be avoided. Perhaps for programs of this magnitude, the University could give out tickets or even sell them. If neither suggestion is feasible, then I believe they

THE WEEK
by flack McGoldrick
Top of the Week
Bengal Bouts start Monday.
Take Your Pick
Beginning today, room registration gives way to course registration, as undergraduates by the thousands engage their respective deans in battles of wits. Favorite sayings during this annual game-week are “but I took that course in summer school” and “I only" need thirty-nine more hours to graduate?”. These remarks are usually countered with stock phrases such as “it’s not in your record” or “well, that’s too bad, but. . . .”
Things have been made easier for the student this year as far as selecting major subjects is concerned. There seems to be a buyer’s market for a change, and for the past few weeks, departments within the various colleges have been peddling their wares in a series of pre-registration seminars. Incidentally have you noticed that every gathering of over ten people, with the exception of chow lines, is now called a seminar? (Probably just a fad.) Anyhow, these seminars consisted of round-table discussions between department heads and students eligible to pick a major. (It has been denied that the Speech department served refreshments in an effort to lure prospective Sociology majors out of the adjoining room.)
Just how much these discussions influenced choices has not been determined, but they undoubtedly acted as a forewarning to, and eased the burden of, many a harried and confused sophomore.
Ready . . . Aim . . .
What’s with South Bend theater owners? In less than four weeks, the local cinemenu (we’ve got to stop reading Time) has included no less than ten war pictures—good ones, bad ones, new ones, old ones.
The list includes Battleground, Submarine Patrol, Wing and a Prayer, Sands of Iwo Jima, Tunisian Victory, Twelve O’Clock High, Wake Island, So Proudly We Hail, Task Force, and Desert Victory.
Some of these have run singly, others have been billed together on double feature programs. Among the latter, there
were four films labeled in the ads as “encore triumphs.” (This means they are more than five years old, and are scheduled for 1953 showings in Washington Hall.)
Just why the sudden deluge of bloody pix, no one seems to know. Maybe it has something to do with the forthcoming Armed Forces Day. And that makes one wonder if Secretary of Defense Johnson knows that American citizens are seeing un-unified movies—some even about the Navy! (Admirals heads will roll for this.) There will probably be a directive forthcoming to splice together the reels of Battleground, Sands of Itvo Jima, Task Force and Twelve O’Clock High, and run them as one picture—in the interests of unification.
Suggestion of the Week
There’s nothing muddier than spring in Indiana. And in this particular part of Indiana, with the possible exception of Badin Bog, there’s nothing muddier than the area in front of the bus stop at the circle. The only safe way to wait for the bus nowadays is to climb the tree in front of the waiting room, or guard house, or whatever that little wooden shack is. The Tree, familiar to us all, has been utilized as a focal point by bus drivers for- many muddy years. If the waiting crowd is standing east- of the tree, the bus swings around it, splashing all within H-bomb radius. If the mob tries to fake the driver by standing west of the tree, the bus stops out in the mid

dle of Notre Dame Avenue, and the troops must wade through the mud to board it.
That word ‘board’ brings to us the point of this little paragraph, wherein the WEEK suggests that maybe a temporary boardwalk, or some kind of flooring could be set out there, to keep busses in line, and feet dry. This would be an inexpensive convenience for profs, visitors, employees, and even students—although the last named group is “expected to take their recreation on the campus, and not loiter about the city” (p. 76, Gen. Bulletin)—and to the city is where the bus goes.

Three Notre Dame Units Will March in South Bend
The NROTC Midshipmen of Notre Dame will march in the first Armed Forces Day parade to be held in South Bend on the twentieth of May. This is the first year that the country will celebrate a day set aside for the Armed Forces as a unit. By presidential order, May 20, 1950 has been designated as Armed Forces day to replace the special ones set aside for Army day, Navy day, and Air Corps day.
The Air ROTC unit will also make a showing at the parade. This is the first year that the ROTC units will take part in the celebrations, and it is also the initial time in the history of both ROTC units on the campus that they will appear in the same event.
Notre Dame will be ably represented by a third group also, the University of Notre Dame Band.
March 24, 1950
Entertainment
MARCH 24
COLFAX (through March 29) — Kirk Douglas, of Champion fame, portrays the jazz trumpeter with the music consuming love in Young Man With a Horn (Legion of Decency Rating A-2). His crack-up at the end of the film is very similar to the one he enacted as Midge Kelly. Lauren Dacail, who is the victim of some terrible dialogue, Doris Day and Hoagy Carmichael lend support. Although this isn’t an excellent movie, it is good entertainment, well spiced with good music. Harry James is responsible for the trumpet work.
PALACE (run indefinite)—Here’s a picture that every movie-goer should see: Robert Rossen’s All the King’s Men (B). Taken from Robert Penn Warren’s Pulitzer Prize book, this is hailed as one of the finest films of the year. Everything about it is above par. The story about politics is excellent. The acting by Broderick Crawford, John Ireland, Mercedes McCambridge, Joanne Dru, John Derek and a large cast, is peppered with stellar performances. The picture was filmed mostly with authentic backgrounds. It’s adult film-fare all the way around. See it from the beginning, and if you have the chance, miss the co-pic, Beauty on Parade.
GRANADA (through March 28)—So Proudly We Hail and Wake Island were two of the earliest war films to come out of Hollywood. The former was about some nurses and their last stand on Bataan and Corregidor. Claudette Colbert, Paulette Goddard and Veronica Lake helped to make it an interesting if not too plausible picture. The latter film was the story of the valiant stand put up by the small contingent of Marines and civilians on Wake Island. Brian Donlevy, MacDonald Carey, and William Bendix were all fine in this production. Both are good for comparison purposes with such recent war flickers as Battleground and Tivelve O’Clock High.
WASHINGTON HALL—Daffy Marie Wilson transfers from radio to be the title role player in My Friend Irma (A-2). If you like your comedy subtle, if you like to smile and remember satiric quips rather than choke with laughter— then, brother, stay away from this. Irma is as broad as they come. Diana Lynn, John Lund and Don deFore are in the cast. The surprise of the whole picture is that new wacky duo, Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin. Lewis is a real clown.
AVON (through March 28)—After having a string of first rate films, this theater falls below the mark with this booking: South Sea Sinner (B). Swiveling Shelly Winters and Mac Donald Carey are the stars. The plot is so corny it isn’t even funny. This, you can skip.
MARCH 30
COLFAX (through April 5)—John Ford forgot his cowboy epics long enough to direct When Willie Comes Marching Home (A-2). Here is one of the laugh-happiest shows to hit South Bend in months. It’s the story of a GI who became a town hero when he enlisted right after Pearl Harbor. Then he becomes stationed in his own town and remains there while his friends get shipped overseas. His situation reverses and he becomes the town disgrace. Then,

From the Editor’s Desk..
Swing's the Thing
Next Monday, over eighty fighters will begin swinging in the 1950 Knights of Columbus Bengal Bouts. And more important, in a couple of months Holy Cross priests and Brothers will be using the proceeds from, the bouts to swing some blows for Catholicism in India.
The Bouts are probably one of the happiest annual events of the schoolyear. Begun in 1932 under the sponsorship of this magazine, they grew so large and time-consuming that they were turned over to the Knights of Columbus in 1946. Over 17,000 people witnessed each of the last two tournaments. The accomplishments of the Bengals are many.
Of course, the money turned over to the missions is probably the most important. It enables Holy Cross missionaries to carry out the command to teach all nations.
However, some of the other facets have more local interest. It provides the university with an intramural boxing show that is well-conducted. The participants receive rigorous training, athletic skill and a chance to prove their ability before an appreciative audience. It is by far the most important intramural activity of the University.
The amount of favorable publicity the University receives cannot be measured accurately, but the show is known throughout the midwest as an annual classic. Reports are not only carried in local publications but also in papers farther away. A good example of this is the widely reprinted guest editorial of Dominic Napolitano, Bengal Trainer, which first appeared in the March 10 issue of the Scholastic and was later reprinted in the Chicago Tribune. Experts realize that the bouts are conducted as well as any throughout the land, and they treat them accordingly.
Students in the local council of the Knights of Columbus get a chance to gain experience by planning and putting over the show. They secure advertising for the program, buy and sell refreshments, manage the crowds and keep the books.
All these things are accomplished in an easy way. The committee has little trouble selling the tickets. People don’t go to the fights for these reasons above—though they easily could. They go to see five action-filled, enjoyable nights. Plan on attending as many nights as you can. You won’t be losing a thing.
Kelleghan's Back
Thomas Kelleghan is back in the Scholastic this week with an article on “What’s Wrong With the Notre Dame Student?” By doing this, he is settling our recent controversy in just about the best possible way. Instead of arguing the relative merits of campus news, he has sent us another provocative essay. Another one worth printing.
We reaffirm the fact that most general essays are not for us. But we add that whenever we receive well-written, provocative articles that really concern the majority of the student body, we wall print as many as we are able.

General J. Lawton Collins Named Laetare Medalist for 1950 by Father Cavanaugh
General J. Lawton Collins, Chief of Staff of the United States Army, was named 1950 recipient of the Laetare Medal last Sunday by Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, c.s.c., President of the University of Notre Dame. General Collins is the 68th distinguished American to receive the Laetare Medal, the oldest American Catholic • medal, awarded annually since 1883 by the University of Notre Dame to an outstanding American Catholic layman.
Movie actress Irene Dunne was the 1949 recipient of the Laetare Medal, which was inaugurated by the Rev. Edward F. Sorin, c.s.c., founder of Notre Dame. The award is named the Laetare Medal because the winner is announced on Laetare Sunday, the fourth Sunday of Lent.
Father Cavanaugh, in announcing the award to General Collins, said, “General Collins has had a distinguished career as a soldier, having been decorated for gallantry in both World Wars. His genius during the crisis of wartime, moreover, is equalled by his steadfast efforts for peace in the world today. General Collins, throughout his lengthy service with the United States government, has remained a shining example of the moral leadership which is one of the vital needs of the world.” In the past, five other leading military figures have received the Laetare Medal.
General Collins assumed his position as Chief of Staff of the United States Army in 1949, succeeding General Omar Bradley. He previously has served consecutively as Chief of Public Information, Deputy Chief of Staff, and Vice-Chief of Staff since the end of World War II.
General Collins, a native of New Orleans, La., was graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1917, at which time he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Army. Since then he has come up through the ranks and was made a full General at the time of his appointment in 1949 to his present post.
March 24, 1950
During World War I, the 1950 Laetare Medal recipient seiwed with the Twenty-Second Infantry, and with the First Division and Heaquarters of the American Forces in Germany from 1919 to 1921. Upon his return to the United States, he served successively as an instructor at the United States Military
General J. Lawton Collins
Academy, the Infantry School, and the American War College.
Late in 1941, General Collins was named Chief of Staff of the Seventh Army Corps, which distinguished itself by capturing Cherbourg and German General von Schlieben. General Collins then served at various posts including Chief of Staff of the Hawaiian Department and Chief of Staff of the Army Ground Forces before assuming his duties as Chief of Public Information of the War Department.
Among the military honors tendered General Collins are the Distinguished Service Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, Army of Occupation Medal, Defense Medal, Silver Star, Victory Medal, Asiatic Pacific Medal, Legion of Merit, Companion Order of Bath (British),

Director Francis Hanley puts some University Theater players through their first paces for the forthcoming showing of Emmet Lavery’s "A Gentleman From Athens."
Theatre Ends Casting For Lavery Comedy
At the final tryout session last Monday night, the University Theatre finished casting for its next presentation, the three-act comedy by Emmet Lavery, The Gentleman From Athens.
Professor Frank Hanley of the Department of Fine Arts and the play director has chosen Lou Garrippo, Sophomore from Chicago, fox' the leading male role of “Socrates Christopher,” the tough racketeer from Athens, California, who bought his way into Congress and made his mark in that body.
The Gentleman will make its appearance on the stage of Washington Hall April 24, 25 and 26. Supporting Garrippo will be Larry McDermott, as a shrewd political “boss” and Daniel Kahlich, as a sober banker.
Doug Robertson and Jim McIntyre have been chosen to portray Congressmen. Handling the two female roles will be Mrs. Virginia White and Mrs. Reggie Lundley, both of Vetville. Mrs. White will enact one of the play’s best humorous roles as a small, witty, 70-year-old spinster. Mrs. Lundley will play a gushy, “club-woman-type” Congresswoman.
Rounding out the rest of the cast of this lively political satire will be John Schneller in the role of a scholarly Russian diplomat and Arthur Casey and Alfred Ward who will appear as Washington newsmen.—Justin Bolger

Also featured in the program will be . clarinet soloist Carl William Kohls, who will be accompanied by the quartet in some lighter pieces by Mozart and Brahms.
Engineers Announce First Annual Award
The first annual award of the Father Steiner Prize will be made on April 26, 1950.
The prize is a cash award, amounting this year to fifty dollars ($50.00). The basis of the award will be scholastic average, rating by Engineering faculty and by the department’s engineering society, engagement in extra-curricular activities, and ability in English composition and speech. The contest is open to all juniors and seniors in the Engineering College. Application blanks are to be secured from the Department
head, and returned there not later than April 4, 1950.
For many years the Rev. Thomas A. Steiner, C.S.C., now Provincial of the Western Province of the Priests’ Congregation of Holy Cross, was a professor in the College of Engineering, and Dean of the College for several years. During this time, Father Steiner was recognized by most of the engineering — students as more than a teacher of • engineering knowledge, more than an administrator of rules. Many young men who incurred his official displeasure by failing courses, found that he also had a human understanding of their difficulties. The sympathy and advice received in evening conferences in Father Steiner’s room in the Main Building helped many students along the difficult way to graduation.
That this side of Father Steiner was known and appreciated by many, is evidenced by the establishment of the Father Steiner Prize. In the fall of 1948, several of his former students under the leadership of Edward Cantwell, c.E., ’25, started contributions towards a fund to establish this prize; the fund is still being increased by contributions of Father Steiner’s former students.
In establishing this prize, it was specified that it is to be based not on engineering scholastic record alone, but also on other activities, thereby encouraging engineers to become leaders among theii- associates.
Final selection of the prize winner will be made at a public speaking contest on April 26. The composition and delivery of the participants on this occasion will count 30 per cent toward the determination of the winner.
Further details concerning the competition will be found on bulletin boards in- the Engineering building.

Universal ND Night Marked for April 17
® The night of April 17 has been designated this year by the Alumni Association to mark the twenty-seventh Annual Universal Notre Dame Night. This night, which is traditionally held the first Monday after Easter, was founded in 1924 during the Rockne-Four Horsemen era and was established primarily to focus the national spotlight on what Notre Dame is doing in fields other than athletics. This same fundamental theme is being kept this year and is not meant to detract at all from the athletic achievements of Notre Dame but merely to bring to light what the University itself is really like.
With this thought in mind, Frank Wallace, the present honorary president of the Alumni Association, has outlined a program which will stress the spiritual, cultural, and intellectual side of the Notre Dame story. This program is to be carried to the public by Notre Dame men who themselves have achieved a stature and a voice in the world today. The 1950 observance of Universal Notre Dame Night could be described as being both universal and local in character in the sense that each club will be spotlighted in its own community.
It is the plan to have each local alumni club feature, that night, Notre Dame men who have gained prestige in their particular community as well as a special guest. Many of the featured ® speakers will include former Laetare Medal winners, former faculty members, lay trustees, and other people who are directly associated with the University today. Following up on this prestige program other clubs will publicize through press, radio and other channels the contributions Notre Dame has made to the community, nation and world. A national broadcast is being planned and will probably be staged on the following night.	'

Campus 'Irish' Honor Feast of St. Patrick
By CHARLEY DULLEA
Saint Patrick drove the snakes from Ireland, but a goodly number managed to. wriggle into local dorms last Friday night — at least, such was the opinion of several score of leaden-footed Hibernians come Saturday mom.
The festive spirit prevailed throughout South Bend as each local barkeep suddenly came into possession of a genealogy stretching back to County Mayo and each barmaid began to answer to the name of Eileen. From Chester’s to the Blarney Inn the sale of orange bitters was taboo. A novel approach was taken by one restaurateur in offering green Swiss cheese; most of his patrons failed to recognize the delicacy due to faulty color perception.
Probably more Celtic songs were sung by the festive flock than had been heard since the days of Chauncey Alcott. Organists, fiddlers, and marimba artists were kept occupied in pounding out such deathless melodies as McNamara’s Band and Clancy Lowered the Boom, all of which went to provide a considerable contrast with the offerings usually heard, generally of the St. Casimir’s school of counterpoint.
The evening’s revels were not with-

out their quota of imbroglios as the merrymakers tried to prove themselves reincarnations of Finn McCool and generally wound up in close juxtaposition with the “ould sod.” An incipient movement by a group of Sinn Feiners to have Sweeney’s secede from South Bend was foiled, thanks to generous tipping of the flowing bowl.
And so,.as Tara’s harp gave out its last few mellifluous tones, the sons of Erin trod their way back to Notre Dame, leaving behind a vague memory of this St. Patrick’s Day.

Campus Flu Epidemic Diminishing in Effect
A typical influenza epidemic has been raging on the campus of Notre Dame for the last four weeks and has only recently been diminishing in effect according to a statement by Dr. John W. Karn, physician at the ND Student Infirmary.
Dr. Karn pointed out that although the individual cases of the flu have been relatively mild, the overall situation has been the most extensive epidemic here foi" a long time. According to the U.S. Public Health Reports for Febru-. ary and March the Notre Dame epidemic is not an isolated appearance of the disease. The entire nation has felt the effects of sharp increases in flu cases.
At the peak of the local epidemic last week, 65 persons were being cared for in Student Infirmary beds. It was then that the third floor of the hospital was opened for the first time to accommodate flu sufferers. The Infirmary can accommodate 85 patients if necessary, but the average number of bed cases runs between 15 and 20 persons.
The epidemic necessitated the adding of two new nurses to the hospital staff.
Patients treated for the disease in the Infirmary usually stay in bed from three to five days receiving penicillin
Four sufferers of the flu epidemic patiently wait for room assignments in the ND Infirmary. The virus was the cause of the large hegira to the campus sick bay.
and other specific medication. The flu, according to Dr. Karn, is not a seasonal disease and can be treated in the early stages of sickness without too many complications.
Dr. Yacobson Ends Lectures on Russia
“Russian Nationalism, Old and New” was the subject of a series of talks presented this week by Dr. Sergius Yakob-son, government specialist in Soviet affairs. The talks, sponsored by the University’s Committee on International Relations, were given this afternoon, yesterday afternoon and Wednesday afternoon. The first lecture covered Russian Nationalism prior to 1900, the second dealt with the period of revolution and Soviet policies up to World War II, and this afternoon’s talk treated current ideological trends in the Soviet Union.
Dr. Yakobson is now Chief of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Legislative Reference Service at the Library of Congress. Born and educated in Russia, he was forced to transfer his writing and teaching activities to Germany after the Bolshevik uprising.
After a second exile, this time by the Nazis, he moved to England; and in 1940 he came to this country. Here he aided the government in its study
of war-time communications by mak- ♦ ing a content-analysis of Soviet propaganda addressed to the Russian home front. Dr. Yakobson’s profuse writings include works in English, German and Russian, and deal with history, politics and international relations.
Donahoe Still Critical After Handball Injury
John J. Donahoe, freshman in the College of Law, remained in a critical condition as the Scholastic went to press this week. After being admitted to St. Joseph Hospital Monday night, he is still suffering from a blood clot between the brain and the skull.
Jack was injured Monday afternoon while playing handball in the Rockne ♦ Memorial. He walked to the Infirmary for treatment, and while there collapsed.
A graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree last year, he is from Oak Park, Ill., and Walsh Hall. Before graduation he was a member of the Student Council and acted as a student manager. ■ » • —----------------

Father Cavanaugh Decries Neglect of God At Address to Friendly Sons of St. Patrick
Our American leaders, through a neglect of God, have come “perilously near to surrendering our national soul,” stated Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., $ president of the University, recently. Father Cavanaugh made this observation in an address delivered last Friday night at a dinner of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick held at the Hotel Nether-land Plaza in Cincinnati.
“All of the nations have come together to erect an international structure so that peace may bless the earth,” Father Cavanaugh reminded the St. Patrick’s Day gathering. “There has been talk about fighting tuberculosis, about reducing armaments and establishing a free-flow of the world’s goods to this country and that. There has been talk about almost everything but God. An American representative told me recently he had heard God mentioned only once in all of the conferences of the United Nations, and then by an insignificant representative from India.
“Are we now cowed into thinking & that God has nothing to do with the success or failure of such a gigantic undertaking? Is there no American to paraphrase the words of Benjamin Franklin, spoken at one of the early constitutional conventions here in America: ‘If a sparrow cannot fall from a tree without God’s knowledge, how can we hope to erect an international structure without God’s aid?’ ”
Father Cavanaugh referred to the United States as a “nation of religious origins and religious consciousness” and a “nation with a soul.”
“As a preamble to all that our forefathers did when America was founded, they said: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that to preserve these rights, govern-■>. ments are instituted amongst men.’ I take it that belief in God, in God-given rights, is of the essence in this country. I cannot understand the modern coldness or cowardness towards this fact.”
Father Cavanaugh pointed to secularism —“a sheepish public neglect of God that shuts Him out of political, social, family, and intellectual life”— as the great heresy in the United States.
“The fanatical, irresponsible communist can in our own country deny
March 24, 1950
God as the source of human rights, and yet demand the exercise of his rights in his attempts to tear down the temple of liberty,” Father Cavanaugh declared. “But, on the other hand, it has become a crime against the American Constitution as interpreted by the highest court in this land to teach religion in the public school — to teach that God is the source of human liberty and the sanction of moral conduct. I believe as most of you believe that when a nation is afraid to stand up for its beliefs, when it is no longer ready to fight for its soul, that nation becomes ready to surrender its soul, and then, even though it may outwardly seem to prosper, it is already succumbing to death.
“The history of Ireland for seven centuries has been a grand protest written in blood against those who would make it choose between annihilation or submission :,to force and subversive creeds. So bitter, so heroic, so unending has been the struggle that we who'have never lost our independence might well appraise against the history of Ireland the value of our liberties as we sit with folded hands and silent lips watching the blood of American freedom drained from the veins of American youth.
“If Ireland were called before the bar of the nations and asked to show reasons why she deserved the everlasting gratitude of the American people, she might well pass by the great' armies of the patriotic dead who gave the last fruit of their devotion in every crisis that America might go on to live; she might pass over her dashing generals and her brilliant orators and her great leaders in every department of American life and point to the faith in God which she has fostered in this land.
“She might say ‘I based my claim foxremembrance and gratitude upon calling you back to Him. I claim an honorable place among the people who make up the American nation fox- the spiritual vision I have given to your- life in the sons and daughters I have sent to you. I ask you to see evidences of my contribution in the shining happy coxxntenances of the people who live by faith; in the mothers with madonna hearts and madonna faces; in the young girls whose purity and honesty and loyalty are inspiring youx- youth; in the strong young men who love Chx-ist and the Holy Mother- of God and stand ready to die fox- the things they hold sacred.’ ”
Final Week-End Retreat Starts Tomorrow for Frosh
The final week-end retreat of the Lenten season will begin at 8 p. m. tomorrow in the Cavanaugh Hall chapel fox- freshmen. Upperclassmen who
Father Laskowski
have not yet made a Lenten retreat this year- may also attend. The order and time of the sex-vices are unchanged.
Rev. Cornelius Laskowski, C.S.C., one of the University’s most outstanding preachers, will conduct the conferences. Father Laskowski is professor- of Slavic languages and an authority on Russian literature.
Attendance at the four previous retreats has averaged close to 200 students.
WND Opens Mikes To Aspiring Jockeys
Would-be radio announcers the campus ovex- will soon have a chance to air- their- vocal chords, according to Joe Shelly, chief announcer at Station WND.
A meeting will be held in room 101 Law Building at 7 p.m. on Tuesday, March 28, to assign interested parties to an audition schedule. Any Notre Dame student is eligible to apply, each will get a chance to read before a board of judges, and those rated highest will be offered a spot on the WND staff.’
Standard network tests will be used, and present WND staff members will be examined on the same basis as new aspirants, said Shelly.
The move is a result of numerous student applications for announcing jobs, and a decision by the station to give any potential Red Barbers or Ted Husings a chance to be recognized.

NFCCS Backs Publication Of Catholic Best Sellers
Doubleday and Company, publishers, have announced that they will publish pocket editions of several best sellers by Catholic authors, if enough letters in favor of such books are received. The small-size editions would probably sell for 35 cents.
In support of this plan, the National Federation of Catholic College Students urges everyone to write asking that such books be printed. Letters should be addressed to:
Afr. Walter F. O’Keefe Institutional Department Doubleday and Company Garden City, New York
Publication of Catholic works would help “to offset the rot and filth that now fills the pocket book stands,” thereby aiding the NFCC’s Decent Literature Campaign.
At present there are only a few Catholic pocket books on the market, notably You Can Change the World, The World, the Flesh and Father Smith and some of Graham Greene’s novels.
Two Movies Cause Battle Between ND and St. Mary's
The Sociology Club’s presentation of two movies last week resulted in a battle of words between Notre Dame men and St. Mary’s College students.
The Sociologists, in conjunction with the Audio Visual Center, sponsored the movies and special guests included the group of instigators from across the highway.
The psychological difference in courtship was the basic theme of the first film, All Kinds of People, and the second film, TV/io's Boss, dealt with the question of just who is the “boss” of a family.
Following the films, Mr. John J. Kane, club moderator, got the ball rolling on a discussion of the problems portrayed in the two movies. But it was soon swept out of his hands and the topics were hurled between the male and female points of view.
Though neither side was able to make much of an impression on the other, the Sociologists were satisfied with the interest shown. Seating was inadequate for the showings, with many being turned away, but this did not dampen the enthusiasm of the group.
Mr. Kane announced that the two movies will be shown as a part of next semester’s course, The Family, an elective in the Department of Sociology.
Band Opens Ten-Day
Western Tour April 9
Director H. Lee Hope recently announced that the Notre Dame concert band will open its . ten-day Western tour Easter Sunday, presenting a concert in Sterling, Ill. The 55 members of the band, together with Mr. Hope will depart from the campus April 9, and will return April 19.
In most of the cities in which the band will appear, one afternoon and one evening concert will be given. The
H. Lee Hope
afternoon concert will be presented for school children, while the evening performance will be open to the general public. Soloists who will perform on the tour include Bill MacMillan, marimba; Andrew Fairlee, bassoon; Gene Hull, saxophone; and William Ensign, drums. Also featured will be a trumpet trio, consisting of William Arzbeacher, Charles McCabe, and William Graham.
This year marks the completion of a three-year cycle of tours by the concert band. In 1948, the band traveled East, while last year they journeyed South. This same three-year cycle will be followed in the future.
Mr. Hope explained the two-fold purpose of these annual trips by saying, “These tours are designed to make new friends for the University and the band. Also, they are intended to be a reward to the members of the band for the many long hours of rehearsal. We plan the trips so that a three-year member can see most of the country.”
Following is the itinerary of the tour: April 9 (Easter Sunday)—Sterling, Ill.
April 10—Eppingham, Ill.
April 11 and 12—Open.
April 13—McPherson, Kan.
April 14—Norton, Kan.
April 15—North Platte, Neb.
April 16—Cheyenne, Wyo.
April 17—Open.
April 18—Colorado Springs, Colo.
Upon their return to Notre Dame, the band will begin preparations for a Spring Concert to be held in the Drill Hall on April 26.
Welsh Poet's Reading Draws Big Crowds
Dylan Thomas, Welsh poet, gave a reading of contemporary poetic works in Washington Hall last week before a large gathering of students and faculty members.	rS
Mr. Thomas has been touring the country for several weeks. Working towards New York City, he plans to continue his one night speaking engagements for several more weeks at college campuses and lecture halls across the states.
Just before reading several of his own works during his lecture, Mr. Thomas made a statement that called for clarification. He said that he was not satisfied with his own work and in the future hoped to change the tone ' of his poems.
In a hurried interview with the Scholastic after his lecture, Mr. Thomas made this and several other things clear. He began by explaining that the major reason for his tour is not to read his own works. He hopes to introduce to the American public as many of the newer English poets as possible by reading their poems to his audiences.
Mr. Thomas next explained his dissatisfaction with his work to date. He explained, “The world needs poems of happiness. It is the function of some poet to make a statement against the Atom Bomb and the horrors of death by power politics. I am going to attempt to fill that role.”
The closing comment of Mr. Thomas had little connection with his work or lecture. Evelyn Waugh during his visit to the Notre Dame campus last year stated that he was amazed not to find a tankard of ale at the end of each station in the dining hall. As Mr. Thomas left Washington Hall, he voiced his hearty approval to this observation.
“There is nothing,” he said, “more relaxing than a good glass of beer. If you can suggest a spot I’d be glad to answer all your questions. Nothing like a good drink, don’t you agree?” Agreed, but—Roger Vorce

ND Mail Always Goes Through
Volume of Mail Has Enlarged With the University, > X But the Post Office Is Prepared for Twice as Much
_	By HUGH SCHADLE
» ■
Ever since the days of the Pony Express “the mail” has maintained a fairly well-preserved precedent for always “going through.” To see that the tradition continues as far as Notre Dame is concerned, the Holy Cross Brothers, as distributors and receivers of the local mail, perform a task that is vital in preserving the peace of the collective student mind. Since the University began, the fl post office, manned by the Brothers, has been the middle-man for the all-important communications between the Notre Dame student and the outside world.
In the course of its history, the post office has operated from various spots on the campus. Only recently, in 1934, was the building it now occupies erected for its private use. Before that time, the P.O. utilized part of a small building on the southeast corner of the campus which now serves exclusively as the chemistry library.
The smallness of the post office building may be misleading with regard to the size of the work done within. Brother Marcellinus, present post master who has occupied that position since 1945, estimated that a grand total of some 5000 letters pass through both “incoming” and “outgoing” mail slots each twenty-four hours.
“The student body has grown quite a p bit in the past few years,” Brother
One of eleven clerks hands out package.

smiled, “and the size of the daily mail has grown with it. I suppose we have approximately 400 parcels going out each day for the two or three hundred that come in.
“The fact that Notre Dame is almost exclusively a boarding-school accounts largely for the size of the mail we handle,” Brother continued. “I think we could handle a great deal more, though. Our facilities here could probably serve about 7000 students, which would mean twice as much mail as we now have.”
Regarding the size of the Notre Dame post office in comparison with those of other universities. Brother was unable to give an estimate.
“Most schools depend on a city post office system, especially if they are located in the immediate down-town district,” he noted. “Here, we operate as a separate post office altogether. Our outgoing mail is made up for the various departing trains and the truck picks up the incoming bags directly from the station. The mail coming in at night, of course, is handled for us by South Bend till we can pick it up next morning.”
A further consideration in the rapidly increasing activity of the local mail service is the recent decision of St. Mary’s to discontinue its function as a separate post office. Since Jan. 1, St. Mary’s has had what Brother Marcellinus calls a “ ‘station’ office,” and depends entirely on Notre Dame for its connections with the various trains.
To cope with its growing responsibility, the post office employs a force of eleven clerks. The group, excluding Brother Marcellinus, is staffed by six members of the order, including Brothers Ramon, Ives, Donan, Flavius, and Francis de Paul. Another member of the order, Brother Eli, serves as Civil Service secretary and is in charge of bulletins, reports, and dispatches to and from the government. To qualify as clerks, the Brothers must take Civil Service examinations just as regular government employees. Brother Marcellinus, as post master, receives a presidential appointment.
The postition of assistant post master is filled by Mr. Irvin G. Alber of South Bend, and two students, Morrissey Hall
Sophomore William Cuddy and Senior Charles Lutz, who lives off-campus, serve as special delivery clerks.
According to Brother Marcellinus, the heaviest part of the post office work-day is divided between early morning, from 6:30 till 7:30, and late afternoon, from 4:00 till 5:C0.
“After opening in the morning- we naturally have an over-night accumulation of out-going mail to take care of,” Brother explained, “plus the early-morning letters being posted. From 7:30 on, however, the day is fairly routine, except for an increase of business at the windows around noon-hour. By 4:00, however, most of the trains are arriving, and we have the bulk of our incoming mail to handle.”
As far as local mail delivery is concerned, it is not a direct function of the post office. Student deliverers are hired by the University,.from four to six, de-, pending on the size of the hall itself. And, despite some student suspicions to the contrary, Brother Marcellinus revealed that the. mail is delivered three times a day.
The private boxes within the post office are mostly reserved for business mail. The various colleges, the library, and many campus organizations, such as the Knights of Columbus, the Catholic Action Club, and the WND radio sta-

tion, have a private box. Vetville mail is also received through the boxes and one box is allotted to each Vetville building unit of three apartments.
As to the all-important question of which times are most advantageous for mailing letters to insure quick delivery, Brother Marcellinus was anxious to dispel many false notions.
"To make certain that a letter will be on the various departing trains during the day, students should mail their letters before 7 a. m., 10:30 a. m., and 4:30 p. m.,” he advised. “The best connections in general with both eastbound and westbound trains and the airlines are to be made around noon. Therefore, to gain the greatest advantage regarding the time element, letters should be posted at least by 11:15 a. m.”
Concerning the eventual suspicions of some letter-deficient students that the post office must be secreting a large part of the mail, Brother Marcellinus explained that the time consumed before a student receives an incoming letter depends entirely on the hour the letter arrives. Those arriving on the evening trains, of course, do not reach Notre Dame till the next morning. Others, arriving during the day, may be in front of the student’s ' door within three or four hours after the train pulls in.
Students unable to stand the suspense of unreceived mail, therefore, can probably only find solace through investments in wireless telegraphy.
Now, where’s that mailman?
Pre-Regis+ration Set Monday for Courses

the Commerce Building. All students will be notified by letter.
Law students will report to Dean Clarence E. Manion in the Law Building as announced in all Law Classes and on the Law bulletin board.
Engineering students will report to Dean Karl E. Schoenherr according to a schedule to be posted on the bulletin boards.
For the student who fails to preregister with his dean for courses at the time fixed for him, there is a fee of $10 for registration, payable in advance of the regular registration.
The student obligates himself to take the courses for which he pre-registers. Therefore, before pre-registration he should carefully consult the current academic Bulletin for his particular college before the time of pre-registration.
Any student intending to earn credit in a summer session at another school this Summer toward his degree at Notre Dame, must call at the Dean’s Office and bring with him a copy of the Summer bulletin, or complete information concerning the courses he plans to take. Failure to secure necessary authorization in advance may result in loss of credit for the summer’s work.
If a student’s plans for the Fall Semester are indefinite, mention should
be made of this fact at pre-registration. All cancellations in pre-registration must be made before July 31, 1950.
Students interested in working for a teacher’s certificate should consult Mr. Bernard J. Kohlbrenner, head of the Department of Education, Room 125 of the Social Science Building, concerning the course requirements of the various states.
Oratory Contest Sponsored By Department of Speech
A Freshman oratorical contest, open to any student who has not completed two semesters of undergraduate work, is being sponsored by the Department of Speech. A preliminary contest will be held on Friday, April 21, and the finals will be conducted the following Wednesday.

What’s Wrong With the Notre Dame Student?
The now-famous Thomas Kelleghan has dropped the question of “What’s Wrong With the Scholastic” to tackle this more basic issue. You may not wholeheartedly agree with his thesis, but his article is sound and provocative.
By TOM KELLEGHAN
rpHE far-famed but nebulous spirit of Notre Dame has defied definition in the past, and is likely to do so for some time in the future. Nevertheless, one thing about it is certain—it should be in the student body, and be manifested primarily by the students.
Furthermore, if this spirit does exist among the students of Notre Dame, it should be apparent not only in their religious and academic life, but especially in their extra-curricular activities, for it is in this branch of university life that students have the widest opportunities to express themselves and the effects of their education.
At this point it is necessary to construct at least a notion of the spirit of Notre Dame. As Notre Dame is a Catholic institution of higher learning, the spirit which prevails in its student body should be manifest with the character and purpose of Catholic college education. Rev. Leo R. Ward, C.S.C., professor of philosophy at Notre Dame, has defined the purpose and nature of a Catholic university: “In the Christian school we are obliged to know .... in subordination to and in proper and vital integration with theology, the highest theoretic Christian wisdom, and this we can never do unless we live as Christians.” He also states that the aim of a university is the cultivation of the intellectual virtues. Student participation in this purpose of university education, may, for our purposes, be termed studential life, and prudence, “the intellectual virtue of knowing how to live” thereby becomes directly involved. It is in this sense that the spirit of Notre Dame should be spoken of as essentially studential.
“As a Man Is ... ”
Father Ward states further, on the topic of university education, that “As a man is, so he does: as he is, in other words, so he lives- . . . The important point is that what he can and will approve will be things like his way of life.” Here the question of Notre Dame’s student organizations may be raised for they indicate in a very definite way how the Notre Dame student lives, and in turn, what he is. The social organizations, in short, comprise that phase of the University’s extra-curricular life
® March 24, 1950
which should be particularly illustrative of the spirit of Notre Dame. Consequently, the question: do Notre Dame’s social clubs indicate a studential way of life, or something else?
Before directly answering this question, it will be necessary, and interesting, to know a little of the history of the student social groups at the University. In the past, clubs at Notre Dame have been primarily devoted to the cultivation of the “whole man;” they presented a program which included Mortimer Adler’s four ends of liberal education: acquisition of the abilities to read, write, speak, and listen, plus a fifth—necessary in a Catholic school—the ability to pray. A single club’s activities were such as to demand of its members a total studential participation—debates, drama, dances, talks by faculty members, religious affairs, etc. Moreover, close faculty cooperation with these student groups was encouraged by the very nature of the organizations. Teachers had much in common with students who wished to develop their “whole” selves, with primary emphasis on the cultivation of the mind.
Changes Take Place
But at the turn of the century, during what Carlton J. H. Hayes has called “A Generation of Materialism,” radical changes began to take place in the student body. Social groups suddenly began to lose their broad studential character and as a natural consequence faculty participation declined rapidly. No longer were the students desirous of learning to think, speak, read, listen, and pray as they could only among themselves. Sensualism, the offspring of materialism, had reared its insidious head, and geographical clubs arose with amazing acceleration, all of them dedicated to ends of purely physical, sensate activities. Their devotion to one facet of student life inaugurated a split of the studential nature all clubs should possess that is ramifying to the present day.
At the same time, competitive sports received an impetus that propelled the University into a temporary sports craze. Athletic teams mushroomed all over the campus, and sports became the order of the day. Eventually the mania settled down to a reverent awe for varsity sports. In the interim true physical
training had been last for the majority of students.
Significantly, the Scholastic in the early years of the twentieth century began complaining of a lack of student contributions. This loss of active interest in student publications has persisted to the present day, forcing a few overburdened students to produce magazines which have often reflected a lack of integration with the student body as a whole.
Spirit Slackens
Furthermore, the intense interest which the students had in oratory and debate during the early years of this century slackened, and a University which boasted nearly a dozen debating teams has today only one. The obvious value of public speaking to any college graduate precludes elaboration.
The inter-hall competitive spirit, of which debate teams, sports, etc., were an integral part, then slowly disintegrated, and a major component of the old spirit of Notre Dame began to leave the student body. This misfortune has been sapping the vitality and traditions of the students ever since.
It should be emphasized that this sudden collapse of the studential character of social life was not immediately complete, nor is it today. There are still alive a few groups striving valiantly to return a character to the clubs more in harmony with Catholic higher education.
Nor did the educational policies and program of the University have anything to do with the desertion of the student body to the forces of materialism. The criticisms common today of specialization, departmentalization, etc., could not be hurled then and discipline was far more rigid than it is today. Hence the fault lies entirely in the student body.
Now the question posed previously may be answered. Notre Dame’s social clubs today do not indicate a studential way of life, i.e., they are not, either individually or as a whole, in harmony with the nature and aims of Catholic higher education. They reveal another way of life the nature of which can-be summarized under four major defects

Palais Royale Houses Everything From Primo Camera
And Chief Eagle to Harry James and Notre Dame Dances


©
,,New York' has its Garden and Starlight Roof; Chicago, its Stadium and Pump Room; and South Bend, its Palais Royale. To seven million Knickerbockers, Madison Square Garden is the Mecca of Sports and the Starlight Roof, the City’s best dance spot. Chicago’s four million boast the Stadium and the Pump Room. Here in South Bend, the Palais does double duty, housing on successive nights the National AAU regional boxing bouts and the best in the nation’s list of top bands.
In a city of approximately 135,000, the Palais pulls off the dual role mighty well. Though its capacity for boxing and wrestling matches is roughly oneseventh that of the Garden, the big hall has billed many of the top names in both sports through the years. It was in May of last year that Heavyweight Champion Ezzard Charles appeared in an exhibition bout at the Palais, and some of the “groan and grunt” sport’s best — Primo Camera and Chief Don Eagle — have gone through their- acts before a full house.
Home of Big Dances
But the Palais is best known to Notre Dame men as the home of the student body’s big dances. The Senior Ball, Junior Prom and Soph Cotillion have all been held there on an almost perpetual contract. The pre-Lenten
Mardi Gras dance netted a sizeable profit when located in the city’s dance hall. Almost all of the local high school proms are sponsored at the Palais, when they can be run in between Chief Eagle and a touring band.
It is only natural that the Palais should throw its doors open three or four nights a week to the dancing populace. When it was built (in 1926) and doing a boom business in the ’30’s, dancing was its meal ticket. Six nights a week music of a sort blared out over the floor filled with pleasure seeking throngs trying to forget the black days of the early decade. Later, as the depression period eased off and a hint of prosperity tinged the land, the Palais opened its area of entertainment and brought to its customers a variety of shows. But it was the taxi dance days of the late ’20’s and early ’3 O’s which made for the big hall the name ‘’Million Dollar Ballroom” and brought the Casa Loma band of Glen Gray to its bandstand.
In 1945, when the present management under Mr. Ed Makar took over, the Palais opened its season with Sammy Kaye and his swing and sway boys. Right on the heels of Mr. Kaye’s poetry and soft music came the “Sentimental Gentleman,” Tommy Dorsey, and the Palais had really hit the big time with a bang. James, Masters, Martin,
Spivak, they all followed the circuit into South Bend and into the Palais. Cavalero, Lawrence, and others of the music world’s big boys played for ND functions there. The only top band in the country which hasn’t unpacked its ' instruments in Mr. Makar’s music hall is Guy Lombardo, the perennial ruler of New York’s Roosevelt Grill.
New ND Policy
The Office of Student Welfare has inaugurated a new policy this year, contracting with the Palais management an agreement which practically turns the place over to Notre Dame. Ac- ’ cording to the agreement, Notre Dame is given priority on about twenty dates at a rental price of S35 per engagement. Approximately ten of these dates will be filled this semester, including the Junior Prom slated for the 21st of April. The remaining dates are set for next Fall, to include all the Victory Dances previously held in the ‘Navy Drill Hall.
And the Palais is getting ready for the Notre Dame invasion. Later this year the interior of the hall is going to be remodeled completely. The dance floor will take a slash in size from 80 by 115 — its present dimensions'— to 70 by 55, providing adequate room to . obtain the new cabaret effect desired.
Palais Royale becomes South Bend's Madison Square Garden Sports arena is quickly transformed into dance hall for Notre each week when grunt and groan boys and following take over. Dame formal. The place is well-known to all Irish party-goers.

Clock Watchers
Editor:
The Scholastic does it again. On page 20 of last week’s issue you have a picture of two students signing in with a student watchman. The caption says they are signing in before midnight. Who’s lying? You or the clock that says 12:24?
Dick Rogers
Editor:
The caption under one of the pictures in the article “Student Watchman” (Scholastic, March 17) stated: “Two students sign in before midnight under the watchful eye of a student prefect.” The watchful eye failed to detect that the clock on the table indicated the time to be 12:23.
The men of Alumni would welcome this watchman with reclining easychair, free cigars and the latest copies of Esquire if he’d take up his duties in our hall.	Bill Conroy
Excellent Excerpts
Editor:
I would like to congratulate Scholastic, and especially Al Laporte for the excellent editing of excerpts from the “old” Scholastic. You did very well to capture in so little space the very essence of that older magazine.
Yet, I was a little disappointed by your insistence on reprinting merely a portion of each article. I suppose you were interested in selecting only the best of each, but in my case I found myself just becoming interested in many of the articles when three little periods (. - .) abruptly interrupted me.
Not only that, you left me with no easy way of looking up the articles which interested me. (I thought that it is customary to indicate the specific issue, etc., from which quotations are taken). Now I don’t know whether I can find all the references in one issue, or if I have to find a different issue for each.
As I say, I liked the little items which you quoted, but I wonder if you were really being fair. After all, if you are trying to prove something about the “old” Scholastic, don’t you think it is only fair-play to quote more than just the best passages. Even I have to admit that there might be some slightly worse parts to the beautiful selections you gave us.
But thank you just the same for your
very sincere interest in tradition and in matters that aren’t purely news.

We are sorry to have flub bed-up. Ironic reader, however, may thumb through old Scholastic’s ivhenever he ivants in the Publication Office. We will supply the references.—Editor
Loss: $13
Editor:
I would like to take advantage of your facilities to make an appeal. On March 21 a sum of money amounting to approximately $13 was taken from my wallet in the student dressing room in the basement of the “Rock.” At first, when I discovered the loss I couldn’t believe that the money had been stolen. But after searching for it in my other clothes and my room I realized that it had actually been taken.
Now to some, $13 may not mean too much, but to me it means a train ticket home at Easter time plus a certain amount of living expenses. If the person who has taken the money should see this, and decide that I need it more than he does, I would be very grateful if he would put it in an envelope and mail it to me at 206 Badin Hall.
If he happens to be a Catholic, I think he would also be doing himself a favor in the long run, for restoration of goods is essential for confession of sins of this type.

I see St. Patty’s day (’tho McGoldrick and Thoren bewail its lack of Notre Dame observance) had its effect on the make-up of last week’s Scholastic. The clock on page 20’s foto is an hour ahead of the cut-line, and then there’s that SNAFU’s head duplication on page 24.
Congratulations on the LaPorte article (Excerpts from ye olde Scholastix). Kelleghan may be Irish, but his “Gay Ninety-ish” reasoning isn’t beautiful.

What with all the colds around campus and the flu and everything, I don’t think it’s very safe. I know a lot of people in the infirmary and they tell me there are more people over there with these colds and things than even on my floor and it’s bad enough on my floor.

Dillon’s Rec Room Opens With Hot Dog, Pop Party
Dillon Hall’s new lounge room was officially opened last Monday night with hot dogs, pop and community singing * highlighting the festivities.
The room is not yet completed according to the Rev. Lawrence Broestl, C.S.C., hall rector. Some seven pieces of furniture are yet to come before the project is finished. Total cost in converting what was formerly a trunk room to a pleasant, well-decorated lounge is about $2,000.
At the Monday night opening, Father Broestl thanked the Dillonites for their £ cooperation in making the room pos- " sible. Assisting Father Broestl in the planning and construction was Roy Strickfaden.
College Parade
In case you’re worried" about what to wear this summer when you go to those many formal dances, the Varsity Neivs of the University of Detroit announces that “the summer white tux is definitely out, and is being replaced by a smooth pearl grey jacket. Looks very masculine and breath-taking accompanied by maroon bow tie and boutonniere.”
The Duquesne University Duke celebrated its 25th birthday with a mammoth 52-page special Silver Anniversary edition. The issue summarized the history of the University during the 25 years of the Duke’s tenure. Former-ND football coach Elmer Layden, also former head coach at Duquesne, received bravos and huzzas throughout the paper.
The Connecticut Campus reports the opening of their North Campus snack bar. Since Notre Dame already has the Huddle and the “snack bar” in the Caf, we can see that our campus is really up-to-date.
At DePauw University last Wednesday voting began on one of the most unique contests in the world. The contest is for picking “the ugliest male!” For each ballot a nickel is charged with the funds collected going to the Red Cross. Why doesn’t Notre Dame have a “Pick the worst prof contest”? Any worthy charity would certainly gain.

Bengal Bouts Begin Monday Evening

Purdue Relays End Indoor Track Season ® As Coach Handy Takes Stars to Lafayette
By TED PRAHINSKI
The local indoor track season comes to a close tomorrow at the Purdue Relays in the host school’s big fieldhouse.
It’s been a long indoor season and Coach Doc Handy, appreciative of the fact that his boys will start an even longer- outdoor season in just two more weeks, will take just a few men down to the meet and will let the rest of the squad take a well earned vacation.
Competing for- Notre Dame tomorrow will be the top individual stars, shot putter Johnny Helwig, pole vaulter Jim Miller, and possibly hurdler Bill Fleming along with two relay teams, the mile and two-mile groups.
These two relay combos represented the school last Saturday at the Chicago
Relays. The mile team spun around the boards in 3 minutes 23.7 seconds to take third, just 1.4 seconds behind winner- Illinois. Purdue was second. Anchorman Bob Boyne, a junior engineering student who had just turned 20 three days before, started his quartermile leg in third place, lost it to Wisconsin with a lap to go, but then came back to nail the Badger runner at the tape. Third leg man Paul Schwetsch-enau ran his 440 yards in under -50 seconds to give Boyne his third place start.
The two mile squad ran a fast 7:57 at Chicago but still was only able to take fourth. Winner Michigan State ran a sizzling 7:40.6 to break the meet (Continued on Page 29)
4,000 Fans to Watch Ring Classic Opener
The 19th annual Bengal Bouts, Notre Dame’s contribution to fistiana, will be inaugurated next Monday night in the Old Gym. Some 4,000 followers of the squared ring are expected to comfortably fill the ancient arena as the first of five festivity filled nights are unfurled. The fans will come to witness the devastating ability of the five exchamps when pitted against the determination and courage of the unknown youngsters who will attempt to dethrone them.
The heavyweights in general, in “Zip” Roemer in particular, will be carefully scrutinized by the public.- The granddaddy of the classic will seek his second consecutive heavyweight title to befriend his middleweight and two lightheavyweight crowns. The way is once again barred by big Gus Cifelli, but toughies like Mike Merrigan, the bolo punching king of last year’s lightheavies, and Russ Skall, the youth who worried Jim Martin in the- ’48 finals, may prevent another Roemer-Cifelli meeting. The rugged South Bender, because of his added experience and topnotch physical condition, rates as the favorite.
Three leading contenders will aim for Mike Merrigan’s vacated light-heavyweight crown. Frank Tripodi and Bill Sheehan are expected to settle the issue on Saturday night, but Aaron Dyson may be the fly in the ointment. Either Tom Carroll or Chai-ley King should be the fourth man in the semi-finals.
Two more of last year’s finalists will probably be among Saturday’s sweet sixteen. Joe Fallon outclassed by the heavier Merrigan last year, and Dick Hyland, the lanky redhead with the slapping punch are the choices in the 167-pound class.
Ed Smith’s second straight 157-pound title will surprise no one. The youth who plays possum while his opponent exerts himself and then explodes with a double fisted barrage, seems impregnable. Joe Brown will be the other man in the ring. Dick Windishar, Dan Finn, Ed Callahan, and Jim Engels are the other starters. Last year, Smith scored a T.K.O. over Jack Mahoney in

the preliminaries and clear cut decisions over Dan Finn and Dick Hyland in his final two appearances.
Perhaps the best boxer in the University is Vic Roblez. The king of the 147-pound class in no uncertain manner disposed of Joe Brown in last year’s finale. John O’Brien, a brave youth from Green Bay, Wisconsin, will attempt the virtually impossible when he meets Roblez. Vic has no apparent weakness. Although very fast on his feet, a vicious right is his stock in trade. The spectators’ delight would be a match pitting Ed Smith against Vic.
The 137-pound division has an ample supply of contenders. The crown is presently held by defending champ Joe Sterret but Leo Hickey, George Chopp, and Dan Brennan will attempt to dislodge it. Chopp hopes to be spared the rigors of the three consecutive nights of boxing which confronted him last year. While Chopp prefers less fighting, Hickey feels that added experience is the solution to his problem.
The 1949 semi-finalist, Sal Fiorella, is the sole veteran in the 127-pound class. A handful of newcomers will compete for the honor of meeting the New York City lad in the Saturday night opener.
Reports from the various ticket agencies on campus and in town indicate that last year’s five-night record of 17,371 paid admissions may well be surpassed. Knights of Columbus co-chairmen Dick Cullen and Bob Savage will direct the five-night tournament and will turn over the proceeds to the Holy Cross India mission. The Bengals will highlight and terminate the sports activities of the lenten season.
Fencers End Season; Face NCAA Tourney
After winning their nine previous matches this year with almost ridiculous ease, the Irish fencers closed the regular season here last Saturday night with their most decisive victory of all against the University of Cincinnati. Instead of walking away with the match in the fieldhouse as usual, the boys won it all over- town — some in their rooms, a few in the Colfax. The contest was forfeited to us by the duelists from the Ohio Basin.
For three of the squad, however, the NCAA Fencing Championships to be held next weekend at Wayne University in Detroit remains to be won before they can hang their swords on the wall for another summer. Representing Notre Dame will be Captain Bob Schlosser and his sabre, Nick Scalera with the foil, and Ralph Dixon in the

epee. Schlosser and Dixon, with marks of 23-3 and 22-4 hold all-time Notre Dame seasonal records, while Scalera’s 23-3 is the second best ever attained in the foil division.
Commenting on the coming tournament, Coach Herb Melton cites New York University, Navy, and CCNY as the teams to beat. They ran 1-2-3 in the Eastern Intercollegiate tourney held last week, and regard the Irish as “a dark horse entry from the Midwest.” Melton also pulled a Leahyism when he said, “If everything goes as it should, we ought to finish among the top ten.”—Joe Straub
O'Shea, Foley Star In Globe+roHer Tilt
Kevin O’Shea and John Foley of Notre Dame basketball fame joined other midwestern all-stars to almost stop the famed Harlem Globetrotters in Chicago. The Harlem lads had to forego their usual clown antics and buckle down to squeeze out a 69-66 victory over the college seniors.
John Foley led the Stars in the contest against the ’Trotters with 14 points. Right behind him was his Irish teammate, Kevin O’Shea who netted 13.
The next night found O’Shea teaming up with Butler’s Ralph “Buckshot” O’Brien to try and stop the Indianapolis Olympians headed by Alex Groza and Ralph Beard. The former Kentucky lads were just too good and handed the Indiana All-Stars an 84-74 defeat.
O’Shea will join a team of college all-stars in Chicago April 2 to get another whack at the Globetrotters in ? what will be the first in an 18-game nationwide series between the two teams.	•

Still No Answer
Dear Mr. Monahan: Thank you for your enlightening letter on just why the O’Donnell Trophy is currently resting on the floor of Charlie Callahan’s office, but tsk, tsk, tsk, Mr. Monahan, you didn’t answer our question in your blast. If this picture taking ever does come off, then what happens to the trophy? Is it going to suffer the same ©fate as the Williams Trophy and “be tucked away in the obscurity of Charlie Callahan’s office . . . ? Or is it going to be put in a more appropriate place such as the Rockne Memorial foyer?”
Another question — just who is the “proper custodian” of the trophy? If, as in the case of the Williams' Trophy, it’s Charlie Callahan, undoubtedly the National Championship prize will “be tucked away in the obscurity of Charlie Callahan’s office with the Williams Trophy.”
Student Trip
We were wondering when the Student Council was going to start the ball rolling on plans for next year’s student trip. Now that the Council has taken action, let’s hope they push the deal through soon instead of letting it stay on docket a couple of months before doing anything about it. Last year, the site was picked and plans were in the formative stage two weeks after the Spring semester began.
The result of this early bird planning was that the students got top-notch seats for the North Carolina game. In 1946, arrangements for the Army game weren’t made soon enough and the Notre Dame student body ended up in the pits of Yankee Stadium. Let’s have a repeat on ’49, not ’46.
Time Out
Rumor around the Fieldhouse has it that Dan Bagley is the man elected to lead the Irish netmen for the 1950-51 campaign. Chicagoan Dan was the third high scorer on this year's quintet, his first in varsity competition.
CCC Gets a New Home
It looks as though the CCC indoor meet -will be held as usual next year and the years following despite the Joss of
March 24, 1950
Michigan State and the use of their spacious Jenison Fieldhouse to the Western Conference. The CCC’s friend in need is none other than the athletically de-em-phasized University of Chicago.
The Maroons offered the use of their fieldhouse for this year’s CCC meet but the CCC officials declined in favor of Michigan State since it was the Spartan’s farewell appearance in the show they have dominated the past couple of years. When the Spartans called off the meet because of the coal shortage, efforts were made to secure the University of Chicago Fieldhouse but unfortunately it had been leased out by then and would not be available to the CCC for that weekend. However, Chicago extended an invitation to the CCC to hold their mid-winter extravaganza in the Chicago fieldhouse in the future. It looks as though the offer will be accepted.
On Cartier Field
Spring practice began last week but the men of Leahy were forced to hold their first practice in the Fieldhouse because of snow on Cartier Field. Frank Leahy wasn’t his old pessimistic self, however. As a matter of fact, the Head Irishman was a bit optimistic, “If we can get past our very first game with North Carolina it will take a pretty strong team to beat us,” remarked the Master.
The Irish are overstocked in some departments while others suffered heavy losses through graduation. It looks like a general overhaul is in the making to distribute the talent more evenly. Bill Flynn will be moved from his end position to help out the tackle situation and Byron Boji will make the switch from center to guard.
Many a time we’ve wanted to see John Petitbon running with the ball instead of after the ball-carrier and it looks like this will be the case come fall.
Del Gander and Dave Flood are a couple of other swifties that will be on hand to give the Irish one of the fastest backfields in the country. There are a lot of good sophomores around that didn’t clock much playing time last fall and the slack left by graduation will mainly be taken up by them. Even at this early date, it looks like another great year for the Irish.
Irish Nine in Tune-Up For Opener April 11
By BILL DELANEY
The 1.949 NCAA District 4 Champs are in the process of tuning up for the 1950 season. The largest number of candidates ever to turn out for the team faced Coach Jake Kline in the fieldhouse about five weeks ago ready and eager to start spring practice. Since then many have dropped by the wayside and more will be cut before the first game of the season, against Iowa, on April 11. The majority of those who turned out were sophomores, many up from last year’s freshma.n squad. Capt. Tom Martin heads the list of men returning from last year’s highly successful team.
There is one sure starter who can be picked even at this early date, Dick Giedlin. Dick is as neat a first baseman as could be wanted anywhere. He can field as well as most major leaguers and he is an exceptionally fine lefthanded hitter. Ed Foley, big sophomore first sacker, will back up Dick and may get some chances as a pinch hitter. The opening-day lineup will probably start with Dick at first and number four in the batting order.
At second there is a slight problem, just as at short and at third. Three sophomore infielders have been looking very good as a unit and they might very well stay together as starters. Dan Nespo, Jim Manning, and John Cunningham are all sure fielders and good hitters, with Cunningham holding the edge at the plate. John bats right handed while both Dan and Jim bat from the left side.
Joe Judge, a junior- who filled in capably last year for Co-Capt. Benny Kozlik and won a monogram while doing so, has the experience over Nespo and it may be that he will get the nod at second base. Joe Pfaff, another soph, transplanted from third, is also a likely contender. Sophomore Tom Keilty looks good afield and at the plate.
It looks like Manning at short, although Bob McGrath and Jus Perticone are right behind him to take over in case he falls down on the job. With Jim at short and Joe at second, Notre Dame should have a pretty good double play combo.
Crowding John Cunningham at the hot corner are a couple of men from last year’s squad, Capt. Tommy Martin and Charlie Kreis. Both are essentially outfielders but can perform with equal ability in the infield. Another sopho-
23
more, Pasquale Tannone, is hoping that both Martin and Kreis go back to the outfield for keeps.
Left handed outfielders returning from last year’s team are Jim Gillis, Jean Ferryman, Don Grieve, and Tom McHale. All are good, experienced fielders and hitters. Swinging from the other side of the plate are more returnees in Tom Martin, Charlie Kreis and Ralph Sjoberg. A number of sophs have shown up well but it is very doubtful whether any of them will see action in this coming campaign. Two Kings, Bob and Tom (no relation), Matt Kerger and Paul Mazza all look good. For opening day it looks like Martin in left, Gillis in center, and McHale or Grieve in right.
Coach Kline has no complaints coming about the size of his pitching staff, but as to the quality he makes no comment at this time. Two of last season’s five top hurlers are still around and ready to go. Bob Nemes and Tony Lipton are both right handers and they will probably carry the bulk of the starting assignments. They will be backed up by such holdovers from last year’s reserves as Jack Hil-brich, Mike McGrath, George Saad and Bob Schriner, all righties. A host of sophomores look good, among them lefties Jerry Ledwidge, Tom Kelley, and Ron Zier; and righties Frank Ronnen

berg, Charlie DePreckel and John O’Neill.
Most of the catching duties this season will be shared by Dick Maher and Tom Boland. Dick is the better receiver and should do most of the work behind the plate. Sophomore catchers Joe Moriarity and Jack Manning seem to be the best of the rest. Moriarity looks good enough now to cause the veteran catchers to work a little harder for their positions. Charlie Wolfe, a senior, is rounding into shape and might get some chances before the sga-•son is over.
In summing up, it looks like another successful season is in the making for the Notre Dame nine. The “old vets” should give the team balance and poise while the sophs, the rookies, will give it fire and determination. Our opening day lineup, then, will look something like this: Pitcher, Nemes or Lipton; catcher, Maher; first base, Gieldin; second base, Judge; short, Manning; third base, Cunningham; left, Martin; center, Gillis; right, McHale or Grieve.
After the opener on April 11 in Iowa City, the Irish nine will play 25 other games. The longest trip will send the local crew to Minneapolis for two games with the University of Minnesota. Western Michigan will close the season for the Irish with a game on Cartier field on June 3.
Howard Hall Tankers Edge Farley Squad
Last Wednesday night the finals in the Interhall Swimming Meet were held at the Rock with the aquamen from Howard edging out the freshmen from Farley by the margin of a mere three points to take the campus crown. Howard collected a sum of 36 points to

two halls that the third place team, Cavanaugh, only managed to gather eight points. The fourth and fifth place teams, Breen-Phillips and Sorin, had seven and five points respectively.
The individual contests were fairly well equally divided among the teams. In the 150-yard medley relay, the team of Wilfred Georgen, Milton Hillman, and Frank Harrison from Howard was victorious, winning the race in 1:34.0.	*
Farley and Sorin finished second and third respectively. Paul Quinn of Farley won the 200-yard free style race in 2:29.3. Moroney of Howard and Eilers of Cavanaugh took second and third. In the 50-yard free style, Jim Flood, also of Farley, took first while Tom Durand of Cavanaugh and Bill Dalton of Howard gathered points with second and third places. Flood’s time for the 50 yards was an excellent 25.8.
Frank Harrison, Ted Delyra, and ~ Milton Hillman made it a celan sweep for Howard in the 50-yard breast stroke, taking all three places. Harrison’s time was 34.2. In low board diving, Bob Bickert of Farley increased his team’s total by capturing first place. Bob’s point total was 188.5, as compared to second-place Jaime Saenz of Breen-Phillips, whose total was 176.3. The freshmen continued to dominate the diving event when Steve George -

Shot-Puffing Helwigs Bolster ND Trackmen; California Brothers Star in Irish Athletics
By JIM BRISLIN
Interhall diver takes off from low board
Things looked so dark at the beginning of this track season that Coach Doc Handy took to inserting ads in this publication in the hope that some hitherto unknown talent might be found. There was one department, however, which gave Handy not even the slightest trouble. This was the shotput and the answer is found in 100 Walsh Hall, for therein reside the Helwig brothers, Joe and John, who, with hurdler Bill Fleming and pole-vaulter Jim Miller, form the backbone of this year’s track team.
Outside the shadow of the Golden Dome, Helwig is just another name in the star-studded cast that gave Frank Leahy his fourth consecutive undefeated season here at Notre Dame, but there is quite a story behind the careers of these two Irish athletes.
Both were born in Los Angeles, Calif., attended Mt. Carmel High School there, and are now in the College of Commerce. But there ends the comparison. While one has gone from success to success in the field of athletics the other has been ever plagued by an unsmiling fate.
Older brother Joe—who is now 24 and will graduate in January—is the hard-luck half of the brother combination. Joe came to Notre Dame in 1946 afterserving a two and a half year hitch with the Navy in the Pacific, and reported immediately for football practice at Cartier Field. He never earned a mono
*• of the meet. However, a second place _ by Howard ended any hopes of a Far-kO ley victory. The winning team composed of Don Gill, Frank Santangelo, Jim Flood, and Paul Quinn swam a very fast 200 yards but it was not enough to beat the mighty men from Howard. Breen-Phillips took third place in the event.
All in all the meet was a huge success. Gil Burdick deserves a vote of thanks for conducting the meet so well. This meet, as all other interhall activi-V	7
ties, brought out some of the good swimming talent hidden on the campus that could possibly be put into a top notch inter-collegiate team. Maybe sometime in the near future the Athletic Association will see a way in which this talent can be put to better use in the form of a Notre Dame swimming team. Present plans for the future campus auditorium-gymnasium t call for a swimming pool among the many other- features of the structure.

gram, however, for he was hampered almost from the start by a knee injury which caused him to give up the sport entirely in 1948. After this misfortune,
John (left) and Joe Helwig
Joe last year turned his attention to mastering the art of shot-putting and is looking forward to earning his first monogram at the ball-pitching sport. His best effort to date has been a 48’ 6” heave, but his steady improvement in this new skill indicates that he should gather quite a few points before the end of this track season.
On the other hand, it seems that every task begun by the twenty-two year old John developed into a letter-winning performance. He has won three monograms at Notre Dame so far—two in track and one in football—and, as he is a cinch to grab another in each of the aforementioned sports, will have gathered five before graduation in January of next year.
Although none can deny that John was a very important cog in last season’s football machine, his greatest skill lies in his ability to toss the sixteen-pound shot. This was time even in high school, and it was in his senior year at Mt. Carmel that he first caused eyebrows to lift by heaving the 12-pound ball a distance of 59’ 5%”. This set a new national high school record, breaking the old mark of 59’ 1” held by DeWitt Coulter, ex-Army grid star,- and for his effort, John was placed on the All-American high school track team picked by Look magazine in that year (1946).
The change in climate which John encountered in coming to Indiana doesn’t seem to have affected him, for he has easily broken all existing Notre Dame shot-put records. His best performance to date was at the Central Collegiate meet at East Lansing where he took a first with a pitch of 54’ 4”. He got off a heave of better than 55 feet in this same meet, but just barely stepped out of the circle and had it called foul. Last week he beat the Big Ten champion, Chuck Fonville of Michigan, with a 54’ 1” toss in the Illinois Tech Relays.
But the Helwigs’ big moment will come three weeks from now when John journeys to Birmingham, Ala., to get his first taste of competing against Jim Fuchs, who set a world record when he pushed the 16-pound shot 58’ 4 27/64” at Oslo last year. Sure, it’s going to be a tough job, but the way he’s been looking lately should be enough to make anyone think twice before betting against him, and that record looks a lot closer now than it did a few months ago. And if he does beat Fuchs, it couldn’t happen to a nicer guy.

Housecleaning Uncovers Bevy of Letters From Girls About Notre Dame Students
By AL LAPORTE
Spring housecleaning uncovers a lot of things: dirt, dust, antiques and other useful items. When we were thrown out of our cubbyhole in Cavanaugh Hall and moved to the new, spacious ballroom which now houses the Scholastic in Farley, the whole staif joined in the treasure hunt of old files and waste baskets. Buried in one of the baskets inherited by the feature Department were several old letters — letters from girls writing about Notre Dame men.
Every editor is allowed one colossal idea in his reign and these letters were the products of that brainchild of one Greg Halpin, departed head of our department. In a moment of gay abandon, Greg — may his wife have mercy on him — wrote to several Catholic girls colleges in the outside world and asked for the feminine viewpoint on the inhabitants of this institution. Since we have nothing better to do and no one with a literary eye on our staff to

prevent this move, we’re going to present several of these answers — minus their authors’ names for security reasons. Originally this was a contest. Now it’s a space filler.
This is the letter Greg wrote to the editors of the college papers and, following, the replies.
Dear Editor:
You have undoubtedly heard of Notre Dame. It is a University in Indiana. It has a football team. It also has a student body. This student body is made up of 5000 males. They are a weird lot. They are so weird that we need help in classifying them. So we are conducting a survey. We want to know what college girls think of Notre Dame men.
We are asking them to write us letters on the subject: THE TYPICAL NOTRE DAME MAN. We do not care if the girls writing us have ever met an ND student. Let these fortunates
use their imaginations. We just want a whole mess of letters and opinions on the subject . . .
Letters can be of any length. They may be serious or otherwise. The more letters the better. And we’ll always feel a warm spot in our pulsing little hearts for you if you give us a break and print a few lines about this thing . . .
Thanks for everything, Greg Halpin
From Immaculata College, Immaculata, Pennsylvania :
“Following the whole man tradition, the typical Notre Dame man should be a trinity of manliness — God’s man, man’s man, and woman’s man.
“Fjrst, he must be God’s. By that I mean his standard of values must he based on the sincere and alive faith and reason which is Catholicism. He must be a man’s man, having firm principles of friendship, loyalty, hard work and play, and a perseverance in the truth. He must have an awareness and a resoluteness about world, community and personal problems. And last, he must be a woman’s man. He must be considerate and tender. He must love his .woman and think of her as a complement, not as a competitor. That’s the - formula. Let’s hope it doesn’t, take four years to react ...”
From Mount St. Mary’s in California:
“It seems to me that a Notre Dame student should embody those qualities for which the University itself has always been noted. Notre Dame to me is synonymous with purity, honesty, courage and a deep faith in God — even though Jeff Cravath and a few others don’t like to admit it. These virtues shouldn’t be abstract. They should accompany the man to every class, game, or party that he attends, now and through all his life.
" “My typical Notre Dame man would always keep his eye on that lovely lady on the Golden Dome and be only what She wants him to be ... ”
From the College of New Rochelle this poem came addressed:

“We’ve met some ND men, we’ve met

At West Point we’re happy—at Georgetown we’re gay,
And we’ll take a man from Purdue any old day!
But as for ND men, we’ve known quite a few,
And they’re characters “weird”— oh brother, how true!
They’re rah-rah’s on campus, they shine in the light,
They know how to talk but they’re not always bright.
With a ‘line’ and a smile they think they’re the master,
And our hearts should flutter?—now Ed. dear, we ask ya!
They’re Men of Distinction (it sez here in print)
And when the gals see them, they sprint with a glint!
Like heroes they stand with the girls at their feet,
And time after time we’ve heard them repeat —
‘Now Rosie! Now Posie! Now Mary Louise!
This is SO boring — get up off your knees.
Too blonde — too dark — too short — too tall,
So dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!’

From Mercy College, Michigan:

“About sports: we’d like someone with the ability to explain in detail (not too) the rudiments of baseball, boxing, basketball, skiing and the immortal football. Without a doubt, Notre Dame men excel in this!
“In general, our Ideal must practice his Religion, be a fine looking fellow, dress neatly, like to dance and have loads of scintilating personality — that’s all!!”
And again, from Immaculata in Pennsylvania :
“I must admit that the name Notre Dame is a magical word, that the thought of a Notre Dame man sends all sorts of mad ideas running around this single girl’s mind. Thoughts of football games, all men, high I.Q.’s, argyle socks, text books, briar pipes, “Joe College,” dances at the Rock, science labs etc. . . .
“All these ideas — except the football— could be associated with almost any college man. But a Notre Dame man seems just. different, for when I think of one, I see a fellow with courage enough to follow the ideals of “the” Notre Dame, Our Lady. It is this, more than anything else, that sets him apart. . . . Maybe it’s Our Lady herself

Council Votes Soon On New Amendments
Two amendments, one to the Constitution and the other to the by-laws, will be. voted upon by the Student Council at the coming meeting. Both are aimed at greater efficiency in the body’s undertakings.
According to the proposals, the Stay Council shall be elected by the members of the Council at the first meeting following class elections. In the past, this has been done at the last meeting of the academic year.
The changes provide that the new Council’s first meeting shall be called by the Chairman of the Stay Council within two weeks of the Stay Council’s election, rather than the present “three weeks of the start of the fall semester.” It is believed that this change will make for more efficient work with campus clubs, the new Council having the entire Summer to organize.
At this week’s meeting it was voted to underwrite the budgets of the Junior Prom and the Met Club’s Easter Dance.

Editor Herrington and his staff a large bouquet for making their facilities available to us so that we may pass you the word anent the doings of the postgraduate world.
Grad Mixer-Meeting
The new, streamlined Graduate Student Association made its re-entry into the world of the living at the beginning of the semestei- with a big mixer and business meeting in the Vet Rec Hall. The feature attraction was the showing of ND Grid Highlights of 1949, ably presented by Jim Martin.
The organization, designed to foster greater community spirit among the graduate students while providing them with a spokesman, is now going all out in its efforts to give us graduates our
place in what passes for the South Bend sun these wintry days, and we highly recommend membership to all laborers in the vineyard of advanced academics.
This year the group is headed by Ed Mertz, Chemistry; Charles Mattingly, Philosophy; and Ralph Weber, History; as president, secretary, and treasurer respectively. Bob Wilmouth, Political Science and Dick • Derenthal, Physics, the representatives of the Arts and Science Divisions, round out the Executive Council.
Valentine Dance
The graduate social season got off to a running start on the feast of good Bishop Valentine when some sixty couples gathered in the Vet Rec Hall, (transformed for the evening into a palace of red and white bunting), to celebrate the day. Candlelight and the soft % strains of recorded music lent the whole affair that supper-club atmosphere so essential to the esthetic satisfaction of the discriminating graduate. The glad cries of those who gave it a whirl are still echoing to the tune of “Let’s do it again!” For these, we understand that Ralph Weber’s crew is even now readying a sequel in the form of a square dance for you rustic Janes and Joes. The affair is slated for April 15, with the Grad Wives Association doing the right * thing by the male metabolism via a pot- *, luck dinner.
First Grad Retreat
The first annual Graduate Retreat was held in Alumni Hall Chapel on February 25-26, with Rev. William Robinson, C.S.C., leading the conference. The sessions were well attended, and provided an excellent opening to the Lenten season. Father Robinson deserves, and here-by receives, a large vote of thanks for his talks, which were a source of great ~ spiritual inspiration to all present.
In closing, and in the same vein, your attention is called to the 8:10 Mass being said daily in Dillon Chapel, by Rev. Philip Moore, C.S.C., the Dean of the Graduate School. It was inaugurated by the Prefect of Religion, for the convenience of the off-campus graduate students who find it hard to make the ear-lier services. We strongly urge that you J make it a daily habit, and make of it a true community sacrifice offered by the « graduate body, assembled as a unit. The ; Mass is said as a Missa Recitata on > Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
Georgetown University’s Hoga says the Hoya polo team recently gave the National Champion Hurricanes of Miami U. quite a scare, but lost anyhow 15-11. You can bet your life that Notre Dame’s polo team would never get beat by such a score.

Purdue Relays (Continued from Page 21) record by over five seconds.
Bill Fleming wasn’t able to run the hurdles last Saturday and he will only run tomorrow at Purdue if he feels that his injured legs can take the beating. If Fleming is available and if Leo Mc-Killip, who may have to give up track for the rest of the year to engage in spring football practice, can run, Coach Doc Handy has hopes of entering a shuttle hurdle relay squad. John Worthington and sophomore basketball forward Jack Neumayr will complete the hurdle squad in that case. Doc has high hopes for Neumayr in both the hurdles and the high jump. He and Hughie Wilcox, another sophomore newcomer from the basketball squad, look like the best high jumping prospects Notre Dame has seen in a good many years.
The entries for the Purdue Relays had not been released at this writing but in past years most of the Big Ten schools and Michigan State competed in the university division while the smaller schools from this area made up the college division in the relay races. Individual competition is in one class that includes both colleges and universities.

What's Wrong?
(Continued from Page 17) and one positive measure which has itself become defective.
The first serious loss of our contemporary social groups is the broad issue described up to this point—that of the studential nature. The import of this loss can be seen in the two facts that most Notre Dame students today have no definite conceptions of education or its purpose, and that they have no common studential interests, but only those that our materialistic, sensualist American way of life presents to them.
And it is idle to assert that the overall pattern of clubs at Notre Dame serves the studential way of life, for even if it were true, the average student does not have enough time at liis disposal to be a member of those clubs
which might compose the pattern. The average student belongs to only one or two groups during his college career— so each individual group should be totally studential.
Lack of creative imagination, manifested primarily through recreation, is the second glaring deficiency in our clubs. Since most students have succumbed to patronage of the mass means of amusement for recreation, student entertainment has become essentially passive. The very composition of the word “re-create” discloses what the movies, radio, et al., fail to do, and what students of the past accomplished in their programs of creative activities.
The art of conversation, hailed as lost in may quarters, is certainly another’ vital phase of recreation and imagination. It too has been corroded by the disappearance of studential interests. The lev
el of the average student’s conversation is hardly on a par with university life.
The third flaw in our clubs, one of far reaching consequences, is the loss of a concept of responsibility. This has manifested itself in two ways. In a proximate manner—toward students—responsibility has descended to a deplorable state. The average club has little semblance of orderly procedure (parliamentary law was once considered worth studying); some clubs have revealed small respect for decent behavior, and others, no respect for ethics. Need it be stressed that many of our secular social organizations have been dominated by Communists through clever manipulation of parliamentary law? And need it be remarked that not following some standard of procedure in a club prostrates the organization to the wildest sort of disorder, and builds near indestructible foundations for future in-
30
competence on the part of the members when they enter the world at large? The problems of cheating in class and unjust criticism of the faculty and administration can also find roots in the concept of responsibility. Students demand certain rights, but fail to carry out the appropriate responsibilities.
In a more remote manner, loss of responsibility also shows itself in the ordinary college graduate’s inadequate knowledge of society’s problems, which has often been decried as having catastrophic potentialities. The fact that Catholic college graduates have been indifferent, and even antagonistic, to the need for reforms in society at large is painfully apparent. Apathy towards societal responsibilities in this case can be traced to college years where students abused the opportunities they had of association, interchange of knowledge, and youthful enthusiasm. A university’s educational program can proceed only so far—at a definite point, students must respond to it and carry on themselves.
The loss of a well integrated religious life is the fourth shortcoming patent in our social groups. Disreputable activities have been promoted by some clubs, but of far more importance is the sheer indifference which club functions exhibit towards religion. If religion is not the structural basis of all clubs at Notre Dame, what right have they to exist? He”e, mingled inextricably with materialism, is secularism, an error our American Bishops have warned us about repeatedly.
The one positive aspect of our student social organizations which has unfortunately defaulted is the Student Council. Men placed in this capacity should use V the privilege of student government ■Lx granted them to aid the University in ' furthering the purpose of a Christian university. Instead of enforcing responsibilities, the Council has been vociferous in demanding rights. The authority it possesses is sufficient to restore a stu-dential character to the student groups, but this it seems to have no intention of doing. The Council has deteriorated into a group of men commanding the nominal prestige of leadership who seem to fear " offending their friends should they make any a^emP^ to correct abuses.
This degeneration of our student groups calls for an immediate and radical reconstructive program. The following three suggestions may help towards this end:
1. Each student should readjust his views in- regard to the ‘ nature of the club to which he belongs, and do what is within his power to make it more stu-dential. More concretely, concern with man’s physical, sensate activities should
>€
March 24, 1950
cease to be of major interest, and the development of man’s spiritual powers should be returned to its proper preeminence in university life.
2.	The social organization leaders should make a serious effort to readjust the nature and conduct of their groups to a state more in accord with true university life.
3.	The Student Council should enforce first, the various club responsibilities which have become perverted, and second, the studential way of life.
' It is, in truth, difficult to understand how the spirit of Notre Dame could exist in the religious and academic life of the student body, if not in its extracurricular life. Perhaps the very difficulty of defining this elusive spirit is due to its non-existence.
In conclusion, Father Ward’s words are again apropos: “A positive, constructive and creative leadership in social affairs, in economics and politics and education and the professions, in the family and in all the arts and sciences — this is . . . the fruit to be justly expected of a Catholic university.”
Faculty Members Take Part In Nationwide Broadcast
Mr. Lawrence H. Baldinger, Dean of the College of Science, and Dr. John D. Mizelle, Professor of Biology and editor of the American Midland Naturalist, will take part tomorrow in a nationwide broadcast over the Columbia Broadcasting System. The two Notre Dame faculty members will discuss the topic “How Science Helps Mankind” on the “Adventures in Science” program at 2:15 p.m.
The program will originate from the studios of radio station WFBM, Indianapolis, and will be held in conjunction with the Junior Scientists Assembly at the Claypool Hotel in that city. The Assembly is associated with the ninth annual Science Talent Search for Westinghouse Science Scholarships conducted by the Science clubs of America. Dean Baldinger is a member of the Indiana Science Talent Search Committee.

The Aspirin Age—1919-41. Edited by Isabel Leighton; Simon and Schuster, New York; 491 pp., $3.95.
Now that the world has passed into the second half of the twentieth century, the press and radio has been fond of summarizing the last half-century. Published last Fall, The Aspirin Age makes no such attempt, but it does give an adequate picture of the United States during the roaring twenties and the terrible thirties.
The book is made up of twenty-two sharply-written pieces about some of the main things of those two decades. There is no attempt to crowd in everything, as comparable books have tried to do. Rather, Miss Leighton is content to include essays on only the most important and significant events.
Each of the authors, besides being just a capable craftsman, is intimately aco.uainted. with his subject. Thus Hodding Carter, the Louisiana newspaperman, writes of Huey Long, and Gene Tunney recreates his fights with Jack Dempsey.
One of the most interesting selections is “The Noble Experiment of Izzie and Moe.” This piece by Herbert Asbury is the story of Moe Smith and Isadore Einstein, the government’s most avid detectives of prohibition violators.
Of special local interest is “Konklave in Kokomo,” the story of the Ku Klux Klan during the early twenties. Written by a Catholic, Robert Coughlan, it describes the immense power of the Klan in Indiana and its final downfall in this state.
Charles Lindbergh, the idol of the people, comes in for special scrutiny by John Lardner. Lardner attempts to show that the aviator is really an important man of the era and will be back in prominence again.
One of the biggest news stories of the period — the birth of the Dionne quintuplets — is reported by Keith Munro who did the same job at the time of their birth.	.
Margaret Case Harriman describes the other great story of the time in “The King and the Girl From Baltimore.”
Republican presidents Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge don’t receive the best notices from authors. Samuel Hopkins Adams suggests that the death of Harding was a timely affair, while Irving Stone calls Coolidge "A Study in Inertia.”
The Aspirin Age is a correct title for the years between the two world wars.
It was not a happy time. People were tired of war, tired of a depression and just tired. In an attempt to overcome this, they tried a lot of things, but they always ended up reaching for an aspirin.—J. S. H.

WASHINGTON HALL — Roseanna McCoy (B) is a glossy version of the old McCoy-Hatfield feud. Farley Granger and Joan Evans are the stars but such fine secondary players as Raymond Massey, Charles Bickford, Richard Basehart and Aline McMahon are the ones who give the film substance.

as much support as possible. Especially from the members of the ’52 class that is sponsoring it. Big things have humble beginnings. Who knows, this might be the start of something? Let’s hope so.
Flu Bug
Last week we heard half the campus was laid up with the flu. Not liking to be left out on anything we promptly managed to get bit by the flu bug, too. Wrapping some pajamas around our slippers, and with a Sociology book in hand, we headed for the Infirmary.
Doc Egan stuck the thermometer into our mouth, watched it rise and then gave us a reservation. It was the first time we have evei' sacked in at the Infirmary and the three-day stay opened our eyes on a lot of things.
The ND Infirmary is something you hear little about. Probably because anyone who gets put in is so interested in his ills and aches that he gives little thought to the way the place is run. Well, after the penicillin needle made our arm look like a piece of swiss cheese and our temperature started to descend, we had time to make several notations.
The primary one is that the nuns and nurses who run the Infirmary rate a lot more credit than you ever hear about. Take last week, for an example. The flu bug had sent a large contingent of NDers into the place. The staff probably had more beds filled than during any other period in a long while. Still, that didn’t keep the staff from being not only extra efficient but also friendly and helpful at all times.
A word of thanks and praise should also be paid to Father Thornton and Father Murray. Father Thornton came around each morning giving Communion. Father Murray paid two visits a day. His burly words of cheer were worth more than a handful of pink pills.
As much as all the patients seemed to benefit from the Infirmary’s good work, everyone seemed mighty pleased when Doc Egan gave the green light to go. No one likes to stay in a hospital but when it’s as well and as pleasantly run as the Notre Dame Infirmary, the sickness is almost forgotten.
Another thing that made the flu a bit more pleasant was to read that the illness wasn’t restricted to this area. Time reported that Sir Thomas Beecham and Princess Margaret also suffered from its effects. So you see, it must be a disease perhaps restricted to royal blood. If that excludes getting hemophilia we don’t mind it in the least.

Vaughn Flubs Up
We weren’t out of the campus sick bay in time to enjoy St. Patrick’s day to the hilt but we were out in time to take in the Monroe radio show last Saturday night. We thought the show itself was fine, but “popular” Vaughn Monroe certainly didn’t ring a bell with us.
Along with almost everyone else, we waited over an hour for the half-hour entertainment. It wasn’t that we expected more than we got but it seems to us Monroe didn’t go out of his way to increase his popularity. The way he ran on just before the program began, and then worse yet, the way he ran off as soon as the program was over jarred us no little bit. If he was trying to prove that he really raced with the moon, he did a fine job of it.
We realize that he had to get to John Adams’ for a show. We also realize that he wasn’t contracted to give the large ND turn-out anything more than rhe half-hour radio performance. But, it does seem the least he could have done was say a few words at the end. If his manner is the way you become “America’s number one bandleader” then we’ll put our vote in for Gene Hull.
Sophs’ Vaudeville
Since we’re speaking of entertainment, we’d like to say a few words about the Sophs’ projected vaudeville show. One of last week’s editorials attacked the Student Council’s financial appropriation to this endeavor. Though we don’t want to cause any dissension in the ranks, we are in favor of this forthcoming show.
We feel that there are too few opportunities offered to the campus talent and anything such as the vaudeville show is a good thing. WND, we feel, doesn’t capitalize enough on ND talent. The University Theater does a good job but their productions are all dramatic. The Glee Club and the Band are for the musically inclined, true; but for the musically inclined as a unit. Nothing is offered for solo talent.
Therefore, we think the vaudeville show is a great idea. Perhaps we’re over-estimating campus talent. For all we know, the Sophs’ show might be a resounding flop. We don’t think so, though. And we feel it should receive

Sunday Holy Hour to Answer Pope's Call for Prayers
The entire campus will participate in an hour of silent prayer from 6:30 to 7:30 Sunday evening in Sacred Heart church.
The holy hour is in accord with the papal encyclical Anni Sacri, issued March 11, in which Pope Pius XII calls for universal public prayer on Passion Sunday “that a new order, based on truth, justice, and charity, may arise from the longed-for restoration of morals.”
Echoing the warning of Our Lady of Fatima that lasting peace can be had only through prayer and sacrifice, His Holiness pleads for an end to indifference and a prayer offensive to gain “enlightenment for minds, peace and concord for souls, and a well-ordered justice between the various social classes.
“No one must be idle and lazy in the face of so many evils and dangers while those in the other camp strive to destroy the very basis of Catholic religion and Christian worship,” the Pontiff warns.
