Yea, Though I Walk 
The dress was ivory, not white, a lacy empire-waist gown I had worn as a flower girl in my aunt's wedding. The veil flowed from a cream-colored bow in my frizzled hair. I knelt reverently in the pew. My hands were angelically folded, my face as serene as the little children's in our catechism books. And my heart was racing. I had, along with my eight-year-old classmates, rehearsed for our First Com­munion for a whole year. We had memorized the ritual: Kneel until the other people in your pew stand, walk slowly and reverently into the aisle, being care­ful not to trip on the kneeler. Keep hands folded until you're at the front of the line. Think about God and Jesus. Step up to the priest. Left hand rests gently in the right, eyes and hands lift to the host. Say, "Amen." Chew the host so subtly that nobody knows you're chewing, try to swallow it before you get to the cup. Take a tiny sip ofwine -enough to taste, but not enough to leave a sour taste in your mouth. Return to pew, kneel in prayer. Now, the moment had finally arrived. Focused, I followed the line of white­clad girls and dark-suited boys before me down the pew and into the aisle. Hands folded, then right hand cupped the left. I received the host. I said, "Amen," con­sumed it, and, swept up in the solemnity ofthe moment, promptly wandered off towards the pews on the other side ofthe church. My parents had to call me back, and when I realized my mistake, I flushed with embarrassment and scurried back into my pew, the moment shattered. I had practiced so hard, I thought. I had rehearsed everything. How did I get so distracted? These days, I'm usually caught up in another ritual -daily life. Whenever I get startled out of my reverie, I find that, once again, I have wandered from the Church. Usually, like my first Communion blunder, it's my fault. This January, it wasn't. As the Church's sexual abuse scandal snaked its way across the nation, I found myself voluntarily wandering out of line. But seeing the infallible hierarchy shaken did cause me to reexamine what I truly believed. I decided to channel my disgust towards the responsible bishops and priests, and not the tenets of the faith. I found focus through my reflection. As the world's leading Catholic institution, Notre Dame also spent some time reflecting on its role in questioning the Church and the definition of its faith, both on campus and internationally. The university didn't shout as loudly as Boston College, perhaps, but people still listened. Scholastic's Annie Robinson takes a look at the university's response to the scandal and the destiny of Catholicism under the dome starting on page 12. Well, it's our first issue of the year, and we're glad to be back. That, and we really missed the dining hall.

People go to sleep each night and wake up each morning; they laugh; they cry; they catch cold; they have children; they write sonnets; eat dinner; watch TV. They grow old; some grow wise ...

It's become a trend, and this summer proves it: The networks have started breeding reality television no better than the typical summer reruns. After being pulled from the schedule last fall, The Mole: The Next Betrayal finally found an audience on Tuesday nights. The Mole's attraction lies in its unique twist on the reality genre. All 12 players work to­gether to earn prize money, although one, "the mole," secretly works against them. The rare reality show that audience. The initial novelty ofIdol quickly wore off, however, when it devolved into a glorified Star Search as the number of con­testants dwindled week by week. 
NBC avoided shows like Big Brother and American Idol, instead opting for something more akin to its successful Fear Factor. Dog Eat Dog was touted as a mixture of Fear Factor and Survivor, where each week six new contestants would vote for each other to perform elaborate challenges. Dog Eat

Another reality vet­cable triumph was in the 
eran returned to the tube this summer: the third incarnation of Big Brother. The domestic version of Sur­vivor, Big Brother locked 12 strangers in a house where players vote one another off the show each week. Not only is this year's cast more boring than last year's, the pro­ducers somehow managed to pack the house with even broader stereotypes ­the histrionic gay man, the religious vir­gin and a dumb jock. Even new twists didn't liven up the pace, and often were downright unfair. 
FOX didn't have any trouble luring view­ers with its summer entry, American Idol. A spin-off of a European hit, Idol scours the United States for the best young singers. The early episodes offered some of the worst auditions in the nation, easy fodder for the judges and wonderful entertainment for the 
ratings. 
Joining Dog Eat Dog atop the ratings was another NBC entry, Meet My Folks. Each week, three young bachelors spent the weekend with one young, single woman at her parents' house. The parents would eventually choose one as the winner, who scored a weeklong vacation with their daugh­ter. Meet My Folks was nothing more than an unconventional way oftesting the lowest levels of human dignity. 
Despite these lackluster entries into the genre, reality television is far from a fading fad. While none ofthese shows were able to match the creativity or entertainment that Survivor conjured two summers ago, several shows already are planning seasons for next summer. 
Looks like the horizon of reality televi­sion rests on a sea ofmediocrity. D

A Big Catholic Field Trip 
Notre Dame students travel to World Youth Day 2002 in Toronto 
SEANDUDLEY

The rain started falling at 5 o'clock Sunday morning, drenching hun­dreds of thousands ofpeople lying scattered across an open airfield near Lake Ontario. Notre Dame's group of pilgrims woke up, quickly covered their belongings, and walked to a fence where they stood pa­tiently in the pouring rain for the next four hours. Then the car carrying Pope John Paul II drove by, and the crowd went wild. This summer, four universities run by the Congregation ofHoly Cross sent a group of 56 students and chaperones to Toronto for World Youth Day 2002, an intense week of Catholic fellowship and prayer. The vigor ofthe aging pope and huge crowds offaith­filled youth left deep impressions on all the pilgrims from Notre Dame, Holy Cross Col­lege, St. Mary's College and the University ofPortland. "One of the most awesome things was seeing young people from so many differ­ent countries alljointogetherinprayer;• says BP sophomore Janel Daufenbach. "There were so many different cultures and Ian­guages and so many differences among us, but there was a great sense ofunity." · The Notre Dame group arrived in Toronto in the evening on July 22 and moved into their home for the week, a Catholic grade school an hour outside the city. They slept on classroom floors and showered with a hose or at the YMCA two blocks away. Ev­ery morning, they took a bus, subway and then. a streetcar to Exhibition Center, a giant convention center on the shore of Lake Ontario serving as the hub of World Youth Day activities in the city. Events included the celebration of Mass, catechism sessions, shared prayer and meals, a vocations fair -a job fair for religious orders -·and several concerts. One artist featured was a Notre Dame graduate, Danielle Rose, '02. She played a few concerts during the week and sang at the Saturday night vigil. 
"As I stood on the stage at the Papal Vigil, · · Dame's group, was overwhelmed by the 
looking out at a million Catholics from around the world, I was absolutely over­whelmed with gratitude," Rose says. "I am sogratefultobeapartofaChurchthatunites people from every comer of the earth." 


cated... they were simply the truth, and I loved hearing them. He inspired me to speak to people in plain language, telling them about God and God's expectations for us." 
The pope spoke to the people about liv­ing as lights ofthe world and nurturing hope for the future in their hearts. Though physi­cally frail, the 82-year-old pontiff appeared determined to participate fully in the events ofthe week, walking down from his airplane unassisted and speaking forcefully at the opening ceremony, tlie Saturday night vigil and the papal Mass. 
''Having five amazing priests and religious on this trip was exn:emely important to me," says Krissy Caponi, a Cavanaugh Hall se­nior. "Even though there has been a shift in focus within the Church after Vatican II to­wards lay ministry, I think that we should never lose sight of the leadership and ex­ample of the ordained and professed in our midst." 
The students from the Holy Cross univer­sities loved their experiences in Toronto. "I didn't really know what to expect," says 

. Danielle Hermann, a sophomore from the University of Portland. "It turned out to be one of the most memorable experiences of 
_ my life. I discovered just how awesome it is to share a common faith with people from around the world." D 
World Youth Day culminated with a two­and-a-half hour papal Mass on Sunday morning that drew over 800,000 pilgrims and Toronto residents. Most of the crowd had walked to the site of the Mass the day before in sweltering heat and spent the night on the airfield, camping out under the clouds in a massive sleepover. On Sunday, about halfway through Mass, nearly five hours of pouring raip. and a tornado warning turned into clear blue skies. 
"Here we were in the middle of a field, where it was raining," says Tim O'Malley, a junior from Old College. "And all we could do was to sing and pray to Christ, because all of our focus was on Jesus. I mean, that's powerful." 
Students and chaperones from Notre Dame saw Pope John Paul II drive by in the "Pope Mobile" three times, never more than IO feet away. The Rev J. Steele, chaperone and rector of Morissey Manor, was nearly moved to tears at the sight of the pope and shouted again and again, ''We love you!" 
The Rev. Bill Wack, leader of Notre 
presence ofthe Holy Father throughout the week. "I was totally inspired and encour­aged by the words that were spoken by Pope John Paul in his homilies and speeches," Wack says. "His words weren't compli-

The games, meetings and chanting allow students to adapt to their new surroundings and to be outgoing and social as they begin their freshman year. "Being with your freshman class in the dorm gives you a chance to meet people you would (eventually) be friends with. The activities (with other dorms) are more to ease tension and ... have a good time," says Brian Tracy, a Knott Hall sophomore and Frosh-O com­missioner. 
Still, some interhall mixers only increase tension for homesick or shy freshmen. Sherman's experience at the Walsh-Fisher Luau is one example. "It's not sensitive to the fact that some people just don't like to socialize that way," Coughlin says. 
"This is an area that I think could use some creativity. The idea of the Cinderella mixer or the tie mixer, where the girl puts her shoe in and the guy finds her, or the guy puts a tie in and the girl finds him -I think that is a

events on Friday and Saturday can make or break a freshman's experience at orientation. This year's most successful events, accord­ing to many Frosh-O staff members, were those involving another dorm of the same gender or simply within the dorm commu­nity itself. 
''Nothing says 'Welcome to College' like an all-'80s Weekend blasting out ofa small boom box," says Jon Feczko, a junior and hall commissioner from Keenan Hall. Keenan welcomed their freshmen with a barbeque and music as the Frosh-O staffun­loaded the newcomers' cars. 
Walsh Hall tried something new this year by planning a luau with Howard, another women's dorm, in addition to Morissey. Sherman says that itwas the biggest suc­cess of the weekend, because the freshman girls had a chance to meet other girls as well as boys. St. Ed's and Carroll, both men's dorms, played sports with one another Fri­day evening and co-hosted a bonfire later that night with Badin.

StudentActivities Office, Coughlin says. The department of First Year Studies runs all of the university's official orientation programs, and each dorm is responsible for registering and moving in its new students. The three­pronged approach to organizing Frosh-O can _ lead to a disparity among fre~hmen's expe­riences. 
"There's really no rhyme or reason to the. consistency ofit," Coughlin says. "We need to get everybody on the same page. Every-job, I don't want to imply that we don't, but I think that we could take it up a notch and 
take it to the next level." 
Although the hectic weekend ofFrosh-O may not leave strong memories in every freshmen's mind, the important thing is to put the students on the path toward a sense of security and solid relationships. "I don't think the first weekend is ever going to be the most memorable," says Tallmadge. "I don't think it can be. l think the most im­portant memories come from friends you know well and care about. That's where your most lasting memories come from." 0

Knock on the door ofroom 319 Siegfried Hall, and it's likely that you won't get an answer. Although the sign on the door of Joe Sinnott and Matthew Solarski's room reads, "Come in, we're open," you may not be allowed in the room until you ring the doorbell. The installation ofthe bell, along with other small ad­ditions, make this seemingly average room stand out from the rest. The goal of the two sophomores' room is, as they put it, ''just to be comfortable." When you walk into the room, the large house numbers 319 on the connecting beam of their two lofts immeditately grabs your attention. Notre Dame leprechaun lights are hung around the beams, in addition to posters and PeeWee Herman paraphernalia. A ladder connects the two lofts, and Joe has even constructed a pulley system from one bed to another. Also, at the top of their lofts is what they call, "a fully furnished upper level." They built a shelf on each loft to hold books, alarm clocks and reading lights. . A large couch with a small end table to its right and a coffee table in front occupies one side of the rooj. Each table is furnished with a bowl of fruit or candy and an J~t ay of different newspa­pers. When asked where they purchase their very homey furni­ture, Joe replied, "Goodwill hunting is t e way to go." 
In the space created by a large bay indow, they have as­sembled their own entertainment center f a TV, VCR, DVD player, Sony PlayStation and stereo. Nearb , they have well or­ganized containers of food and a fully stoc d refrigerator. On top of the sink there is a dish rack and towel, which are rare in any dorm room. 
"Because it's tasteful and tidy, more people resp ct our room," says Matthew. It may also appear organized becau of the way Joe and Matthew worked with the amount~of space hey were given. They both agree that space is the key in any do . room. In spite of their immense stylistic success, the two man e to remain humble. They say, "We're just one small part of the o t dorm on campus."

ANNIEROBINSON IPHOTOS BY MIKEMCNARY 
January 2002 in South Bend. Cold, bleak, boring. Notre Dame is covered in snow, the days are short and dark. Students, confined to campus, shuffle from dorms to classrooms in a daze. Brief peeks at the long-forgotten sun serve as only a momentary escape from the monotonous winter days. 
January 2002 in Boston. After the Boston Globe breaks the story ofJohn Geoghan, a pedophile priest allegedly sheltered by the Bos­ton archdiocese, the Catholic Church finds itself on the front page every day. Just when the Church thinks it can't get any worse, it does. The Catholic public's clamor for reform intensifies as more victims come forward each day. The scandal takes the top head-when in search of quotes and sound bites. According to Appleby, Notre Dame's spokespeople felt immense pressure to comment pub­licly on the crisis as soon as possible. "There was a new revelation every day," he said. Appleby pointed out that Notre Dame's re­sponse differed starkly from the way the school reacted to Septem­ber 11. While the university was able to respond to that tragedy right away, the Church controversy, which was unfolding on daily basis, posed a different situation. "Father McBrien and I were try­ing to deal with the media everyday," says Appleby. "Maybe we were too cautious, but maybe because we didn't know what was happening to the full extent." 
Rather than make a knee-jerk reaction, the administration wanted to wait until it felt it had the whole story, Appleby said. They wanted 
"I don't think that the bishops or our Catholic colleges and universities have exercised the kind of leadership that the Church has needed during this greatest crisis in U.S. Catholic history:' ·-the Rev. Richard P. McBrien, ND theology professor 
lines of major papers across the country, dominates nightly news­casts~ and serves as fodder for late-night comedians. The Catholic Church is forced to hang its collective head in shame. 
Once Notre Dame realized the scandal wasn't staying on the East Coast, it was clear what was needed-leadership. Catholics wanted someone to step up, to tell them it was 'going to get better, that the Church would survive this crisis. More importantly, someone needed to tell Catholics what they could do and how to move for­ward. 
Widely recognized as the premier Catholic university in the coun­try, Notre Dame had a responsibility to do something. But could the university have done more? And what do the past months indicate for Notre Dame as a Catholic institution in the years to come? 
Notre Dame's Reaction 

"I don't think that the bishops or our Catholic colleges and uni­versities have exercised the kind of leadership that the Church has needed during this greatest crisis in U.S. Catholic history." 
Strong words from the Rev. Richard P. McBrien, Notre Dame theology professor and former department chair. 
"We have provided widespread leadership on this crisis." 
Strong words from Professor R. Scott Appleby, director ofNotre Dame's Cushwa Center for American Catholicism. So, who is right? The sudden revelation of so much corruption in the Church was 
unprecedented, and it left the university with no easy answer. But if ever there was a time to speak out, it was now. 
"Notre Dame has a special role to play because of its preemi­nence in the network ofCatholic institutions ofhigher learning and because ofthe highly visible place it occupies in U.S. society," says McBrien. With Notre Dame's status comes great responsibilities. The university needed to make a statement and make it quickly. 
Formulating a response was not as simple as it might seem. The media turned to the monikered "mecca" ofAmerican Catholicism to avoid commenting on allegations and rumors, but preferred to wait out the immediate media frenzy until the facts were established. "A lot of us thought first this is isolated to Boston, then it was clearly a national problem," Appleby says. 
Although the taint of scandal never directly touched campus, "It was some­thing very close to home because it af­fects us here" due to Notre Dame's strong Catholic tradition, says Appleby. The ripples of the scandal extended far from Boston. No longer a problem lim­ited to the east coast, Notre Dame needed · to step up to the plate. 
In the eyes of many at Notre Dame, the university did exactly that. President Malloy led 11 members ofuniversity fac­ulty and administration in forming a Church Study Committee early in the spring. In the committee's own words, it convened "in order to of­fer the university's support and assistance to the Church and her bishops in addressing the current crisis facing American Catholics." So far, they have undertaken two tasks related to the crisis. 
The first went largely unnoticed. A special Mass organized for the Sunday before last spring's final exams was the school's initial public reaction. The event was poorly publicized and came at a time when students were preoccupied with the coming week's ex­ams. Needless to say, the Mass attracted few students, despite its dedication to the healing ofsexual abuse victims by Church clergy. After the liturgy, John Cavadini, an associate professor, chair ofthe theology department and director of the Institute for Church Life, led a presentation and discussion in Washington Hall. 




''It's wrong to have the same expectations. 
The second endeavor earned national attention. The committee claring it "benefited greatly from the wisdom of all three experts," sent a letter in advance to the annual June conference ofthe United the commit.tee addressed taboo subjects specifically in a section of States Conference of Catholic Bishops, where the clergy leaders .. ·the letter titled "Grapplingwith Difficult ~ssues." Among these was planned to discuss the scandals.

Several ofthe committee's suggestions were incorporated into the bishops, such as creating a support campaign for a "National the bishop's final resolution.

In retrospect, Appleby says, "It's fair to say (last spring's Mass) was not an adequate response for the student body ... we should have done more." He believes the university is better suited to re­flection on past events, rather than impulsive reaction. The univer­sity plans to make it up to the student body, with one installment of its Saturday Scholar Series titled, "The Crisis Facing the Roman Catholic Church," to be held this Saturday at 10 a.m. in the Hes burgh Center for International Studies before the second home football game. McBrien, Cavadini and Mooney will lead the panel discus­sion, which Appleby describes as the university's largest scale event planned for this semester in regards to the church crisis. Also, Mooney says the committee has tentative plans to host a sympo­sium on October 14 with a theme of"restoring trust," to encourage audience interaction with the speakers. 
A Look at Boston College's Response 

Meanwhile, one of Notre Dame's fellow Catholic universities was staging a vehement protest. Boston College provided Cardinal also doesn't see the rivalry of reactions between Notre Dame and BC as justifiable. "I don't think it's really helpful to say that one institution bears any greater burden than any other. No university has the right to speak for people. Universities are supposed to raise the level of intellectual reflection." Mooney agrees: "I don't think it is productive to try to draw comparisons with Boston College's approach, they are simply different responses to a tragic situation." Pope stresses that BC and Notre Dame should not be alone in re­sponding. Georgetown and all other Catholic institutions should have the same obligation. 
BC faced the same immense media pressure as Notre Dame. The argument has been made that BC was quicker to respond publicly, and since they began making statements and protesting almost im­mediately, their media presence has continued to overshadow that of Notre Dame. Never mind who spoke up first: BC was louder. But were they more effective leaders? 
"It's wrong to have the same ex­pectations ofNotre Dame as for BC," says Pope, who stresses that location 
of Notre Dame as for BC.'' 
Law with his harshest critics, as BC students and faculty spoke out loudly against his handling ofseveral sexual abuse cases. The school made its sentiments clear when, Cardinal Law (for the first time) was not asked to give the benediction at BC's spring commence­ment. His absence has been viewed as a strong message to the arch­diocese ofBoston and the nation at large. 
BC's president, William P. Leahy, recently announced the start of a program entitled "The Church in the 21st Century," which fo­cuses on the transition from "crisis to renewal." The program will examine not only the effects ofthe sexual abuse cases and the cor­ruption within the Catholic hierarchy, but will also focus on larger issues facing the Church today. It plans to tackle hot-button topics such as permitting females to become priests and allowing priests to marry. Composed of students, faculty and alumni, the advisory board for the program hopes that special lectures, discussions and classes will allow people to solidify their faith in what many see as an unstable Church. "Judging by limited data only, it would appear that Boston College has made a more aggressive response to the crisis than Notre Dame and other Catholic institutions of compa­rable size and stature," says McBrien, but adds that it is too soon to say whether dramatic change will be enacted within the Church as a direct result ofBC's program. 
With the Vatican and the archdioceses around the nation failing to speak out enough to satisfy an angry public, it appears as if the burden of paving the road to change falls on Catholic institutions like BC and Notre Dame. But is it really a university's place to do so? Stephen Pope, chairman ofthe theology department at BC, thinks not. "The problem is, there are 60 million American Catholics, so it's not helpful to think that any university can speak for 60 million people," says Pope. "It's the job of the bishops in the Catholic Church to speak for American Catholics, not any university." Pope 
-Stephen J. Pope, BC theology chair 
should not be overlooked. "We are in the archdiocese in Boston, which is the whole fulcrum of the crisis in the Church," directly across the street from Cardinal Law and the archdio­cese. In addition, Pope pointed out that a large portion of BC's student body is from the east coast, more spe­cifically New York City and Boston, the home dioceses of the most em­battled cardinals. This only increased the need for the school to react quickly. For BC students and faculty, there was no feasible way to avoid commenting on this crisis even ifthey had wished to do so. "There was a lot ofpressure from the media to respond, and we were trying to answer responsibly without being evasive," says Pope, echoing Appleby's reflections on how theolo­gians and administrators handled the press at Notre Dame. 
Those critical ofNotre Dame's reaction thus far point to its over­whelmingly Catholic student body percentage as evidence enough that the university should be more vocal. Approximately 84 per­cent of Notre Dame students describe themselves as Catholic, and BC estimates its student body is 70 percent Catholic. Pope credits several listening sessions at BC held last year as greatly enhancing the healing process for students. The sessions were an opportunity for those willing just to "be heard."

On Notre Dame's reaction to the church scandals, Miscamble says the real decisions need to be made at the diocesan level and with the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. He believes there should be less concern with the media and more outreach to the local community here at Notre Dame. The university should be able to conduct a forum where students and faculty alike can congregate in hopes of open and productive discussion on all controversial Church issues, Miscamble says. 
As Mass attendance drops across the nation, is Notre Dame also losing its faith? Appleby doesn't think so. "I haven't seen any evi­dence that people have lost any enthusiasm for the Catholic mis­sion of the university. Catholicism is a lifelong commitment and people around here are in it for the long haul." . 
How Does Notre Dame Stack Up? 
As the Catholic Church faced a na­tional crisis this past year, many expected Notre Dame, supposedly the world's most prominent Catholic university, to step forward and be a leading voice on church issues. But exactly how promi­nent is Notre Dame compared to its Catholic peers? 
Based on the latest rankings by U.S. News and World Reports magazine, only three Cathqlic institutions are in the "top tier" of national universities: Notre Dame (19th), Georgetown (23rd) and Boston College (38th). While these schools are academi­cally comparable, they differ significantly in terms of the influence Catholicism has on them. 
Compared to Boston College and Georgetown, Notre Dame has a very high percentage ofCatholic undergraduates.The university's institutional research depart­ment reports that in 2002, 84 percent of ND undergraduate students claimed to be Catholic.This figure has stayed relatively con­stant since 1991·, when it was 86 percent. Boston College does not keep records of its students' religious preferences, but offi­cials from BC's admissions and public affairs departments recall that 60-75 percent of students said they were Catholic on an in­formal survey a few years ago; Georgetown gave students a voluntary survey in the fall of 2000, and 55.3 percent of students re­ported being Catholic. 
Besides having a significantly higher per­centage of Catholics on campus, Notre Dame has been generally more able to avoid doubts about its devotion to Catholicism. Ofthe three schools,only Notre Dame still maintains single-sex residence halls. In 200 I, Georgetown faced harsh criticism when it chose, for the first time, a lay president. While both Georgetown and Boston Col­lege have been challenged for not placing crucifixes in certain classrooms, this issue has yet to surface at Notre Dame. 
On the secular side of this comparison, Notre Dame does not stand out. Of the three schools, Georgetown boasts the larg­est minority population, the smallest faculty to student ratio,and the highest undergradu­ate SAT scores. It is also has the lowest ac­ceptance rate. However.a Georgetown edu­cation is more expensive than one from its Catholic counterparts. 
Yet in the end, only one statistic has a last­ing impact on Notre Dame students: I I. This is the number of national championships won by the Fighting Irish football team, as compared to zero by Boston College and Georgetown (which no longer fields a Divi­sion I team).The next time you meet a BC alum, steer away from acceptance rates and bring up the one number that really mat­ters.

IThe Rant Win or lose, don 'tjudge Willingham by this years results 
by Gerard Meskill -respond to the king ofsports at gmeskill@nd.edu 
When a defensive specialist who lacks offensive vision is dismissed in favor of an offensive mastermind, fans expect offensive production to increase, even atthe expense of the defense's efficiency. After two games, Notre Dame football fans now know that this expectation can be entirely wrong: Notre Dame's defense has been pro­lific, but the Irish still are searching for their first offensive touchdown ofthe Willingham era. While it is unfair to judge an entire football organization on two games' work, the early verdict is that Notre Dame is on the road to recovery, but still is far, far away from being healthy again. This is not necessarily a bad thing, so long as one is willing to look at everything in perspective. Coach Tyrone Willingham has the Irish off to a 2-0 start for the first time since 1996, a statistic that glaringly skips Bob Davie's ten­ure, from 1997to2001.AgainstNo.21 Mary­land, his squad posted Notre Dame's first shutout since 1998 (Navy, 30-0), first shutout over a ranked opponent since 1980 (No. 5 Alabama, 7-0) and first victory over a ranked opponentonthe road since 1997 (No. 11 LSU, 24-6). In a short amount oftime, Willingham has given the Irish faithful reason to believe that Notre Dame football will indeed "Return to Glory." However, one would be foolish to expect that resurrection to be completed this season. Willingham is operating Davie's team, filled with Davie's recruits. The men on the Irish roster are good football players, but they are not ofa caliber that allows Notre Dame to rub elbows with the likes of Miami, Oklahoma, Texas and Tennessee. Willingham eventually will get Notre Dame back to that status, but only after he has a year ortwo to bring his own recruits into the system. If his abbreviated effort this year is any indication ofhis ability to drawtal ent to his program, Willingham will have a top-rated recruiting class before too long, perhaps even next year. Ofcourse, how well he does with next year's class will be directlyaffectedbyhowtherestofthisseason plays out. 
So far, Willingham has exceeded many of the expectations placed upon him. Byseason's end, this achievement might become a curse, 
Remember that every Notre Dame coach has lost a game or two -except George O'Leary. 
as expectations rise with each victory he notches. The road gets tougher for Ty from here, as the arch rival Michigan Wolverines (AP No. 7, ESPN/Coaches No. 6) roll into South Bend this week for the first time since 1998. The Wolverines bring pressure to Willinghamintwo forms: they are the tough­est team on Notre Dame's home schedule and also their greatest rival east of Los Angeles. 
Michigan will be the toughest trial for Notre Dame's new regime. Judging by the team's early offensive woes, it is likely that Notre Dame will be defeated on Saturday. The loss will bring the high hopes built around Willingham crashing down, and they will land firmly on the shoulders of the head coach himself. This will be unfair, but it is the way of sport: The shortcomings of athletes are the responsibility ofthe man who coaches them. 
Should this happen, do not give up on Willingham. Michigan's roster simply is more talented than Notre Dame's, an advantage that will be hard to surmount even with Willingham's expertise and the benefit of a home crowd. There is a reason that only two head coaches in college football history have led their teams to national championships in their first year on the job: There is too much adjusting to do, and too much damage to fix. Very rarely does a new coach inherit a final product; programs with elite rosters generally don't change their coaches. Willingha has 


more demolition to do than most first-year coaches, as was demonstrated by the team's early struggles with the new offensive strat­egy. 
Nevertheless, he has the program back on the right track, which is_ all that can be ex­pected of a first-year coach. Lou Holtz only finished 5-6 his inaugural season, and Dan Devine only 8-3. Willingham has the opportu­nity to fare much better than Holtz and just as well as Devine. But with Michigan coming to town and a road schedule that includes three ranked teams, it would be unfair to expect much.more. 
Keeping that in mind, go out and support the Irish on Saturday as they battle the Wolver­ines. Ifthey win, great. But should they lose, remember that every Notre Dame coach has lostagameortwo-exceptGeorgeO'Leary.O

The Missing Ingredient 
A non-factor in the first two games, the Irish offense must step up for Michigan 
JIMMYATKINSON 

With the sixth-ranked Michigan Wolverines coming to town this Saturday, a dark cloud hangs over the Irish. A 2-0 record and exceptional defensive and special teams play has been overshadowed by an offense which has, in the first two games of the Tyrone Willingham era, failed to score a single touchdown. The offense will have to come to life if winning is to continue. The new West Coast offense started the season promisingly when Notre Dame de­feated Maryland 22-0 at Giants Stadium. On the very first play, quarterback Carlyle Holi­day fired a strike to Omar Jenkins for a· 7­yard gain, and the Irish faithful knew im­mediately that this year would be different. Throughout the game, Holiday ran the pass­ing game to near perfection with impressive numbers, completing 17 passes to eight dif­

ferent receivers on 27 attempts for 226 yards, all career highs. Willingham, in his first game as Irish head coach, made a powerful first impression by defeating the defending ACC champion. 
Still, the offense failed to score a touch­down. Seven dead-ball penalties, an in­ability to establish the run (2.89 yards per rush), and four sacks were some of the reasons the offense was unable to put the ball into the end zone, despite an average starting position on the Irish 39-yard line. "It was really hard to get momentum," offensive coordinator Bill Diedrick says, "We really did not put together a good consuming drive [and] that was discon­certing to me." 
The offense showed a different face against Purdue the following week. The simple mistakes were cleaned up as the Irish committed only one dead-ball penalty, and the running game was more effective. Ryan Grant and Rashon Powers-Neal teamed up for 139 yards on 28 carries (4.96 yards per rush). 
The Purdue defense, however, exposed weaknesses in the Notre Dame passing game. The offensive line had a difficult time establishing solid pockets against Purdue's blitzing schemes. Holiday, who ran the West Coast offense against Maryland as though he had innovated it, struggled to amass any positive yardage against a much stronger Purdue defense. Hurried by a Purdue front that penetrated the Irish line time and time again, Holiday struggled to an unimpressive 7-for-22 performance for only 50 passing yards. "We expected them to blitz a lot to­day... [but] they disguised their coverage very well, which took us out of a lot of things," says Holiday. 
The overall ineffectiveness of the Notre Dame passing game forced the coaching staff to rely too heavily on the run, espe­
12 SEPTEMBER 2002 
cially in the second half, when Holiday at­tempted only eight passes. Overall, Notre Dame's offense was anemic, gaining only 203 total yards against Purdue, 18 yards fewer than Illinois State had managed against the Boilermakers the week before. On a more positive note, Holiday has avoided throwing an interception in 49 at­tempts this season in an entirely new offen­
sive system. A year ago, he threw seven in­terceptions on 144 attempts. Thus, the Irish team that shut out Mary­
land in a decisive 22-0 victory in week one depended on miscues by Purdue in week two to remain undefeated. "I am, overall, happy with the outcome of [the Purdue Jgame. To be 2-0 right now is a special thing and we will build on that," said Willingham after­
wards. The Irish might be happy, but they hardly can be satisfied. They know that Notre Dame's return to glory will not happen with­out offensive touchdowns. The Irish offen­sive unit cannot rely on special teams and defensive plays to bail them out of every game. ''We know as an offensive team that we have to make touchdowns. We have to work on some things to become a better ball club," says Holiday. That the Irish are undefeated is deceiv­ing. Maryland was thin all-around. Their of­fense was a disaster without last season's ACC offensive player of the year, tailback Bruce Perry. Their secondary played too soft and allowed Notre Dame to make comple­tions on short passing plays. Purdue, on the other hand, clearly was a much stronger team, but made too many big mistakes. The Boilermakers handed the Irish the game in

scoring twice on turnovers, including the game-winning touchdown on a 33-yard interception return by Vontez Duff. 
Special teams also has played a key role in the first two games. Against Maryland, special teams accounted for all 22 points. Nick Setta set a Kickoff Classic record with five field goals, including a career-long 51-yarder in the first quarter and Duff returned a punt 76 yards for a score, Notre Dame's only touchdown of the game. Against Purdue, the kickoff unit forced a fumble that was returned for a touchdown by Lionel Bolen. 
This Saturday, the Irish will need all the pieces working together, offense included, as Notre Dame and Michi­gan, the two , 

college football history, renew their rivalry after a two-year hiatus. And for the 17th time in the last 20 meetings, both teams are ranked nationally. 
Notre Dame cannot sit back and hope Michigan will make as many mistakes as Purdue did last week (four turnovers con­verted into 21 points). IfNotre Dame hopes to defeat Michigan, the offensive line must 
provide Holiday more time in the pocket. 
Holiday must remain poised and go through his throwing progression until he finds an open receiver rather than scrambling at the 
first opportunity. Until Notre Dame's offense can start consistently generating positive passing yardage, expect the Wolverine de­fense to stack more men in the box and over-commit to the run and come blitzing play 
after play, forcing Holiday to beat Michi­gan with the pass. This is exactly how Pur­due was able to keep Notre Dame offbal­ance. The Notre Dame passing game needs to return to the level of play they established against Maryland. Another task for the Irish on Saturday: get the ball to Arnaz Battle more often. Against Maryland, he had 68 yards on four receptions. Against Purdue, he re­turned three kickoffs for 89 yards. The fact that the coaching staff put Battle back to return kicks last week and attempted to get the ball in his hands on a reverse, albeit a failed one, shows the confidence they have in him as a serious offensive weapon. Unfortunately, none ofHoliday's passes made their way into Battle's arms. This must change against the Wolverines this weekend. Eight touches in two games are not enough.

Besides teamwork and leadership, another major key to a successful season will the . team's ability to maintain its focus. 
"Mental toughness is something that we

tin Detter. "Believing that we are the better

The goal of intense focus also includes 
taking the season one game at a time. "Our 
goal is to win every game," says Braun. 
"Therefore, the next game is always the 
most important one on your schedule." 
Clark compares this approach to another 
sport. "If you're a golfer," he says, "you

at a time. It's the same in soccer.... Ifyou

One ·more important advantage that the 
2002 squad holds over last year's team is 
NCAA Tournament experience. 
"The nice thing about getting into the 
tournament was getting our feet wet for the 
first time in a little while," Clark says. 
"...There's no question that it will serve as 
an incentive to get us back here." 
Braun says that although the team has at­
tempted to put the heartbreaking tournament 
loss to Maryland behind them, they are also 
using it as motivation for this season. "It 
was good to be there and play in the 
NCAAs, and, yet, we felt that we should 
have won that game," he says. "We are try­
ing to use it as a stepping stone rather than 
a stumbling block."

goals in three games and is looking to es­
tablish himself as one of the top forwards 
in the country. 
"Erich is very important to the success of 
this team," says Clark. But he quickly points 
out that Braun is only one player. "Obvi­
ously, [senior forward] Rafael Garcia and 
[junior forward] Devon Prescod have got 
to step up and help him in there, but we need 
all the other players to step up as well.... 
Erich's very important to us, and it's im­
12 SEPTEMBER 2002 
portant that he plays well, but it's impor­tant that other people alongside him also play well so that they take a little bit ofthe pressure off." 
The Irish started the season with a win over Southwest Missouri State, a tie with 19th ranked Creighton and an impressive 4-0 shutout ofdivision rival and 6th-ranked Seton Hall. The result has been a boost in the polls and their confidence level, but it also has led to an increasing amount ofpres­sure from the fans and the media. Never­theless, Clark says that the Irish aren't af­fected by outside views. 
"I think we always put the pressure on ourselves. I think the only pressure you ever need to put is on yourself, to be the best that you can be. The rest is never really worth worrying much about. ... That's the way I want the boys to think about it and that's certainly the way I function .... The only pressure that we have is, at practice, to perform to a maximum potential." 
With strong leadership, solid team chem­istry, determined focus and incredible work ethic, there are no limits to what the Irish can accomplish this season. They have all of the attributes of a contender for the na­tional championship. The only thing hold­ing them back now is time. D

Me Write Pretty One Day 
What an Arts and Letters student goes through when he's actually forced to work 
71ough I'm still looking for him, I fear the chances that a lightly jaded but generally good-natured homeless man liv­
mg in the basement ofthe library is going to teach me valu­able lessons about life are growing slimmer by the day. Given the rumors regarding the sort of activities that go on in Hesburgh's basement, this may be just as well, but there comes a point when one will grasp at any sort ofinspiration that comes along. The fact that I've resorted to obscure Joe Pesci movie references this early in the column is perhaps indicative of a larger problem, but the reader can at least take comfort in the fact that I haven't yet men­tioned the agony on film that was 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag. 
What I'm trying in my own rambling Faulknerian way to get around to mention­ing is the fact that this is the year I finally have to do some real work at this university: complete a senior thesis. While I'm some­what buoyed by the knowledge that this ar­ticle was 150 words deep before the main idea was even mentioned (indicating what I believe is an innate ability for slinging it with the best ofthem), the ever approaching dead­lines have been a pretty clear reminder to me that I ultimately have no idea what I'm do­ing. When people ask me, I typically mumble something about a think-piece involving in­fidelity and Jeanette Winterson, after which I deliberately spill something on myself and pretend I need to go home and change. Several applications ofthis process have taught me two important things: 
1. 
"Tide with Bleach Alternative" proves woefully inadequate at getting out tomato juice stains. 

2. 
People only ask you what you're doing because they like to see you squirm. I honestly didn't mean to let it get this bad this quickly. I made a 


number ofpurchases that I thought would be conducive to writing a thesis -a book titled Writing Tour Dissertation in Fifteen Min­utes a Day, a few reams of printer paper and a bottle of wine to help get the ideas flowing. As of now, the paper has been used to make three origami cranes, the book is still sitting on my shelf, and the only thing I know for certain about my thesis is that I am one hell of a guy who needs a lot more wine. I briefly contemplated a government-related dissertation proving the prohibition of Sun­day liquor sales makes Indiana a fascist regime, but was ultimately discouraged by the fact that there's only so many times I can be called a shiftless drunkard without starting to believe it myself. 


Reflecting on things a little more, I've come to realize that my real problem here isn't one ofpages, but passion. I see people who are fabulously excited to write about mitochondria or the effect that a Russian translation of Lolita had on post-War Communist morale, and I can't help but envy them. There are lots of things I like, but very few that I'm truly passionate about. J.K. Rowling has created a great little series with her Harry Potter books, but could I write 80 pages about the idiocy of the claims by radical Christian groups that the novels are nothing but Satanism wrapped 
up in child-friendly packaging? Sure, I en­joy the occasional game ofKnockout Kings 2000, but I'd be hard pressed to create a well­written thesis titled "Lightning in a Bottle: How in. the World did Joe Frazier Ever Man­age to BeatMuhammadAli, Especially Con­sideringAli has at LeastTen Inches ofReach on Him, Plus Frazier's C-Button CombosAre Absolute Garbage? "The best idea, ofcourse, is to combine something that you would love writing about with something that's likely to get you a job in your chosen profession, but considering today's wintry economic cli­mate, you're better off titling your thesis "Why McDonald's Should Laugh in the Face of the Fat People Suing Them" and hoping for the best. 

Which brings us, in a roundabout way, back to my thesis. No, I don't really have a clear idea ofwhat I'm doing yet. No, I haven't chosen a formal advisor as such, let alone discussed with him or her what my vision for this heartbreaking work of staggering ge­nius is. There, however, is the rub: In spite ofall these obstacles ( or perhaps because of them), I have no doubt that everything will work itself out for the best. I'm involved in any number of activi­ties this year, but I'm convinced that the work is there, a brilliant essay on the true meaning of love in the novels of Jeanette Wmterson, just waiting for the right moment for me to pluck it down from style heaven. In the end, this paper only has to be some­thing like 80 pages, and that's really not so bad, in the grand scheme of things. In my mind, it's entirely plausible that I will start the thesis sometime in November and have a working rough draft by the time Christmas break rolls around. Many believe that such a wish is childishly optimistic, or even impossible. I believe that the completion of this thesis will prove that only the impossible is worth the effort. D

Architecture professor Thomas Gordon Smith exhibits his work at the South 

Bend Regional Museum ofArt 
CAROLYNSWEENEY

Wantler into O'Shaughnessy or 
DeBartolo and mention the 
name Vitruvius and you'll-re­ceive more than a few blank stares. Try the same thing in Bond Hall, however, and al­most every student, from freshmen to fifth­years, will be able to enlighten you about his ideas and writings. 
Marcus Vitruvius Pollios, a Roman archi­tect and founding father of the profession, is revered by archies much as Euclid is by math majors, and Socrates is by philosophy students. Around 25 B.C., Vitruvius wrote down his understanding of architecture on 10 scrolls. Thomas Gordon Smith, a profes­sor in the architecture school, has spent years studying Vitruvius and his architectural writ­ings. They are the topic ofhis newest book, due out in early 2003. 
The book will include a translation ofthe text of the scrolls, as well as Smith's com­mentary on and illustrations of the text, which replace the long-lost illustrations originally created by Vitruvius. The draw­ings that will be reproduced as plates in the book are on display until September 22 at the South Bend Regional Museum ofArt. 
"This is a very long-term project, as I've been working on it for maybe 20 years," Smith says as he enters the exhibit room. He points to photographs of smil­ing faces among building ruins, and ex­plains that they are some family shots from a 10-week trip to Turkey taken 1S years ago. "We went there to look at build­ings along the coast where Ephesus and other cities known through biblical refer­ences are located, which was called Ionia in ancient times. The Ionian people in about 300 BC developed Ionic architecture, which was a very high form .of architecture. For 
28 SCHOLASTICENTERTAINMENT 
Vitruvius, Ionic was the perfect develop­ment," he explains, delving into a quick Vitruvius 101 lesson. 
"Ionic architects wrote books about their buildings and described the proportions of the constructions. Some ofthose books sur­vived into the period ofChrist, when Rollie was under the rule ofthe emperor Augustus. Drawing from these writings, Vitruvius, an architect who had mainly done military ar­chitecture, wrote 10 books on architecture 
"The idea of the illustrations is to read his words, both about instructions for house proportions and other cases il­lustrating his more general, theoretical ideas and illustrate them to give a graphic, tan­gible expression of his ideas." -Thomas Gordon Smith, architecture professor 
and presented them to Augustus as kind ofa guidebook for how to rebuild Rome. Those books were appreciated and gained popu­larity in the medieval times, and so manu­scripts of his books, which were originally scrolls, were copied at that time. For this rea­son, it is the only ancient book on architec­ture that has survived to our time." 
Vitruvius' writings are valuable not only for their antiquity, but for his striking un­derstanding ofthe gravity ofhis profession. Because an architect's work figures so prominently in the existences of countless people who live and work in his creations, he has a deep responsibility to those people. 
In addition to describing specific archi­tectural proportions and rules, Vitruvius also addresses the philosophy ofthe field, stress­ing the value of balance and grace in both the buildings and the lives ofthose who de­sign them. 
Smith referred to Vitruvius' writings as a model for his current work as a practicing architect and educator. "This project also gave me a basis for directing the school of architecture in a classical direction," he says. "What's in this book gives an architect a basis for his ideas, and then you obviously ·interpret the words differently in different times." 
Smith's ideology has indeed evolved over the years. He was the chair ofthe school of architecture from 1989 until 1998 and in­troduced the classical curriculum, for which the school is well-known, during his tenure. He also designed Bond Hall, which currently houses the architecture school. After grow­ing up in San Francisco, and graduating from the University ofCalifornia-Berkeley, where he received both his undergraduate liberal arts degree and his master's degree in archi­tecture in 1975, Smith_ worked at an archi­tectural firm before entering academia. He taught at Yale, UCLA and the University of Illinois at Chicago before arriving at Notre Dame. 
Originally a follower ofthe post-modern­ist movement in the 1970s, Smith eventu­ally developed a classical approach to the field and has since played a large role in the revival ofclassicism in contemporary archi­tecture. His book will attempt to capture the evolution ofVitruvius' ideas over the years. Smith explains that "ofVitruvius' 10 books, I've taken the five that pertain the most to architecture's influence today. It will be a 
12 SEPTEMBER 2002 
retranslation of Vitruvius' words, with my commentary, explaining what I think he means, as well as a lot of photographs and illustrations, some of which are displayed in this exhibit. The idea of the illustrations is to read his words, both about instructions for house proportions and other cases illus­trating his more general, theoretical ideas and illustrate them to .give a graphic, tan­gible expression ofhis ideas." 
The illustrations on display in the exhibit certainly achieve this goal. Their detail and balanced layouts demonstrate the very characteristics that Vitruvius stressed as important in a work of architecture. The paintings each focus on a different idea from Vitruvius' books. "The one on the left is an illustration of his idea of deco­rum, which is sort oflike the etiquette of architecture," Smith says, pointing to a watercolor that depicts different gods standing near architectural elements. 
"Vitruvius describes how the types of architecture, including Doric, Ionic and Corinthian, are associated with different types of characters. In his case he uses gods and goddesses to exemplify the char­acteristics ofthe order. Ifyou're building a temple for Athena or a temple for Mars, the appropriate order would be Doric, whereas Venus and her delicacy and beauty are associated with Corinthian ar­chitecture, which is very refined." 
"I also illustrated his idea that there's a relationship between the.proportion of a human being and the proportion of a building," he says, pointing at yet another watercolor that juxtaposes a human form and a column of a building, demonstrat­ing that there exist universal proportions of beauty. The length of a· person's head in relation to the rest of the body, for ex­ample, can guide an architect when de­ciding on the size of the capital, or top part, of a column. 
Other paintings explore the literary back­ground of architecture, as one illustrates a legend discussed by Vitruvius that explains the origin of Corinthian architecture. The story explains that a sculptor passing through Corinth saw a basket placed on a young girl's grave site, which had been overgrown with plants in the spring, and was inspired to create a more flowery type of architecture. "This painting shows how you can see a natural accident and translate it to a more formal solution," Smith says. 
Smith's book is the product ofa collabo­ration with ND colleagues and students that seems fitting in light ofVitruvius' love of 
12 SEPTEMBER 2002 
balance and depth. Vitruvius' original Latin and Greek words were translated by a Notre Dame faculty member, and the book will also include drawings by a former student of Smith's, who accom­panied his family on their trip to Turkey. 
"A lot ofthis project is collaborative and about working with others, and trying to synthesize ideas," Smith explained. The va­riety ofcontributors will help the book dis­tinguish itself from other analyses of Vitruvius, which have been produced for cen­turies. "This kind of project has been done about 100 times in the past 500 years," Smith says. "With the Renais­sance desire to revive Classicism, there was a lot ofinterest in his ideas during it, and people kind of rediscovered Vitruvius. They started reconsidering his themes, which them­selves are reflections on the past. Vitruvius was not inventing these ideas, but inheriting them and reiterating them." 
The words so often used to describe Vitruvius' ideas -in­heritance, development, evolution, balance, grace and beauty-seem nec­essary to explain Smith's work, as well. His paint­ings not only capture Vitruvius' words, but his theories on art and architecture seem to mirror those ofhis sub­ject. Leaving his symmetrical, graceful ex­hibit, Smith's art and ideas seem to embody Vitruvius' phrase concinnitas -a virtually untranslatable Latin word meant to convey utter beauty and order; a quality not easily explained in words, but immediately iden­tifiable when seen in art or architecture; a quality that pervades Smith's corner of the museum. 0 








Alternate Personalities 
How to make new friends out of your old ones 
KATIEHUGHES 

Discovering someone's alter­nate personality is like making a new friend without having to re­member a new person's birthday, phone number ·and screen name. And when you live in a place where seven out of IO girls in your first class of the day are named Katie, you eat pasta stir fry every night and wake up in your 12-by-14 room ev­ery morning, discovering an alternate per­sonality can be a pleasant little kick in the pants just when you need it. For example: This sum­an uncanny ability to detect a fake ID by smelling it. What's more, he could incite mini-riots with a carefully-crafted con­descending shake of his head and make seven-foot-tall men soaked in cologne question their manhood. He sent 90­pound girls home in cop cars without bat­ting an eye. He added to his resume one slap received in the face from a very, very bitter girl wearing a very, very heavy Tiffany's bracelet. It was a beautiful and mysterious transformation.

We didn't really get it in the beginning. Dennis as a bouncer made about as much sense as Monk Malloy joining the Ice Capades. We didn't think he would last a week in the doorway ofBar Anticipation, but not only did he last, he blossomed in the dark neon light outside that bar like someone was feeding him some kind of miracle bouncer growth hormone. By the time he left "Bar A," he had developed ously through his stories. Deep down, there's a part of all of us that wants to be tough. We go to the gym and watch BattleBots. We buy enormous SUVs so we can feel tougher than people who drive tiny, slow cars. We super-size so we can feed our tough bodies. Ifsomeone offered to pay me for being tough, I would prob­ably take the job. We gathered around Dennis for bouncerstory time and listened in wide-eyed wonder. Tales of confronta­tional drunk people are almost always at least a little more interesting than ac­counts of interning in offices, serving eggs and coffee, and watching the mildew grow on pools all day. And as slightly bit­ter 20-year-olds who couldn't get within a mile of most indomitable Jersey bars, we lived vicariously through Dennis 's sto­ries. Stories about silly underage boys and girls and about how bars aren't for kids. They always seemed to end with him tell­ing someone, "Yeah, that's what I 
thought." 
I had never seen my friend get violent with anything other than his printer. But he was so intimidating he 
mannered friend was banned for life from the bar. Yeah, that's what I thought. 
Some people set goals for themselves for the new school year, like getting bet­ter grades or trying to be more organized. They post quotes like, "Success is work­ing hard at something you love," and "Go get 'em, Tiger," on their walls to inspire them. I think I'm going to write, "Dennis was a bouncer" on a little sticky note somewhere and try to channel the alter­nate personality gods to descend on me as well. D

Reflection on a yearfrom september 11 
Scholastic asked 
members of 
the Notre Dame communityfor reflections on the past year. Here are a few of 
their responses. 

The world has always beenfull ofuncertainties. That is the condition for a free and open world. Personally, I prefer it this way. In such a world there are centers of strength, especially ifwebelieve in a God who loves us, died for us and gives us each day whatever grace we need to live as Christians, including loving others who are loved with difficulties. 
-Theodore M Hesburgh, C.S.C., President Emeritus ofthe University ofNotre Dame 
As I stood there that morning in my Army ROTC uniform, my girlfriend and I knew our lives would be changed forever. My commitment to the Army held more significance. Thecries that arose inlower Manhat­tan carried across this nation, and around the world. The bloodied debris, masses ofsteel and tom concrete that stole so many innocent lives were shoved directly onto all America's shoulders. That day I knew why I volun­teered to be a United States Army Soldier. 
-Ryan J. Kelly, senior, Army ROTC Cadet Battalion Commander 
In the weeks after that, I watched in amazement as people from every nation, every faith, friends and foes, came together to share the pains of America, and I wondered iffinally this was going to bring peace and tolerance amongst people. Alas, somewhere during the last year we seem to have lost the peace and the tolerance I had seen then. Today I look at the changes occurring and I often have to wonder if America views me as a different person because of my faith, my heritage or my color. Did I suddenly lose my humanity because ofacts perpetrated by other people? Will people ever be comfortable ifI suddenly grew a beard, wore aturban and wanted to fly to LA? A yearago, I felt like a global citizen looking at "one world," and today all I see are the fragmented pieces, andI have to wonder which one I should call my 
home. 

-Haseeb Mahmood, Co-president ofthe Pakistan Association ofNotre Dame 
I believe that at the root ofthe attacks there lay a feeling ofmisunderstanq.ing that manifested itself in the rage thatwewitnessed. I came to a realization that inorder to keep misunderstandings from going tosuchanextreme, people _peed to change the way we interact with one another. Treating a stranger orsomeonewhois different. from you with respect and really trying to understand their perspective can make a world ofdifference. 
-SarahFinch, Junior, Co-President, Pasquerilla West 
32 SCHOLASTICFINAL WORD 

to september 11 
There were over I00 families from my town who lost somebody. It's strange going home now. There's a feeling that things have changed; it feels like it happened yesterday. Up until the beginning of the summer, they were still having funerals. I don't think New Yorkers are separate from the rest of the country, but they've been especially scarred. It's just weird going home. The city's not the same. ButI don'tthinkNewYorkers have been beaten down by thi_s; I think it made them proud. 
-Kristin Capece, senior, Farley Hall, from Long Island 

After September 11th, I found hope for the future rooted in my experience ofthe Gospel, the support of the Christian community and the sense that, theologically, the mystery we proclaim is perma­nently connecting us together with the cross and the power of the resurrection. When a loved one dies, even the tragic loss oflife oflarge numbers of people, it forces me to reflect on my fundamental convictions: that God makes all things new, and that we can be healed and through this healing our hope for the future can be sustained. 
-Rev.· Edward Malloy, C.S. C., President ofthe University ofNotre Dame 

This su:qimer I lived and worked in lower Manhat­tan, within blocks ofwhere the World Trade Cen­ter once stood. There I saw how life had changed from the fear and shock ofSeptember to a dedica­tion to rebuild. New Yorkers, like all Americans, had decided that the best way to respond to this tragedy was to persevere in their lives while hon­oring the memory of those who died. For me, the true meaning of 9/11 rests in how we as a nation have responded. -Trip Foley, senior, Student Body Vice President 
The greatest lesson I can learn from such sadness is that at the heart ofhurt and terror and anger still lies love. We hurt because we love each other and allow ourselves to care about another's anguish. We fear because, even with its million problems, we love our world and are so scared of losing it. And we are angered because we loved who and what we lost that day. I cannot minimize the crip­pling feelings that still lingerfrom that day, but I do firid comfort in the awareness that I can share my suffering with people of such great love. 
-Rebecca Lyman, senior, Lyons Hall
