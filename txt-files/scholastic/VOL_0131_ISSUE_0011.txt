A Note to Our Readers 
Scholastic's annual Football Review has made fantastic strides in recent years. Ricky Watters' centerspread shot in our 1987 edition marked the first time color photography graced the pages of any of our recent issues, much less one entirely devoted to Notre Dame's second religion (or first, depending on the strength of your allegiance). Last year's issue served as a landmark as well. We honored our national champion­ship team with a special 56~page spread containing four color shots and an all-glossy finish, a first for our publication. With this year's Irish squad boasting the nation's best record against the country's toughest slate ofopponents, we felt obligated to go a step further. The 1989 issue features an unprecedented number of pages (64) to go along with our largest color photography display to date (eight photos). Although budget limitations prevent us from publishing an all-glossy edition this year, we're confident you will find the overall quality of this issue to exceed that of past editions. Recall with us a 1989 season that added a special chapter to Notre Dame football lore. From Notre Dame's explosive first half at the Kickoff Classic against Viginia to its inspired second half against Colorado to capture the Orange Bowl Championship, this season hardly paled as a sequel to last year championship campaign, providing mountain­ous highs along with a few lows. The school record 23-game winning streak that peaked at Penn State's Beaver Stadium, where ND had never won, may never fall. Who can forget the Rocket's two kick returns to propel the Irish to victory on a soggy day in Ann Arbor, or the defense's goal line stands against Southern Cal and the Buffaloes? Relive the disappointment of Miami's third and 44 "Hail Mary" pass to perpetuate Notre Dame's woes in the Orange Bowl, and share in the Irish triumph a month later in the same stadium. It is our sincere hope that this issue will serve as a reminder of the season not only today, but as a keepsake for future consumption. Finally, we wish to extend special thanks to John Heisler and the Notre Dame Sports Information staff, the Dome, the South Bend Tribune, Mike Bennett and John and Vicki Dlugolecki for their assistance. Their contributions, along.with those ofour hard-working staff, were essential in making this issue possible. Enjoy.

. , -. Now, Notre Dame took a seasoned, talented squad to the field. But true to form, Head Coach Lou Holtz spent much of the week preceding the Kickoff Classic doubting his team's chance for success. 

In the wake of several recent events, it appeared as if Holtz may have had genuine cause for concern. After all, the Irish had In addition to deficiencies resulting from graduation, various difficulties unexpect­edly sidelined Michael Stonebreaker, Tony Brooks, Braxston Banks and George Wil­

A personal foul at the end of the play moved the ball to the Virginia seven yard line. Three plays later, Rice pitched to Ricky Watters for a two-yard touchdown putting the Irish on the board early. 
Quickly stuffing the Cavaliers on downs, Notre Dame forced the first of Ed Gamo's seven punts. Watters' return of 24.yards set up a nine-play drive featuring five Anthony Johnson carries. The final run foundJ ohnson sprawled out in the end zone after a one yard

prior to squaring off with highly ranked Michigan. He was less than impressed with the results. 
"For the first 25 minutes we were a top 20 team. For the last 35 minutes we were a bottom 20 team," said the fourth year Irish coach. 
Welsh appreciated the sight of Tony Rice and company watching from the sidelines prior to the end of the first half. "I think he was nice to us. It could have been much worse. They are awfully good," said Welsh, the ninth year head coach of the Cavaliers. 
The game was billed as a battle of quarter­backs, but Shawn Moore, the Virginia field general, had a difficult time getting un­tracked. Moore, who eventually became one of the nation's highest rated passers, con­nected on only 3 of 12 first half passes while throwing two interceptions. 
The Virginia ground attack boasted Marcus Wilson, a returning starter and lead­ing rusher from the previous season, along with his backup, Terry Kirby, one of the nation'smosthighlyregardedfreshmen. The tandem combined for 116 yards but only 18 of those came in the first half. 
"At a point you have to say, 'We're going to do it' and that point never came in the first half. It came in the second half, but by that 
quite a workout. Hen­trich connected on one of two field goals and his seven kickoffs reached the ten yard line on the average. Meanwhile, two of the Irish touchdowns resulted in six points following conversion attempts. Hackett missed one, and Rice was stopped on a two-point attempt after the next touchdown. 
Even an impressive win failed to erase genuine concern from the mind of Holtz. "We won't be a good team until we are a dominating defense." 
The polls tended to disagree with the coach's definition ofa"good team." Coming into the game, Notre Dame was ranked #2 AP and #1 UPI. Furthermore, they were ranked

Road 
to Victory 
The Rocket's two kick returns for touchdowns spark Notre Dame to its third straight win over the Wolverines 

BY JIM MAGGIO 
Sept.16, Ann Arbor, MI-
hen someone asked Lou Holtz 
if he had a name for the play 
that buried Michigan on this soggy Saturday afternoon in Ann Arbor, he responded with a shrug. "Middle," he re­plied, almost embarrassed by the moniker. "We're not real clever." 
Holtz didn't have to be, not when he could unleash Raghib Ismail on kickoff re­turns. Twice the Wolverines elected to kick deep to the "Rocket" in the second half, and twice they walked away kicking themselves for it Ismail's returns of 88 and 92 yards 
w 
translated in to 12 points and the difference in 
Notre Dame's 24-19 win over Bo 
Schembechler's second-ranked squad. 
Ismail gave a prelude of things to come 
last November when he returned kicks of 87 
and 83 yards for touchdowns in a · 54-11 
shellacking of the Rice Owls. But the Owls 
were a winless team at the time, and while no 
one questioned the abilities ofthe sophomore 
speedster, no_t many would have bet on the 
same thing happening against the defending 
Big Ten champions. Certainly not Holtz, 
who quickly jumped to Schembechler's de­
fense for giving Ismail two chances. "Bo's 
won a lot ofgames doing that," he explained. 
"He sort ofwent against his trend, but I never . question anything Bo does in a game." 
And who could really blame him? Ismail's second-half explosions were the exception to Notre Dame's rule of playing conservative, possession football on a rainy day. After all, the Rocket's lone return of the first stanza netted only 11 yards, and the Irish were content to grind it out on the slick Michigan Stadium turf. 
With fullback Anthony Johnson and quarterback Tony Rice carrying the bulk of the load, Notre Dame rushed on 27 consecu­tive offensive plays in the first halfbefore throwing a pass. Following Scott Kowalkowski's second quarter fumble re­covery at the Michigan 2A, the Irish ran Johnson left, right and center to a first and goal at the two. An illegal motion penalty

Bolcar's hit knocked Taylor out of the game with a bruised back, and sud­denly Michigan's fate was left to a redshirt freshman named Elvis. Elvis Grbac, that is. 
Grbac's first series in a.. Michigan uniform consisted ofa running play for minus yardage 
pushed them back 19 the six . before Rice completed his first pass of the afternoon to Johnson · for the touchdown. Craig Hentrich'spoint after gave Notre Drune a 7­0 lead. 
The Wolverines responded on their next drive to close the gap. Desmond Howard's 38-yard kickoff return gave Michigan the ball at their own 41, and the offense began to click after collecting a measly 40 yards in the first 25 minutes. Quarterback Michael Taylor's 14-yard completion to Chris Cal­loway, along with a string of Irish penahies, helped Michigan to a first and goal at the six. Taylor tossed to Calloway again on third and nine for the touchdown, but J. D. Carlson's point after attempt hit the left upright and sent Michigan to the locker room at the half trail­ing by one. 
The respective defensive units con­trolled much of the first half as Michigan (99 total offensive yards) and Notre Dame (115) seemed destined for a full day of trench warfare. But as slow·as the first 30 minutes seemed, the second 30 began at warp speed. 
Carlson's kick to open the third quarter rose, then descended into Ismail's waiting hands at the Irish 12. Remembering Holtz' catchy name for the task at hand, he sped up the middle at the first wave of blockers. · A key Ryan Mihalko block enabled Ismail to dartto the right sideline, and from there it was a footrace. The Wolverines' Corwin Brown appeared to have the angle on him, but the 
-Rocket's 4.28 speed took it away as he raced unhindered into the end zone. Hentrich converted the extra point, and after just i1 ticks of the· clock the Irish led by eight. 
· The play seemed to light a fire under the 
and two incomplete passes. When Eduardo Azcona's 35-yard punt en­abled Notre Dame to answer with Hentrich 's 30-yard field goal, the Wolverines' chances appeared doomed. Grbac would have to mature fast, and-Domers bedamned-the kid shook it off, making like the King himself with a stellar performance. 
"Coach (Offensive Coordinator Gary) Moeller told me; 'Ifyou screw up,just go on and forget it;"'.said Grbac about his introduc­tion to college football. "The first series I was in jitters, but I settled _in after that. I just wanted to lead the team." 
Henearly led Michigan to victory. Start­ing from his own 39, Grbac came out sling­ing. His completions of 19 and 23 yards to split end· Greg McMurtry helped move the 
. ball to the Irish five, where Grbac finished off the 12-play drive with a touchdown strike to tight end Derrick Walker. The two-point conversion attempt failed, but the rejuve­nated freshman had brought the Wolverines back to life. Just as the 105,912 fans in Michigan Stadium began to rock the house, someone pulled the plug on all their fun. You could sense what went through every Wolverine fan's mind as Gulam Khan's ensuing kickoff sailed high and deep. Oh no, not to him again. The Rocket took Khan's kick and headed straight up the middle once more. Dodging three tackles, he broke to the left sideline and had only the kicker to beat. Rodney Culver too~ care of that problem, waylaying Khan (who broke his left arm on the play) and giving Ismail clear sailing for a

92-yard touchdown return. That, capped by Hentrich's PAT, put the Irish up by 12 with 12:46 to play. 
Both teams traded possessions before Michigan had the ball once more with under eight minutes to play. Grbac came out throwing again from his own 33, and 13 plays later had pulled the Wolverines back in it with a four-yard scoring pass to McMurtry. Gibac's success through the air ( 17 for 21, 134 yards, 2 touchdowns) was a factor the Irish had not counted on. 
"We thought he'd be a little off balance," said Bolcar. "We should have pressured him more, but Grbac played really well. He found his receivers and stayed in the pocket well." 
Trailing 24-19 with just over four minutes re­maining, the Wolverines opted for the onside kick. As if Schembechler wasn't peeved enough with Carlson for his missed extra point, imagine his disgust after Carlson's attempt failed to travel the required IO

Johnson's one-yard plunge provided the Irish with the winning margin. 
It looks ugly, but Notre Dame gets by the Spartans in its home opener 


BY BRIAN MCMAHON 
Sept. 23, Notre Dame-
he wind-whipped air was filled
T 
with excited anticipation when 
top-ranked Notre Dame hosted its first party of the 1989 season against Michi­gan State. With the last two games of their 1988 national championship season away from the friendly confines of Notre Dame 
, Stadium and the first two ofthis season on the road as well, the 2-0 Irish were anxious to play in front of their loyal fans. 
The invited guests were fired up as well. Although the game wouldn't count in the Big Ten standings, the Spartans desperately wanted to avoid the same rough start that saw them lose four of five to start the 1988 cam­·paign. The Spartans were on a roll after demolishing Miami (Ohio) 49-0 the previous week, and a victory at Notre Dame would vault them into the Big Ten season with a lot of steam-not to mention avenge the previous year's 20-3 loss at home to the Irish. 
The Irish were gracious hosts on this cool September Saturday, yielding four turnovers (three of which lead to Spartan scores) and sputtering offensively for much of the after-· noon. Expected to be the life of the party, Notre Dame quarterback Tony Rice had what he woul.d call later the ''worst" game of his career, throwing two interceptions, complet­ing just eight of 15 passes and fumbling once. 
It wasn't pretty, but when it was allover the Irish had extended their home unbeaten streak to 13 games with a 21-13 victory. 
"We're gratified to win," said Notre Dame Head Coach Lou Holtz afterward. "I

15 tackles led both teams and his inspired 
play seemed to lift his team. 
"We aren't being very productive inside for the type of defense we're seeing," said Holtz, reacting to his team's struggle with the · Spartan defense. "But let's give them credit. Percy Snow is a great linebacker. There was some great hitting out there on the field on 
both sides." 
MSU later drove to Notre Dame's 38, but 
the Irish defense was detennined not to allow 
another score. Sure enough, Enos dropped 
back to pass on third and 10 and was sacked 
by junior end Andre Jones for a loss of 16. 
The sack knocked the Spartans out of field 
goal range and forced them to punt once

Notre Dame's own failure to generate more offense gave the Spartans new life, but not for long. On the first play of the fourth quarter Enos took the snap from the Irish 46 on second and 10. Drifting back with no pressure at all, he threw a weak pass that junior linebacker Donn Grimm intercepted at the 38. Grimm and Bolcar anchored the Irish defense on this day, combining for 18 tack­!es, a sack, an interception and two blocked passes while playing every down. 
Following an exchange of possessions, the Irish offense finally gave Notre Dame a point cushion with which to work. Starting from their own 38 they ran nine plays on the ground, punctuated by a one-yard scoring run by Johnson to give the Irish a 21-13 lead with 
8:16 left in the contest. 
Michigan State wasn't finished, though. They took the kickoff and marched to the Irish 25, where they faced a fourth and one situation.

Perles thought Rice played exceptionally, despite the quarterback's self criticism. "The credit goes to Rice," he said. "He's one heck

of a guy to defend. His judgements were good. He ran tlie ball and that's when he's most dangerous (Rice had 78 rushing yards on the day). He threw the ball on occasion pretty well. He was a pretty well-rounded player out there today. He was really the big difference. He's a legitimate great football player and God bless him. I'm glad I'll never see him again."· 
· When told of Perles' comments, Rice admitted being "surprised," adding that "it will go down as a win, but in my book it was only so-so." He wasn't going to dwell on the day, though. "I have to learn from the mis,. takes and make things better next week," he said. 
"Next week" would send the Irish to Purdue, and Holtz was his usual distraught self at the prospect of facing a team the Irish have manhandled in recent years. "I under­stand that they've beaten Notre Dame every year after they (Notre Dame) won a national championship," he said. "I'm concerned in a lot of areas." 
Uh-huh.

Purdue Head · Coach Fred Akers was disgusted with the turnovers and realized that they were the reason for the lopsided score. 
"It was pretty plain to me that when you play the number one team, you have to play almost perfect football, and we didn't do that," said Akers. "Eight turnovers eliminate the chance to win against anybody, much less against Notre Dame." . 
an option left for the touch­down and a 14-0 Irish lead. 
After the game, Holtz showered praise on his quarterback and team leader, who by virtue of this victory improved his rec­ord as Notre Dame's start­ing quarterback to 20-2. 
"I evaluate Tony Rice solely on how many times he gets the team into the end zone," said Holtz, "He ran the option well and had a strong day passing, but that is not unexpected from a player the caliber of Tony Rice." 
And what ofRice him­self? As usual, he evalu­ated his best day thus far as Notre Dame quarterback by deflecting all the praise to his teammates. 
"Purdue played man­to-man defense and we took advantage of what they gave us," said Rice. "A game like this gave me and my receivers confi­dence. It was a total team effort." 
Notre Dame's next touchdown would come from a inost unusual source. Defensive tackle Jeff Alm, whose three in­terceptions during the 1988 The majority of r;>erek Brown's 10"1 receiving yards, resulted from running after the catch. J,;,; 




The second half gave Holtz a chance to play some of his second team, but the results were not what Holtz was looking for. The de­fense played well, but the offense sputtered. Freshman quarterback Rick Mirer led the Irish to two Craig Hentrich field goals of 19 and 22 yards, but overall the second team offense lacked cohesion and did not impress, a fact which disturbed Holtz. 
"We had too many fumbles in the second half to say that we played well," said Holtz. "Our second unit lacked consistency and needs great improvement." 
The second half for Purdue was an exer­cise in futility, best evidenced in a bizarre fourth-quarter sequence where Purdue quar­terbacks fumbled and lost three straight snaps from center. First, Eric Hunter fumbled the snap and Notre Dame defensive end Troy Ridgely recovered. Then, after a Hentrich field goal made it 37-0, deja vu-Hunter fumbled the snap, and Ridgely recovered. Fi­nally, after Hentrich missed a 37-yard field goal attempt, Steve Lesniewicz fumbled the snap and freshman Brian Ratigan fell on it. Hentrich drilled his second field goal, and the Irish led 40-0. 
The Boilermaker fans got so fed up with the com­edy of errors on the field that when Purdue finally executed a snap from cen­ter, the fans gave a deri­llaCOl sive, 30-second standing ovation. When they got

With 33 seconds remaining in the game, Purdue finally scored on abizzare-play at the Notre Dmne three. Letnich was flushed from ihe pocket and scrambled to his right. Under heavy pressure, Letnich shovel-passed the ball under his arm and the waving hands of a Notre Dmne defender to ~od ·oennis for a touchdown that~ccounted for Purdue's lone 
score. 
After the game, Akers assessed Notre Dame's overwhelming squad. "They have great temn speed and talent, and you al I know how deep they are," he said. "They're the most talented group I've ever seen put to­gether in a long time, maybe the best ever. They are clearly the number one team iri the 
country.'' 
Zorich, though, was not pleased with the performance of the defense. "I don't think we are a good defense yet," he offered. "Purdue had too many yards rushing and that is not good." .

kicked a 42-yard field goal and Stanford led by six heading into the second quarter. The score was set up by a shanked punt by Hen­trich, which gave Stanford the ball on the Notre Dame 32. 
Notre Dame got on the board early in the second stanza. It took the Irish just four plays to go 64 yards, keyed by runs of 25 and 38 from Anthony Johnson and Tony Rice. Johnson carried into the end zone from seven yards out and Craig Hentrich's PAT gave the Irish the lead, 7-6. 
Stanford's propensity to pass caught up with them seven minutes later. Notre Dame's defensive philosophy against a pass-oriented offense is to avoid being burned by. the long pass and hit the receiver where he catches the ball, the theory being that an offense putting the ball in the air that much will self-destruct. 
Smith's thirty-fifth pass of the first half set upNotreDame'ssecond touchdown. The pass, intended for senior tight end Jim Price, was deflected into the hands of Francisco, who returned it 20 yards to the Stanford 32. 
"We knew they'd pass a lot," said Irish safety Pat Terrell, who finished with two interceptions on the day. "They were drop­ping the ball off in the flats, going to the sidelines. We didn't get frustrated." 
Nine plays after Francisco's interception, Rice pitched to sophomore fullback Rodney Culver, who went in untouched from the two for his second touchdown of the season. Hentrich's kick made the score 14-6 entering the second half. 
Stanford's game-tying score half way through the third quarter came at the end ofa 79-yard drive when Smith found junior re­ceiver Ed McCaffery in the end zone from five yards out. On the previous play, third and goal from the ten, Stanford got a break when Irish comerback Stan Smagala was called for interference for tripping Stanford receiver Chris Walsh.

Cardinal Head Coach Dennis Green, be­hind by two, elected to go for the tic. Smith's pass for Jon Pinckney fell incom­plete, but the Irish were called for interfer­ence again. This time Francisco was the culprit, setting up Vardell's one-yard plunge to tie the score. That set the stage for Ismail's heroi~s. 
Up 21-14, the Irish threatened late in the quarter but failed to earn a first down on fourth and one from the five. The quarter ended with Notre Dame up by a touchdown. 
The fourth quarter opened with the Irish driving from the Stanford 40. Hentrich kicked his first of two fourth-quarter field goals, a 20-yard kick that widened the lead LO 24-14. 
Stanford answered four and a half min­utes later when a 70-yard drive culminated in Hopkins' third field goal ofthe game, this one from 27 yards. Smith threw on nine of the drive's 12 plays, completing six, but couldn't engineer a touchdown, as the Irish defense tightened deep in its own end. The Cardinal would not threaten again. 
Terrell picked off Smith passes on each of the Cardinal's last two drives, the first of which led to an 18-yard field goal by Hen­trich and the last coming with just over a minute left, preserving the Trish's 27-17 vic­tory. 
"It was a hard fought, difficult game," Holtz concluded. "I wasn't surprised they played that well. Dennis Green and his coaches deserve all the credit in the world. 
"We played well on defense," he contin­ued. "Our plan was to cover them and let them dump it off or mix it up." 
Irish linebacker Donn Grimm put Smith's apparent success into perspective. "We didn't want to blitz a lot because they are so good man to man," he said. "We played a zone to avoid the big play, dropping eight guys back .. He (Smith) wasn't taking time to throw but we had a good rush for the defense we played." 
"Notre Dame is a fine team," summed up Green afterward. "They don't make mis­takes and they have good balance ... good teams make key plays." 
At Stanford Stadium that day, those quali­ties proved too much to overcome for the gritty Cardinal. II

Sophomore Raghib Ismail propels Notre Dame to a convincing road win over Air Force 
BY PETE LaFLEUR 
Oct. 14, Colorado Springs, CO-f Excited" described the atmosphere 
as the Air Force Academy pre­pared to face the first top-ranked opponent ever to visit Falcon Stadium, with a record 53,533 fans looking on in anticipa­
tion of an upset. An unprecedented four flyovers preceded the game, as jct fighters screeched in from the south and bomber planes rumbled over from the east. 
Three hours later, Notre Dame had un­leashed its own weapon. Powered by the multi-dimensional attack of Raghib "Rocket" Ismail, the Irish soared to an early lead on their way to a 41-27 win, smothering the upset hopes of the Air Force faithful. . 
"Our team is very hurt and very disap­
. pointed," sai<;l Air Force coach Fischer DcBerry. ·"We felt the stage was set for us to win; But we didn't play well enough to beat ,the nation~I champions." · ' Ismail stole the show in a game billed as a battle between two Reisman Trophy con­tenders, quarterbacks Tony Rice of Notre Dame and Dee Dowis of Air Force. "Every­body talks about Tony Rice and Dee Dowis, but we justwanted to do whatever it takes to win," said Irish Head Coach Lou Holtz. 
What it took was a vintage performance 
28 
from Ismail. The Rocket had the Falcons, who fell to 6-1, seeing double-make that "triple" -as he ran out ofthe backfield, caught passes, and returned both kickoffs and punts. When the flames subsided, Ismail, seeing his first extended action in the backfield and returning punts, accounted for 180 yards, more than one third of Notre Dame:,s 529 total yards. ·-, 
"We put [Rocket] at tailback a couple of plays early in the game and he did things very weII. We just decided to keep him there," said Holtz, as Notre Dame won its 18th straight game. Ismail's statistics spoke for themselves. The five-foot-ten, 175-pound . native ofWilkes-Barr~. Pennsylvania caught two passes for 32 yards, returned a punt 56 yards for a touchdown, and scored on a 24­yard reverse while rushing for 92 on the evening. 
But the statistics don't quite convey the significance oflsmail 's performance. While he rolled up yardage on two spectacular scores, the Rocket fumes still clouding the minds ofAir Force players were memories of Ismail blasting out ofthe backfield. On many ofthose plays he skirted to the outside, break­ing tackles and dragging Air Force defenders for. much-needed yards. But even more · importantly for the Irish, he gave senior full­back Anthony Johnson a !'"uch-needed break. 
· Johnson entered the game. as Notre . Dame's second-leading rusher· (291 yards) and leading scorer ·(eight touchdowns).-· More importantly, Johnson had been Not.re 
Dame's "money man." Entering the game, Johnson had carried an average offive times per game more than starting tailback Ricky Watters and was always called on for the important carries. But things changed in Colorado Springs, and Johnson's ankles were thankful. 
Johnson carried the ball only 13 times on this day as Watters (96 yards on 11 carries) and Ismail (10 carries) helped divy up the rushing duties. Johnson was needed on first down only five times, and his only key runs were on two fourth-down plunges: Aside from that, Ismail and Watters set up most of the drives. 
Ismail wasn'ttheonlystar, though. Rice was just as much a factor in taking the pres­sure off Johnson and in leading the Irish to quick points. Rice completed his first seven block by junior Scott Kowalkowski sprung passes, finishing with nine of 13 completions the Rocket, who, slanting towards the left for 123 yards. He also rushed for 71 yards on end zone marker, avoided a last-ditch diving 14 carries. Said DeBerry, "I'm really im­attempt by the Falcons' Jason Jones. Air pressed with Rice. He's the catalyst for Notre Force never recovered, while Ismail and the Dame." Irish only got better. 



The Irish went up 21-0 before Air Force The Falcons managed to put 14 first-half had even recorded a first down, scoring with points on the board, thanks to scoring passes a deadly combination of execution and from Dowis to fullback Greg Johnson and speed. The first two scores came off sus­wide receiver Steve Senn. The Irish an­tained drives, the first covering 80 yards in swered with a 27-yard Rice-to-Johnson scor­ten plays and the second logging 69 in 14. On ing toss sandwiched between the Falcon's those drives, Johnson plunged in from the two touchdowns. But when Dowis fumbled one-yard line and Watters scampered in from on first and 10 from his own 40, the Irish were 
five yards out to give the Irish a lead they would never relinquish. 

First quarter events truly devastated the Fal­cons. They stood idly by as the Irish racked up 149 yards in 24 plays, including three success­ful third down conver­sions. On the other side of the ball, the Irish defense held the Air Force to only 11 yards on eight plays. Things didn't get much better in the second quarter. 
Following its sec­ond successive "four and out" drive, Air Force set up in punt for­mation. Ismail fielded Eric Olsen's 35-yard boot on the Irish 44. He quickly burst up the middle, sliced through the first wave of defend­ers and found himself halfway to a score. As 
-1·1 Ismail neared the 30, two Air Force tacklers lunged at him from each side but came up empty as they tumbled overone another. 
As he neared the goal line, Ismail used an official in front ofhim to ward off some of the pursuit. A crunching set to put the game away. 

After two rollouts by Rice and a spurt by Ismail came up short, Holtz and the Irish were forced with a decision. They decided to go on fourth and one. Johnson bulled over for two on the left side, picking up the first down. 
Ismail, rapidly becoming the most po­tent weapon on the Air Force campus, then took the ball on a reverse and sped toward the same comer where he had scored minutes earlier. This time nobody was there. Ismail coasted in as Dowis' fumble suddendly took on added significance. DeBerry probably best exemplified his team's frustration when 

he ripped the hat from his head, throwing it to the ground in disgust . 
Maybe the cadets took DeBerry's "throw­ing in the hat" to heart. Entering the second half down 35-14 they took to the air, throwing like the wishbone-oriented team hadn't all year. The Fal­cons rallied behind Dowis' throwing and Senn's receiving. Dowis posted career highs with 15 completions for 306 yards, with Senn latching on to six of those passes for 101 yards. 
"I didn't know they were going to throw that much. I'm sure they did get the idea to throw so much from Stanford," said defensive end Andre Jones, in reference to Notre Dame's narrow win the week before in California where the Cardinal attempted 68 passes. "I felt good about how we played consider­ing that we prepared for one thing [the run] and had to adjust" 
Holtz, as usual, wasn't so positive. "I did not think we could play as well against the run as 
Johnson scored on a one yard plunge and a 27 yard reception. southc~~~~iribu~~ wedid,"hesaid. "Butwe

Dame guessed our option right a bunch." 
The Irish defense turned in an assortment of big plays. Comerback Todd Lyght snared Dowis' first interception of the season in the third quarter, thwarting what seemed a certain Air Force score. On that play, linebacker Ned Bolcar tipped the ball as Lyght out-jumped the Air Force receivers in the end zone for his fifth interception of the year. Instead of closing to 38-22 with five minutes to play in the third quarter, Air Force lost any hope ofmomentum as Notre Dame added a field goal to go up 41­
14. 
But in the end it was Ismail receiving the star billing. Talk of the Rocket as an emerg­ing Reisman Trophy candidate could be heard among departing fans and writers. But this was justanother day for Ismail in this, only his sophomore season. 
"I just tried to get what I could out of every play," Ismail said, dismissing any talk about himself as a Reisman contender. "The holes were there and I think I got the maxi­mum. It was nothing out of the ordinary. 
"Dee Dowis is real good, a great athlete. But I'd vote for Tony Rice for Reisman." 
The Air Force faithful won't soon forget the exhibition the Rocket put on here, a flyo­ver that made their F-16's seem like plastic models. Ismail won't soon forget, either. II certainly didn't play well against the pass." 
"We take pride in our run defense, and I think our people matched up prelly well with them," said Kowalkowski. "The key with Dowis was that we had to force him to pitch the ball." 
Air Force ground out only 182 yards rushing (260 below its season average) while Dowis picked\1p only 39 of his own (95 below his standard). Their 27 points were a season low and marked only the second game the Falcons failed to score at least 43. Notre Dame's defense of the Falcon wishbone proved to be the key. 
"The main thing the coaches told us was to play Dowis back and wait for him to com­mit," explained defensive end Devon McDonald. "My job was to buy time for the defensive backs to come up and take the running back. The big thing was to stop Dowis hurting us when he's rolling out." De Berry summed it up nicely, saying, "Notre

Notre Dame and Southern Cal provide another thrilling moment in a classic rivalry 

BY DAN FLYNN 
Oct. 21, Notre Dame-
Before the 1989 chapter of Notre 
Dame-USC football was written, 
the rivalry between these two per­ennial collegiate heavyweights had already been called the greatest inter-sectional com­petition in college football. This year's game did nothing but enhance that reputation. 
The 61st, and possibly the greatest meeting between the teams had all the ele­ments of a classic football game: big offen­sive plays, goal-line stands, controversy and unfortunately, a pre-game fight which in the end overshadowed Notre Dame's remark­abie 28-24 victory. 
After the game, naturally, each side felt the other was at fault for the pre-game fisti­cuffs. Some Irish players went so far as to blame Southern Cal coaches for taunting the Notre Dame band. 
In the end, it was Lou Holtz who took responsibility for his team's part in the fra­cas. "I sincerely apologize to Southern Cal," he said after the game. "I promise this will never happen again at Notre Dame, regard­less who is at fault." 
Soon after all the taunts, accusations and stories had been traded, it was fullback An­thony Johnson who probably summed up the tunnel tussle most accurately. "It was some­thing we didn't want to get involved with," said Johnson. "Adrenaline is high and people's emotion takes over." 
Emotion certainly did take over during the game, especially for Notre Dame. After sleepwalking through much of the first half, they found themselves trailing the Trojans. 17-7. However, the Irish received a rather rude, but nonetheless timely wake-up call in the form of a USC serenade. 
The Trojans reportedly sang a mocking rendition of the Notre Dame fight song to the Irish as both teams headed off to the locker room at the half. Ifanything, it only served to stir the slumbering Irish. 
The Irish appeared fired up to open the second halfas the defense led the charge. On USC's first possession, comerback Todd Lyght shoved tight end Scott Galbraith back two yards after what appeared to be a certain first down at the USC 20. Notre Dame received a favorable call, however, and the Trojans were forced to punt. The Irish got the ball back at midfield, where they needed

early in the fourth quarter to go to work. They drove 80 yards to put the Irish on top for the first time in the contest. 
Even this drive, however, was set up by the defense. After Grimm and Ned Bolcar sacked Marinovich and forced USC to punt, the Irish ground game moved the ball suc­cessfully against the vaunted i Southern Cal rush defense and were

"It was just an off-tackle play designed to get the first down," said Johnson, who rushed 13 times on the day for 78 yards.

quarterback Todd

yards passing on

interceptions.

With theNotreDamedefense making all the big plays, the Irish offense waited until 

USC Coach Larry Smith (left, In yellow) holds his breath as Bob Dahl hunts down Marlnovich. 


After catapulting his team ahead and rushing for almost more yards on one play (35) than the Trojan defense had given up per game (36), the usually sure-handed fullback fumbled at the Irish 34 and USC's Brian Tuliau recovered. 
Johnson's miscue opened the door and Marinovich kicked it in, wasting no time in putting USC back on top. In just four plays the Trojans struck paydirt, Marinovich hit­ting Brad Wellman on third down from 15 yards out for the score. 
Trailing 24-21, it seemed like the Irish had finally done themselves in. One too many turnovers and one too many touch­down passes from golden-armed Mari­novich. But as quickly as Notre Dame can convince you it let the big one get away, their Reisman hopeful quarterback always seems to grasp and, somehow, create another big moment. 
Surprisingly, Rice did it this time with his throwing arm. For three quarters, the Irish quarterback completed just four of 15 passes and had turned the ball over twice. Then, with nine minutes to play and the Irish trail­ing, Rice grabbed his magic wand and waved it over the 80 yards of Notre Dame Stadium turf separating his team from the goal line. 
On second and eight from the Notre Dame 44, after four consecutive running plays, Rice threw his first pass ofthe quarter­
a perfectly· 1ofted strike to Raghib Ismail, who beat All-America safety Cleveland Colter. Catching the ball in full stride, Ismail carried it Lo the Trojan 15. On the next play, Rice optioned left, broke two tackles and dragged Colter into the end zone with 5: 18 to play. 
· The Irish offense had put . together a scoring drive when the team needed it the most. Notre Dame rushed for 197 of its 266 yards on the day in the second half, and the offensive line . gave Rice all the time he needed Lo find the streaking Ismail for the long gainer. 
It was the defense, however, that would · end up saving the game with a stand of its own-one of the goal-line variety. 
USC, led by the surprising poise of the young Marinovich, did not stop pressing the 

34 

Notre Dame lead. Behind Marinovich, the Trojans closed in fast. From their own 37, four short passes got USC to the Irish 10. After a five-yard run and two incompletions, the Irish defense tightened and tacked on another big play to its ever-expanding list. On fourth down, Marinovich felt the pressure of defensive -end Scott Kowalkowski and threw to the middle of the end zone, where D'Juan Francisco batted it down. 
The Trojans nevertheless refused to concede defeat and found themselves with yet another chance to pull the game out in the closing moments, but a Hail Mary pass fell short as Irish won their 19th straight. 
"This was a great game," said USC Head Coach Larry Smith. "It was a very intense game. I. think everyone watching was enter­tained. It was college football at its best." 
Holtz agreed with Smith's assessment, but admitted that "it seemed like we were fighting uphill all day." 
For the most part, the Irish were. Two fumbles by Ismail, one on a kickoff and the other on a punt, left the Irish in 7-0 and 14-7 holes early in the contest. 
In the end though, the Irish surged to their seventh win of the season behind a stingy second-half defense and an opportun­istic offense. Once more, Notre Dame and Southern Cal truly gave us a game for the

The offense responded, too, racking up 339 yards of total offense, mosty on the ground. Leading the way, sophomore Raghib "Rocket" Ismail rushed for 74 yards on only eight carries, including a 50-yard touchdown dash in the third quarter. 
But this game may be re­membered more for the tur­moil of the week leading up to it than the game itself. In a series of episodes worthy ofan afternoon soap opera lineup, Irish-bashing became high fashion. The brawl in the tun­nel prior to the Southern Cal game the previous Saturday caused quite a stir. Holtz ac­cepted his share of the blame and apologized for Notre Dame's part in the fight, but

have helped the team's state ofmind enter­ing the October 28th confrontation with the Panthers . 
On paper at least, the Pittsburgh game looked to be tough. Coach Mike Gottfried came to Notre Dame Stadium with a 5-0-1 record and a high-powered offense averaging 31 points per game. Freshman quarterback Van Pelt led the Panther offense, having thrown 10 touch­down passes in his first six collegiate games for an amazing 146.8 quarterback 
rating. 
In fact, against West Virginia, Pitts­burgh had trailed 31-7 entering the fourth quarter but roared back with an amazing 24 points to tie the Mountaineers 31-31. Till this point, the Pitt offense was crank­ing on all four cylinders. 
Sure enough, the first Panther drive did nothing to dispel Irish fears ofan upset. Van Pelt marched the Panthers on a 12­play, 68-yard drive capped by a Van Pelt­to-Ronald Redmon pass. A successful 
extra point followed and, before you could blink, the Irish were in a 7-0 hole. 
The first Irish possession was anything but promising. Anthony Johnson took a handoff and fought up the middle for four yards. The Rocket gained five yards on a pitch left and · quarterback T.ony Rice got a first down on asneak. Butthreemoreplays yielding only five yards re­sulted in a Jim Sexton punt which Pitt fair caught at its seven yard line. 
From here on, the Irish defense took over. 
On first down, Pitt was called for an illegal proce­dure penalty which forced them into a first and 13 from their own three. After an incompletion and a run for no gain by Redmon, Van Pelt dropped back to pass but was flushed from the pocket. He lost his footing, falling in the end zone for a safety, making the score 7-2 Pittsburgh.

Devon McDonald demonstrates the kind of punishment Notre Dame inflicted on Van Pelt all evening long. 
Notre Dame got the ball on its own 40 after the Pitt free kick, but the Irish could not convert and had to punt. The Irish defense played tough again, however, stuffing the Panthers on four plays, including an Andre Jones sack of Van Pelt for a nine-yard loss. After the Pitt punt, Notre Dame embarked on a touchdown drive which would provide all the scoring the Irish would need. 
The Irish drive would go for 36 yards, all on the ground. On first and 10, Ismail exploded off left tackle fora 16-yardrun. Then, Johnson carried on three consecu­tive plays for 12 yards. After an Ismail one-yard gain, the Irish again called Johnson's number as he carried to the Pittsburgh one­yard line to set up third and one. Sophomore Rodney Culver burst through the left side for the touch­down, and Rice successfully exe­cuted a two-point conversion to give the Irish a 10-7 lead. 
38 
The running game was key to this drive, as it was all day. Behind big holes opened by the likes ofTim Grunhard and Dean Brown, the Irish backs ran roughshod over Pitt for 310 yards on an astounding 57 car­ries ( out of 66 total Irish plays from scrimmage). 
"lfwe get that kind of per­formance each week from the line, we will do very well," said Grunhard. "We don't get the hype, but the guys across from us know who wori the battle_;, 
The Irish would score once more before the half on a Pat Terrell interception return. Van Pelt overthrew his receiver at the Notre Dame 46, and Terrell picked it off, broke a tackle and was off to the races. Terrell cut across· the field and sprinted down the left sideline just ahead of Pitt tacklers for his second career touchdown. 
"It felt like a punt return,"

T. 
Navy. The Notre Dame ground attack led the way as the Irish pounded the outmanned Midshipmen, 41-0. 
Notre Dame rolled up 414 rushing yards on 60 attempts while utilizing ten different ballcarriers. The Irish posted their 21st con­secutive victory to run their season mark to 9­0, tying a school record which was set from 1946-48 under legendary coach Frank Leahy. 
Coming into the game, Irish coach Lou Holtz stated, "All I know is that our worst performance all last season came against Navy." He was referring to Notre Dame's lackluster 22-7 victory over the Midshipmen in Baltimore's Memorial Stadium. Coming off back to back impressive wins against Southern Cal and Pittsburgh, Holtz worried about another Irish letdown. 
"Can we maintain this pace?" he asked. "Can we play in all phases th.e way we did againstPitt?" As usual,Holtz' ritualistic pre­game pessimism turned out to be unfounded once again. 
"Obviously, Notre Dame was too much for us today," observed Navy coach Eliot Uzelac. This fact became manifest early on in the contest. 
After forcing the Midshipmen to punt on their initial possession, quarterback Tony Rice and the Irish offense took over on their own 36. On the first play, tailback Ricky Watters burst off tackle for a 43-yard gain to the Navy 21. Three plays later Rice, sprung by a Rodney Culver block, turned the comer on an option left and scored from six yards out.

"The defense helps the offense for Notre 
Dame," said Uzelac. "We had drives going, 
and they would make a big play like an

The Irish defense did indeed help the 
offense, recovering two fumbles and inter­
cepting two Midshipmen passes while post­
ing their first shutout of the Lou Holtz era, 
and the first since a 42-0 drubbing ofAnny in 
1983. 
Notre Dame's dominance was a total 
team effort as Holtz cleared his bench, ena­
bling everyone to get into the act. "What was

on this afternoon. 
Navy's last chance to make a game of it came with 13:47 remaining in the second · quarter, when Navy cornerback David Lerch snared a Rice pass intended for tight end Derek Brown. The interception was the first of two for Rice, whose poor day passing (1­8, two interceptions, 28 yards) damaged his Heisman hopes. 
This Irish miscue proved to be merely a stay of execution as linebacker Scou Kow­alkowski threw Grizzard for a 14-yard loss on third down, stalling yet another Navy drive. 
Shortly thereafter, Watters broke up the middle and deftly eluded three would-be tacklers on a remarkable 48-yard touchdown scamper. The run was the best of the day for Watters, who turned the game into a taping of his personal highlight film. His nine rushes netted 134 yards, a career high. 
"I have to give credit to the offensive line," said the junior tailback. "They were awesome. It was like the (parting ofthe) Red Sea. I can't even make my arms as wide as that hole was."

Freshman wide receivers Adrian Jarrell and William Pollard were other bright spots for the future of the Irish, who, next season, figure to move away from the option-ori­ented ground attack which has been so suc­cessful under-.Tony Rice. · 
"It was relaxing just getting to be able to watch other people play," stated Rice, "and there was no slack-off." 
The final blow to the Navy ship was delivered by a Tank. Senior walk-on Ted "Tank" McNamara rounded out the Irish scoring with a two-yard touchdown with 
4:40 remaining in the game, making the final tally 41-0. 
"It was the greatest moment ofmy life," gushed McNamara after the game, perhaps overwhelmed by the personal significance of the moment. It was the first score of McNamara's career at Notre Dame. 
The loss left Uzelac wondering if the longest intersectional collegiate football ri­valry in existence should continue. The Midshipmen haven't beaten Notre Dame since 1963, when a quarterback named Roger Staubach was at the helm for Navy. Notre Dame now leads the series 53-9 with one tie.

A Merciful Mauling 
Under Holtz's orders not to score if given the chance, Setzer stepped out of bounds short of the end zone. 
The Mustangs suffer severe growing pains at the hands ofthe Irish, who take measures to hold the score down 

BY KEVIN SPROULE 
Nov. 11, Notre Dame-
A fter an intentional delay of 
game penalty late in the third 
quarter, Irish reserve tailback Rusty Setzer took a pitch right and broke free toward the Southern Methodist end zone. Before scoring, though, Setzer pur­posely stepped out of bounds at the eight. 
The scenario was typical of this game. Notre Dame's scoring oppurtunities were so frequent and easy to come by that Head Coach Lou Holtz was forced to take un­usual measures to keep the score down. "I wanted to score and I could have," ex­plained Setzer. "Coach Holtz told us that we could run up and down the field but he didn't want us to score." 
The 59-6 blowout came as no surprise to anyone, though. Notre Dame came in at 9-0 and ranked number one in the country while SMU was 2-6 and trying to rebuild after an NCAA imposed two-year proba­tion. Consequently, the Mustangs brought nothing that could combat the Irish arsenal. 
This Notre Dame-SMU match-up wasn't exactly what players and fans wanted as the last home game of a memo­rable 1989 season. Most wondered not if Notre Dame would win; rather, by how much. 
Notre Dame began its scoring barrage midway through the first quarter. Starting on its own 21, Notre Dame drove to the SMU 35 on six running plays. Ricky Watters then took an option pitch right, broke one tackle and scored a touchdown. Watters' 35-yard run would be thelongest run of the game. 
SMU was forced to punt on their next possesion. Raghib "Rocket" Ismail fielded the punt at the 35, broke loose, and returned it for an apparent touchdown. What would have been Ismail's second punt return for a touchdown of the season was called back for clipping. 
After scoring only once in the first quarter, the Irish were a ticking bomb. That bomb detonated furiously in the second, scoring 32 points offensively, defensively, and through special teams. 
On the first play of the second quarter Ismail swept around the right side for a 26­yard gain, getting knocked out ofbounds at the one. Holtz then inserted Pete Graham at quarterback, allowing him to score his first career touchdown on a\5ne-yard quarter­back sneak. 
SMU bounced back, scoring a touch­down with a little help from an Irish mis­cue. After forcing SMU to punt, Ismail tried to catch the punt with his facemask. The ball bounced away and SMU recov-· ered on the Notre Dame 19. Three plays later quarterback Mike Romo threw five yards to a diving Andy Bergfeld in the comer of the end zone. It was the Mustang's first and only score of the day. 
After the touchdown the Irish defense decided to take matters into its own hands.

completed his first pass to Watters over the middle for a 31-yard gain. After failing to convert a first down after that, Billy Hackett kicked a 34-yard field goal.

Watters answered quick! y bybreaking three tackles en route to a spectacular 97­yard touchdown run.

Notre Dame received the 
free kick and started at its own

the half. 
The 42-point first half may have showed off Notre Dame's offensive power, but the defensive unit was equally if not more dominant. Through the first half the Irish defense had allowed only one touchdown, and that occurred after a turnover deep in their own end. The pass defense was unyielding, holding Romo and the Mustang Run-and-Shoot offense to merely 70 yards passing.· They also 
held SMU to -1 yards on the ground. 
The second half saw a change in the face of the game. The domi­nation continued but the scoring and high-pow­ered offense was toned down. Holtz took ad­vantage of the large lead to clear his bench, al­lowing his younger players a chance to shine. Notre Dame's defensive unit didn't let up at all as freshmen, walk-ans and other re­serves recorded three interceptions in the sec­ond half. 
The Irish still man­aged to score two touch-by game's end. Setzer scored on a two-yard run, Billy Hacket kicked his second field goal of the game from 32 yards out and Rcxl West blasted into the end zone from one yard out to finish the day's scoring. 
Four Irish players scored their first ca­reer touchdowns in this game. While so-. phomores Boyd and Setzer scored on runs of 14 and two yards, respectively, senior role players Graham and West took advan­tage of this game to score the first and only

touchdowns of their collegiate careers. 
Though watching reserves finish a game usually isn't very exciting, it was . most fitting in a game of this nature. Not only was it a show of the future for Notre Da'me football, but also a deserved chance for many older reserves who paid their dues for four years. Said senior D'Juan Francisco, "I am very happy with today's game not for myself, but that some of the people who have been here since I got here got the chance to show themselves out on the field today." 
Even this game, so dominated by the Irish, was not perfect. Notre Dame fumbled seven times, losing three. Said Holtz, "It was a good game because we got to play a lot of people. It was a bad game because we made some mistakes and got away with them." 
Perfect or not, Notre Dame was a convincing winner. They moved their record to 10-0 and retained their number one ranking. The Irish also finished a third consecutive undefeated home schedule. As Johnson summed up, "It's still great to go out with the win."

Notre Dame met the challenge of Penn State's highly regarded rush defense by sprinting for over 400 yards

'0 ne thing that jumps out at. you is

True, "Happy Valley" in University Park,PA, has been anything but happy for the Fighting Irish in this decade. Coming into the contest Notre Dame had travelled to Beaver Stadium four times, and each time had come away saddled with a defeat. Those setbacks included a November 1987, heartbreaking 21-20 loss which dashed Notre Dame's na­tional title hopes for that season.

''They just physically man­handled us," commented Lion strong safety Sherrod Rainge. "We basically knew what they were going to do, and that was run. And we still couldn't stop them. We were just out-manned physically."

"I thought going into the game that it would be tough, and we were really going to have to tighten up," said Watters. "But the offensive line did a great job. There were times I saw three holes and would have to make a choice." The vaunted Penn State defense had been allowing just

Fullback Anthony Johnson has been the bread and butterofthe Irish short yardage of­fense for the past three seasons, and this oc­casion was no different. Johnson got the call four straight times and finally found pay dirt. 
"I thought we rose to the challenge," said Holtz. "They scored, and we came back and scored, and then we did itafter the field goal."

That wouldbe the halftime tally as Craig Hentrich's 49-yard field goal at­tempt went wide as time expired. 
Trailing by 11, the Lions would begiven one more chance to climb back into the game.

The Irish defense stiffened as defensive end Devon McDonald sacked quarterback Tony Sacca for an eight-yard loss, forcing the Lions to settle for Ray Tarasi's 38-yard field goal. 
That would be the extent of Penn State's first half offense, and tl1e Irish were just get­ting warmed up. Notan easy task on this day, with the wind chill reading zero and winds gusting upwards of 25 miles per hour. 
Notre Dame scored twice in a span of less than nine min­utes. The first came courtesy of a 12-yard run by Watters, culmi­nating a six play, 58­yard drive in which the Irish were not forced to and Smagala recovered. Six plays later, Rice went in for the score, making it 28-10 with 


8:42 remaining in the third quarter. 
The frigid temperatures and gusting winds, coupled with Joe Paterno' s conserva­tive offensive philosophy, did not bode well for a Penn State comeback. Facing one ofthe most talented defenses in the country, the 
:1 Nittany Lion offense responded well behind Tom Bill, who had replaced Sacca at quarter­back late in the first half. "I never thought this would be an offen­sive game," said Holtz. "I was disappointed in the defense, but you have to give Penn State credit." Taking over on their own 21, the Lions drove 79 yards to make the score 28-17. Bill threw for 32 yards and scram bled for 25 more on the drive, which ended on Thomas' three­yard run. The Irish added two short Billy Hackett field goals, and the scoreboard read 34-17 with just 6:53 remaining. Bill went to Terry Smith for a five-yard touchdown toss, and a failed two-point conversion attempt left the margin at 11. That was as close as Penn State would get The Irish missed a chance to add to their total when Pat Eilers fumbled in the Lion end zone with under two minutes re­maining. 
Notre Dame's ball control offense had proved to be too much for Penn State, which fell to 6-3-1 on the season. "If you were to watch the films, you'd see how the backs aren't getting touched until they're two or three yards past the line," said Johnson. 
Nothing Penn State did up front fazed the experienced Irish offensive front. "We've seen about any defense possible," stated tackle Dean Brown. 
Notre Dame had ended their Beaver Stadium jinx in dominant fashion, prompting some to try and place this team in history. 
"Notre Dame compares with Oklahoma and some ,of the clubs we've played," said an obviously impressed Paterno. 
The convincing Irish victory set up a showdown with the Hurricanes from the Uni­versity of Miami, to be followed by a New Year's Day Orange Bowl clash with Colo­rado. Just how this team would be viewed in college gridiron lore depended on how they would fare in the Sunshine State in the com­ing weeks.

BY JIM MAGGIO 
Nov. 25, Miami, FL­
Forget 58-7, Catholics vs. Convicts and all that business. With the 1989 installment of Notre Dame-Miami came a new coach, new expectations and a whole new brand of fever-pitch hype and hysteria. Last season's thrilling, 31-30 Irish win did nothing but bring emotions to an even higher boiling point for this year's clash of the titans in the Orange Bowl. Oops, there's the hitch. Maybe some things don't change after all. 
For all its apparent invincibility, Lou Holtz' top-ranked squad fell victim to the same old story in that same old, dreaded stadium. First-year Miami coach Dennis Erickson got his first taste of the home cookin' Howard Schnell en berger and Jimmy Johnson enjoyed so much against the Irish in the 1980s, directing his blood-thirsty charges to a convincing 27-10 victory on this balmy Saturday evening. 
Miami may as well have scheduled this game for the Coliseum-Rome, that is. The 80,000 or so Hurricane fans who jammed this down trodden facility didn't come to see their team merely kill the opposition; only a good dismemberment or two would suffice. Upon first sight of a Notre Dame player on the Orange Bowl turf, they reacted with all the charm and grace of a rabid pit bull. Some­where between loud chants of "F-Notre Dame" and "Tony Rice Sucks" flew a wide range ofprojectiles into the closed end of the field, directed at the Irish during pre-game warm-ups. Welcome to the jungle, baby. 
The problem for the Irish, though, lay not nearly as much in the hostile surround­ings as in the Hurricanes' balanced offensive attack and swarming defensive unit. Yet the

the pleas of an excited defense ... 
tone for the evening may well have been set on the opening kickoff, where, following a heated verbal exchange at midfield between the two arch­enemies, Raghib Ismail bobbled the ball in the end zone· and had to settle for a touch­back. 

Rice took the first snap from center and darted up the middle for a gain of 12. That was all the 'Canes defense needed to get going. Line­',acker Bernard Clark gave an lrish ballcarrier a rude greeting on each ofthe next three plays, and following a 21-yard punt "Jy Craig Hentrich the Miami offense quickly went to work. 
Quarterback Craig Erickson (no relation to Dennis) came out firing, hitting Leonard Conley and Dale Dawkins on successive pass completions of six and 26 yards to shove the ball right back in Notre Dame's end at the 21. if:,, The Irish defense stiffened on the three fol­lowing rush attempts, but Carlos Huerta 
l 
11 

cracked the scoreboard with a 35-yard field goal to give Miami the early lead. 
Meanwhile, Notre Dame's offense sput­tered. The rushing attack cracked a standout Hurricane defensive front with a few good gains, but, when forced to throw the ball, the Irish met with disaster. Roland Smith picked 
off a long Rice pass to squelch one drive, and 
Cortez Kennedy and Greg Mark teamed up to 
dump Rice for a loss of seven on third and 
five to end another. 
No sooner than another Hentrich punt did the 'Canes offense strike again. Four plays was all it took for Erickson to find a breakdown in the Irish secondary as he hit Dawkins on another long pass, this time for a 55-yard touchdown over the middle and a quick 10-0 Miami lead. 
The Irish fought back to start the second quarter with a sustained drive and found themselves knocking at the door on Miami's one-yard line. But the next three plays typi­
.fied the intensity with which the Hurricane defense played all evening. The lightning­quick unit dropped Rice and Anthony Johnson for losses, and an incomplete pass on third down forced Notre Dame to settle for Billy Hackett's 22-yard field goal. 
"We didn't really know what they'd do on goal line. That was a main problem," explained Holtz. "If you see someone on goal line you see that they'll run at least four looks. We didn't real! y know what to do, and 
in all honesty they didn 'trun what we worked on. They ran something rather conventional, and we worked on some different things." 
Consequently, the rest of Notre Dame's offense came from its defense. With the ball at his own 43, Erickson drifted left looking to throw, only to find Irish linebacker Ned 
52 
Bolcar in his path. Bolcar snared the errant pass, then leaped over the sprawling quarter­back-turned-defender to race49 yards for the score. "They were having breakdowns here and there. I knew they'd look for the tight end," Bolcar explained. "I just came off and stepped in front of him." 
With the score tied at ten late in the half, the Irish had the ~all once more at the Miami 
46. Rice came out passing on second and one, looking to move the Irish into field goal position and give them the halftime lead. The plan backfired as Clark became his receiver instead; returning Rice's second interception down to the Notre Dame eight-yard line. Steve McGuire's five-yard score three plays later gave Miami the lead once more. "The pass before the half increased their momen­tum," said Holtz. "We could have had halftime at 10-10, and I think that's what changed the game." 
If Clark's interception changed it, then what followed to start the second half merely helped ice it for the 'Canes. It will go down in Miami lore and Notre Dame infamy sim­ply as "The Drive." 
Oddly enough, the Hurricanes had to move a lot in reverse before actually getting the Drive in gear. Following a gutsy fourth and one running 
it at their own three-yard line. After McGuire's run netted only four yards, Miami faced a third and 44 situation. The Hurri­canes needed a thrill, and they got it. 
Erickson entered the huddle and called "80 double zone" as Randall ''Thrill" Hill lined up wide to the right side. Hill slipped past comerback Stan Smagala on the right sideline as Erickson unleashed a prayer. Hill answered, hauling it in at the Irish 49 to squeeze out the first down and prolong Notre Dame's agony. 
Miami strung together 12 more plays, mixing in the run with pass completions to Hill and Conley. Erickson's five-yard scor­ing strike to Dawkins culminated a 22-play journey covering 80 yards and consuming a whopping 10:47 off the clock. The Irish offense had yet to touch the ball in the second half as the game began slipping out of their hands. 
"It hurt us in that it didn't give our offense a chance to get on the field," said Bolcar. Added Irh;h safety Pat Terrell, "Our defense was not used to seeing anyone drive the ball like that Take away three or four plays, (and) it might have been a different story." 
Notre Dame had a chance to pull the game within seven midway through the final period. Rice's second and 17 bomb to Wil­liam Pollard netted 42 yards and put the Irish into Miami territory at the 34, but the threat would once again die inside the Hurricane's ten-yard line. On fourth and six from the eight, Rice threw incomplete over the middle to Ismail to extend Notre Dame's offensive futility in the Orange Bowl in this decade. 
"We had two 90-yard drives and put three points on the board," lamented Holtz. "One thing we've had some success with is the ability to score when we got inside the ten-yard line. We were not successful in that endeavor today, and I thought that was criti­cal." 
From there, Miami chewed up another five minutes off the clock, and Huerta's 32­yard field goal all but ended it, 27-10. His players gave Coach Erickson a victory ride on their shoulders, erasing any doubts that this Hurricane football team could win the big one under its new leader. 
"This football team has been through a lot ofadversity," said Erickson, reflecting on various key in juries and a24-10 loss earlier in the season to bitter cross-state rival Florida State. "Any time there's a coaching change, everybody'scheckingthenewcoachout,and 
play that gave them a first down at theirown 41, the officials flagged Miami for a per­sonal foul to move the ball right back to the 26. Irish defensive end Eric Jones then dropped Erickson behind the line of scrimmage -to force a fumble. Fellow defensive end Devon McDonald had a shot at the ball but couldn't recover, and Miami center Bobby Garcia saved the 'Canes from potential dis­

the team has to adjust I don't think anyone gave us very much credit and we came out today and proved that the transition is over." 
Meanwhile, the Irish had once again fallen victim to the Orange Bowl Curse that plagued them throughout the 1980s, holding them to one offensive touchdown there in this decade. That came in the 58-7 debacle marking Gerry Faust's coaching finale at Notre Dame in 1985. Other losses include a 37-15 drubbing in 1981 and shutouts in 1983 (20-0) and 1987 (24-0). This year's loss ended Notre Dame's 23­game winning streak dating back to the start of the 1988 season. 
"Sure, it's frustrating," said Ter­rell in the locker room following the game. "But we've come too far to throw in the towel. It's hard to put your head down after 23 straight wins." He then gave the assembled press corps a look of conviction. 
"We'll play real Notre Dame football the next time we take the field."

Notre Dame erases any thoughts ofa 
Miami jinx with a convincing 21-6 
victory over top-ranked Colorado 
Ian Johanson 
The Irish defense got pushed around a bit but was 
unyielding when it counted the most. 
BY JIM MAGGIO 
Jan. 1, 1990, Miami, FL-
is voice neither . wavered nor
H
showed any twinge of anxiety. 
His step was slow but. deliberate as he paced before his assembled troops, outlining the battle plan for how the war would be won. This was a man in all his MacArthuresque glory. This was nottheLou Holtz that the public, much less Colorado, was supposed to see. _ 
"Let me tell you what, they've been living a lie, they've been living a lie all season," Holtz declared in reference to the Buffaloes, unaware of the Denver television· . crew filming his pep talk four days prior to the Orange Bowl. "Remember, I told you." 
Holtz' public concern over his team's ability to bounce back from last month's 27­10 loss to Miami gave way to (seemingly) private conviction. "They're expecting an outstanding football team and they're going to see one," he told his players. "They're going to see the best Notre Dame. And we're going to whip 'em." 
As the six-o'clock news aired Holtz' comments, the emotion-charged Buffs now had added incentive to go along with their season-long quest for a national champion­ship for their spiritual leader, Sal Aunese, who died last September ofinoperable stom­ach cancer. Aunese's parting request to his teammates was simple: "Go get 'em, and bring home the Orange Bowl." 
Ifanything, though, Holtz' remarks may have contributed to emotional overload for Col~rado this New Year's Night For all the lessons they learned, for all the detractors they proved wrong on their way to an 11-0 mark in 1989, the Buffs forgot Rule #1 in Approaching a Sleeping Giant. 
I/you' re going to kill him, make sure you do it in less than three attempts. Otherwise, the big guy just might wake up. 
Colorado learned the hard way. Three times in the first half they had the gun loaded, aimed and ready. Three times they misfired. 
After an exchange of possessions to open the game, the Colorado offense took its second tum and marched the ball down to the Notre Dame 35-yard line. -On second and five, tailback Eric Bieniemy received the hand-off from Darian Hagan and rambled 16 yards through the right side of the defense, headed for an apparent touchdown. But as he tried switching hands, the ball popped loose and Irish free safety Pat Terrell recovered. Strike one. 
Notre Dame's running attack got them no further than their own 42, and the Buffa­loes had the ball again on their own 18 fol­lowing a 49-yard punt by Craig Hentrich. Hagan .complemented Colorado's impres­sive option attack with long pass completions to John Perak and Erich·Kissick. Suddenly the Buffs found themselves knocking on the door again with a first down at the Irish 12.

Ned Bolcar helped stuff three successive running plays short of the first down marker, and Colorado had to settle for Ken Culbertson's 23-yard field goal attempt Culbertson turned the chip shot into a night­mare, hooking it wide left. Strike two. 
The Irish offense followed that up with a futile three-play, eight-yard drive. The Buf­falo defense, led by the inspired play of Alfred Williams, Michael Jones and Kana vis McGhee, once again stuffed the Irish attack deep in its own territory, and Hentrich's shanked punt gave Colorado prime field position at its own 41. From there Hagan, Bieniemy and J. J. Flannigan combined to pound the ball over the right side to the Irish I-yard line. What followed was one of the greatest goal-line stands in Notre Dame his­tory.

Second and goal. Hagan tries his luck on a keeper up the middle. Chris Zorich & Co. say no. 
· Third and goal. Hagan rolls right, finds a wall of Notre Dame defenders in his face and pitches in desperation to Bieniemy. The ball flutters out of bounds for a loss of two. 
Frustrated and scoreless, the Buffs lined up for an apparent field-goal attempt on fourth and three to get something, anything on the scoreboard. Instead, Colorado Head . Coach Bill McCartney reached into his grab bag of tricks and pulled out a lemon. 
· Normally a linebacker, Chad Brown lined up at tight end on the play and was supposed to release from the line of scrim­mage when the ball was snapped, making himself an eligible receiver on the fake. But when holder Jeff Campbell took the snap and looked for an open receiver, Brown didn't release. With no one to throw to, Campbell ran to the right in desperation and Troy Ridgley flattened him a yard short of the end zone. 
Strike three. 
"He (Brown) said he got jammed," McCartney explained dejectedly as he tried to justify the play. "It looked like a broken play, but it wasn't." 
If anything, it was the alarm clock the Irish needed. Notre Dame proceeded to march the ball downfield in their own attempt to crack the scoreboard. Long runs by Tony Rice and Ismail set up Rice's first two pass completions of the day-12 yards to Derek Brown and 29 to Pat Eilers over the middle. Colorado blocked Billy Hackett's 27-yard field goal auempt two plays later to end the scoreless first half, but Notre Dame entered the locker room confident. Colorado's fail­ure to score on its last drive convinced the Irish they had the Buffs where they wanted them. 
"Ifyou try a fake play, that means you've gone away from your game plan," said Zor­ich. "Once they didn't score on that, we knew we were in good shape." 
"When it came down to 'crunch time' in the first half, we (the defense) just dug a little deeper," said Bolcar. "We went into the second half 0-0, but we knew that as soon as our offense got into a rhythm that we would be fine." 
. The Irish came out for the second half as iftheir Iives depended on it-which, accord­ing to their bespectacled leader, it did. "How you respond to the challenge in the second half will determine what you become after the game," Holtz told his troops at the inter­mission, "whether you are a winneror a loser, for the rest of your life." 
The offense got the message, picking up where it left off at the end ofthe first half and marching down the field with the help of the big play. Rice found Tony Smith over the middle for 27 on third and 11, followed two plays later by Anthony Johnson's 29-yard run to the Colorado 11.. Johnson scored on a two-yard plunge soon after, and the Irish had their first offensive touchdown. in the Orange Bowl since 1985. 
Bolcarpickedoffa deflected Hagan pass on Colorado's opening series of the half, giving Notre Dame the ball at the Buffalo 46. Time for Rice to show once again, as he did in the Fiesta Bowl last year, that his throwing 

arm had not suffered from disuse. He hit 
Johnson on third and nine for again of 13, and 
his perfect strike to Eilers for 18 pulled the 
Irish out ofafirst-and-32 hole created by two 
penalties. 
With Rice having found success against 
the Buffalo secondary (5 of 9 completions, 
99 yards), many expected him to be throwing 
again on third and 14 at the Colorado 35. 
Instead, Holtz crossed everyone up by calling 
for ''Reverse 8." A simple namefor a play 
with a simple purpose: Give it to the Rocket, 
and see if anyone can catch him. 
Rice dished off to Ismail streaking right 
from his flanker position, and, with key 
blocks from Johnson and Tim Grunhard, the 
Rocket scorched a path down the right side­
line quicker than you can say "touchdown." 
Following a halftime spectacle of six break­
dancing elephants and a guy named Chubby, 
the Irish were suddenly putting on a show of 
their own. Call it "14-0." 
Ismail' s run typified the kind of grief he caused the Buffs all evening long. Still nursing a sore right shoulder he dislocated . against Miami, his status remained uncertain 
-1,• 

Each team ex­changed possessions to begin the fourth quarter, and Notre Dame had the ball once more at their own 18 with 10:27 re­maining. With an eight point lead and the run­ning game hitting its stride, Holtz had no more surprises for Colorado. Just a return to smash­face football. 
Ismail right for ten. Johnson right for nine. Ricerightforeight. Rod­ney Culver left for four. When the dust finally settled after Johnson's seven yard touchdown run, the Irish had con­sumed almost nin,e min­utes to drive 82 yards on 17 plays, all on the ground. Hentrich's extra point put Notre Dame up by 15, leaving only 
1:32 on the clock and a long off-season for Colorado to reflect on what could have been. 
"Coming away from the first half with­out any points after controlling the game for awhile was too much to overcome," mused McCartney. "Anytime you 're playing a team like Notre Dame, you've got to capitalize on your chances. We didn't." 
"That's something that's going to haunt us for a long time, knowing we had three or. four opportunities to score," said Flannigan, looking away in disgust. "We gave the game away. You just don't not score when you're inside the 20 yard line that often." 
For the Irish, victory in the Dade County Snakepit tasted ever so sweet. "Everyone kept on saying that there was a jinx on us in here," said Rice in I-told-you-so fashion. "Well, the jinx is definitely over." 
Only the final polls remained for Notre Dame to mull over. A Miami loss in the

until game time. But when tailback Ricky Watters went down with a knee injury on Notre Dame's third play from scrimmage, the Irish had to press the Rocket into backfield action. 
"I was going to play a lot more at tailback, but (my) injury put a damper on the game plan," said Ismail. "(But) Coach told me that after a few hits he wanted me to go a few plays in the backfield." From there he inflicted much more pain than he felt, pounding out 108 yards on the ground on 16 carries. 
"He was terrific," obseryed McCartney. "He's very, very dangerous. We saw more of him in the backfield than I would have wanted." 
But Hagan responded to Ismail's score with his own phenomenal effort On first and ten at the Notre Dame 39, Hagan rolled right to the short side of the field. With little room to maneuver he eluded the reaches ofTerrell and Devon McDonald and cut back left, scrambling 39 yards for the touchdown and the longest rush against the Irish this season. Culbertson's point after attempt hit the left upright and bounced away, ending the third quarter at 14-6 and prolonging the kicker's disastrous evening.

Turn 
Senior walk-on gets a chance to share his thoughts on the 1989 season 
BY TED "TANK" McNAMARA 

It would be an understatement to say · the 1989 Irish football season was an uphill battle-unless the hill hap­pened to be Mount Everest. Never before had I encountered as much adversity as this football team experienced. Fate dealt us a hand which would have devastated any other team. However, we endured the hard knocks, and for the second straight year we can boast the best record in Division I football. Only one game kept us from our ninth national championship, but having experienced what we did, we know we are deserving of that honor. I will always remember the three weeks before the Kickoff Classic, for dur­ing this period we were dealt our most severe blow. At a time when most students were still enjoying their summer vacations, we were engaged in two-a-day practices in preparation for the coming season. As if practicing in the humidity of an Indiana August was not enough, we also faced the harsh reality that nine players, including four starters, would not be joining us for the season. But we did not waste time feeling sorry for ourselves. We felt remorse for those teammates who would not be with us, but we continued to move forward, deter­mined to win with the players we had. Our purpose remained the same, but we now viewed the season in a different light. We saw it as the ultimate challenge, a challenge just waiting to be tackled. As a team we had no doubts that we could rise to the occasion, but many people truly be­lieved we were not capable ofdoing so. The Kickoff Classic proved otherwise. Notre  Dame was back, and many critics were forced to eat their words. As the season progressed, our luck be­gan to fade. Injuries plagued the team, pre­venting key players such as Anthony Johnson, Rod West, Stan Smagala, and Jeff Alm from seeing action in some games. Tight end Frank Jacobs had to sit out the rest of the season because of a broken ankle he suffered in the Stanford game. Injuries were ever-present, and as a result many young and inexperienced players had to step in and take up the slack. To top it off, we had also been dubbed the "bad boys" of college football. When you're on top, you come under close scrutiny as those around you try to find fault. Such was our case. Many sportswriters were no longer concerned with the fact that we were winning. Instead, they criticized our "class­less" style of play. As untrue as that label was, they nevertheless attempted to paint just such a picture for the public. The USC incident provided them with the perfect opportunity to do so. Never mind the lack of class USC displayed before the game, on the field and during halftime. We were·still the "thugs" and "hooligans" at fault. Despite our misfortunes we ignored our critics and continued to play like a number­one team, and we entered the final game of the regular season with an unblemished rec­ord. As much as we wanted to beat Miami, the fatigue and accumulated injuries from a marathon season prevented us from doing so. The season ended in disappointment, but the Orange Bowl and a possible national cham­pionship awaited, and Notre Dame was not  about to give up. After some rest and recuperation, · preparation began for the Orange Bowl. Many thought the Irish would give up after such a devastating loss to Miami. In addi­tion, we would be playing Colorado with­out defensive starters Andre Jones and Bob Dahl. But something special happened dur­ing those practices before the Bowl. Signs · oflastAugust'sNotreDame team began to reappear as we started to practice with en­thusiasm and cohesion. Not only were we getting better, but we were having fun in the process. We ignored Colorado's propaganda campaign because we knew it was a futile effort. We had overwhelming confidence in ourselves. Coach Holtz and his staff are master motivators, and by game day they had us convinced we could not lose. And we couldn't. There was no way Colorado could ever beat us; the coaches had pre­pared us too well. We walked onto that field knowing we would leave it as Orange Bowl champions, and we did. It was a fitting ending to a season so valiantly played. We finished 12-1 with a schedule that included nin¥ bowl teams. It was without a doubt the toughest schedule in college football. Yet the polls did not deem us worthy of the national champion­ship. We know in our hearts, however, that we are the best team in college football, and the people of this country seem to agree with us. To them we are the national cham­pions. Ill
