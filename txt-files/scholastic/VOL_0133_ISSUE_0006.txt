An Explanation
Some of our readers may have noticed that the column we printed last week under the headline “Irish ego goes beyond gridiron” looked a little familiar. It should have: the column, reprinted from from lU’s student paper, also ran Wednesday, the day before last week’s issue, in The Observer.
Scholastic is distributed every Thursday night across campus, but the magazine is sent to the printer on Tuesday night. Even though we had seen the Observer version of the column, it was too late for us to make any changes.
As a weekly magazine, we can cover events in detail and spend a long time on research and writing, but we don’t cover truly fast-breaking news; that’s not our job. We don’t print AP stories or press releases, and we don’t write up ordinary meetings of student government — that’s what The Observer is for.
But, with a few exceptions, most of the news at Notre Dame is not fast-breaking, and that means that Scholastic and The Observer are in competition, at least some of the time. We don’t talk about what we’re going to print with The Observer, and they don’t talk about their plans with us. Last week we at Scholastic got beat by the competition, simply because they print on a daily basis, while we publish weekly. But this section is labelled “An Explanation,” not “An Apology,” and that’s an important difference.
I’m not apologizing for the competition between the two publications because our rivalry usually benefits the student body. Reporters dig a little deeper for a better story, editors work a little harder for a better product, and readers get a little better publication than they would have gotten otherwise.
So I’m embarrassed that we ended up printing a “repeat,” but not sorry. Maybe we’ll get the next “scoop,” maybe they will, but either way, you’ll get the story first.
On The Cover
Sports at Notre Dame are not low-stress activities. The academic demands of the university team with often intense media coverage to place real pressure on Irish student-athletes. Children may idolize them, livers may quiver over them, butit’s often impossible for them to escape the public eye. When college athletes get in trouble it can be national network news. In this week’s cover story, Sports Editor Jon Paul Potts explores the difficulties involved in being caught in the glare of the spotlight: the problems student-athletes face at Notre Dame. The striking artwork on this week’s cover is by Graphic Arts Manager Jeanne Naylor, by the way.
Also In This Issue
We go as far away from the spotlight as possible in this week’s Campus Life story. Almost everyone knows there’s a seminary at Notre Dame, but as writer Heidi Laura Toboni points out, what goes on at Moreau is pretty much a mystery to most students. Scholastic goes inside the seminary for a look at what it’s like to be on the road to the priesthood.
In the News department, we welcome former Copy Editor Margaret Kenny to her new post, and writer Laurie Gilbert brings in a report on the state of campus computing. Entertainment checks in with a review of Late for Dinner as well as a look at some new music. We’ve got all our usual columns, of course, as well as the pull-out Coming Distractions centerspread calendar.
As always, enjoy the issue and let us know what you think!

A Catholic University Cannot Condone GLND/SM
Dear Editor:
I cannot allow Mr. Patrick Thomas’ comments regarding the administration’s stand against GLND/SM (Scholastic, Sept. 26, 1991) to pass by me without offering a rebuttal. Notre Dame was founded by a Catholic priest, a son of the Church, those 150 years ago. The present administration is doing nothing less than maintaining this role in modem society.
Consider this: what if some students wanted to open and abortion clinic in the basement of LaFortune Center? Do you think the administration would allow that? Of course not Because abortion is against church teaching.
Tm not supporting the treatment of gays and lesbians by their fellow students. Notre Dame should, as should any community of people sharing a common goal and grounded in Christ, be a “family.” In a family, no matter what differences of opinion are held by the members, they respond to each other with loving concern.
The problem is not so much discrimination against one group of people, as it is that those of us who claim to be Christians have lost sight of Christ in our fellow human beings. We are all walking embodiments of the goodness and grace of God. We should respect and cherish each other because of this.
We all look at God differently, though. No one have the right to judge someone else “wrong.” The Church has decided that the practice of homosexuality is against God’s teaching, however, and the predominantly Catholic administration of Notre Dame supports this by not allowing GLND/SM to meet. It’s not that they mean to exclude the members of this organization from campus life. It is simply that they cannot condone what the Church does not condone. Give ‘em a break.
If nothing else, write to the Pope.

Security Responds to Letter
Dear Editor:
I have read with interest the letter to the editor from Ms. Eble which appeared in the September 19 Scholastic. Unfortunately, she did not choose to discuss any of her opinions about the state of security of St. Mary’s Road with any security official prior to writing that letter. The result is that some completely false information was given which heightens fear and compromises safety.
The emergency phone system put in place over the past year does not require the caller to say anything, much less identify a location. As soon as a call box is opened, it alarms the dispatcher and immediately identifies the location. Additionally, the opening of the door puts the caller and dispatcher on a live, open intercom line requiring no dialing or punching of numbers. Police and security units are immediately dispatched to the automatically identified location. The speaker system will pick up all sounds within 20 feet of the instrument. Should a box fail, that is noted on a computer screen that constantly polls each box location.
This system is by far the most advanced technology available and was custom designed for Notre Dame. As with all technology, there sometimes are malfunctions. Our system, backed by computer software, gives us immediate notification. Whenever we have trouble with a particular box location, we take it out of service so that a caller cannot be calling on an instrument that is not functioning.
We are constantly looking for ways in which to improve the levels of security present on our campus. The fencing that was referred to is intended to reduce the numbers of places that pedestrians may be grabbed and pulled off of the roadway. A primary function of crime prevention is to reduce the opportunity for a crime to be committed. We believe that the recently installed fencing helps in that regard. It would not be practical or wise to extend the fencing beyond its present location because of openings for drives, roadways and walkways. There is no measure or technology that insures that an attack will be prevented anywhere. Additionally, the presence of personnel at one end of the road would not appreciably reduce the opportunity for a situation to occur.
There are some options to feeling unsafe or fearful of walking on St. Mary’s Road or any other remote area of campus. The shuttle system is provided for safety and convenience. Utilization of the escort services available go a long way towards enhancing safety. There is also safety in numbers and we encourage students to walk in groups whenever possible. Being aware of the surroundings and what is going on about you also are tips that help persons remain safer.
We are very concerned for the safety and well-being of all who come to this wonderful place of higher education. We expect and appreciate a community that is concerned for the safety of themselves and others. Our doors are always open and we encourage any interested person to stop by and investigate for themselves what we are doing to help make this a safer place.

H BY THE GIPPER
Information, opinion, attitude and outright innuendo
Latin Lovers Teach the Gipp a Thing or Two
The Gipper’s admission last week that he needed a little help decoding Scholastic’s andtheuniversity’smottoestoreatleastfour Junior CampusWatchers away from from their Latin texts long enough to translate the foreign phrases. Consensus opinion is that Scholastic’s Latin motto (“Disce Quasi Semper Victurus / Vive Quasi Cras Mori-ji turus”) translates as... (drum roll, maestro): “Learn as if you are going to live forever, live as if you are going to die tomorrow.” The Gipper says “consensus opinion” because his Latin experts didn’t agree on verb tense, but three out of the four agreed on the basic message. Thanks to Junior Cam-i pusWatchers Mark D. Holtz (no relation, as far as the Gipp knows) and Rick Dechance (grad students both) as well as John Connor (senior) for the help. Both grad students । actually left the Gipp fairly lengthy notes on ; the correct way to read the Latin motto of i	Notre Dame. The motto, printed on the
;	school seal as if on the pages of an open book
(see right) is not “Vita, Cedo, Dul, Spes.” It’s correctly read as “Vita, Dulcedo, Spes,” which translates to “Life, Sweetness, Hope.” Those are also (not entirely coincidentally) the first three words of that church-i rockin’ favorite “Salve Regina” (“Hail Holy Queen”). Well, now you know. TheGipper ; hopes all those curious CampusWatchers I	out there will sleep a little more soundly
I	tonight.
Question of the Week: The Forbidden Floor
This week’s puzzler was suggested by a note the Gipper got about the fourteenth floor of the library. The top floor of the ‘brarc isn’t open to students, and can only be reached by elevator when a special key activates the top floorbutton. TheGipper’sheard theofficial explanation about some fancy meeting rooms being up there, but it all sounds a little vague to him. The Gipper would like to hear from those who’ve managed one way or another to get up there (what have they seen?) and he’d also like to hear the best guesses for what’s up there from those who haven’t managed to penetrate the uppermost sanctum. (Check out the “Tip the Gipp” section for info on how to reach ND’s gossiping ghost.) The Gipper would also like to send a writer and a photographer up there for ' a look around on behalf of all CampusWatchers everywhere, and hopes that the proper authorities will see this and give him a call.
Stop The Presses
Now we have final proof that those folks over in public relations and information | must be getting a little bored. From a Notre I Dame Public Relations handout available in	:

“NOTRE DAME TREES
“TheUniversity of Notre Dame’s 1,250 acre campus contains some 5,000 trees of some 300 varieties, many of them rare in the region. A complete list of trees, shrubs and vines on campus was made over the years by a self-taught dendrologist, Rev. Peter E. Herbert, C.S.C., who died in 1974. Father Herbert’s guide was published in 1966; it identified and located 276 trees, 199 shrubs i and 7 vines.	j
“Three Notre Dame trees are the largest of ■ their kind growing in the state, according to	'

Don’t Zip Your Lip; Tip The Gipp
Faster than a speeding rumor, more powerful than a hot news tip, able to spread juicy gossip in a single sentence! It’s a bird! It’s a plane! It’s the Gipper! But his superpowers depend on the help of others: tell one to the Gipper — leave a message for him by phone (239-7569, call anytime), in person (stop by the office Monday-Friday 2-5 p.m.) or by campus mail (303 LaFortune) □

MOVIE
l
!■
H oily wood surprised itself last year with
Ghost, a box office smash made without a huge budget. Now it yearns for a repeat performance with Late for Dinner, another small-budget film with lovers reuniting after one dies.
Surprise! The formula does not work every time. Ghost had several things Late For Dinner does not, such as accomplished stars, veteran directors and a decent screenplay. Late for Dinner tries hard, but in the end, the screenplay and faulty directing prove its undoing.
The film begins in 1962 in. Sante Fe, N.M., with Willie (Brian Wimmer of TV’s “China Beach”) and his semi-retarded brother-in-law, Frank (Peter Berg) desperately trying to keep slimy Bob Freeman (Sex, Lies, and Videotape’s Peter Gallagher) from foreclosing their home. In a mixup, Freeman accuses Willie of kidnapping his son and threatens to kill him. After a struggle, Willie is shot. Attempting to return to his wife, Joy (Marcia Gay Harding from Miller's Crossing),.he finds their house surrounded and is forced to flee. They wind up in Pombna, CA., where Willie passes out from loss of blood. Frank miraculously runs into
a doctor who happpens be seeking two patients to test his cryogen- ™_ freezing chambers. The doctor informs slow-witted Frank he will be able to get a new kidney (Frank suffers from kidney ailments from birth complications) when he awakens, and Willie will be healed. Frank agrees and they are cryogenically frozen until some electrical equipment from a 1991 accident crashes into the lab, freeing them. Now Willie must try to renew his relationship with his wife, who is now fifty-three years old.
The story would not be a bad story line if handled well. Late For Dinner establishes a tongue-in-cheek atomosphere from the very beginning with Frank’s amusing narration.
In the genre of serio-comedy, however, it is nice to have a mixture of both, and this film fails to deliver.
From the moment Willie and Frank start back to Sante Fe, they thaw most of the potentially outstanding emotional scenes. Upon seeing his former home now converted to an automatic teller, Frank is simply shoved back into the car. AsFrank sneaks up to his wife’s new home, tears swell in our eyes, but the moment is ruined by Frank’s panic-stricken yelling in the background. Perhaps the only real emotion-packed scene occurs as Willie and Frank stumble to Willie’s daughter’s house in middle of the night, and she embraces them, as if in a dream. The much-anticipated reunion with his wife never develops fully as director W. D. Richter never lets .Willie and Joy stay in
Late for Dinner's Brian Wimmer and Marcia Gay Harding
the same room long enough to build up any tension. The whole film builds to these points but never delivers any emotional whallop when it gets there.
The acting is magnificicnt despite the glaring lack of substance. Wimmer is superb in the few scenes in which he sets Joy on fire. Marcia Gay Harding makes a statement that she is an actress to watch for in the future when she expresses her disbelief with Willie’s return. Peter Berg as Frank gives a performance I will not soon forget with his childish yet poignant comments on the ad
venture. Let us hope the Academy remembers Berg with a nomination for Best Supporting Actor in February.
There are other flaws besides the screenplay. Wilie and Frank immediately feel at home after only one day in the 90’s, which makes the audience feel misplaced. The first half of the film concentrates equally on Frank and Willie, but then ignores Frank in the second half. I felt cheated that Richter did not include more of Frank’s troubles with his condition after spending most of the first half detailing them. Again, the oppurtunity for more emotionally-charged scenes are limited. Willie and Frank’s relationship shows no complexity, either. After all they go through, they regard each other in the same terms as they did in 1962. Even though Willie goes through personal changes, he fails to relate them to Frank.
When I walked into the theater, I truly wanted Late for Dinner to succeed and prove that good, smallbudget films can be done well, as in Ghost. Poor direction, a meatless script and an anti-climatic ending ruined one of the most promising films of the year, not to mention a number of fine performances. Late for Dinner tried admirably with what it had and should not be penalized as another romantic serio-comendy
flop, as it inevitably will be with Hollywood’s law of box office success or bust. Late for Dinner is, on its own terms a better than average film. I recommend it as a wonderful way to spend an evening and nothing more, even though it could have
been much more.

Nirvana's NewetminA
Smells Like Grunge Spirit
Nirvana's Nevermind is the Olympia, WA. band's new reiase on DGC
by JejfJotz
urr hey’re young, they’ve got their
A own van and they’re going to make us rich! ” proclaimed an old mail-order catalogue for Sub Pop records, the label that filled the ears of America with the alternative rock genre known as “grunge.” The above quote was in reference to Nirvana, three stoners from Olympia, Washington who were into Black Sabbath and various punk stuff. In 1988,the trio launcheditsown blitzkreig with the release of Bleach on Sub Pop. Nirvanamania was bom.
Three years, three singles, one EP, four compilation appearances and numerous bootlegs later, Nirvana explodes into the fun world of corporate rock with Nevermind. their newest effort on record mogul David Geffen’s DGC. The twelve songs onNever-mind comprise a motley crew of traditional maniacal jams, kindler, gentler material and various songs the band has been performing live in the past few years. Displaying the signs of true rock greatness, the majority of
songs clock in at under two and a half heavenly minutes. Like adolescent debauchery, the pleasure is short but intensely sweet.
On Nevermind. Nirvana demonstrates the remarkable maturity gained since Bleach while still retaining the senseless ferocity which has won them a loyal and devoted following. Nevermind reassures the newcomer with a surprisingly melodic and intricate base of tunes, while still pleasing the old fan and showing that three chords still reign supreme. Produced by veteran Butch Vig, Nevermind demonstrates that an indie band can benefit from quality production characteristic of major labels. Instead of being lost in the chaos, vocalist Kurt Cobain’s voice blares forth loud and clear. Chris Novoselic’s bass retains a fine fuzz on “Breed,” the album’s most enjoyable track. For the sake of fairness, newcomer D. C. hardcore vet David Grohl’s drums lend precision to the new Nirvana sound.
Nevermind begins its roar with “Smells LikeTeen Spirit,” a poke atNirvana’s place in the consumer rock panthenon that is well-lined with Cobain’s smooth snarls and reinforced with drums that will blow a hole through the uninitiated listener. Float downstream to “In Bloom,” the rhythmic rocker that has been a popular tune at Nirvana’s live performances. “Breed” (see above) shakes your foundations with a phenomenal bass, repetitive punk guitar and excellent vocal insanity. Oozing on, Nirvana actually at. tempts an accoustic piece on “Polly.” Instead of sinking into the painful “power ballad” required by all cheesy metal bands and other hard rockers, Nirvana shows that sensitivity does not have to be part of a
lucrative record contract. The opening lines quickly dispel the notion that a sappy croon about roses, thorns and patience is not part of the band’s repertoire. Following the cannabis-influenced “Polly” is an excruciatingly beautiful song whose title is hardly suitable for a family magazine. With guitars so terrifically distorted that Hiisker Dil’s Zen Arcade cringes in its wake, the song shows potential as a future fan favorite. Cobain’s agonizing screams deliver a crazed vocal melee without sounding like some contrived industrial bombast.
On Saturday, October 12, Nirvana will be playing with New Jerseyans Das Damen at Chicago’s Cabaret Metro (3730 N. Clark). In the midst of warnings of mass hysteria and near-riot conditions from the East Coast Nirvana shows, it looks as if the Metro will be lucky if her walls remain standing after Nirvana blazes through the Windy City like the Great Chicago Fire.
Nirvana has emerged from their three-year album drought with a refined, diverse sound. Unlike other alternative bands’ attempts at fitting in the realm of corporate rock (The Replacements’ Pleased to Meet Me comes to mind), Nirvana bridges the gap between Bleach and their future quite nicely. The savagery of old is blended with a newfound sense of musicianship that should win the love of new fans as well as the venerable, long-haired, tried and true grunge-lovers.	□

CAMPUS COMPUTING
Taking Advantage of Campus Technology
by Laurie Gilbert
Sit back, relax and imagine this scenario: The summer is over and you’ve arrived either at or back at the University of Notre Dame for the fall semester. For the first week or so, things aren’t going badly; sure, you have a few brief reading assignments and whatnot, but you’ve still found the time to sunbathe at Stonehenge or scope prospective SYR dates at various locations around campus free from anxiety over schoolwork. And then it hits. Your Humanities (feel free to substitute English, philosophy, etc.) professor assigns THE PAPER. It is to be 4-5 pages in length, double-spaced, with title-page, endnotes, bibliography.. .you get the idea. Likeagood “Domer” you race to the ‘Brarc, where you research like mad, then proceed directly to your room and scratch out a rough draft on several semi-crumpled sheets of notebook paper. The only problem appears to be transferring all of your work into some sort of legible form. Unlike some of your lucky dorm mates, you lack a personal word processor of your own. Unsure of what to do, you push the matter completely from your mind (well, kind of) and wait until thenightbefore it’s due to start worrying in earnest (now you’re acting like a typical “Domer”). Finally, clueless as to what else to do, you carefully copy it out by hand on looselcaf paper, only to find in class the next morning that you are surrounded by students clutching spotless papers with spiffy laser-printed title pages. Suddenly, you get the eerie feeling that everyone in the room knows
OCTOBERS, 1991
something that you don’t..
What they all know is not such a big secret, as long as you keep your eyes and ears open and pay attention to the ever-changing state of campus computing. Even though it’s loo late for that first paper, what services are provided, youask? The answer is a long and somewhat complicated one, due mostly in fact to the difference between the present state of campus computing and the vision of the University Committee on Computing at the University of Notre Dame (UCCIS) for future technology here on campus. And although constant changes are being made to implement theUCCIS’ goals and to upgrade the facilities and equipment, the university still has a way to go in seeing this task completed.
Slightly over two years ago the UCCIS launched a four year campus computing initiative in an attempt to dramatically improve technological opportunity for students, faculty and staff of Notre Dame, Saint Mary’s College and Holy Cross College. The initiative focuses on eleven main recommendations which are as follows:
1)	A campus network (NDnet), which would extend to nearly all buildings on campus and consist of a fiber-optic backbone connected to local and microcomputer networks to facilitate campus-wide communications should be implemented.
2)	The IBM 303 should be replaced with a state-of-the-art mainframe system with vector-processing capability.
3)	The clusters of workstations should be
provided and maintained.
4)	A number of classrooms should be equipped with a workstation and output projector and be connected to NDnet for the instructor’s use.
5)	In addition to providing and supporting the computing infrastructure, the university should provide sufficient funds to support the computing requirements of colleges, departments, and other units.
6)	A review of the existing plans for the development of the Administrative system, particularly the Student Information subsystem, should be undertaken without delay and completed quickly.
7)	The library catalog database should be enlarged and IheLibrary Computing System should be made convenient for all users through the campus network.
8)	S upport services should be expanded to provide a wide range of services for all centrally supported systems, including educational programs and materials, consulting services, general technical support and assistance to faculty in developing courseware and. applying educational computing technology.
9)	An Office of University Computing (OUC), headed by the Assistant Provost for Computing, should be established.
10)	The implementation should begin with a broadly based response to needs and with a goal of completing the plan over a four-year period.
11)	Recommendation eleven is a complex four-part piece regarding the financing of
7

campus computing.
Of the eleven recommendations, numbers one and seven are currently in the process of implementation, numbers four, five, nine and eleven have been implemented, although in manners slightly or significantly different from those originally suggested, and numbers two, three, six, eight and ten have been implemented according to the UCCIS recommendations, Recommendation three, regarding provision and upkeep of computer clusters has been implemented well beyond UCCIS’ initial vision, having been invested with a great deal of money and effort. Currently the ten public cluster sites

provide 184 Macintosh, 81 DOS and 124 UNIX microcomputers and highend workstations, as well as 30 dedicated terminals and 43 hardcopy devices. At least one facility should be kept open 24 hours a day every day of the year, and several are open around the clock during the school session. Most of the clusters are staffed by students (OUC is, incidentally, one of the major employers of students on campus, currently employing over 150 students), while others have online or telephone access for assistance. Those clusters not staffed include Campus Security 217, Computing Center/Math Building G015, and Nieuwland Science 203. Only those familiar with the equipment and software are recommended to use these
clusters.
All clusters are internally networked and are on the campus network, and eight of them are used for instructional purposes as well as public access. In addition, a new computer cluster has been planned for the DeBartolo classroom building. It will include approximately 80 workstations and depending on staffing may be open 24 hours a day. Although plans are still indefinite, it is intended that the cluster will offer multimedia working environments to allow integration of text, animation, video and sound into one learning environment.
Revisions in equipment were made over
the summer of 1991 to further improve the accessibility of campus computing. All two-drive Macintosh SE computers are now equipped with hard drives, which allow them to run the upgraded operating system 7.0. Zenith 286 LP computers in the Hesburgh cluster have been replaced by sixteen DTK 386 computers. Through the first semester DOS-based computers will have their operating systems upgraded to DOS 5.0. Currently all clusters provide laser printers and TElnct Access, while all but Nieuwland offer Macintosh Computers and Library System Access. In addition to this, seven out of the ten clusters provide software manuals available for checkout, so that students may do a little computer research
before heading out to the cluster to cram in that last minute paper.
OUC also sponsored a series of presentations last spring which dealt with the creative integration of computing resources and technology in academic work. Entitled, Technology for Academia, the presentations were open to members of the Notre Dame, Saint Mary’s and Holy Cross communities, and they explored the ways in which technology is employed to teach and to acquire knowledge. The Perseus Project tackled the subject of applying computer and video technology to the study of Ancient Greek civilization, while
the Theoria Project used technology to involve the user in a case study which provides a handle on controversial material. The Perseus Project was directed by Gregory Crane, Associate Professor of the Classics at Harvard University, and the Theoria Project by Preston Covey and Robert Cavalier of Carnegie Mellon University.
OUC also published bytline, a newsletter devoted to campus computing, which can be subscribed to or found in the Information Resource Center of the Computing Center, bytline includes extensive updates on the progress of implementing the UCCIS’ goals, detailed descriptions of available software, feature articles, and news features. In addition to this, a question and answer section (imagine
“Dear Abby”, only concerning bits and bytes) is included to address some of the major dilemmas encountered by. novice or experienced computer users and to provide valuable information which can be stored away for later use.
So the next time your favorite professor gets that old “Time-for-another-paper” gleam in his eye, don’t sweat. With a little planning and a knowledge of the options open to you, it will be easier to take advantage of the computer resources already available. And we can all look forward to the upgrades, revisions and improvements which are still in store as the state of campus computing continues to move forward. □

Former student body president Tom Doyle offers a glimpse of what it's like
to be a seminarian
.	; by Heidi Laura Toboni
uring his undergraduate career (1985-Ur 1989) Tom Doyle lived in Grace Hall, studied philosophy, and served as student body president his senior year. More recently, he put his BA to good use working as a research and financial analyst in his home state of Washington. However, unlike most of his fellow alumni, Doyle no longer runs the corporate rat race. He’s back on campus, and he isn’t wearing plaid pants.
He has chosen to enter Moreau Seminary.
Operated by the Congregation of the Holy Cross and located on the far side of St. Joseph’s Lake, Moreau Seminary offers young men the opportunity to explore a vocation in the priesthood. Doyle and 11 other men interested in the priesthood will spend “a candidate year” at the seminary to explore their calling/
One can’t help but wonder why someone like Doyle, who has all the characteristics that society deems necessary for “having it all,” would choose a life of poverty, celibacy, and service.
Doyle admits to first expressing an interest in the priesthood his freshman year at Notre Dame. He said he made several inquiries about how to enter a seminary,
what would be expected of him at a seminary, and what life is like living in one.
Throughout his undergraduate years he felt the call to ministry in varying degrees. “At times I felt very close to it, and thought, ‘Yes, this is exactly what I’m going to do,”’ Doyle said. “And other times I felt more distant,” because there were other things he wanted to explore.
While most ND students who are considering a vocation live in Old College, he chose to remain in Grace. Specifically mentioning strong friendships forged in the dorm, Doyle said, “At the time, I could not see forgoing my life in Grace Hall nor such changing directions in my undergraduate years. ”
Doyle was extremely involved in campus life. In addition to his studies, he played interhall football for Grace. In the spring of his sophomore year, he even walked on the varsity football team and was invited to stay and play. However, Doyle was unable to pursue the time-consuming sport further, due to schoolwork and other responsibilities. As a junior, he became president of Grace Hall. The following year he was elected student body president for the ‘88-
‘89 school year.	, '
After graduation, Doyle was snatched up by Deloitte & Touche Mangement Consulting of Seattle, Washington where he worked for two years. While pursuing a professional career in business, he also continued thinking about the priesthood. “Suddenly, then, the whole question of celibacy came to the front, because I’d see people married with families. Friends I graduated from high school with were starting their own families.
“There was no single event, there was no one day when God spoke to me and said ‘I’ve chosen you!’” .
Doyle compared his decision to join the seminary to one’s decision to go to medical school. The demanding lifestyle of a medical student involves commitment and years of academics. Therefore, potential students do not enter into schooling lightly, but only after much consideration. The typical applicant has already asked him or herself, “What am I good at? What brings me fulfillment? Do others want or need me to do this?” These questions, he said, apply to a calling to serve God as well as a desire to practice medicine.
When the decision was finally made, Doyle said, his friends and family were very
OCTOBERS, 1991
supportive. “I would say the people who knew me best weren’t surprised.”
Doyle mentions the support was constructive, not blind. “Sometimes support came in the form of tough questions, such as ‘Are you ready to take a vow of poverty? Can you give up your automobile? Live in a community setting?’”
Although Doyle also considered pursuing his vocation with the Archdiocese of Seattle, he was attracted to the Holy Cross order because of his familiarity with Moreau and the variety of ministries the Congregation is involved in. If ordained, Holy Cross could offer Doyle placement opportunites in higher education at ND and other universities, in parish work in nearly every area of the country, and mission work in Chile and Africa.
Hoping to clear up some of the misconceptions concerning seminarians and their lifestyles, Doyle said, “I think people would be surprised how normal our lives are.”
Three points of emphasis in the Candidate Program are academic life, service projects, and experience in community living. All candidates are students. The seminary requires 9 college credit hours of theology and 12 college credit hours of philosophy before the candidates can begin their Masters of Divinity Program. Therefore, most of the twelve, including Doyle, are now taking higher level theology and philosophy courses at ND.
In addition to class work, each candidate has a service project, an apostolate, within the South Bend community to which he donates at least 6 tolO hours a week. Tom Doyle is counseling at the local homeless shelter, while another candidate is volunteering at a hospice, and still another is working in bail-bond ministry.
“Probably the most important aspect is learning what it means to live in a religious community, in particular, Holy Cross,” said Doyle. The first year is designed to introduce the candidates to the character of the Congregation. “You discover its [the Holy Cross Order’s] personality, its expectations of you, and your expectations of it.”
Many facets of seminary life help to fos
ter a strong sense of community. Fourty to fifty seminarians gather every day in morning and evening prayer, and an effort is made to eat most meals together. Furthermore, each candidate is expected to celebrate the eucharist daily, preferably with his fellow candidates.
“You don’t just walk in here and say, ‘I’m here. I’m in the seminary.’ It’s more like
“.. It's such a great atmosphere here... there Is a great deal of support”
you’re being invited into a family,” said Doyle.
On a more personal level, the Candidate Year is also a lime for spirlual growth and for exploration of one’s own vocation. Tom said,“That is what the candidate’s year is for; to see whether or not you want to proceed with your MD and be fully integrated into the seminary.”
Doyle said he thought his living arrangement was not unlike most of the dormitories. A quick look around the seminary reveals what Tom refers to as “the perks”: single rooms, cable television, VCRs and stereos, a library within the dorm, an open kitchen with great food, an adjoining athletic facility with one of the best racquetball courts on campus, recreational lounges with coke machines and an open keg, and a spectacular view of the Dome. “The phone is the only thing that’s sort of an anomoly.” All candidates must share the use of one phone.
All the candidates are socially active. Tom Doyle plays sports, maintains friendships in Grace by attending mass, and invites old hall buddies to visitordincon Thursday’s community nightdinners. Doyle
also attends home football games.
There is no rush to complete one’s MD, so seminary life, though busy, is much more relaxed than undergraduate work. Such a schedule enables candidates to explore other areas of learning which otherwise might have been closed to them. Doyle, for example, has just begun to take guitar and voice lessons.
“I would love for anyone close to me to walk through a week of my life with me now, because it’s such a great atmosphere here ... there is a great deal of support,” says Doyle.
If he decides to continue on his present course, and is accepted into the seminary program, the next year will be spent in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Doyle will live with whomever remains of the original 12,and life will bede-voted to prayer, community service, and personal reflection. After this novitiate year, Doyle will return to the seminary to complete his Masters of Divinity, which usually takes 2 to 3 more years of classes. This is followed by a regency, which is similar to an internship in that the seminarian is placed in a parish to learn his role from his superior firsthand. The next step is dcaconry for about a year, at the end of which the final decision concerning ordainment is made.
Tom views the future cautiously, “trying not to swallow to much at once, and taking the process one step at a time.”
“Thal is the real beauty of the program. To start the program and not to finish is not a failure. The only failure is if you haven’t been honest with yourself and the people within the program.”
Actually, most of the candidates do not see the process through to ordination, but go on to other things with their enriched lives. But Tom’s present goal is ordainment, and he appears to be secure in his decision.
In his candidate application, Tom Doyle cited a quote he found particularly inspiring, in his decision to enter the seminary: “What you are is God’s gift to you. What you make of yourself is your gift to God.” □

CAMPUS LIFE
Hsangm' wifth fths gunys
An evening with the candidates at Moreau
by Heidi Laura Toboni
You and a friend are jogging around Si Joseph’s Lake. Halfway through the circuit, on the lake’s far-side, you pass a large brick building with a cross on the front lawn;
“What’s that building?” you ask. “Is that where the priests live?”
“No, I think it’s for the seminarians,” your friend answers.
“The who?”
“The seminarians.”
“What do they do there?”
After a short silence your friend admits, “Well, actually, I don’t really know.”
If you have never been to a seminary, maybe it’s time you dropped in for a visit. You might be surprised.
The Moreau Seminary, operated by the Congregation of the Holy Cross and a five minute walk from campus, affords ND students a good opportunity to correct their misconceptions concerning its inhabitants and their lifestyle.
Community night, a kind of open house at the seminary, falls on Thursday. Visitors are invited to mass at 5:00, dinner at 6:00, and then welcomed to look around the facility or kick back with the seminarians. Yet many ND students may not have time to spend such an evening, so here’s a quick look at how a typical visit with one group of seminarians, the first year candidates, might run.
After a beautiful mass combining song, OCTOBERS, 1991
celebration, and worship, you are presented with a homecooked meal. Sitting around the dinner table are this year’s candidates for the seminary. There are twelve in all, ranging in ages from 21 to 29. Perhaps the most extraordinary characteristic of this group is their incredible diversity.
Next to you might sit Brett, a Notre Dame grad in philosophy and anthropology who enjoys outdoor sports. On your other side could be James from the University of St. Thomas, who’s earned a degree in quantitative methods and computer science. Beside him sits another ND alum who went on to the University of Michigan Law School and was an attorney in Chicago for two years.
The people at the seminary “take people where they are. They don’t mold people into a final product, but take special gifts and talents of each individual and try to foster them,” said Tom Doyle, an ND grad and former financial consultant.
Other candidates have degrees in finance, accounting, theology, philosophy, and history. Somearejust finishing up their undergraduate studies at Notre Dame. The majority have been out of school and in the work force for some time. Michael Chalmers was an accountant for the firm of KPMG Peat Marwick, and Timothy Frantz was vice-president of Kruger McGrew Construction Co. Another candidate was a coach and faculty member at a high school

in the Bronx.	?
Conversation covers an equally wide range	4
of topics; from music and their upcoming i retreat to football (yes, even here!) and the j ND Encounter Program. Serious subjects j such as women in the clergy and celibacy are	■;
also discussed.	j
One candidate describes the vow of celi-
bacy as “dying to self.” Doyle, however, ; describes it as a form of witness. In a society	.!
that places so much emphasis on relations	’
between men and women, the relationship j between an individual and God is often over-	:
shadowed. A priest stands out as “a radical statement of incompleteness.”
The candidates are also very willing to share stories about their struggle to decide if the priesthood is right for them, and to offer : advice to other young men who think they ■ may be interested in avocation. The candi- ; dates suggest that those interested in the ' vocation speak to someone they are comfortable with, such as arectoror priest. “Don’tbe	j
afraid to ask questions,” said Rob Weiter. j
Visiting Moreau and its seminarians may ;i not convince a student to dump his girlfreind,	:
switch majors to theology, and move out of ' the dorm into Old College. But it may present	;
another post-graduate possibility, and at the very least erase the misconceptions concern- ; ing life in the seminary. Undoubtedly, you’ll make good friends in the process. □	4

Fighting Irish student-athletes struggle to balance academics, athletics and fame in the Notre Dame media fishbowl
By Jon Paul Potts
It is a Notre Dame Saturday on NBC and the Fighting Irish football team is being broadcast to millions of households across the nation. As the Indiana University quarterback drops back to throw to the right side, Notre Dame fans everywhere cheer as Demetrius DuBose, a 20-year old junior linebacker, steps in front of the errant pass, making the interception and returning it 49 yards fora touchdown. On the television, Bill Walsh, one of the announcers for NBC, heaps the praise on DuBose, gushing that this young man will be a guaranteed “first-round draft pick in the NFL.”
If you are a student atNotre Dame, you hear this and say to yourself, “Wait, isn’t that the same Demetrius who is in my government class?” or, “Isn’t that the same guy that I played section hoops against?”
People are already calling him a potential NFL star and he is studying for the same test that you are taking on Monday morning.
DuBose and junior quarterback Rick Mirer arc at a huge party off-campus. Not ten min
utes after you had chatted with them, the South Bend police arrive and these two young men arc arrested. The next day, their faces are plastered all over networks as the media describes their arrests for “disorderly conduct” and “public intoxication.”
You wonder if it is fair that these two guys were singled out by the press because they arc high-profile Notre Dame athletes. And you wonder if it is right that they be madeaspectacleofwhcn, last weekend, the guy down the hall was arrested for the same offense, but it only made The Observer security beat.
It is finals week and you are stressing because your boyfriend is being a jerk, you haven’t done any laundry in three weeks, and you have five finals that you have to study for by Monday. You start to feel sorry for yourself and begin to feel the pressures of college life. Now, imagine you’re the girl next door; she has all your problems and more — she’s a varsity basketball player and, tomorrow, the Notre Dame women’s
basketball team plays national power Louisiana Tech.
Wow. You may be stressed and cramped for time, but at least you don’t have basketball practice for three hours everyday.
There is tremendous pressure and scrutiny that accompany being a studentathlete at the University of Notre Dame. It is a school that boasts of one of the finest all-around athletic programs in the nation while, at the same time, holding academic and moral integrity on an equal plane with that athletic prowess.
This combination, along with the tremendous media coverage that Irish sports receives, contributes to the pressure cooker that these athletes have to endure for their four years under the Golden Dome. All the athletes, football and men’s basketball players especially, are held to a high standard that can get to be a bit taxing at times.
“You know when you come here that it’s going to be hard,” DuBose told the South Bend Tribune. “Your life has changed, you
14
SCHOLASTIC
made a commitment and it’s important that you stay with that commitment.”
Dave DiLucia is a men’s tennis player from Norristown, Pa. He has led a resurgence in the men’s program since his arrival on campus as a freshman in 1988. This past summer, he won a gold and a silver medal at the Pan-American Games which were held in Cuba, so he knows a thing or two about pressure. In reflecting on his Notre Dame experience, he has felt the glare of the spotlight, but said that it is nothing he wasn’t warned about.
“The pressure from the media here is more intense than it is elsewhere because Notre Dame has developed a tradition of excellence in academics and athletics that the media either loves or hates,” said DiLucia. “There is no happy medium, it seems. There is great scrutiny from the press here, but you arc warned of this before you sign on to come.”
There doesn ’ t seem to be a middle ground, as DiLucia said. Just consider for a moment, the incredible pressure that Raghib Ismail was subjected to in 1990. For almost a whole season, this shy and unassuming young man, who happened to be blessed with extraordinary skills in football, was hounded by the national media about his intentions to join the professional football ranks.
Reporters saw a young man with a tremendous weight on his shoulders at press conferences and in the locker room after games. He was trying to make it through classes, a regular season and every other little thing that goes along with being a col lege student, and then he had the media to deal with and it appeared to take its toll. When the man they called “the- Rocket” finally announced his decision in January, the pressure was off and it showed.
But its not just the superstars who have to deal with this pressure. Every student athlete, from the starting quarterback of the nationally ranked football team, to the backup catcher on the women’s softball team, has to deal with the tremendous time constraints that go along with being a student-athlete.
JoAnne Bunnage is a counselor for the Academic Advising for Student-Athletes department. In her office on the third floor of the Golden Dome, she has files for a fair amount of the football team, and selected other Olympic Sports teams such as swimming and softball. She emphasized that
OCTOBERS, 1991
being a student-athlete involves much more than putting on the uniform on gameday.
“They (student-athletes) use us a lot because we arc a resource that can save them time,” she said. “Sports reduces their time tremendously. For non-athletes, it is often tough to understand the time these kids put in. It’s not just practice, it’s weight training, film, and general upkeep of their health in terms of eating a good diet, stretching, and just staying healthy which can be a job in itself.”
Bunnage and her counterparts keep files on each athlete which includes the athlete’s complete academic schedule, their semester assignment schedule and any other information which Bunnage could possibly use to help the person manage time more effectively.
But that is not her only job. She also acts as a middle man between the athletes and any possible counseling that they may need.
For many athletes, it is quite an adjustment from being a high school superstar to being a freshman far down the depth chart. Homesickness, depression and academic troubles arc all possible symptoms of a student-athlete struggling to adjust to the college life.
For Irish standout tight end Derek Brown, freshman year in South Bend was a long way from his home in Merrit Island, Fla. He had been used to the spotlight through high school and as a hot recruit, but suddenly, he was one of many great recruits that had to adjust to Du Lac, academic demands and life

away from home.
“It’s definitely tough here at Notre Dame,” he said. “Freshman year, I almost went nuts — I got grey hairs. The coaches were on you to perform on the field and the teachers gave you no breaks in the class. I honestly hated it when I got here because I had never been under so many rules. But through experience, I managed to learn to budget my time and make the adjustments. Now I realize that no matter how many tests or papers I have, it always gets done and then you just breath a sigh of relief.”
Just two weeks ago, the heir apparent to Ismail, Mike Miller, a schoolboy sensation from near Houston, Texas, withdrew from the university citing homesickness. He had struggled with several injuries throughout the preseason and in his first game, against Michigan in Wolverine Stadium, he was not spectacular. Perhaps if scouting reports hadn’t touted him as “the next Rocket,” he would have been able to sort things out for himself and made the adjustments to life ; over 1,200 miles from home. But his every ~ ; move was scrutinized and in the end, he thought it would be in best interests to return to Texas and attend a college closer to his ; home. Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz wished	'
him the best and agreed that sometimes it : - : just doesn’t work out.
“There was pressure, but all we ever told him was to be yourself,” Holtz told the SouzA Bend Tribune after Miller’s departure. “Notre Dame is not all glamour. It’s a tough school. There are a lot of lonely hours.”
15
Bunnage and her office deal with this sort of thing frequently.
“It is a definite transition to college life, no matter if you are an athlete or not,” she said. “For most, it is their first time away from home; they are switching from an urban lifestyle to a campus; they are adjusting to a higher level of athletics — it is tough. We help the student to realize that he/she is not alone.
“Many freshmen are adjusting, but the athletes are under a microscope and their problems are very public,” she continued. “There are 50,000 people watching their every move and they are not always able to say ‘Timeout.’ We use their RA, upper-classmen, or anyone else that they can maybe relate to and verbalize their problems with. So we act as a sort of middle man.”
Notre Dame has always been in the national spotlight. From the efforts of Knute Rockneemerged a tradition that today places Notre Dame constantly at center stage. What other school in the nation could command its own television contract such as the one the University inked with NBC?
But with the big money and exposure come certain pressures that can affect how a football program or athletic department are run. In his book A Whole New Bailgame, Allen G ultmann examines the world of modern collegiate athletics. He writes, “... the psychological mechanisms of identification... arc such that a victory or defeat
or a football team ... is felt as a personal triumph or humiliation by thousands and tens of thousands of students.”
At Notre Dame this is magnified. For it is not merely the students who live vicariously through the athletic teams, but tens of thousands of alumni and millions of subway alums who have chosen the Fighting Irish as their team and Rockne as their patron saint. When Football Saturdays come around and plaid pants come momentarily back into style, these fans do not want to know if
Johnny Linebacker is having problems in school or with his roommate, they only care if he can stuff the hole al the line or make a sack.
The athletes are representing Notre Dame and they are expected, by the fans and the University, to comport themselves with dignity and maturity.
“Being an athlete at Notre Dame is a responsibility, and our athletes are told this,” said Rev. William Beauchamp, executive

Dave DILucia said there is great pressure to perform both academically and athletically.
vice-president and chairman of the Faculty Board on the Control of Athletics. “They arc ambassadors for the university, representing us with dignity and sportsmanship. These are the qualities that characterize Notre Dame student-athletes, and these are the qualities that the media tends to see.”
Ryan Mihalko is a fullback on the football team who graduated in May of 1991. He is currently pursuing his MBA and looking-back over his five years at Notre Dame, he said he wouldn’ t trade h is Notre Dame expe
rience for anything. But he said that at times, the spotlight can be a little bright.
“Sometimes, Notre Dame can be like the pros,” he explained. “We are held to scrutiny just because we are athletes. Kids look up to us and we’re told to watch what we do and use our better judgement. The media and people everywhere watch what we do, so wc have to be careful.”
Brown is on everyone’s preseason AllAmerica list this season and is sure to be a high NFL draft pick. In 1989, Sports Illustrated pegged him as an NFL All-Pro for 1995 — even though he was only a sophomore in college. But Brown says that you have to learn to let the press and glare of national attention roll off your back.
“That’s fine that I was on it (the Sports Illustrated list),” he explained. “It’s nothing that I can control so it’s no big deal. You just have to do what you have to do and not look at it as a pressure thing.”
T hese athletes are not alone, and most would emphasize that the Notre Dame community is very sympathetic to their situation. Bunnage has been an academic counselor at other schools, including the University of Washington, which has its own rich athletic history. But she emphasized that Notre Dame has a “wonderful support system and level of care. The sincere desire for the students to succeed is unsurpassed.”
Daimon Sweet, a starting forward for the men’s basketball team and a senior American S tud-ies major who is scheduled to
graduate, said that he has never felt singled out academically.
“I have never had a problem with a professor understanding that I will be traveling with the team and that my assignment might be turned in early or late because of it,” said Sweet. “Professors are fair with me. They give me their syllabus at the beginning of the semester, and I have to discipline myself to work basketball around that.
“There is no reason for professors to go out of their way to meet my needs,” he
16
SCHOLASTIC
explained. “It is a give-and-take situation. Professors are on a schedule also. I am here to learn and to play ball — I am not going to jeopardize my loaming for any reason because I need that GPA to play.”
DiLucia agrees with Sweet in his assessment of the academic treatment student-athletes receive.
“There is great pressure to perform academically as well as athletically because you have to get that GPA to stay eligible,” said DiLucia. “Notre Dame’s eligibility rules are far tougher than most other college eligibility rules. I respect that and the teachers f respect that. They make no unnecessary exemptions for me, and that’s how it should be. At the same time, the teachers are helpful i f I have a serious time conflict or something. They arc here to help in the same way that coaches do, just that their area of expertise is the classroom and not the court.”
There are many wonderful success stories among the student-athletes. Coquese Washington is a guard on the women’s basketball team who is scheduled to graduate a year early at the end of next summer with a degree in history. This coming Saturday, she will take thc -LSATs and will begin to apply to Law School.
“I realized last spring that I had a chance to graduate early if I worked really hard,” said Washington. During the summer, I didn’t have a job so I went to summer school and I have'will have all the credits I need to graduate.
“I think that the most important thing that I’ve learned is budgeting my time on a semester level, not just week by week,” she explained. “Getting the grades is just a matter of time management and realizing that academics should be first.”
Washington relayed a story which goes a long way in demonstrating the emphasis that coaches put on academics. It seems that during finals week of first semester of last year, the Irish were preparing for perhaps their biggest game of the season — a showdown with ninth-ranked Louisiana Tech, a perennial women’s basketball power.
“It was funny, during finals last
OCTOBERS, 1991
year, we were getting ready to play Louisiana Tech, but we were only getting six or seven players at the practices,” she said. “Coach McGraw said, ‘Hey, here we are preparing to play our biggest game of the year, and practice is empty.’ I think that that proved Notre Dame’s commitment to academics.
“Here at Notre Dame, we feel much more pressure to perform in the classroom than on the field or court because the media scrutinizes everything that we do,” she continued. “Especially in the higher profile sports like football and men’s and women’s basketball, the pressure is on to perform and stay eligible. It is kind of competitive to keep up our grades for the sake of the team.”

such as Washington or Pat Eilers, who graduated in 1989 with a degree in biology while earning a National Championship ring for the football team. In 1990, he came back for a fifth year finishing a graduate degree in mechanical engineering. Oh, and he also played varsity baseball.
■ The fact that these athletes, all across the board from fencing to football, from track to tennis, are able to earn their degree while competing and usually excelling in their sport is a feat in itself. The fact that most of them succeed in the media fishbowl that is the University of Notre Dame is even more impressive.
They all admit that they knew what they were getting into when they matriculated at Notre Dame.
“I came to Notre Dame for the combina: tion of family and sport. I could have gone somewhere where tennis was my life and I did not have to study, but nothing in life is fool-proof,” said DiLucia. “If I get injured or I just start to slump, I will always have that highly re* garded Notre Dame degree. This is why my family and I are happy that I am here. The pressure is on, but Notre Dame takes good care of its athletes.”
Washington has found life as a Notre Dame student-athlete rewarding for many reasons.
“College athletics have definitely been a great opportunity,” she said. “I’ve traveled and made contacts with people I’d have never gotten a chance to meet otherwise. The only grind is the preseason from October 5 to November when we have conditioning and tedious practices. But playing in the games definitely makes it worthwhile and I’d have to say that the benefits far outweighed the negatives.”
And Mihalko, enjoying his fifth year of suiting up and donning that well-known gold helmet said:
“There’s so much that you gain from Notre Dame. Outsiders just can’t grasp what a great place it is. It’s an experience that I’ll hold with me for the rest of my life.” □

Notes: The Fighting Irish finished at 10-0-0 to win what would be Knute Rockne's third and final consensus national title at Notre Dame... This team had seven All-Americans, more than any Irish team before it or after it. These All-Americans were QB Frank Carideo, HB Marchy Schwartz, HB Marty Brill, FB Joe Savoldi, G Bert Metzger, E Tom Conley, and T Al Culver. All of these AllAmericans were on the offense, providing a punch that pounded each and every opponent save a single grudge match against perennial power Army — a game which the Irish won 7-6... The Notre Dame Stadium was completed in 1930 and dedicated during the Navy game... Also in 1930, the present Law School was completed.

FEMALE ATHLETE OF THE WEEK
Mike McWilliams: McWilliams, a sophomore from Grove City, Pa., paced the Notre Dame men's cross country team in its successful showing at the National Catholic Invitationals where the Fighting Irish placed five runners in the top 12. The race marked the first time that McWilliams has led Notre Dame in a race as he has always been outdistanced by teammate and fellow All-American John Coyle. But this race belonged to McWilliams who had a personal best time of 24:04.6.
Tiffany Thompson: Thompson, a freshman from Houston, TX, scored the first goal of the game against the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, a game that the Fighting Irish women's soccer team would wind up winning 3-0. This was Thompson's third goal of the year, an impressive figure for a freshman when combined with her four assists. The center midfelder has impressed everyone from day one and has started every game for Notre Dame.

Chowin' Down at Sigma Alpha Epsilon
This is Why Why We Don't Have ZAE at ND
A fraternity house at the University of Houston had to be shut down temporarily, reports theChornicle of Higher Education. The president of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house apparently got into a scuffle with a female visitor and her boyfriend during a fraternity party. Try and guess what happened next, knowing those frat brats. Give up? He bit off the top of her little finger! (We're not making this up). This incident has caused the university to close the house as part of a ''cooling-off' period. The university is also responding to numerous complaints of loud noise of those fearful that their limbs will be detached. Hopefully they won't be scrv'mgfinger sandwiches at their next party.

Dear Mr. Manners:
Well, we’ve had our first SYR (isn’t that a funny name for a Catholic school dance - Screw Your Roommate? Shouldn’t it be more like Find Heinous Date For Your Roommate? Although I suppose telling a friend you have an FHDFYR tonight isn’t too cool). Anyway, we had it and as usual it was the greatest time in my life until that moment. Oh that moment.
I knew it was coming all night long, but I prayed it wouldn’t. It was about 1:30 a.m. and we were on the dance floor getting down andthenextsongtheyplayedwas-youguessedit- “Only the Good Die Young” by Billy Joel. lean barely write the words without violently wretching. I am convinced he is Beelzebub. And everybody freaks for that song. Don’t they realize how hypocritical they are?
Mr. Manners, why is it that at a half-way decent dance here they must wrap up the last half-hour with a song such as this? Similar wretch-inducing songs include “Shook Me All Night Long” by AC/DC or something by R.E.M. Stop this before it’s the end of me.
Signed,
I Hate ND Music
Dear ND Music:
I must confirm your observation. Billy Joel is, in fact, the Prince of Darkness. One must search high and low for a more pretentious modern-day Mozart from the heart of Long Island. I think my main problem with him is that he sang through the 70’s and still takes himself seriously. This is why I have given upon all forms of music in favor of a disco revolution. Big bass, stupid words, funky clothes.
Must you really ask why dances are ended this way? It’s a tradition. Say it, tra-diiiiiii-tion. Don’t dare try changing it, either. So, just for your enjoyment, I have enclosed a picture of B J himself. Do with it what you will.
Dear Mr. Manners:
There’s this girl I really like and I want her to go to my SYR with me. I’ve liked her since freshman year. Now as a senior, I’ve been rejected by her seven times. Every time I ask her, she says she has ‘friends coming in for the weekend.’
Mr. Manners, she is from Western Samoa. I believed her for the first five times but now I’m having my doubts. It must cost a bundle for all these friends to make the 22 hour trip. And I have not once seen her with these friends. Is she hiding something from me? What should I do?

I think she might be blowing you off. Tell you whaL Just give me a few characterisitcs about yourself. Maybe your height, class, G.P.A., favorite come on line, etc. I'm sure I could pull something off for you. Womyn of ND/SMC (Yes, SMC) need a date? □

WEEK IN DISTORTION
A Mish-Mash of Stupidity
Freshman Tony Leonardo Offers Some Observations and Complaints
Well, folks, here it is. This is the scoop, the main drag, the news on the juice. I’m your information-hype-it-up-funky-type-o-guy and I’m a gonna make things happen. The man of the hour, your soul-flyin,’ back-flippin, jack-rip-pin’ dude with the ‘tude. And I don’t want no lip, so shut-up, pull up, and roll back.
I’ll get to the point. It seems to me that every “Week in Contortion” article has some overriding theme that keeps it all together. They either talk about some specific gripe on campus (which is usually something that darned well should be griped about) or they talk about something that has a geniune comedic interest. I, however am different. I’m ignorant, lazy, and not a good enough writer to successfully pull off these two techniques. So you’re going to get a mish-mash of stupidity and naivete. And you have no choice but to like it. And, no, I don’t want to hear it.
I might as well start with an observation. I, though only a freshmen, have noticed that many, many people seem to have gotten sick the weekend of the Michigan game. I don’t mean sick and/or depressed because we lost, but I mean a general sick feeling, usually beginning with a cold-type of feeling. That’s right, your head feels kinda funny, you’re sleeping longer than usual, and you’re grumpy. Not that you’re probably not grumpy in the first place, but this time a little more grumpy. Sort of a “grumpy” grumpy, if you know what I mean. Anyway, this vague sickness, in most cases is due to the glorious South Bend weather. I’ve lived here for thirteen years now, and I haven’t gotten used to it. It’s cold one minute, warm the
next, and before you know it, it’s raining. But that rain only lasts for maybe ten minutes, and then the skies clear up and the sun shines again. What fun. Anyway, because of this, and maybe because of the Michigan game, everyone is coughing, sneezing, blowing their nose, and generally looking a litle haggard. I’m included in this department, and I’m grumpy, so that’s why I’m telling you.
To make it seem as if I was actually directly talking to you, the reader, let me complain about a few more things. While I’m sitting at my desk writing this drivel, I can’t help but notice that my roommates’
to this column.
desks are both clean and organized. Their clothes are put away, and their beds are made. Then I gaze around the room at a large, actually very large, pile of books, folders, newspapers, boxes, various papers, and other assorted junk. I notice an unmade bed with pretzel crumbs and a
book lying on it. Who could have made such a mess? (Only then do I realize, after looking at the desk I’m writing on that is just covered with junk, that this fiend must be me.) I’m that one roomie that you always end up with at least one year that is disorganized and lazy. And I’m here to stay.
This “Week In Extortion” is getting a little too predictable, so I’m going to end it with a little “bad craziness,” to quote Hunter S. Thompson.
While walking through, as opposed to under or around, the campus yesterday I noticed a squirrel lying on his back. He * kept on trying to tell me he was really the King of England and that he was on his back because he was pretending to be the' Queen of England. I knew he was lying then because: 1) The Queen of England would probably beon top, and 2) Everyone , knows that squirrels can’t talk. I ignored him and checked the time, even though I don’tplay hockey. According to my watch that I wasn’t wearing, it was 3:00 P.M. This meant trouble, if it meant anything at all, because I was late for my nap. Fortunately for me, however, it didn’t mean anything at all because time is relative, sort of like a great-uncle or something. I then ran, ran, ran, and ran some more. Four steps of running! Not bad for my daily nonexistent exorcise. I just had the toughest lime ridding myself of that devil. But now I’m cured and the “Week In Disproportion” is over.

All the presidential men
Compiled, by Patricia Doyle
A Ithough many students are aware that xjL Fr. Edward F. Sorin founded the University of Notre Dame in 1842, Sorin’s followers as presidents of the university each contributed to the development of the university as it stands today.
Sorin created Notre Dame in the Indiana

wilderness, fighting harsh climates and fire to build and maintain the university, and he played a significant role in developing the image that Notre Dame has today. The presidency of Sorin has been described as one “of faith, of struggle and finally of triumph.”
Following Sorin, Fr. Patrick Dillon served as president during the Civil War in 1865 for a one-year term. Due to the war, both tuition and enrollment decreased, however, Dillon oversaw the construction of a new domed college' building.
Fr. William Corby served his first of two terms from 1866-72. During his first term, he opened the Notre Dame law school. The first issue of the “Scholastic Year” was published on September 7, 1867 while Corby was in office.
Sorin’s nephew, Fr. August Lemmonnier, served as president from 1872-74. His presidency was short as a result of his death in office at age 35. His goal as president was to improve academics at Notre Dame through courses in science, math
and law. Lemmonnier also provided the students with a circulating library which was named for him after his death.
Fr. Patrick Colovin served a short term from 1874-77 and resigned as president due to differences with Sorin. During his office, the Centennial Exposition took place and many of the religious art objects that now adorn Sacred Heart Church were viewed, making Notre Dame more widely known.
Corby served his second term from 1877-81 following Colovin’s resignation. It was during his term in office that the original college building burned. In April of 1879, Sorin was called back to Notre Dame from a trip abroad, but Corby had already started the rebuilding. With Sorin’s help, the present Main Building was complete enough to use when students returned in the fall.
Following Corby, Fr. Thomas Walsh served a twelve-year term in office from 1881-93. During this time, many new buildings were constructed on campus such as St. Edward’s Hall, a Science Hall, Mechanics Hall and the Astronomical Observatory.
Fr. Andrew Morrissey was chosen to be president by Walsh. With the death of Sorin in 1893, Morrissey expected many changes to'take place at the university. He paid close attention to the liltlest details regarding students.
Fr. John Cavanaugh was president from 1905-1919. Cavanaugh ruled the university on his own, making most university decisions. He still remained a very grand president. It was during Cavanaugh’s presidency that military training was incorporated into the curriculum so that students could serve their country while attending school. Cavanaugh was also responsible for the appoint-

ment of chemistry professor Knute Rockne as football coach.
Next came Fr. James Bums. He played baseball during his schooling atNotrc Dame and he was the Superior of the Holy Cross School of Theology in Washington before returning to Notre Dame. His presidency lasted from 1919-1922, during which time he recruited the brightest students preparing for the priesthood and encouraged them to pursue further studies. Bums also raised money for the university. During his office, he received grants from both the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations and raised one million dollars in endowments for Notre Dame.
Fr. Matthew Walsh, president from 1922-28, was not related to Thomas Walsh. The university experienced much growth during this lime due to the end of World War I. Unfortunately, the university did not cope well with the influx of students. Two temporary dorms for the freshmen and sophomores were hastily built, but many students decided to reside off-campus. During the roaring twenties, it was difficult for the university to maintain control of these high-spirited students. Due to the increased enrollment, many young professors, graduates of the university, were hired, which also contributed to the rowdiness at the university. The university did produce many fine graduates under Walsh, partly due to the deans and department heads that Bums trained and put in place during his presidency. He was also responsible for the construction of Howard, Morrissey and Lyons halls.
Following Walsh came Fr. Charles O’Donnell who served as president from 1928-34. New dining halls and a stadium were built during this lime and O’Donnell was remembered for his gift to write both poetry and prose. Due to his failing health, his duly as president ended in 1934 and he was succeeded by Fr. John O’Hara.
O’Hara’s presidency lasted from 1934-40. O’Hara had been the founder and first dean of the College of Commerce and was thought of as a very powerful man. He constructed Cavanaugh, Zahm and Breen-Phillips Halls to hold the remaining, and de
creasing, student population that was off-campus. His greatest accomplishment was the founding of the Graduate School. He permitted many scholarly meeting and conferences with famed academics. As a result of this, O’Hara is credited with founding the University of Notre Dame.
Fr. J. Hugh O’Donnell, a former Notre Dame football player, was president from 1940-46. He returned to the university in 1934 as O’Hara’s vice-president. With the onset of World War II, the number of students and faculty decreased and Notre
Dame was eventually used as a military training facility.
O’Donnell’s successor was Fr. John Cavanaugh. His term lasted from 1946-52, during which time he created the Notre Dame foundation for the purpose of fund-raising. With the end of World War II, enrollment increased. As a result of this, Cavanaugh worked to improve student life, and he also developed lies of friendship with the South Bend community. It was Cavanaugh’s vice-president who would take these accomplishments and develop today’s Notre Dame.
Fr. Theodore Hcsburgh served his 35-year term as president from 1952-87. While his contributions to and accomplishments at Notre Dame are to great to even list, Hesburgh is most noted for his work in peace studies. He found both the Notre Dame Peace Institute and the Hesburgh Center for International Studies. He also was instru-

mental in the creation of the Peace Corps. As president emeritus, he still plays an active role in campus activities.
Since 1987 Fr. Edward Malloy has been Notre Dame’s president. Besides taking a very active role in student life and teaching class, he is a member of President Bush’s Advisory Council on Drugs.
Although these men were presidents over 150 years of history, they each had to lead students and faculty through good and bad limes. Each of Notre Dame’s presidents made many significant contributions to making Notre Dame the university that it is today.

FINAL W ORD
FM for ‘VFI?
Station manager Kevin Flaherty makes the case for a radio band-shift
The next time you’re in your room, turn on your radio and put on 640 AM. Chances are the sound quality will be poor —poor enough for you to change the station. This is the very reason that WVFI doesn’t have higher listenership. It is not because there is “no market” for this type of music. Nothing could be further from the truth. There is a great market for it, and one is not hard-pressed to find the evidence. Unfortunately, for those who have a desire to hear “alternative” music, there is only one station whose format caters to their tastes... and it is difficult to hear. WVFI is seeking a remedy to this problem. We would like to see the station change over to the FM band.
There are a great deal of people who have an interest in alternative music, enough of an interest that — right there between Led Zeppelin and CSNY — is usually a Jane’s Addiction CD ... or a Cure ... or a Red Hot Chili Peppers. The fact is that few people are locked in to one type of music. As much as they may live for top 40 or thrive on classic rock, they are generally interested in at least one or two bands that may be classified as “alternative.” And if you think that this term refers to the strange and disposable, be advised that groups such as U2 and R.E.M. would probably not exist if it weren’t for college radio to give them the start they needed.
We are simply here to provide an alternative to other forms of music. Hence the term. When I am asked why WVFI doesn’t play more Led Zeppelin or Tom Petty, I explain that that is not our purpose. WAOR serves that purpose, and they serve it well. But for the individual who wants to hear something
that lies outside of the pop culture, there are few choices. One can keep going up to Chicago to keep abreast of the new releases, buy $500 worth of CD’s at local record stores to find out what is appealing or turn on the radio for easy review of what is new in the alternative world. And like “rock n’ roll,” the word “alternative” encompasses as many different styles as there are bands. There is truly something for everyone. Certainly, the Notre Dame student body is open-minded enough to explore musical styles that might be foreign to them. .
This is where the problem arises. The AM carrier current system currently in use is a faulty one at best. The amplifiers located in the basements of all dorms and other campus buildings tend to break down quite often, and the system is not worth the money it costs to constantly upgrade it. The most logical and financially sound option is to change WVFI to the FM band.
If the station were to go FM, students could count on much more than clear reception. Seven specialty shows each week explore different musical genres (i.e. jazz, reggae, hardcore and hip-hop), the sports show features guests from the football team and telephone conversations with listeners, syndicated shows highlight acoustic performances and other lesser-known styles of music and campus news and events are announced several times per hour. We are an informative medium, both musically and educationally.
WVFI also serves a function outside the studio. We are currently booked to deejay about half of the dorm SYR’s this season, and we have provided our services for other
campus events as well. Our involvement with campus activities is only a fragment of our ongoing effort to bring this music to the students.
Lastly, WVFI is instrumental in promoting musical events on campus. Shows like The Drovers or Ariel stand to suffer from poor turnout if their music is not promoted prior to the show. We are generally given a cassette to play on the air at least a week in advance of the performance. If no one can hear the station, no one can hear the cassette. This lack of promotion has a detrimental effect on the show, which may cause the promoter to second guess any future involvement with Notre Dame, which in turn will certainly have an effect on the bands that Notre Dame is able to secure for concert appearances. The upcoming Connells show at Theodore’s, for example, will not be promoted on WSND, WAOR or U93. We would like you to be able to hear their music before the concert. This is not likely to happen if the station’s signal is too weak to reach the students.
I have been asked by several students already what they can do to help our cause. Obviously, vocal support is the foundation of any great endeavour. Write a letter to Scholastic or The Observer stating your support for WVFI’s efforts. We would like to know that the student body is behind our appeal as we approach the Administration.
While you’re at it, tune us in. You might hear something you never heard before. You might even like it.	□
