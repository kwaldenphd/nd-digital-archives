in This Issue
This week, Scholastic devotes several stories to its cover theme, Valentine’s Day. In Campus Life, writAer Stephanie Goldman sardonically informs us of the many ways to celebrate the holiday at Notre Dame. The topic of “Week in Distortion” also sticks with the loving theme of the day, as does Entertainment editor Brad Keck. His opinion of this “Ahhhh Inspiring” day is evident in “Out of Bounds” and in a special Valentine’s Day quiz. The Gipp is also in on the act with “14 Reasons to Hate Valentine’s Day.”
In News, executive editor David J. Holsinger comments on last week’s address on cultural diversity by the Reverend Jesse Jackson. Also, Jason Beachy takes a look at a different type of residence hall at Notre Dame, the home of the priests, Corby Hall.
In addition to Valentine’s Day, the Campus Life department also looks at the new

The
Ethic of
Love
Jackson's speech challenges with simple message
by David J. Holsinger
O hortlybeforeValentine’sDay,theRev-C erend Jesse Jackson came to Notre Dame to speak aboutlove of a differentkind. Jackson’s speech tackled the problem of cultural diversity by exhorting students and others to be driven by a “love ethic” in working to achieve cultural pluralism in our country. His hour-long oration painted the problem of cultural diversity in the broadest possible terms, but unfortunately cited few specific solutions.
While Jackson’s speech may have been lacking in specific suggestions for promoting cultural diversity in America’s universities, the message of hope behind it visibly stirred many of those present at the talk. Jackson’s effectiveness as an orator cannot be denied. He is an extremely engaging speaker who uses every available rhetorical device to deliver his message of tolerance and love for one’s neighbors.
Appropriate to a conference of Catholic students, Jackson founded his call-to-arms on an ethical and religious principle. “To love someone ... is the revolution,” said Jackson. “It is a contradiction to worship a God of love and
to hate someone else.” He continued from this point by citing examples of apparent hypocrisy, with former Vice President Dan Quayle among his targets. After referring to Quayle as “the ‘potatoe’ man,” Jackson
criticized Quayle’s stance on abortion as hypocritical by saying that Quayle “had strong positions on abortion until the question was placed, ‘What if it was your daughter?”’ Even Thomas Jefferson was cited as a hypocrite for refusing to give his own name to the children which he fathered with one of his female slaves. Jackson also used the story of Jesus and the adulteress to make his point, saying, “You can’tprostituteby yourself.”
These examples all drove towards the point that such inconsistencies in moral attitudes are the reason underlying cultural tensions in general. If the basic problem of achieving cultural diversity is to learn to recognize and to tolerate the plurality of cultures within our country, then Jackson has indeed provided a noble, if utopian, solution to the problem. What he advocates is not “color blindness,” but acceptance of the intrinsic worth of all cultures, and affirmation rather than negation. As he said, “I am not my brother’s keeper: I am my
[the Supreme Court decision] Plessy v. Ferguson" Jackson noted that apartheid became legal in South Africa in 1948, long after “separate but equal” facilities had been decreed legal in the United States. As a result of this, he said, “Members of the African National Congress came to Alabama to leam about segregation. They visited Indian reservations to see how Bantustans would work. Even then, we were a leader unto the world.”
“Law and morality married in 1954,” Jackson explained, holding up the late Thurgood Marshall as an example of character and integrity, calling him “the tallest in the forest of democracy.” According to Jackson, Marshall was an example to all because of his commitment to living out his beliefs in a manner that was both fair and consistent. In one of the most applauded one-liners of the night, Jackson explained that Marshall was more genuine than the Founding Fathers, if only because he gave all of his children his own last name.
Marshall was among the first who helped bring about the real intention of “equal protection under the laws” and put an end to institutional inequality. It is an ambition and commitment to justice such as Marshall’s which Jackson provides as the only way to “keep hope alive,” and put an end to institutional racism and hypocrisy.
Jackson’s address was certainly one of broad analogies and examples which sometimes tended too much toward the extreme. In comparing the issue of racial intolerance to “ethnic cleansing” and to Nazi Germany, Jackson portrayed the issue in terms which are not entirely applicable to the situation of American universities. While there is truth to his statement and power in his words, those words were sometimes used too much for dramatic effect. This was the main criticism which many held against Jackson during his speech: He spoke in sweeping generalizations and exaggerated examples that, although inspiring, were too idealistic for many to
be able to accept as a practical solution. The ideal which he proposes is certainly worth striving for, but hasn’t humanity been trying that (at least ostensibly) for two thousand years?	□
brother’s brother.”
One of the night’s real eye-openers was Jackson’s statement that, “In 1896, the Supreme Court decided on an apartheid society. South Africa learned apartheid based on
This Old House
Hundred-year-old Corby Hall is a happy home for the Holy Cross family
by Mark Mitchell /
With the arrival of 1993, another campus building achieved membership in the hundred-year-old club. The peaceful Corby Hall has met its centennial. Distinguished to most by the statue of “Fair Catch Corby” on the front lawn and the lighted statue of Saint Mary at the peak of the roof, Corby Hall is not a noted party dorm, nor is it a noted dorm, nor is it even a student dorm. Though only boys can live there, they also have to be ordained; Corby Hall is the priests’residence.
It was built in 1893 for the campus religious community and named after Father William Corby, twice a president of the university and chaplain to the Union Army during the Civil War. Inside, there hangs a famous painting of Father Corby giving general absolution to the union soldiers at the battle of Gettysburg, an event commemorated by the statue in the front yard which is a replica of one which stands on the battlefield.
On entering Corby Hall, there is no significant visible difference between it and any dorm. But just off the main hallway is the study room which is not a dirty and cramped cubicle, but a finely furnished library. And through the library is the hall lounge which substitutes a stately grandfather clock for a pool table and is appointed with wood paneling and paintings, not posters.
These initial differences between Corby Hall and a campus dorm are confirmed by the presence of an ample dining room and full kitchen. Though the upper floors are taken up by small sleeping rooms, Corby Hall is not a dormitory—it is a home. Like a home, it has a study, a living room, a dining room, kitchen and bedrooms. And like a home, Corby Hall has a family. But the
family which has made Corby a home is certainly not nuclear—it is the Congregation of Holy Cross. While the 90 members of the community do not all live in the confines of Corby Hall, they all consider it to be their home.
Though there are only 24 residents of the hall, Corby is where all the priests on campus go to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner. It is where the priests meet and pray together. And it is where the priests go to relax and have some peace. Together, the 90 Holy Cross fathers on the campus form what is called the ‘Corby Community,’ their family.
However, Corby Community can refer to two different groups. The first, and most obvious, is those priests living in Corby Hall. The 24 residents include professors, a craftsman, a former-president and the community religious superior. Many of the men living there have retired. Father Charles Carey, a former English professor, said, “I lived in the student halls for fifty years. This is the perfect place for me right now: it’s quiet, it’s just priests living here, there’s no interruptions—very peaceful. Life is comfortable here, we have everything we need.”
While Corby is now home to just priests, from 1913 to 1937 it was a student dormitory. Pressed for space, the university moved the priests to Columba Hall and put students in Corby. Father Ned Joyce, retired executive vice-president, is the only man who lived in Corby Erst as a student and now as a priest Father Joyce, who lived in Corby as a junior during the 1935-1936 academic year, said: “Back then room selection was based on grade point average, and my roommate and I had pretty good averages so we picked out what we thought was the best room in the hall. It was big but it was next to the chapel. So every morning at 6:00 our rector, a tough Irish priest named Ryan—we called him Tuffy Ryan—would come in and wake me up to go to morning mass whether
or not I wanted to go.”
Father Joyce has lived in Corby for over 40 years, which is the longest of any priest there; he said, “I came as a newly ordained priest in 1949 and since they didn’t put the newly ordained priests in the student halls, I moved into Corby. The next year I went to Oxford to study and when I came back I was prefect on the second floor of Morrissey for a year. But the next year I was made executive vice-president and I didn’t have any time to live in the residence hall so I moved back into Corby.”
Each priest has two rooms and a bathroom. The accommodations are not luxurious. In fact, they are no more than what a student has. Father Joyce said, “I just sleep there. I don’t have a T.V. or anything. My life was in my office.” He continued, “I would have loved to live with the students. Interaction with students was one of the reasons I became a priest. But my work meant that I didn’ t have time, and I needed to be close to the Main Building.”
As Father Joyce noted, interaction with the students is a large part of the Holy Cross priests’ work. Accordingly, of the 90 priests and brothers in the Corby community, the majority live outside Corby Hall. From the brothers in the fire station to the brother who lives in the athletic and convocation center, to the rectors of the student halls, more than sixty priests live outside of Corby. Even though they are outside the hall, all the priests consider Corby to be home. Father John Conley, who lives in Alumni Hall, said, “I get over there at least twice every day, sometimes more. I go for morning prayer and dinner and evening prayer. It’s home plate.”
Father Robert Moss, an admissions officer who also lives in Alumni Hall, echoed these sentiments: “We are members of a religious community and Corby is our religious house. It provides a chance to interact with the community. Living outside of Corby is like having a house with aremoved bedroom.” Father Conley said, “We have a friendly little community of priests here in Alumni, and the four of us get together once in while to talk. But Corby is the big house and it’s where I can sit down and have dinner with fellow priests, members of the community, whom I wouldn’t normally see.”
Both Father Conley and Father Moss said
they enjoyed being able to interact with students. Father Moss said, “When I came to Notre Dame my plan was to live in Corby, but I was put here in Alumni and I’m still' here—it’s been great.” Father Conley noted, “Sometimes it’s nice to be able to leave all the noise and activity of the hall and go to Corby to sit quietly and read. But I still enjoy and appreciate the contact with the students.”
For the Holy Cross Community, Corby is more than a place to meet and eat. The Corby Community is the extended family of each of priest and brother here. Father Joe Ross, rector of Morrissey Manor, said, “In a technical way, Corby is where we are all assigned, you don’t have to sleep there to be assigned there. But in an affective way, it is my family: it’s a place where people support you and challenge you and pray with you. It’s a place to be with people who know your soul.”
The General Constitutions of the Congregation of Holy Cross establish community life on the model of a family. Indeed, Father Basil Morreau, founder of the order, envisioned community life to be modeled after the life of the holy family. Father Ross said, “As we are a family there is much beauty in the relationship, but there are also difficulties. There are members of differing ages who have been formed in different periods of the Church. There are those who knew the Church before the Council and those who have known the Church only after the Council. But we are all together in finding the role of Christian leadership today.”
Just as a family has a father, the Corby Community has a religious superior. Father Paul Doyle, who is the father of the Corby family, said, “I am the pastor of a very special parish. I have the truly privileged role of helping good men to be better religious, to be better ministers and in the process, they all help me. I make sure that the members of the community are well and also that we have times and opportunities for them to come together as a family. I think that families that don’t come together to eat and pray cannot grow and cannot be unified.”
Part of the idea of being a family means that Corby Hall is the home for the priests on the campus. But part of the idea of being a
home is that it is a private place, and accordingly Corby Hall is a place for the priests of the campus, but not for everybody. Father Doyle said, “I can have a fellow priest to dinner here, but I can’t bring my mother or my brother. You welcome visitors into your home, but you don’t open you home up to the neighborhood all day.”
Father Ross said, “I have no effective privacy here in Morrissey. I don’t mean that in a bad way, it’s just that I have meetings in my room and students are in and out of here all the time. When I’m here I’m always sort of on call for students and what they may need. So all of us, not just me, but all of the community members need to have some place where we can go where it’s just us.
example: of ■ thd;
JdaiiW^
Dinner is not open for guests not because the room is sacrosanct, but when it’s just us, then the meal is really ours.” Father Tom McDermott, who lives in Morrissey, said, “Corby proper is like being a part of a tradition which started before you and will continue after you are gone. But very simply it is a place to relax and I’m grateful for that It’s a private place, a safe spot, a sign that I have a private life.”
Even though Corby Hall serves the Holy Cross community as its cloister, there are also occasions when the hall is open to guests and visitors. At different times, all of the seminarians from Morreau seminary are
invited for dinner, or all of the priests of the diocese are invited for dinner and a basketball game. Father Doyle said, “My inclination is toward openness. We have a tradition of inviting faculty guests to dinner once a semester, and I have extended that to twice a semester. And for the first time we are having students in as dinner guests when we invite the outgoing student leaders in to say thank you for their service over the past years.” Father Ross said of the greater openness of Corby, “I think it’s good for people to see our healthy community as an example of the way religious life can and should be. It’s like a good marriage: you celebrate it as holy and something to be admired, you don’t hide it. In the same way we shouldn’t hide our community.”
Above all else, the interpersonal relationships of the Corby community are what make it strong and cohesive. It is Corby Hall which facilitates the relationship. Wednesdays and Sundays are called community nights when all of the priests go to Corby for Mass and dinner together at once. Wednesday and Sunday are the days when all of the members of the family are together.
For each priest the experience of the Corby Community and Corby Hall is different, but each one acknowledges that Corby constitutes a family for all of them. Father Ross said, “I really enjoy the chance to meet with and learn from such incredible men as we have here, men like Charlie Carey, John Dunne, and Brother Valery.”
Father McDermott said, “It’s a wonderful sense of belonging and acceptance. My image of Corby Hall is as my family home and a place where I am always welcome.” Father Doyle said, “I like very much living in Corby Hall because I can be with and learn from living saints, men who are incredibly good and deeply committed. And I am edified to be able to serve them. Sometimes I have to get up in the middle of the night to drive someone to the hospital, but that is my gift of service.”
When Corby Hall was built one hundred years ago, it was intended to house the priests of the campus. In the course of a century it has become the hub of a community and a loving home for a large family. Father McDermott said, “Corby is gratitude for what I have been given and a symbol of how much more I want.”	□

Information, Opinion and Innuendo
Oh joy — it’s Valentine’s Day. (Canyon hear the cynicism dripping from my printed voice?) The Gipper hates Valentines Day, and as promised, he brings you:
14 REASONS TO HATE VALENTINE'S DAY
14. U93 starts playing even more annoying power ballads.
13. The color red doesn’t look good on pale people (and most of us persons of non-color are pale right now).
12. Observer personals get even more stupid than usual.
11. Roses are expensive,
Carnations too,
Candy is fattening, Oh, what to get you!?!
10. Shiny happy people get shinier, grumpy depressive types get grumpier, and those in the middle suffer both of them.
9. The restaurants are always packed.
8. So are the movie theaters.
7. Dinner and a movie is a dull date, but what else is there to do? And you have to think of something, don’t you?
6. Arrogant sportscasters interrupt basketball games to propose to their “significant others” on national T.V.
5. SYR commissioners always get the bright idea to schedule a dance around this time of year — all at the same time.
4. Overworked flower delivery boys get in car accidents all over town.
3. Some anal-retentive cardiologist always shows up on TV to tell kids that hearts aren’t really shaped that way.
2. Candy conversation hearts neverexpress what anyone is really thinking.
...and the Number One reason....
1. Nobody wants to be anyone’s “boyfriend” or “girlfriend” anymore — it’s just not P.C.
“GIPP” LANDERS?
The Gipp usually refuses to give advice to the lovelorn, but since it’s Valentine’s Day, he’s making an exception for a selfdoubting freshwoman. This young resident of Pasquerilla East asks, “Why are freshman guys so afraid of commitment? It seems all they want to do is hook up. It makes us fell so used and betrayed. Is there something that I am doing wrong? Or is it just that the guys here are all so shallow? I don’t understand, maybe it’s just the party scene and I should start looking for guys in the library or something.”
Oh, the idealistic days of youth. Dear reader, the Gipp hates to warn you that it is not going to get any better during your four years here. You will be lucky to find anyone who is interested in more than a brief hormonal release, ever. And that goes for both men and women. Yes, it may be true that freshmen have more hormones to the gallon than senior men and that the maturity levels are slightly different, but not enough to make that much of a difference. Most people are afraid of commitment, so don’t get your hopes up. Ifyoufindsomeone.be happy. If you don’t, don’t worry, and enjoy “hooking up” without too much guilt You have plenty of time.
Whew. Thank you, Ann Landers, for that
relationship advice. The Gipp just isn't cut out for being an advice columnist.
GOOD ADVICES
A reader found a great little book from the Notre Dame archives which might be of interest to readers. The brochure, entitled “The Notre Dame University Physical Directory” by P.J. Weiss, is a general fitness guide for students which dates back to 1902. (If you’re looking for it in the library, the catalog number is LD4107.P569, but the Gipp has it right now. And it’s checked out under someone else’s name, so don’t go trying to find out who I am!)
This guide has some gem-like quotations on general health. If you need to know how to sleep right, eatright or exercise all of your major muscle groups, this book offers some wisdom from the Neolithic Age which you might find usful.
For your amusement, the Gipp has culled the following from the section entitled “Sleep”:
(1) The best time to sleep is at night.
(5) You need eight hours of uninterrupted sleep in every twenty-four.
(9)	Dispense with curtains or draperies around the bed.
(10)	Havea window open at least two inches every night, no matter how cold the weather may be. Arrange this so the draught does not strike you.
(14)	Each person should occupy a separate room, or at least a separate bed.
Coming next week: “The Handyman” dumps some dirt. Contact the Gipp through the usual channels.

Does Valentine’s Day EXIST on this Campus?
Specific dorms, off-campus stores and students try to get everyone else into the spirit of love
by Stephanie Goldman
Okay, be honest How many people (excluding those with serious ball-and-chain action) actually have an official “Valentine’s Day date?” Especially on this campus.
At Notre Dame, gender relations, or the lack thereof, is always a hot topic of discussion, especially with the “Holiday of Love” arriving this weekend. With the university’s efforts to keep the sexes separate through single sex dorms, parietals and few dating options like S YRs, it is a surprise that Valentine’s Day is even celebrated here.
Really, Valentine’s Day is quite possibly the most elitist holiday in the league of Americanized, commercialized celebrations. It ranks right up there on the list with Secretary’s Week. And, unless you’re a secretary, or in this case, a Valentine, who really cares?
Yet, Valentine’s Day afflicts everyone. It would not even be that bad except that no one, during the entire month of February, can escape the impending pink and red hearts of doom. They are everywhere: on
cards, as stickers, as little decorations for the wall. These hearts are even hugged by cuddly white teddy bears that deliver messages of devotion like “I love you beary much” scrawled in imitation felt.
Moreover, no one can forget the heartshaped candies that come in different pastel
7; or Winter ■ 7Oh Valentine’s Eve arid findyorir 7 ■ V‘‘s^eethe'^
■ at thestroke of v 7'.
7;	i777v 7
colors with similar messages, like “Kiss Me,” “I Luv U,” “Be Mine” and “Dare Me,” written in carcinogenic red food dye. Too bad they do not even taste edible. Could this candy be made from colored chalk slivers
leftonblackboardledges? With all thehype, it seems that Cupid has definitely gone psycho.
But, for those who were lucky enough to have bagged a babe for that most wonderful Jour d’Amour, and for those who would like to try their hand at winning the one they have been admiring from afar, there are plenty of original and fun opportunities around campus this Valentine’s Day that are sure to please your precious.
. With a sensational idea called “Snap-a-Scam,” those precocious Pangbom girls have stumbled onto a revolutionary way to let that dream-date know that he or she has a secret admirer. For just $2, the gals will take out their cameras and get an autographed picture of that number one scope. The key.is that the objects of your affections need never know who you are — unless you tell them! Sign up in either North or South dining hall by tomorrow, to get in on this phrenetic photo frenzy. The bonus: the pictures will be delivered right to your door on Valentine’s Day.
Another cool way to let your would-be lover know you exist is to buy him or her a

flower from Pasquerilla West’s carnation sale. These floral treats are color-coded so they convey just the right message. Now, everyone knows that red means “I love you” and that pink symbolizes “like,” but the P.W. girls have taken this one step further. A yellow carnation can be sent to express friendship or a white one to say, "I’d like to get to know you better.” And, they even have these flowers in green! Wonder what that is supposed to mean? For only one dollar, one can send a flower and a message to be delivered to their sweetheart, friend or scope on February 14.
As for those who have already managed to score a date for Valentine’s Day, here’s a great way to impress him or her for free. (One has got to be on the ball for this.) It is the Knott Hall Medallion Hunt, going on the weekbefore Valentine’s Day. Ifyouarethe first one to discover where the medallion is hidden, you will win a dinner for four at

Of course, there are also many cards made

domer-dating causes a bit of nervousness.
There are also a few SYRs planned for Saturday, February 13, Valentine’s eve, and a Winter Ball that predicts everyone will find their sweethearts at the stroke of midnight. These dances should put everyone in the mood for a little romance, dancing and Valentine’s Day celebrating.
Besides actual holiday dating, there is a popular and easy way to send love home and around the world. Flowers and candy are typical, but cards are the ticket to sharing true emotions.
Shoebox Greetings from Hallmark offer a few examples that cover the whole span of relatives, spouses, sweethearts and acquaintances.
child — But I sure came closer than those other misfits I call siblings. Happy Valentines Day!”
There are specific cards available for each member of the family. For "Brother,” this one said, "If you should get something red and heart-shaped on Valentine’s Day — May it not be a zit”
"Sister” as well, is not left out of the holiday hubbub. Her card reads, "Sister, you have what every guy wants on Valentine’s Day—Recent pictures of me!”
A good option for a miscellaneous acquaintance Valentine is this card: “Dear Valentine, as you go through life, remember, money does not bring happiness! — The beer truck brings happiness!”
Finally, for that special someone, there are a wide variety of humorous, serious and encouraging Valentines available. However, before that perfect card is found, remember, Valentine’s Day would not be the same without the classic tried-and-true poem: "Roses are red, Violets are blue, Sugar is sweet, and so are you!”
Hopefully, everyone will take part in some of the wild and wacky events on campus that attempt to bring the spirit of romance to Notre Dame. Those creative ideas are great alternatives to the usual chocolates and roses, and originality may be just the thing to catch that Valentine. □

It is the new recycling center at two locations in the Huddle. Now students and visitors can sort their garbage into different bins marked “Waste,” “Clear Glass,” “Blue/Greeri Glass,” “Polystyrene,” “Aluminum” and “News Print.” A new, improved, environmentally-conscious campus is starting to take shape.	-
The crusade to heighten the student body’s environmental awareness began about three years ago. When Dave Prentkowski became the director of Notre
Dame Food Services. At the time there was,
and still is, an effort being pushed forward by Recyclin’ Irish, Students for Environmental Action (SEA) and other environmental organizations on campus to make some positives
changes. Prentkowski “saw that they needed some support.”
Aided by Dave Brietbach, theNorth Dining Hall assistant production manager, Prentkowski decided to emphasize envi-
ronmental concerns within the department
Sophomore Mike Vassallo stops to do his part In the aluminum recycling efforts In the Huddle.
He said, “We started looking at whatkind of
products we use that could be recycled to establish a means.” A recycling center was not a novel idea to Prentkowski, who came from the University of Michigan where
they recycle a considerable amount of their waste.
Before the recycling center was constructed, the Huddle switched from using wax paper cups to polystyrene plates and
cups to aid the recycling efforts. “The big
gest challenge was to find out what could be recycled,”	said
Prentkowski.
“Overall, the cost [of construction] wasn’t significant,” he added. The recycling project was funded by Huddle revenues.
There is also an effort being made among LaFortune offices to recycle white paper—typing paper, computer paper, stationery and photocopied paper. There are now collection containers and recycling guidelines
in every office.
So what happens to the trash after the public sorts it in an orderly manner? The Superior Waste Systems company of South Bend, picks it up for free, once a day, six days

a week. Prentkowski said, “Superior Waste takes it back to their site where they bale it up and sell it to recycling centers.”
After much deliberation, their efforts seem to have paid off, and the Huddle can now boast of a superior organized recycling center. However, students have mixed reactions.
J.P. Thole, an off-campus junior, said, “It blocks my line of sight, but otherwise I think I’ve used it twice since the beginning of the semester.” As a native of Brazil, he says that he is not used to a recycling system and that he does not recycle at home.
Sophomore Aoife Lyons, a Farley resident, said, “it’s awesome because there is a lot of glass that people buy in the drugstore [that was not recycled] so it was a shame that we didn’t have it before.” Lyons uses it frequently for newspapers, and she devotedly recycles at her dormitory, too, where stations are not set up in one convenient location, as at the Huddle. She also thinks that an expansion of the recycling center across campus would be a good idea.”
Off-campus senior Vaneeta Montiero’s response to the new recycling efforts are also positive. “I really like it It is not that much trouble to use it. Too many people are just using the one trash
can, and it only takes about ten extra seconds to sort your trash. I think this should have been done before now, and I hope everyone starts to use it more,” she said.
Another senior who frequents the Huddle said, “It’s not that big of adeal. The first time you use the new system you have no clue where everything should go, but after that it is much easier.” She continued, “I hope that these efforts are productive. More people should be recycling, especially in LaFortune, where just about everything you use like cups, paper and bottles can be re
cycled.”
Unfortunately, not everyone is pleased. Some complain that it takes too long to dispose of their trash, while others pessimistically think that the recycling center just will not make much of a difference.
“It takes me about ten minutes longer to throw away all my trash after lunch,” an off-campus senior said. “I know that recycling is important, but it just seem s more inconvenient than helpful when I am trying to get to my class and I have a Coke bottle, a newspaper, plastic utensils and a paper plate on my tray that I have to take the time to sort out and throw away.”
One student predicted, “Once everybody gets the hang of sorting their trash, and starts to make a concerted effort to recycle, it will
After lunch, juniors Mike Seelinger and Pat McCullough, can sort their trash Into the Huddle's new recycling bins.

definitely be more productive.” He said, “Hopefully, it won’t take forever for recycling to become a habit among students.”
With the growing recognition and success of the Huddle’s recycling center, Prentkowski can see some long term plans for a center being set up in the basement of the library.
Although these centers may seem to be a bleak means of assistance in the face of a global environmental tragedy, it does make a difference, and as Lyons said, “It should have been done a long time ago.” □

SURPRISE!
The Irish have overcome inexperience and a lack of depth to compete well against the nation's sixth toughest basketball schedule
by Nik Mathews
One revealing statistic concerning the 1992-93 Notre Dame men’s basketball team is that the Irish are 1-10 when their opponents shoot better than 40 percent from the floor over the course of a game. Because Notre Dame has struggled offensively this season, the only Irish wins have come when Notre Dame has played tough man-to-man defense consistently from start to finish.
Unfortunately for Irish fans, Notre Dame has had a hard time putting forth consistent efforts because the team is characterized by inexperience and a lack of depth. Often, opponents of the Irish have had more size, speed and strength so that starting Irish players become tired and get into foul trouble early. This problem, which is as much a test of psychological endurance as physical fitness, has plagued Notre Dame since it tipped off its season at Loyola in December. As a result, all of the Irish wins have come down to the wire but many of the Irish losses have been blowouts. A nine-point margin of victory in a 72-63 win over LaSalle has been the largest this far for Notre Dame. The Irish have had to scrap for every point and play with heart and determination in order to overcome mismatches, pull off their last-second wins and hover around the .500 mark.
The return of forward Monty Williams has been integral in the surprising success of the Irish. Williams has been impressive since taking the floor for the first time in two years following being sidelined with a heart condition. He has been carrying a great deal of the work load for the team, averaging nearly a “double-double” with 17.4 points and 9.4 rebounds per game. Williams might best be remembered for his one handed alley-oop slam dunk over Grant Hill against Duke last Saturday. Following that play, NBC Sports play-by-play man Quinn Buckner shouted, “Wow! This kid has what it takes to be playing in the NBA some day.”
Another pleasant surprise has been the emergence of Ryan Hoover as a major contributor and court leader. Hoover has proved to be a serious threat from beyond the three-point arc and has also made his presence felt with an increasing number of assists since being moved to the point guard position. In this, his freshman year, Hoover is threatening to break the Notre Dame single-season record for three-

point field goals attempted and made with a 32 for 82 effort from trey land thus far. Hoover already owns Notre Dame’s single-game record with a 7 for 13 performance in a 71-66 win over Dayton earlier in the season. Also, after a mere four assists in his first nine
I
games, Hoover has steadily bettered his numbers by dishing out over 30 assists while acting as floor general. Although Hoover has been prone to making turnovers when facing a full-court press, he has the raw talent and the will to win that will mold him into a premier point guard in the future.
Together, Williams and Hoover have accounted for 43.4 percent of the Irish points scored this season. Although the two have been the most consistent offensive players on the team, it seems as though different players have unexpectedly stepped up at crucial times to pull out a win. Take, for example, the recent play of the virtually unknown Jason Williams. Williams, a sophomore who totaled only 17 minutes and no points as a freshman, enjoyed the best day of his collegiate career against Dayton with ten points and five assists, including a key three-pointer with 37 seconds remaining and the shot clock expiring to put the game out of reach for the Flyers.

clutch times this season. Boyer’s jumper against New Orleans delivered the 45-43 win in the first round of the Sugar Bowl Tournament, which the Irish went on to ■ win by beating St. Joseph’s in the finals by a score of 68-65. The junior guard’s free throws against Loyola and Boston College in the final seconds, were instrumental in those respective wins of 52-50 and 73-70.
Part-time starter Jon Ross has also heated up of late, including a career-high 21 points in a 70-56

quality minutes as well an additional scoring threat.
The Irish have performed particularly well in games against powerhouses Michigan, Duke and Indiana. Playing with tenacity, they attacked the boards well enough to stay with the heralded Fab Five and defending champion Blue Devils for a half and took the currently top-ranked Hoosiers to the buzzer, losing in their third game of
Junior center Jon Ross, after seeing more playing time this
the season by a score of 75-70.
One factor contributing to the intensity of the players has come from the stands, as the “Thunderdome” has become a reality. The positioning of the student section behind the basket coupled with MacLeod’s exciting running attack have combined for numerous capacity crowds complete with rowdy, shirtless and painted faithful fans.
Few thought that the Irish would be able to compete well this season, but they have defied the odds and disproved the skeptics. Notre Dame has indeed enjoyed some surprising success so far this season but will continue to take some lumps throughout the remainder of the season. Inexperience and lack of depth will probably continue to plague the Irish, as will their schedule which ratings guru Jeff Sagarin rates as the sixth most difficult in Division I. However, with scrap and determination from the players, the screaming fans behind the basket will continue to be treated to some exciting bas-

A Rough
Road Home
After a four-game losing streak away from the ACC, the Irish women's basketball team returns to South Bend looking to improve its record
by Peg Ward
During the month of January there was a notable absence from the campus of Notre Dame. Was Mary missing from atop the Golden Dome? Of course not What about the cold and snowy weather? No, that still remained in South Bend. What, then, was missing?
It was the Notre Dame women’s basketball team, which played eight of its ten games on the road that month. The Irish are finally back playing at the ACC. If there is one phrase that could summarize how Coach Muffet McGraw and the players feel about coming back to the Thunderdome, it would be “Home Sweet Home.”
After winning four conference games in a row, the Notre Dame women’s basketball team embarked upon a gruelling road trip in late January. The Irish lost all four games, including two to conference rivals Evansville and Butler.
“These were definitely our four toughest road games, and they were all in the course of about a week,” commented McGraw. “They’re out of the way now, though, and we feel pretty good about the rest of the schedule. Idon’tseeanyreason why we can’tbeat any of the teams we still have to play.”
For now the Irish are looking to take advantage of a homestand that will carry them onto victory in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference tournament later
on this season.
The Notre Dame women’s basketball team has been led this year by senior guard Coquese Washington, who tops the team in both steals and assists. In 61-58 win over LaSalle on February 4, Washington recorded six steals to assume sole possession of the Notre Dame women’sall-time steals record. Her 10.1 point scoring average hovers near the team high as well. Washington has managed to turn out several stellar performances this season, despite the fact that her surgically reconstructed knee has diminished her practice time.
Said McGraw, “Coquese is a great senior leader, .and she is playing in a tremendous amount of pain. To be honest, she really can’t practice that much. She didn’t even practice before the DePaul or Evansville games.”
Perhaps the true impact of Washington’s play, however, cannot be measured in the tangibles of points, steals, and assists. Her most valuable contribution may be the dedication and determination she exhibits on the court.
“I try to step up and be a calming influence when we’re getting too excited and rally the team when we need it. Hopefully I can do this in each game throughout the rest of the season,” said Washington.
The Fighting Irish have a wealth of other experienced, and talented guards, including juniors Sherri Orlosky and Kara Leary, and sophomore Audrey Gomez. Orlosky is the pure shooter of the team and has averaged about 11 points per contest throughout most of the season. She scored a team high 24 points
in a loss to LaSalle earlier in the season. In last week’s rematch between the two teams at the ACC, Orlosky helped avenge the loss and provided a spark off the bench with several key baskets that sealed the victory.
Kara Leary, meanwhile, attracted a lot of attention last year, as the former walk-on who earned a scholarship by lighting up the ACC with spectacular play at both ends of the court. Leary has surpassed her 81 point scoring total of the J991-92 campaign and can provide the Fighting Irish with both an outside shooting threat and defensive toughness. This year, Leary has shared time at the point guard position with Washington and Gomez.
For Audrey Gomez, this season has already been a triumph of sorts. Last year, the highly recruited freshman’s season was cut short when she suffered a knee injury that led to reconstructive surgery in the offseason. The road to recovery has been slow but steady and she has been seeing a greater amount of playing time at the point guard position. “Audrey is really improving and playing very well. She’s very smart on offense and her shooting has really improved. Audrey had an excellent game against Loyola at home a few weeks ago, ” commented McGraw.
In that winning effort, Gomez keyed the Irish with a season high ten points and four assists. Together, Washington, Orlosky, Leary and Gomez provide the Irish with a talented core of backcourt players.
While the Irish have an abundance of
J
adept ballhandlers, their strength can also be seen in the powerhouse play of forwards
Letitia Bowen and Kristin Knapp. Coach McGraw needed few words to describe the play of Bowen: “Our best player. She is outstanding in every way.’
Bowen, a sophomore, is a force underneath the basket and leads the team in both scoring and rebounds. She has hovered near the top 20 in national rebounding averages, and has accomplished this despite the fact that she has been hampered by a heel injury for much of the season. According to Coach McGraw, Bowen, like Washington, is often unable to practice with the team. When game time arrives, though, Bowen is often the “go-to” player, whether its scoring points inside or wiping the glass clean on the defensive boards.
Joining Bowen underneath the boards is Kristin Knapp, whose impressive and consistent play has been a source of stability for the Irish. Having started in all but two games so far this season, the junior forward scored a team high 16 points against LaSalle in the February 4 match-up, helping break a four-game losing streak. She currently averages a little over nine points per game and is the second leading rebounder for the Irish. Knapp’s prowess in the paint is complemented by a soft shooting touch, a quality that is rare among post players.
The Fighting Irish have also been propelled by the play of veteran players Tootie Jones, Andrea Alexander and Majenica Rupe. Jones ajunior forward, has started in three games this season and scored a
career high 20 points against Georgia earlier
in the year. While Alexander, ajunior, has
seen limited action this season, she can often be counted on to provide the team with hard-nose defensive play. Senior center Majenica Rupe is also a member of the
women’s volleyball team and just recently joined her teammates on the basketball squad. She is already contributing with her rebounding and shotblocking capabilities. One notable absence on the team this year is senior Dionne Smith. Smith, unfortunately,
has been sidelined for the season with a knee problem that she has had to deal with
throughout her college career.
One of the most pleasant surprises of the season has been the play of the Fighting Irish’s first-year players. “I am extremely happy with the play of the freshmen. We have an outstanding recruiting class. Both Carey Poor and Stacy Fields, in particular, have been playing extremely well,” said
Senior guard Coquese Washington tallied six steals during the Irish women’s game against LaSalle on February 4 taking over the Notre Dame all-time steals record.
McGraw. Both players have wasted little
time in making big contributions to the team.
Poor, an all-state forward from Ohio, sees herself fitting in well with the team. “I’m finding my role on the team and gaining more responsibilities. I think my play has
really been improving.”
Stacy Fields is a Third Team All-American guard out of Minnesota, and has broken into the starring lineup in over half the games played this season. Her impact on the team is best summed up by Fields herself.
“1 know that I’m not a big point scorer, but I do know that I can make a contribution by
going out and getting a couple of floor bums in a game and playing with intensity. I’m glad that Coach McGraw is giving me the chance to prove myself,” she said.
Fields is currently averaging nearly eight points a game, and her six-point, five-rebound, and four-assist performance against LaSalle on February 4 is indicative of the balanced attack that she brings to the team.
Two other freshmen, Susan Atchinson and Jenny Layden, both guards, have seen limited action this season. Atchinson has played in eight games, while Layden, a walk-on, has been sidelined for much of the season with a knee injury.
The future of the Notre Dame women’s basketball team is certainly bright with these talented freshmen, but, as McGraw reminds her players, “We’re looking to establish ourselves now during this season as well.”
So far this season has been filled with ups and downs, and as McGraw said, “We’ve been working very hard, but we’re still a young team. After such a long road trip, we definitely need to get our confidence back.” Perhaps the current homestand is the remedy.
Last season, Notre Dame carried a 11-15 record into the conference tournament and tallied several upset wins to earn an automatic bid to the big show, the NCAA tournament. This year, Notre Dame plays host to the Midwestern Collegiate Conference tournament, which takes place March 8-10. The team claims to be taking one game at a time, but there is
no doubt that the Irish are excitedly antici
paring the tourney.
Said Fields, “We’re looking forward to the MCC tournament This is the first time we’re hosting it here at the ACC and we feel that this will be a very big thing for Notre
Dame women’s basketball.”
If the recent wins against LaSalle and Duquesne are any sign that a turnaround has occurred, the Irish women’s basketball team will be a force to be reckoned with come tournament rime.	□

The Foreigner
Cavanaugh Hall Takes to the Stage for the Eleventh Year in a Row
by Pete Dedman
he Cavanaugh Hall players are once again bringing a fresh performance to the Washington Hall Stage. Since auditions
last November, members of the cast and crews havebeen putting together their rendition of Larry Shue’s The Foreigner, a comedy first produced in Milwaukee, WI, and then enjoying Off-off Broadway success.
The two-act play, described on handbills as “a comedy of intrigue, adventtire and amour,” takes place at Betty Meeks ’ Fishing Lodge Resort, in Tilghman County, Geor
gia, U.S.A. Chip Highsmith plays Sergeant ‘Froggy’ LeSueur, a British soldier visiting the States. Froggy always stays at Betty Meek’s, because it reminds him of the B&B’s back in England. On this trip, though, he’s brought along his shy friend, Charlie Baker (Tyler Hower), whose deathly fear of conversing with strangers is compounded by the fact that Froggy must leave him alone at the Lodge for three days while he goes out on orders.
The comic element of the play is placed into fecund ground as Froggy tries to alleviate his friend’s phobia. Upon leaving Charlie at the inn, Froggy tells the owner Betty Meeks (Tracy Crinion) that Charlie should not be spoken to because he speaks no English. “You mean, he’s a FOREIGNER?” Betty exclaims, excited, since she’s never met anyone outside of Tilghman County before, aside from Froggy himself. Charlie reluctantly goes along with the plan, and what follows is a raucous and insightful exploration into the various ways people react to others who are “different” from themselves, as seen from the perspectives of both the visitor to the South, Charlie and his narrow-minded hosts.
While uncomfortable living under pretense, Charlie soon finds his disguise to be
useful in helping Betty. The Rev. David Marshall Lee (Tim Mooney) is to marry exdebutante Catherine Simms. With her money, he and his redneckpal Owen Musser (Rob Schlosser, in an especially fiery and riotous performance) plan to buy Betty’s Lodge, so they can establish headquarters for the Kin Klux Klan. Of course, as they assume Charlie is oblivious to their calculating schemes, they talk freely in his presence. With the help of Catherine’s rather dim brother Ellard (Pete Goyer), Charlie spends his short stay trying to save the Lodge from a sinister takeover.
Cavanaugh’s performance of The Foreigner opened last night, but that doesn’t mean it’s too late to see it. There will be performances both tonight and tomorrow at 8:10. Tickets are $3 for students, and $4 for non-students, with all proceeds going towards the Andy Sowder Scholarship Fund. Sowder was the president of Cavanaugh Hall in 1979, when he died suddenly of spinal meningitis. A fund was set up by Cavanaugh Rector Emeritus Fr. Matthew Miceli; The Foreigner is the eleventh annual hall production to benefit the cause. This year’s play was put together under the skilled direction of sophomores Jen Andre and Tony Leonardo and produced by John Ruskusky, who wishes only that he’s able to get some shuteye in the near future.	□

Ah! Valentine’s Day is finally here.
Boy, what a woman’s holiday. First the guy goes out, racks his brain and drops big money on the “perfect gift,” not expect-. ing much in return. He feels a little queasy because the fifty bucks he spent on the twelve samples of red fauna could have purchased four cases of pretty good beer. He soon overcomes this sinking feeling because, well, he might get some. Wrong! Everyone knows that few girls are ever satisfied, happy or in love on Valentines Day— no man could be romantic enough to pull that off. But please go out and get that someone special a gift—your life may depend on it.
A Sinister Arab Parrot with a New York Accent
As you all have probably have heard by now Aladdin has been attacked by numerous American-Arab groups and scholars for its insensitive presentation of Mid-East peoples. The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (AAADC) has taken offense to the opening song - of Aladdin, especially the lyric: “Where they cut off your ear if they don’t like your face/ It’s barbaric, but hey it’s home.”
Leila Gorchev, the group’s spokesperson, found the song extremely stereotypical. “It sets the tone for the whole movie, the idea that Arabs are somehow barbaric and brutal,” she told The Washington Post.
The AAADC has also took offense that all the evil, violent characters in the film had strong accents and were Arabian. (If memory serves me right, all the characters were Arabs, even the hero, and one of the most evil, was played by Gilbert Godfrey without any accent) They were really unhappy with the character Jaffar, who was extremely vicious, murderous and hateful.
The AAADC has sparked a world-wide debate on Disney’s movie. I have read
letters to the editor of the L. A.Times, The Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune and The Toronto Star. Casey Kasem, of Lebanese decent, told the L. A. Times that he found that Aladdin was engaging in “gratuitous Arab bashing.” Professor Shaheen of the University of Southern Illinois displayed that Aladdin was just another example of how “finding a humane, heroic Arab in any aspect of popular culture is about as easy as finding a needle in a sandbar.”
Now other Arab-American groups are enraged with Mattel toy company’s line of dolls inspired by the movie. Critics claim that the plastic figures are not dark enough, they show lack of sensitivity and they aid a perpetuation of Arab stereotypes.
ENOUGH!!! But if everyone must find fault with everything and be politically correct to no end I have compiled a list of the abuses found in other Disney movies.
Beauty and the Beast'. All people of French descent, take offense. Lumiere, with his deep French accent, is a male chauvinist and dabbles in sexual harassment And Gaston, he must tame his act. He is giving a bad name to all of France with his excessive drinking and spitting.
Peter Pan'. Can you believe Disney’s insensitivity? The major villain of the film is physically disabled. A hook for a hand and a heart of stone—what an unfair portrayal of the handicapped.
Snow White'. Dwarfs glorified as part of the working class, playing a subservient role to the people of average height And the wicked witch, I still can’t believe that she is at her evillest when appearing as an elderly woman. I call for the aged to demand an apology for this unfair representation of their class. Go, AARP, go!

Oh~Other Campuses
Living with cows, playing monopoly, and driving a hot dog:
News of the Bizarre from the nation's universities
Too sexy for Utah
All right, so Utah isn’tknown for its liberality, and you wouldn’t go to Brigham Young if you really wanted to have fun. But even the University of Utah (probably the most happening place in Salt Lake City) is cracking down on a billboard advertising their very own gymnastics team. The billboard features gymnast Aimee Trepanier posing in a black leotard. The Chronicle of Higher Education writes that critics feel that the ad uses sex to sell tickets to gymnastic meets; defenders think it qualifies as art (Oh no, here comes Mapplethorpe again!) The Athletics Director pulled the billboard and television commercials for the team because he thinks the images portrayed should be more athletic. Trying telling that to the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue models.

Not just fun and games
Notre Dame accounting majors take note. Sstudents at Kansas University get to play Monopoly as part of their Business 240 class in an attempt to “learn accounting in a more exciting atmosphere,” reports the University Daily Kansan. (It’s not saying much about accounting in the real world if you have to play a board game to make it more exciting!) Actually, the game in class is not even as fun as
regular Monopoly, because students have to keep track of every transaction they make, and the “Chance” and “Community Chest” cards have been replaced with “more realistic” accounting transactions. I don’t know, buying Baltic Avenue for a mere $60 still seems a little unrealistic to me.
Hotdogging on the Highways
Every summer, 12 lucky college students are chosen out of a pool of over 1000 applicants for a chance to drive cross-country in the Oscar Mayer, Inc., Wienermobile, a 25-foot, V-6, hot dog-shaped vehicle. The Wienermobile, also nicknamed a “Wieniebago” and a “Lamborwienie,” travels across the nation to various fairs, sporting events and celebrations. The College Press Service story, as reprinted in The Creightonian, interviewed driver Tim Young, who gotpulled over for speeding by aLos Angeles Police Officer. Young said, “What I drive is faster than a semi but slower than a Corvette. I wasn’t the fastest car out there, I was the fastest hot dog.”
Worse than dorm life
You’re sick of your tiny rooms, having no heat on cold winter mornings and parietals. Well, you can be happy you are not living in a bam at Penn State. The Weekly Collegian recently did a feature on the agronomy and the dairy and animal science majors who, literally, live in bams just a floor above a herd of co ws. S tarring work at 5:30 a.m., shoveling manure, and staying up all night with cows that are sick or giving birth are the regular duties of the few students who choose to live in the Dairy Bam Complex in State College. Another drawback is the 45-minute walk to the heart of campus and having to go to classes in soiled clothes. So much for a normal college experience.

Flirting, Notre Dame Style
,tc
\
by Ann Lillie
T t’s everywhere you look. In the dining A hall, the library, at dances, in your classes: flirting. Ah yes, you say to yourself, Notre Dame and SMC women always seem to be batting their eyes, throwing enticing . smiles, and flashing feigned looks of admiration at some unsuspecting Joe Domer. Time out I wasn’t talking about female flirts—I was referring to the guys. That’s right, male flirts. Now don’t choke on your meatless baked ziti. I’m not going to generalize and arrogantly say that all Notre Dame men flirt the same way. They don’t As a matter of fact, there are three very distinct types of male flirts here at Notre Dame: Macho Mikes, Slick Ricks, and Tender Teds. Hey, don’t get me wrong. All three groups share a common goal to, as a Macho Mike might say, “bag some babes.” But of course, that’s where the similiarities end...
Macho Mike’s flirting technique revolves around his three favorite words: “me,” “myself,” and “I.” Since all women feel an uncontrollable attraction to him (all women?), Macho Mike focuses his flirting around his muscles and athletic ability. Strutting through the dining hall in a pair of strategically ripped jeans and a t-shirt (so what if it’s twenty degrees outside? The “babes” want to see his body!) Macho Mike—in his loud, obnoxious, loving way—snaps his fingers at a woman before casually leaning his body across her table. And if she’s really lucky, Macho Mike tells her to “call me” and departs with a “later." Of course, after the woman calls and hears
his affectionate answering machine (“Leave a message.”), she remembers he’s on his way to work out Now this is an absolute rule! Macho Mike is always, always on his way to work out. Always. After all, he’s a rugged, Brute aftershave, rap music kind of guy, and his technique of showing himself off attracts just the right king of hood ornament, I mean, woman.
Although Slick Rick shares Macho Mike’s unbelievably large ego, Slick Rick is wise enough to know that the way to woo the woman is through flattery and charm. Sharply dressed in khaki pants, a nice oxford, and loafers, Slick Rick re-defines the word smooooooth. Need proof of his flirting? Walking to class one day, Katie O’Domer detects the slight odor of Drakkar Noir or Polo in the air. Suddenly, Slick Rick saunters to her side, slips his arm around her shoulders, and affectionately greets her with
“hi honey,” “hello sweetheart,” or “hey gorgeous.” Slick Rick drips with enough syrup to make a person physically ill. Of course, Katie O’Domer doesn’t mind. Obviously, SlickRick—a guy who brings roses “justfor the heck of it,” listens to jazz (jazz?), dances like he’s watched one too many hours of MTV, and says good-bye with “stay beautiful”—attracts a woman who likes to be awed.
If you asked a Notre Dame or SMC woman to describe Tender Ted, she’d probably smile and say he’s “such a sweet guy” or he’s “everybody’s friend.” With such an aggressive image, ahem, it’s often difficult to discern his flirting technique. Nonetheless, Tender Ted does flirt!...he’s just rather indirect about it Instead of flexing his muscles like Macho Mike or drowning a girl in compliments like Slick Rick, Tender Ted depends on his sincere manner and natural smile to win a girl’s heart. Casually dressed in his favorite sweater and jeans and smelling faintly of Eternity, Tender Ted is easy to pick out on the quad. S tolling along with his hands in his pockets, he’s probably laughing and teasing an amused companion. OK, so Tender Ted often ends up with more friends than girlfriends...eventually, someday, (we’re praying for you, Tender Ted), his pleasant personality will win someone’s heart.
So there you have it. Notre Dame’s male flirts. Ask for one by name.	□
Anne Lillie is a sophomore who hopes Slick Rick remembers roses for Katie O’Domer on Valentines Day.

Try Something Different This Summer
by Julie Longstreth
Julie Longstreth is a senior from Pasquerilla West.
anted: Freshmen, sophomores and juniors V V tired of the same old summer jobs and interested in an experience that will bring something different and challenging each day.
While waiting tables or selling clothes day after day may seem exciting, the Summer Service Project (SSP) allows current undergraduates to spend eight weeks sharing their talents and enthusiasm with a wide variety of people, from children to teens to adults. Pre-professional majors can gain experience working in hospitals and clinics while future lawyers might work with a legal services agency.
Even if you are headed for the corporate world or graduate school, a SSP can open your eyes to the realities of the world and give meaning to the academic experiences at Notre Dame. Senior Shannon Fay, who worked at the Home of the Sparrow Interfaith Shelter in McHenry, IL, stated, “All I can is say is that this project goes beyond what one can learn in a classroom.”
A SSP provides you with the opportunity to work with those in your community or travel to a different city or state, depending on your interests. You can spend a summer in Hilton Head, Southern California or even in South Bend! Each project is unique and presents different challenges as well as the chance to work with groups of people with whom you’ve had little or no previous contact. However, the summer isn’t spent feeling sorry for the needy, the so-called “other half.” You help your neighbor, those who may actually become friends.
“I arrived in Charleston wanting to help ‘the poor’ and left feeling as though I had accomplished something very different and much more rewarding. I had helped my brothers and sisters who were in need,” said junior S heila Camillus, who worked at Our Lady of Mercy Outreach Center Neighborhood House in Charleston.SC.
Some might object to the project because of a lack of previous experience or because they want a summer internship. The major qualifications for the project are an open mind and the desire to experience
something different At the project site, you will
receive the training needed for your position.
In addition, the SSP, in many ways, becomes an internship due to the hands on experience and the responsibility you undertake during the eight week program. It’s truly an educational experience in that you learn as much or more than you teach. “The project is far-reaching for it has changed the way I look and perceive things now, said junior Kjirsten Hanson who worked at the Stanford Home for Children in Sacramento, CA. It’s not something you’ll soon forget regardless of your future experiences.
But I need to earn money this summer, you might argue. Each project is accompanied by a $1400 scholarship from the Alumni Club of that area. Also, since the project involves only eight weeks, the other seven can be spent earning more money, if necessary. Some have even worked at their projects after their official time had run out.
Finally, throughout the summer, you’ll meet with the alumni contact for your area and with other Notre Dame alumni to update them on your project. Upon returning to Notre Dame in the fall, you will select a follow-up session such as a weekend retreat, or three group meetings, which count for two credits, or a three-credit course in theology. These opportunities allow you the chance to share your thoughts with other SSP participants.
The best way to find out about the projects is through the many past participants on campus. The dorm representatives have a book describing last year’s projects and can supply information and answer questions. If you’re ready for a different type of summer job, one that will challenge you daily, fill out an application and return it to the Center for Social Concerns as soon as possible.
“Maybe we don’t all have the capacity to answer to the inequality in and the unfairness of life. Maybe we do not have the capacity to give all human beings a decent quality of life, or even help them find that quality themselves. But we do all possess one thing; we all possess the capacity to care,” said Kathy Donovan, a junior who participated in the program at
the St Paul’s Meal Plan/St. Vincent dePaul’s Service
Center in Madison, WI.
