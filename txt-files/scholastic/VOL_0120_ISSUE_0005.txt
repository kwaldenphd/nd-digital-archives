Christian ideal; is it the philosophy and theology requirements, the availability and accessibility of the Holy Cross Fathers on campus, or the mere fact that tjle student body happens to be practically all Cath­olic? Once again, just what is it? 
In answering, Father Hesburgh saw Notre Dame Catholicism as something more complex and less easy to pinpoint than any .. one of these features. The University,_ as a Christian school, must· provide an atmosphere, be committed to an at­titude, be an actual incubator for r es po n s i b 1 e Catholic/Christian thought. Father Hesburgh doesn't view the University's role · ending when it draws up the course require­ments; he points out that certainly . the theology classes help, especially if the . student · studies Christian faith, but that if one "takes a class on Zen Buddhi~m,. for instance" the requirements _are only indirectly helping to build a . Catholic aware-. ness.. . 
As he talked. about· the· more_in­tangible qualities that make Notre Dame aCatholic university, Father Hesburgh highlighted important factors that students usually just accept .as facts of life. Simply living with fellow students, he feels, provides opportunities for Christian· growth that makes Notre Dame unique. When issues come up during the course of a student's four years here, they ~-inevitably. discussed in a context of. Christian values and beliefs. This close association with, even immersion in, an . intelligent, articulate, and largely Catholic soci­ety cannot but help to develop· each individual's spiritual self .... 
Beyond .even this social ·proximity with . Christians:-Father-Hesburgh sees the University furnishing _stu­dents . with a . Catholic orientation through. its academics. and adminis­tration. This,. perhaps, . is· what he

would like," aims at these goals, and 
is true to its mark. 
I listened and began to understand 

more clearly about what Notre 
Dame feels its duty is as a Catholic 
university. I asked Father Hesburgh 
if Notre Dame's· task has become 
any more difficult as the school 
has evolved, over the last several 
decades, into an academic "power­
house," on par with any secular in­
stitution .in the country. Does the 
increased academic emphasis de­
tract from the spiritual mission? 
In other words, more studying and 
less attention. to Christian develop­
ment? · 
Father Hesburgh · admitted that 

there would· always be a few stu­dents . who paid too much attention to their books, just as there would always be those who played too much;· but he affirmed his faith in the Notre Dame experience in gen­eral, commenting that he is "con­. tinually: amazed at the degree of theological sophistication displayed 
by the University's students." 
He feels that Notre Dame has suc­

cessfully integrated a first-class 
curriculum with a true Catholic/ 
Christian . focus, blending both and 
detracting _from neither. The aca­
demic. excellence · speaks for itself, 
and Father Hesburgh sees real spir­itual growth and dedication campus­wide. He notes that whatever time he passes through the Grotto, he can be pretty · assured of finding someone there, praying. He sees Catholicism as thriving; he cites the number of Masses being said each day, and the interest shown in them by the students' attendance. Father Hesburgh . believes Notre Dame is as successful now as it ever was in creating ·in .its community members a Catholic outlook. 
Father Hesburgh .stated at the outset it would be impossible to cap­ture what he had spent so many years 'thinking and living in the rel­atively short time we had to talk. Still, he did manage to communicate a clear sense of what a Catholic/ Christian university should be, what its goals are, and how it tries to remain true to its religious commit­ment while offering an education. 
He sees the. University's purpose and foremost goal as "grad~ating mature Christians.". In the final analysis, Father Hesburgh feels the students of Notre Dame, through their intelligent pursuit of the Chris­tian ideal, are the ones who are·com­pletely and totally denying George Bernard Shaw's acerbic quote that "A Catholic university is a contra­diction in terms."

Campus Ministry In the-Mainstream 
. Campus Ministry. The name cer­
. tainly rings a bell. But how many students and faculty at Notre Dame know what it really is arid how it · affects their lives? Campus Minis­try is not an intangible force that somehow sheds its aura of spiritu." ality over the campus duLac. The Office of Campus Ministry is a small, dynamic group of people that works energetically for the members of the Notre Dame community. · 
Throughout the decades since Fr. Sorin started this university, vari­ous methods of ministry have been in vogue. One of the more significant and widely used· practices was the idea of assigning certain clergymen to individual classes and their re­spective dorms: (For most of Notre Dame's history, freshmen · lived in freshman·· dorms, sophomores in sophomore -·dorms, etc.) These priests,· who acted as chaplains for one of the four classes, did not live in ·the residence halls, but worked out of a makeshift, informal "of­fice" in one of the dorms. 
Not until 1970 and the arrival of Fr. William Toohey could Notre Dame claim a full-fledged Office of Campus Ministry. Fr. Toohey and his six-member staff operate as a co­ordinating team. The various mem­bers of the group assume responsi­bilities for projects according to their abilities and interests. 
Father Toohey sees himself as "the co-ordinator of the co-ordinat­ing effort." The· organizing·_ unit meets two or_ three times a week and, according to Toohey, all seven mem­bers are integral in the decision­making process. 
Campus Ministry as a co-ordinat­ing unit serves three major roles in the Notre Dame community. First; the staff plans for religious events that occur at specific times of -the school· year. Scheduling a · full slate of Masses at Sacred Heart-Church every Sunday is a fundamental re­sponsibility of Campus Ministry. In addition, Fr. -Toohey and his co­
8 · 
workers devise special . agendas for religious seasons such as  Lent and Advent. . 
A second niain endeavor of Cam­pus Ministry is the preparation and institution of educational programs. Retreats, surveys, the Pre-Cana pro.: gram, training sessions for religious workers in the Notre Dame commu­nity and research projects are all organized_ by the Ministry staff. 
Asserting its viewpoints on con­troversial campus issues is a third significant _contribution of Campus Ministry. Fr. Toohey and_ his asso­ciates have taken stands on issues ranging from the groundskeepers to Dean Roemer's alcohol directives. In fact, ·the Director was instru­mental in initiating a meeting of rectors and · assistant rectors before break to discuss the alcohol situ­ation · from a -"pastoral point of view." Fr. Toohey claimed that:the meeting went very . well and gave the attending clergy and their sub­ordinates a good chance to vent their feelings on a touchy subject at Notre Dame. 
One of the principal ways of spiritually affecting the Notre Dame student, aside from the general ·methods described above, is through the rector and assistant rector of his/her particular dorm. "The rector is the Director of Campus Ministry. within a · very small part of the campus,11 declares Toohey. Rectors assume the dual role of an adminis­trator of a hall and a person who deeply cares about their · spiritual 
· growth. Their mere closeness to the students facilitates more -knowledge of students' individual problems and needs.. "That's one thing that makes · Notre Dame unique," commented Fr. Toohey. "We don't just send stu­dents out of the classroom without caring what they do after ·classes. We really feel that part of the edu­cational experience is outside the classroom· experience." ··Even more direct contact is made 
by Tom Westphal 
. . 
with the· students through the as­sistant rectors and the RA's.: Assis­tant rectors are trained for ·_ their positions through programs· co-ordi­nated by Campus Ministry. Personal experiences with hall staffs·· that exemplify the Christian ideals are an indirect reflection on the job Campus Ministry is doing. _ 
The · principal . beneficiaries of all of the activities of Campus Ministry are the students themselves. Part of the task of Fr. Toohey .and·_ his staff is to try to provide the im­petus from the outside so that the members of th_e ND community can strive to grow inside as people: Ac­

. cording to Fr. Toohey, students have had "very narrow backgrounds' with little exposure ·or contact with the real crucial questions of _··society." Thus, Campus Ministry attempts to assist young . people in increasing their own spiritual growth and be­
. coming more aware of the needs of the community. ..· A perennial problem faced by reli.: . gious co~ordinators and counselors is how to measure the ·effects of their. actions. The "spiritualpulse" of the community is indeed an· in­tangible quality thatcannot be accu­rately measured by simple statistics such as the attendance at Masses or. the number·· of students doing· volunteer work. The Campus Minis­try Office has various· methods of-ob­taining feedback on · the· success' · of its_ efforts such . as conducting sur." veys, . analyzing student ___ opinions and actually talking' to students to obtain their views on religion' at Notre Dame. Presently,· the staff is creating a survey to be answered by the Class of '79 which asks them if and how they have grown spiri~ tually over the last four years. . Father Toohey · has · been the Director of Campus Ministry· at Notre Dame for eight years of the controversial '70s.· When asked how he ·felt religion fits in today at the premier Catholic university in the country, he-· stated that: "Vve're at

a critical point right now. We have to decide whe~her Notre Dame really wants to· be unique and different and if sothey:really have to work_aUt so they don't. just become a good secular university that's got a_ lot of academic excellence but. has -severed Us spiritual roots like aHarvard or Princeton."

He hopes, that "they will respond to the little bit I might be able to add by entering into their .

lives and wallting with them a bit 
and becoming a -part of their

Fr. Toohey's personal goals are 

virtually synonymous with the g9als 
of Campus Ministry. He would .like 
to see a '_'continuing expansion of 
involving more and more people in

The training and educational pro­grams, research, surveys and analy­ses are all in the introductory stages and he feels they can all be en­hanced and _improved upon. Special · projects, such as evaluating the effectiveness of theology courses and using. husband-wife teams as

Perhaps you will get the urge to wander off campus some warm, sunny afternoon. If you choose to stroll down Notre Dame Avenue, a little beyond Angela Avenue you will come upon ·a· large white and red house with a distinctive sign over the door which proclaims "Windmoor." If your curiosity gets .the better of you and you decide to approach this house and ring the doorbell, you will be greeted by an impeccably dressed, clean-cut young man named Brian McAuliffe..· He is the director of the house. If you like, Mr. McAuliffe will show· you around the ground floor. The .interior of the house is deco­rated with tasteful elegance; the walls are paneled with rich, heavy wood and · the furniture is mostly done in· wanri, autumn colors. Per­h11ps · Mr. McAuliffe will ·volunteer. to show you the chapel. He will take you through a narrow doorway in the back of the house into a small, square room· with three short rows of pews. There is an altar, a sacris­ty and two candles against· the front wall. Mr. McAuliffe will genuflect in the aisle, move into the closest pew, and kneel down to say ·a short 
devotion. 

Perhaps you will be slightly be­wildered by thi_s entire setup. You have company; it seems that many people on ihe Notre Dame campus are slightly, even very, bewildered by Windmoor Houseand what goes on 
by Theresa _Rebeck 
there. A little investigation into the matter probably won't get you very far, either; definite facts concerning Windmoor are hard :to come by. It seems that whenever one "author­ity" says "black" another is probably saying "white." 
A few points are clear-cut: Wind­moor House is an Opus Dei Center. Opus Dei (translation: Work of God) is a worldwide Catholic organ­ization which was founded in Spain on October 2, 1928, by ·Msgr. Jose­maria Escriva de Balaguer. It is an organization · dedicated to helping Catholics lead a fully Christian life by teaching . them to be faithful to Catholic doctrine. ·The Windmoor center is particularly concerned with the spiritual development of college­age men.. Several Notre Drune stu~ dents live at the.house. _ _ 

Almost any statement dealing with 
Opus Del ·_ and _Windmoor beyond
\, 
these is open to debate. Even the origins of the movement'an_d the rea­sons for its birth in 1928 are hard to pin_ down. Fr. Claude Pomerleau of , the . Government Department sees Opus . Dei as a_ . · religious/political movement , originally organized to put meaning back into the collapsed 
social and. financial structure of a pre-civil war. Spain. Pomerleau ex­plains that Opus De{ combines reli­gion and capitalism in an.attempt to preserve social. order.-This is fine. in Spain or any predominantly _Catholic country, but P~merleau thinks it makes little _sense in a democratic country such as the United States. 
According to Pomerleau, "They_go back to religion_as the essential moti­vator of both personal and social action." He further explains his view of the organization by pointing out that "They bring together in a very unique way professional action and religious values by crystallizing reli­gious development and · maintaining a religious infancy in their mem­bers." 
Briari McAuliffe, director of Wind-· moor, disavows ~any political-inten­tions whatsoever on ·the part of Opus Dei. "Opus Dei has no aims other than spiritual aims," he states emphatically. In regard to the situ­ation in Spain in 1928 he claims that "What happened is that there were some members of Opus Dei who in fact were in positions of -govern­ment-just because they were darn good economists or darn good politi-· cians; and Opus Dei didn't have any­thing to say about their decisions in government or anything else." Mc­Auliffe stresses that members of 
.Opus Dei always -act with complete 
-. personal freedom and responsibility irf all decisions that ·bear on ·their professional fields. Windmoor's main purpose, he says, is to_ teach_ young men ori a very practical·1evel the "living of· the Catholic faith and knowledge of the Catholic· faith." This is partially achieved through · their teachings concerning "sanctify­ing work." · 
NOVEMBER 17, 1978 
It .was this concept that first at­

tracted Peter Murphy (not his real 
name), a .senior Engineering Major. 
Murphy says that the idea of sancti­
fying work _involves carryi~g your 
religion through the day with you 
and giving glory to . God through 
your everyday work. ·. Murphy em­
phasizes that Opus Dei and Wind­
moor are preparing a Catholic laity 
in this way. "The whole concept 
caught . me off guard, made me 
think," he smiles. Murphy explains 
that Windmoor . helps students 
through· seminars and discussions on 
such topics as Church doctrine or 
Christian values, frequent .retreats 
an·d days of recollection. He says 
that his involvement in Windmoor 
(begun when he was a sophomore) 
has been an extremely positive expe­
rience. 
Paul Ryan (not .his real name) is 

a junior Engineering Major whose 
experiences with Windmoor have not 
been quite so favorable. Ryan had 
been a part of an Opus Dei group in 
his hometown throughout high 
school, and he assumed that he 
would continue this involvement 
with the group in South Bend. After 
several months, however, he decided 
he wanted to expand his interests and 
he became involved in other campus 
activities. Ryan says that · his at­
tempts to spread himself out were 
met with opposition from other 
members of Windmoor, who wanted 
more of a commitment to the center 
from him. Finally, Ryan withdrew 
completely. 
Now that he has been apart from 

Windmoor for almost a year, Ryan says he sees the center and the whole Opus Dei organization in an entirely different light. He expresses disillu­sionment with Opus Dei's methods of achieving their goals while still be­lieving that the goals. themselves are admirable. "Their problem is one of mechanics," he explains. "Their goals are·right, but their. means just ·seem to be a little cockeyed." . To · illustrate his point, .Ryan explains that Opus Dei has a policy -concern­ing certain philosophical and literary works · which,· in essence, recom­mends that certain books should not be read. Ryan says that the rationale behind this policy is grounded in the 
belief.that at certain stages in a per­son's life, he or she is very pliable and open to different kin~~ of ideas, and that reading certain works would raise -destructive thoughts or doubts in.that person concerning his 
-or her faith. Ryan disagrees with the policy, suggesting that some control might be wise but better applied in the form of an advisor or teacher who would be able to help the stu­dent understand the readings and their implications in a Christian context. . . , . 
Ryan is ._ also dismayed. by-Opus 

· Dei's rather forceful opposition .. to any . kind of change -within the Church. He points out that although they don't like to be-described as "traditional" or "conservative," that is essentially what they are. While not being openly'opposed-to change, they resist ·u subtly. "They say; 'well, this is what the Church ;ays, and that'i; fine, but riot for us.'" McAuliffe explains ·that one of Opus Dei's main concerns is remain­ing faithful to the spirit of their founder, Msgr. Escriva. The birth of Opus Dei through Msgr. Escriva _ was, he says, a "supernatural" thing, and the followers feel that because of this it is very important to honor _the original spirit of the organ­ization, which is to serve the Church. McAuliffe explains the· rationale behind the conservative attitudes concerning controversial books by emphasizing that "It is abasic teach­ing of the Church that it can go against faith if a person unduly endangers -faith and morals.,. This "endangering" of faith and morals is what they are trying to protect against,· so they recommend that un­less a person is well-versed in Chris­-tian theology and doctrine and can keep these works in the proper con­text, he should avoid them if pos­_sible. What it comes down to, · says McAuliffe, is a matter of· con­science-Opus Dei recommends that each person consult his own rightly formed conscience and decide wheth­er or not he is capable of reading the piece without endangering his faith. 
Another point of controversy con­· cerns Windmoor's attitudes .toward women. Windmoor is a totally fra.,; 
ternal organization-no women are permitted in the group. The reasons for this stem from a desire to re­main faithfui to the original spirit of Opus Dei, which .was first set up as a men's organization with a branch for women forming two years later. These two branches have always been totally separate, their only link being the founder of the entire movement and in a small priestly society. · 
McAuliffe explains that· Opus Dei continues this policy of keeping the sexes separate because it has always worked for them. They feel that they can serve the spiritual needs of each sex best under this system. Mc­Auliffe emphasizes that they do not claim that this method of spiritual guidance is the only or ·the best method, only that it works for them: 
Pomerleau thinks that their fidel­ity to this policy is one of the rea­sons Windmoor's influence on the Notre Dame campus is minimal. "Who wants to get involved in a totally fraternal organization these days?" He also thinks that another reason their influence will continue to be minimal is that they are "phys­ically and intellectually separate from the Notre Dame community." 
Fr. Bill Toohey and Bro. Joe Mc­Taggart, both members of Campus Ministry, agree with Pomerleau in thinking that Windmoor's influence at Notre Dame is minimal. McTag­gart explains that Notre Dame did not invite Opus Dei ·(they began their work here in 1960) but that the open speaker policy here gives them the freedom to recruit for members on campus. Campus Ministry thinks that their efforts have not met with very great success because their meticulous interpretation qf Catholic doctrine and .almost fundamentalist approach to tile Bible do not speak to most students. 
The basic controversy boils down . to a conflict of methods. Everyone agrees 1hat it is important for a Christian to find a way to integrate his religion into his everyday life, and everyone sees the need for a heightened sense of spirituality. Joe McTaggart explains that Campus Ministry tries to answer this need by helping students direct themselves into this deepened spirituality. Through the different services Cam­pus Ministry makes available, they try to "enhance the positive experi­ences of. a student's past, provide him with new experiences-to gently nudge the student to a mature· Christian stance in life." McTaggart goes on to point out that searching for a deeper spirituality can be con­siderabiy different for different peo­ple; Windmoor's approach· .·offers students a strict set of guidelines, defined values and a sense of stabil­ity. They do not insist that this ap­proach is the "only" or the "best" approach, only that it is there. for students ·who respond · to basically conservative interpretations · of Church doctrine and an ordered phi­losophy of life. Peter Murphy thinks that many students :would benefit from it,' but he agrees it's noCfor everyone. · "You can't expect that on a campus of 8,000 people everyone wiil have the same way of doing things," he smiles. "But for us, it 
works." 





Renewing the Word 
M u c h misunderstanding sur­rounds the Catholic Charismatic Movement. The Movement or Re-· newal is a controversial subject for many people. Catholics accept the Charismatics more now than at the Renewal's beginning. Mani parishes . support prayer groups. Some are charismatic in nature. The Catholic Charismatic Renewal's history cen­ters at South Bend and Notre Dame. The Charismatic Renewal in the " Catholic Church began at Duquesne 
. University in Pittsburgh. Around 1967, a group of· religious Catholic faculty members there decided ·to try to expand their faith by praying for the Holy Spirit to renew their lives. These men. went through a deep religious experience. Through friends at Notre Dame who prayed together in small groups, news of their experience came to Notre Dame. Some of the men involved at Duquesne· came to Notre Dame to teach. Through similar connections, this news· traveled· to Ann Arbor, Michigan. 
The Charismatic Renewal, or C a t h o 1 i c Pentecostal Movement, grew out of . a stormy beginning. Little acceptance by the-Catholic Church and a now-dissolved commu­nity's activities which started some theological trouble in South Bend marked this period of growth. At present in South Bend, the LaSalle Hotel houses the Charismatic Re­newal . Services' headquarters along . 
. with a community center for the People of Praise community and a · publishing business for charismatic books and tapes. Last summer, 
. 20,000 people. came to attend · the International Charismatic Renewal Conference. The People of Praise, a large charismatic community, exists in South Bend as in other commu­
-nities such as Ann Arbor, Michigan, 
by Kathleen Sullivan 
and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Recent­ly, a charismatic group came from California to join the community. 
Many questions arose at the Cath­olic Renewal's beginning that still concern many Catholics. Some peo­ple see a separation occurring be­tween the charismatic groups and · the Catholic Church because they see the Renewal as a large step to­wards ecumenism. Many people wonder if the animated prayer and presence of the charisms at prayer meetings does not signify erratic emotionalism. Opinions vary con­cerning the movement's relationship with the Church and the direction and form the -Renewal should take in the future. 
At Notre_ Dame, some faculty, members and students belong to var­ious -charismatic prayer groups. When contacting people for infor­mation about the charismatic groups here; some students and faculty did. not want .to discuss their involve-­ment in. the Charismatic Renewal. Often people not involved in the charismatic movement easily mis­understand ·the radical prayer forms; speaking in tongue&, gifts of prophecy, interpretation and other charisms;that occur at many charis­matic prayer meetings.' Also, many Charismatics· go · through changes_ in their lives when they accept the · Holy Spirit. On the whole, most stu­dents did not mind talking · about · their experiences and their reasons for belonging to the Renewal. Most students talked about a change in direction in: their lives. All spoke about receiving a new understand­ing of what Christian life entails. A new· awareness of God's love came when they decided to accept the Holy Spirit; ·Some felt a new inner peace and joy that came from their involvement in the Renewal.

The Crying Room 
As I stepped inside, I could not see. Moments passed before my eyes adjusted to the dark inside. I paused, still holding the large, carved door, sifting through the grey. I moved. forward, letting go of the handle. As the door shut tight, the room came into view. Outside, the sun had been very bright. 
The room was not a lobby but a vestibule. Certain terms are linked to a church. Vestibule is one of those terms. You enter from the vestibule; this one, red tile floor, old but well kept; heavy plaster walls, thick with paint, always · cream · colored; wooden racks filled with leaflets and missalettes' (two other church terms);· the stairway to the choir loft; . a large marble font be­hind black iron gates.· I walked over to the gates and looked in. One tiny stained-glass window lit. the area with red light. The marble, ·grey­streaked white, was heavy looking, solid,· seemingly ·molded out of the floor like a tree out of the ground. The bowl was dry, gritty. A small altar stood to .the side, gold para­phernalia, ·a cloth. The altar was made of the ·same marble as the font. Altar and font, more terms. 
I knew this church. This was my church when I was growing up. It hadn't changed, it seeined; the font · still the same. . Of course, I don't remember my baptism. I do remem~ ber witnessing my cousin's baptism when I was thirteen. I stood by the altar, silent, wide-eyed, s·miling at times. The priest was very gentle, young and freshly scrubbed. The baby was wrinkled, wriggling from the closeness of the room, whining at the taste of.· the salt, cooing at her godmother's comforting voice. All the voices were quiet, .soothing. There were no harsh lights, nci bells, no incense. It was soft, like a lullaby. .. . . 
I moved·away from the-iron gate to the second. set . of doors, shorter than the first, carvedjust the same. The wood was heavy, set thick with varnish, worn somewhat from over­use. The handie, brass, I suppose, 
-was blackened. The door swept open with a clack-whoosh as I stepped in­side the church.

Point of View 
by Anthony Walton 

. Walking about the campus of the University of Notre Dame, I cannot help but appreciate .the · stunning beauty. Itis fall now, and the leaves are turning into their various shades of red, brown, and yellow. Much of the ivy remains upon .the walls of the buildings.· .As I stand taking. all of this in, I can't help but feel awed, yet I also feel secure. This is what college was meant to be; this is Notre Dame. 
Ah yes,. Notre Dame. Nestled among two picturesque lakes in northern Indiana, Notre Dame is the epitome of American higher educa­tion. It combines outstanding aca­demics, world-renowned athletics, a spectacular campus, and perhaps the most important ingredient of all, a certain aura which surrounds and envelops the place, a thing unknown at any other university in this country.. 
Who wouldn't want to go to Notre Dame? Well, a lot of times I think I wouldn't. Notre Dame is one heck of a school, but I often wonder if it is for me. I am a member of two 
often overlooked and forgotten com­munities at Notre Dame: the minori­
. ties and the non~Catholics: ·we com­prise, respectively, about 6% and 8% of the student population here. Notre Dame is overwhelmingly white and Catholic, and while this is to· be expected, it is ·not necessarily an ideal situation. 
Before I go on,. perhaps I should clear up a few points. I.am not a· sign-waving, radical activist.scream­ing about discrimination. At the risk of being. facetious, some of my best friends are white. I am a quiet, basi­cally shy (or so I'm told) subur­
banite with a background much like 90% of the students here. I do, how­ever, have a few observations that I would like to make note of concern­ing Notre Dame. I admit that I will make some broad generalizations, but I feel that they are valid and necessary to get my point across. 
As stated before, Notre Dame pretty much represents the ideal in American 'education. It has become the pet of white, upper-middle-class Catholics. This . is reflected by the 
student body ·as a whole: Glancing at the student directory illustrates 
. this. There are not really very many people. here· from a·city. Generally; ·. students· are not from Chicago or Cleveland, but instead they live in Elk Grove Village or Shaker Heights. Many others hail from small to me­dium-sized towns across.the country. By having ia student body that comes from a generally similar background, the University loses a much-needed diversity.~ We could use a few more longhairs ·or Hare Krishnas around here.-I don't think that you can have a really "catholic;' education without them. If you grow up in a suburb and then go to school with people who themselves all grew up in sub­urbs, one could start believing that life is a suburb. By having such a homogeneous group, we are not in­troduced to how "some. of the other half lives.'' Part of this situation is innocent, created naturally by people who simply wanted to go to a Christian institution and get a good education: . But there are those who want this 

situation deliberately, and would like the same way. If those guys were a ference to minorities that is both to keep it.this way. To those, Notre part of the community, maybe we good and baa.

Hoop for the· Best 
by Paul Mullaney 

A lot of fingers will be pointing towards Coach Digger Phelps' 1978­79 Notre Dame basketball squad as one of the top contenders to win the national title. After all, Phelps has 10 lettermen back from last year's 23-8 NCAA final four entry, includ­ing eight of the team's top 10 scorers and nine of the top 11 rebounders. 
Nonetheless, Phelps remains some­what_ cautious _when speaking of. the possibilities of duplicating the most successful Irish cage campaign ever. 
"You have to realize that no team has made back-to-back. appearances in the_final four in the last four sea, sons," notes Phelps, who is the only collegiate coach to claim five straight postseason tourney -bids heading into the new season. 
"It -· keeps you _rather humble. You've just got to go .out and get · your 20 wins to get the bid.'! Once again, the Irish will have to face one of· the toughest schedules

MVP of the Midwest Regional. 
Orlando Woolridge, also a sopho­
more at 6-9, seems to have the in­side track at the other forward spot. The native of Mansfield, Louisiana, is one of the most innovative slam­. dunkers in the country. He averaged 
4.1 points a game last year and should improve vastly with expe­rience. 
Two more sophomores, Tracy Jackson and Gil Salinas, also figure to see . plenty of playing time after playing . valuable reserve roles in 1977-78._. Jackson, from· Silver Springs, Maryland, is invaluable.be~' cause of his ability to play at either forward o; guard. Last season he averaged 5'.6 points and shot 55 per-· cent from the field. Salinas, the 6-11 San Antonio, Texas, . native saw limited _action_ last year, but should aid the Irish often with his soft cor­ner j·ump shots. · . 
The backcourt is the area which Notre Dame fans are most concerned about, despite the return of. Rich Branning, the heady junior often re~ ferred to as the "glue" of the Irish.. The overall skills of 6-3 sophomore. Stan Wilcox and 6-2 ·freshman Mike· Mitchell will aid the Irish caµse aside Branning. 
Notre Dame's floor general the last two seasons, Branning scored 11 points per contest last year while dishing out 129 assists. He'll prob­ably move into more of a shooting role this year, with Wilcox and Mitchell working out of the point position. 
Wilcox, nicknamed "Silky," played in 29 games last year as a backup for Williams. The North Babylon, New York, native is a smooth ball handler and consistent shooter. Mitchell, the only scholarship newcomer to the squad, was an All~American at Capu­chino High School in San· Bruno, California. There he averaged 31.8 points· per contest and was chosen player of the year in Northern Cali­fornia. In one two-game set, during one of the final weeks of last season, Mitchell connected on 44 of 54 field goal attempts and scored 108 points. 
Bill Hanzlik; a 6-7 junior from Beloit, Wisconsin, will also pressure· Branning, Wilcox _and Mitchell for one of the guard spots.

"We can't get complacent about the fact that we should get to the final· four;'' stresses Phelps. "You're going to see more teams like Fuller­ton State making it now. 
"We have three basic items of im­provement we're working on_ right now. First, we have to concentrate on our clock situations. We have to· have total awareness out on the·

Father James Ri!,?hle ' 

For we are .devoted to. the con­tinued pronwtion _of the primary goal of the University which we understand to be the spiritual, intel­lectual, and physical development of its students and alumni. Our inten­tion is to strive for the realization of that goal by channeling the insights and energies of monogram winners. through diverse projects commen­surate with Notre Dame's image and tradition. :-Excerpt from Notre Dame . National Monogram Club Constitution 
MEN Of lE'"C'"CERS 
In an effort to achieve the goals set forth in its constitution, the Notre. Dame National Monogram. Club, which is made up of graduated . varsity monogram winners, is cur­rently undergoing a· revival. 
"We're trying to make it a muc~ more . viable institution than it has been in the past," says Father James Riehle, C.S.C., the club's newly ap­pointed 'executive secretary. ''In past 
·years it has.not' been a very_ organ­ized club · arid this has caused it to become an inactive organization. But we're working to.reactivate it.';_ . . The first steps.. towards rejuve­nation were taken two years ago, according to Riehle. At that time, a constitution was developed, marking the first time the club·had any offi­cial bylaws. The club's next move, another first, was the election of of­ficers. The list of officers and direc­tors includes the names of former· basketball star Sid Catlett, · football great Jim Lynch, and -·Montreai 
. Expos president John McHale. 
--"It was important that we gave the club a formal structure, and the constitution did that," says Riehle. "Previously, it had just been run out of one ·mans head so very few rec­ords and such things were· kept." . 
Searching for and compiling rec­ords is the task with which Riehle is currently faced. Until his job is finished; Riehle can only give an esti­mation of the size of the club. "Right now we have about 3,100 members but I hear about more and more members all the time," says Riehle. 
According to Riehle, a graduate of the Notre Dame class of 1949, the Notre Dame · National Monogram Club is open to all varsity monogram winners immediately upon gradu­ation. Eligible students are given one year's free membership follow­ing graduation and then must pay dues of ten dollars per year to re-

main a member. The club's benefits 
include a. scholarship fund available 
to tlie sons and daughters of mem­
bers and the assurance of two Notre 
Dame football tickets. Riehle points 
out, . however, that. if a member 
wants football tickets his dues are 
increased to $25 per year. . . .. , . 
Other activities · the · Monogram 

Club has undertaken, in an attempt 
to become more active, include the 
presentation of awards to the out­
standing offen.sive ·· and defensive 
football· players as chosen .by their 
teammates. "Giving awards and 
making scholarships available are a 
couple of the ways that we are try­
ing to . become more involved with 
the University," says Riehle .. 
According to.Notre Dame Athletic 

Director Edward "Moose" Krause, 
the revival is progressing well. "l 
think it's a great idea. The club used 
to be very active on campus years 
ago arid it's good to see them getting 
involved again..·For example, they 
recently donated $20,000 for the new 
track _on Cartier . Field, ..· which · we 
needed very badly." 
Revival of the student portion of 

the Monogram Club is another action · 
being considered by the_· National · Monogram Club..The student club, . which was first broken up about ten years ago, according to Krause, would be comprised of undergrad­uates who have earned their Notre Dame monograms. Cheerleaders and varsity female athletes would be in­cluded just as ·they are currently 
members of the National Club. 
"The student club was broken up 
the first time because there were too 

many other activities' for the ath­
letes," says Krause. "Between sports, 

studies, and other events they just 
didn't have the time. This could still 
be a problem today, hut it would be 
nice if the National Club could get 
the students involved again." ·

Scholastic encourages its readers to comment on the mag~ine's con­tent. Letters should be addressed to Editor Scholastic, LaFortune Stu­dent Center, Notre Dame, IN 46556. 
Dear Editor: 
In exercising your right to "The 

Last Word" in the Scholastic maga­-zine, you allude to your -desire ­
nay, your duty -to "produce a 
magazine of quality" (November 3, 
1978). I would like to commend you 
and your editorial board for taking 
such a noble stand. Unfortunately, 
however, there seems to be some dis­
crepancy between your goal and 
your final product. 
In your column, you state that "a 

publication must print what it feels 
to be the best writing, photography 
and artwork, not because someone 
has 'requested' it, but because it is 
the best." Certainly you can't be re­
ferring to · such insipid articles as 
"If Rome Were Home," by John 
Maddog _Muldoon or "Paradise Re­
visited," by Greg Solman and Tim 
Gulstone (both · Sept.. 22) which 
started off. so promisingly but then 
quickly degenerated_ into so much 
tedium, Also, the overwhelmingly 
self-defeating and self-contradicting 
editorial by _Theresa Rebeck in the 
same edition is · by · far the --most 
worthless waste of two pages that I 
have ever seen come out of the 
Scholastic office. (Ms. Rebeck pro­
poses that not starting food fights, 
not starting riots, and not throwing 
up all over the halls is somehow 
radical; she treats maturity and 
responsibility as some· sort of _novel 
challenge.) · · · -· · 
. In the same edition (perhaps n~t 

your finest) the Scholastic does a 
grave injustice to Joe Gill and Rick 
Pinkowski by misrepresenting them 
and twisting their words around en­
tirely out of context. I believe, how­
ever, that they have written to y~u 
about this matter, an_d hence I feel 
no need to elaborate on it here. 
Somehow I wonder, is this. article 
iri keeping ~th your uduty to print 
the-truth"? _ ··­
-Your choice o_f_ -th~ W_9~d "trut_h.'~ ­

is indeed a curious one. You state 
that In its "quest fo~ truth, publica­
tions _such as _the Scholastic must 
remain aloof from outside forces." 
Yet you leave the issue· at that and 
never give reasons for_ this assertion. 
(Are .we to assume-that the faculty -. 
and. administration do not know the _<'truth'' which the Scho~tic grasps and espouses?) You then go on to say that !_'best'' is not "the pretUest picture or the cutest story," yet the Scholastic -editions·_ thus _far have 
reeked of "cutesiness." As evidence, I point to your own columns on such topics as a test for preppie:.ness (Sept. 8) and your state of health (Oct. 6). Come now, Mr. Morrissey, let us not delude ourselves with pre­tensions about "truth." 
Let us now return to your self­stated duty to print the best mate­rial. In your drive to reach this goal, you claim that a publication should not "be afraid of editing or deleting altogether a piece."_ If ..Autumn 
.Wonderland" by Joseph Evans·is an _example of such policy, may I com­mend you on your fearlessness! Granted; the editor's duty is to edit as he seesfit, butto carelessly and uncaringly snip out the flesh of the article . and merely _leave a few bones -this is not editing; it is 


butchery. To wait an entire_ month 


before offering_ an "apology" is dis­graceful. To not even have the cour-_ ·age· and. humility to admit that you committed a grave injustice_ is un­forgivable, and -certainly. -beneath the dignity of a quaUty _magazine. I 


, 'feel embarrassed for,, you and the Scholastic. ­
_  
Sincerely,  _  _  
-Thomas G. Hamel  
P.S. Incidentally, though I do  not  

consider myself to be a preppie, I . understand that backgamm9nis no · longer "in."· 
Dear Editor: 
Your story,, ''How I -Spent My Summer with Pete Rose,'' .in the September 22 issue . of Scholastic, brought back memories of another summer :..,-many years ago _c-:,--when a twelve-year~old "hit" safely in fifty-six consecutive games with the greatest baseball playl?r of,the_Jirst fifty, years of the twentieth. century 

,-Joe Dimaggio! ___  .-_-. ­When Mr. Rose. is so honored, or when he hits _safely  in _flftr-seven consecutive games, or whe~ _there is a song wrjtteri about him, or when Simon and Garfunkel -and. Mrs. Robinson 7:"": wonder where_ he has gone, then he. may be_ considered as _an equal_ of M_r. Dimaggi<>. __ Your story is enjoyable..

Dear Editor: 
This letter is in reference to the article_ ''Rich Dorm, Poor Dorm" by Bob Southard and Lisa Harten­berger, which appeared in the Scholastic of September 22, 1978. 
We feel that several salient points were missing from. the article and that these points are critical to the complete understanding of the facts and the true representation of Stu­dent Government's role in the social space issue. 
The first point. is not only critical to the issue, but also a violation of the cardinal rule of good reporting --"Tell both sides of the story." 
Father Riehle, rector of Pangborn Hall, is quoted as. saying, "I was not consulted. U my ha.Hpresident was, it was done casually."_ During our two-hour conversation with South­ard and Hartenberger, we mentioned 
-that despite many phone calls to· Riehle over the: two-week period in which we met with the other rec­tors, Fr. Riehle was never available for consultation. Therefore, we met with Chris Edelen, then Pangborn's Hall President (who is still on cam­pus, . but_· apparently was-not con­tacted by. Southard and Hartenber­ger) who presented his hall's plans for social space development, which had been drawn up five years earlier waiting for the chance to be used. 
Our _second point is that, accord­ing to Southard and Hartenberger, Howard. submitted a detailed set of . blueprints. Student Government never . received a set of :blueprints from Howard. Our proposal was · that the. University would finance the removal of some of the rooms on the first floor of Howard in order. to 
·create· sociil space. The haU was th~n to take on the burden.of fi­nancing the interior decorating. This .was to be done at a cost of approxi­mately ten times lower than the present cost. 
Obviously, sometime in . between the time that the Board of Trustees han:ded over the proposal to Student Affairs . and this summer when the renovation of the halls was under­taken, somebody screwed up the proposal and it sure wasn't Student 
· Government. Finally, just as a bit of irony, Southard and Hartenberger use the word "superficial" twice at. the end of their article. Apparently, the word is used as a way of describing 
the way matters are handled here on campus. However, given that Southard and Hartenberger did not contact Chris Edeien, did not trace the proposal once it touched the hands of Student Affairs, and did not accurately report both sides of the story, we feel the word "super~ ficial" can also describe the way in which this issue was reported.

Dear Editor: 
I recently received the latest cata­log from the Notre Dame Bookstore. On leafing through its pages I came to an item that I coul_d not believe was being offered for sale. I refer to the attempt to sell.-the_ Irish-. Tri­color with that foolish-looking. Lep­rechaun stamped on the white field. I was appalled, insulted, disgusted ·. and angry at such crass commer-· cialism. 
The Tricolor is not a toy. It is the flag of a sovereign state and even more important to me as an Irish-American, the symbol of Ire­land's long and bitter fight against the oppression of England. The orig­inal Tricolor was based on the French. Revolutionary Tricolor and· was handmade. by Irish exiles living in France in the 1840's. It is the sa­cred symbol of nationhood .to all true republicans. The Tricolor, along with. Starry Plow Flag of James Connolly's Citizen Army, hangs in my home. It is a great source _of pride to me. I object to your at­tempts to ·turn a profit by such a desecration. 
Would you do the same thing with the flag of the United States·or old mother England? I Jhink not. As a Notre Dame Alumnus (1955). and an Irish-American, I demand that you withdraw this item from,saie.
