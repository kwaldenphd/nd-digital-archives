Sir:
Now why did you have to go and get ” intellectual all of a sudden with that “Humanist” column? Don’t you know the average college boy here at ND is just along foi’ the ride? Can’t we keep the Scholastic on a happy-little-collegiate-moron level like all the other college publications in the country?
• Us old vets don’t want to be bothered ;	about things like leadership; all we want
is oui' sack and the latest copy of Cap-tain Marvel. This trying to make Christian lay-crusaders out of 4000 morally-timid souls is a big job. “The Humanist” is asking for an Atlas-sized assignment;
* they’ll soon despair and fold, then we can have more space for pin-ups.

Sir;
An article in the Scholastic, issue of February 7, 1947, announced the methods of issuing Army football tickets to students and Alumni. The article requested that students refrain from writing to the athletic department concerning the Army game. . . .
I am to graduate in August of 1947. At the time application blanks will be mailed (prior to July 1,1947 for Alumni) I will be a student. But at the time students will receive their tickets I will be an alumnus. . . . Will Aug. graduates have an opportunity to purchase tickets?

No plan has yet been set up to provide Army game tickets for August graduates, but James E. Armstrong, national alumni secretary, w said that details will be worked out with the Ticket Office and the re--< suits should be known within the next week.—Editor.
Sir:

The “Whitest of White” Pigments from Black Ore
It is a strange fact that the ninth most prevalent element in the earth’s crust should have been regarded as "rare” for over a hundred years after its discovery in 1791. But that is the story of titanium, actually more abundant than zinc, copper, lead, tin, and nickel combined. One of the factors that have kept titanium from being better known is the difficulty of handling some of its compounds commercially.
If, as a student, you were to look up the equations for the manufacture of titanium oxide pigment, you might find something like this:
FeTiO3. nFe2O3*+ (3n + 3)H2SOt—> Ti(SO4)2 + FeSO4 + nFe2(SO4)3 + (3n + 3)H2O
Fe^SO^-j + 2H+-->2FeSO4 + H2SO4
Ti(SO4)2 + (x+2)H2O—> TiO2 jcH2O + 2H2SO4
TiO2.xH2O-->TiO2 + xII2O
*—The exact composition of ilmenite varies with the source of the ore.
From these equations, the manufacture of the "whitest of white” pigments from black ilmenite ore appears to be chemically simple and straightforward. However, the processing required to obtain industrial titanium oxide of sufficient brightness, hiding power and fineness is more complicated than one would anticipate.
Controlling a Metastable System
The final product must have a particle size averaging 0.2 microns in radius and varying between 0.1 and 0.5 microns.
To attain this end in a metastable system that is ready to go in the wrong direction at any time requires exceedingly rigid control conditions throughout.
The essential steps in the operation are: 1) The careful solubilization of ilmenite in concentrated sulfuric acid to avoid hydrolysis. 2) The complete reduction of any ferric iron to facilitate purification of the solution, with removal of any unconverted residue and colloidal slimes. 3) Crystallization of 70
per cent of the iron as FeSO4.7H2O— a critical operation in which tempera
ture must be kept low and wild seed crystals avoided. 4) Hydrolysis around 105-109° C.—the most important step of all—because the initial particle size and pigment properties of the final product depend on concentration, temperature, time of hydrolysis, intensity of stirring, and presence of foreign materials. In this operation it is not unusual to talk in terms of parts per million, rather than the usual analytical
accuracy of 0.01-0.02 per cent. 5) Varying salt treatment of the precipitate, depending on the impurities. 6) Calcination between 900-1000° C. to obtain the desired particle size. 7) Grinding to give the proper aggregate size. 8) Treatment of the dried pigment in various ways depending on end use; e.g., in the automotive, rubber, ceramics, paper, linoleum, printing, or other fields.
Wide Diversity of Research Problems
Long and patient research was necessary to develop the manufacturing techniques now used. Some of the problems demanded technical skill of the highest order from the colloid chemist, the physical chemist, the analyst, the crystallographer, the physicist, and other specially trained men. A wide variety of instruments, such as the petrographic microscope, the electron microscope, x-ray diffraction unit, ultra-centrifuge, and spectrophotometer were used in

this work. Finally the metallurgist, the chemical engineer, the mechanical engineer, and the industrial engineer had to design equipment to handle this extremely corrosive system economically.
The manufacture of titanium pigments is another example of the problems that constantly challenge chemists, engineers and other specialists.

- VIOLETS ARE BLUE AND SO ARE YOU...
By BILL LEAVEY
Today here at Notre Dame as well as throughout the western world the mailman’s load was considerably heavier than usual. Every year on February 14th his bag contains the numerous messages of romantic appeal commonly known as Val-entines. The custom of sending Valentines has been going on for well over a thousand years, but no one is certain how it all started. The Calendar of Saints des-m ignates February 14th as the Feast of St. Valentine. Immediately we might conclude that there is a definite connection between the Saint and the sending of Valentines. Many assume that it is St. Valentine, the patron of lovers, who is invoked by fair maidens on the prowl e for a husband. But such is not the case. In the “Lives of the Saints” we find that there were three St. Valentines, two from Rome and one from Africa, all of whom were martyred during the 3rd century. Little else is written of their lives and we can safely assume that 4 there was no connection between their conduct and the sending of Valentines for they were holy and pious men not inclined towards amorous frivolity.
Many Theories
There are various theories of how the name of Valentine came to be connected with the day on which lovers send tokens * of affection to one another. One theory which seemingly has its origin in mediaeval England is that the birds began j- to mate on February 14th. Chaucer in his “Parliment of Fowles” refers to it this way:
“For this was Seynt Valentine’s Day When every fowl cometh there to choose his mate.”
A popular superstition has come from this belief that is still prevalent in parts of England. It is supposed that the first unmarried person of the other sex whom one meets on St. Valentine’s morning is a destined wife or a foredoomed husband.
Those who do not believe that the old opinion about the mating of birds on February 14th is sufficient to explain the connection between St. Valentine’s -» Day and the lovers, suggest that the association grew out of the similarity between the Norman word “galantin” meaning a gay blade—known in these parts as a “Walgreen Commando”—and the name galantin with the initial “g” frequently pronounced as “v” led to con-* fusion in the popular mind.
Another theory is that the Valentine custom is a survival and a Christianized form of a practice that occurred in ancient Rome on the pagan feast of Lu-
percalia occuring on February 14th. On this day the names of all the eligible young women were put in a box from which they were drawn by chance, an arrangement whereby a Roman maiden became the “steady” of young Nero or Octavius for the ensuing year. The Christian clergy objected to this refined “Sadie Hawkin’s Day” method of selecting a lady friend; the good Fathers instead substituted names of Saints for names of young ladies and each youth was to emulate the virtues of the Saint drawn for him. This change for the better might also have helped to clear up a little racket. No doubt the drawer of names was a public official and could very often be influenced with a little silver across the palm. Young Julius, the senator’s son, and his wealthy comrades probably had the pick of the year’s crop of Roman debutantes, while the financially straitened young plebeians were stuck with what was left. At least the change gave the latter a fighting chance.
Blind Date Method
However, the clergy were never completely successful in preventing the prac-tic of drawing young ladies’ names from out of the hat. The ancient method of getting a blind date on February 14th continued on for many years into the Christian era. In fact, it still goes on in a modified fonn at Notre Dame every weekend.
One might ask what is the connection between the drawing of names and the sending of Valentines? Well, when the youth and the lass were paired off by this method, the young man was in the habit of sending his girl friend a gift. One year when there was a depression in the city of Rome, and the value of the denarius had hit a new low, the young Roman, not having ready cash in his tunic, decided to send a simple message of endearment. Evidently the young Roman maidens rather liked the idea of receiving such messages of amatory significance on February 14th, for from that time on the custom of sending Valentines came into being.
The heyday of the Valentine came during the latter part of the 19th century. The young men of this period were not distracted by the diversified forms of entertainment available to the modern youth; they had plenty of time to devote to the making of Valentines. In the day of the quill pen, swains sent their fair ones thick sheets of gilt-edged paper with rosy cupids carefully gummed on.

STORMY WEATHER . . .
Not so long ago, a popular novel was written called The Rains Came. Last week a not-so-popular number was in circulation hereabouts called The Snotvs Came, and with them came the cold weather . . . from forty above to zero in twelve hours. That’s the pleasant Indiana way of greeting visitors. We were all for packing up and going home, but we had misplaced our passport, and consequently couldn’t get back into the States. Naturally we had to sweat it out (That’s a joke, Son!). Our room was so cold last week that we had to go outside to get warm. The cold snap brought out all sorts of ingenious garments for warding off the zero temperatures. At first we thought that Admiral Byrd had called for volunteers to spend the winter with him in L. A. (not Los Angeles, O’Connor—Little America) and that the whole student body had responded en masse.
When the snows really got deep after a three-day fall, we had visions of Notre Dame being cut off entirely from dear old South Bend and of our being marooned here indefinitely. Visions were conjured up of DC-3’s zooming in occasionally and dropping cans of Spam, fresh loads of pencils, crates of books for the studious and the latest editions of Superman for the rest of us. Some men had even gone so far as to suggest that Paul Sweeney might send out a pack of St. Bernards with their customary small casks attached.

EPILOGUE ...
The Sophs had a rough time of it trying to throw a formal with the mercury at five below (five below is the temperature reading—not men under the table). Penrod Q. Whiffenpoof, our Soph correspondent, reported that the cold weather gave him the first break that he ever had in his life. He just told his date that the heater in the car wasn’t functioning, soooooo! Afterwards Penrod had a sore jaw because his girl cracked a smile—it was his smile!

THE HOW COME DEPT....
Recently, the sports columnist for the Purdue Exponent penned this item. “The Notre Dame Athletic Commission has
turned down all “B” basketball games this season, -which included a 12-game ' schedule they had originally set up. Evidently the Irish are intent on taking in ; money only, and not interested in giving the second stringer a chance to play.” „
How about that? Why no “B” team games? After the lads get out for practice five times a week for three months, don’t they deserve a break? Couldn’t *■ they be used for a preliminary game, which is sadly needed hereabouts, since the students are required to be seated „ by 7:30, long before the varsity commences it contest.

♦ \ COMPARISON...	,
Newspapers are like women. They have g (Continued on Page 7)
Ask any number of the nearly 4000 Notre Dame men who did not take in the Sophomore Cotillion just why they stayed away and the greatest percentage of them will cram their answers into these three categories:
1)	no girl
2)	can’t dance
3)	no money.
The first reason is sound. There aren’t enough fems to go around, so the lucky boys make off with the prizes. Again a college prom is of meaningful import, or should be, so just any date won’t do; rather she should be someone special. Since most ND men are still single, unattached, un-engaged and playing the field as it were, the vast majority cannot single out one special doll for any such occasions. Needless to say those that are engaged are slaves and must take in all shindigs, etc. or suffer the fearful consequences.
As for the second reason (can’t dance), this is largely imagination. Very few men who do take in the rat races are smooth hoofers. In order to overcome this inferiority complex it wouldn’t be a bad idea if say the Vet’s Club or somebody (certainly not the Director of Studies) would organize dancing classes and mould ND men into social successes as well as well-rounded gentlemen.
Lastly, there’s the money angle. The buying or renting of a monkey suit, * runs into unnecessary jack. Most owners Cp of these holdovers from the roaring twenties are professional fops, neither - .' athletes (nothing more rugged than
golf) nor scholars (strictly Downbeat ' ~ magazine and Steve Canyon), but rather dandies whose backgrounds have allowed them just about anything their little k hearts desired. The cure for this throw-
back to feudal privileged royalism is to outlaw all strictly formal affairs. Of course it’s all right for the women, they live to put on the dog and strut their stuff. But tuxs for men are undemo-
cratic. They should go to the wall. ♦

The South Bend theatre operators apparently are wising up to what the public wants in the way of film fare.

We were somewhat amazed in looking over the results of a poll of student opinion conducted by James Burns and Warren Fromrath on the question of the closed shop. The co-writers of “The Humanist,” which appears on page 11 of this issue, found a wide divergence of opinion. The outlook of Art and Letters majors, 65% of whom favored the closed shop, contrasted sharply with that of Commerce men, of whom 18% said that the closed shop should be maintained in industry. But what amazed us was the fact that 23% of the Science majors questioned and 37% of the Engineers held no opinion on the subject.
Granted that the question as propounded permitted no definite answer for those who see both good and evil in the closed shop, still such a lack of opinion on so vital a matter is a shocking indication of the point to which education has degenerated. It is incredible that more than one-third of a group of college men—men of a high intelligence level—have no opinion on an issue that affects every individual in the nation. It dramatically illustrates the dire need for the reforms many educators have been demanding. We would start off by prescribing a stiff dose of the social sciences for the 37% so engrossed in their math and physics that they can ignore a strife-torn world.
Student Representation
The time has passed when all students except the minority who actually resided in South Bend lived on the campus. This semester there are some 1,300-odd students who are located off campus. This figure is well over one-quarter of the total enrollment, yet excluding the “Villagers,” this group has absolutely no representation in the Student Council and as a result has no voice in the controlling of student activities. The “Villagers” have two representatives on the Student Council but their membership totaling 170 is restricted to native South Benders. Besides, they would hardly be expected to be interested in or have the same problems as the temporary commuters.
This situation has not just begun. Even last September the figures were very much the same, but nothing has been done to see that new delegates be installed.
The SC’s failure can (and no doubt will) be rationalized. The Executive
Committee can excuse its oversight by v contending that there was no interest and that the defeatist attitude so ingrained in all hardly warranted the p bother to make a change. This is poor rationalization at its best. With the advent of disinterest the SC should have been the first to notice and the first to • correct it rather than waste its time in $ debating which is the better entertainment at a basketball game half time: the naive gent in the long green underwear portraying something forgotten, something Irish, or a tug-of-war.

The Vet Studies 1
Everbody said veterans did better aca-demic work than non-veteran students, but Dean J. O. Jones of the School of Engineering at the University of Kansas wondered if, just like the weather, people > were talking about it and never did anything about it.	'
Dean Jones decided to do something about it and made a survey of the grade point averages of 990 veteran and nonveteran students in the School of Engineering. The results indicate just what everyone said—the returning veterans are far ahead of the non-veterans in the race for academic achievement.
He tabulated the mean grade point averages and the percentage of students •*-with averages above 2.0 and the percentage with averages less than 1.0 for each group. At the University 3 grade points are awarded for each hour of A work, 2 for each hour of B, 1 for each hour of \ C, 0 for D’s and a minus 1 for each hour of failure.
The comparison which follows clearly shows the academic superiority- of veterans.

' Rebels Hold Mardi Gras a la Claghorn
By JOHN J. SULLIVAN
Tomorrow night Bebels from Notre . Dame will enter the social spotlight with their first gala Mardi Gras Party at the swank Erskine Park Country Club on Miami Road. This party, which the • wheels of Notre Dame’s Rebels hope to make an annual event, is strictly a southern affair with attendance limited u to students who live below the Mason-Dixon line and their invited guests. St. Mary’s girls will have late permissions and the Prefect of Discipline has granted * both car and 1 a.m. permissions to Notre Dame Rebels, provided certain specified conditions are met.
j Dancing from 8:00 to 11:30 will be to the music of Phil Foote and his Southern Serenaders. In Senator Claghorn fashion the bigwigs of the Rebels have exacted a promise to play predominantly southern music. Plans are being made for a radio broadcast over a local station to come directly from the Country Club.
...	To Run Special Buses
Bids selling at $3.00 include tax and transportation, via chartered buses leaving from and returning to the Notre Dame circle, the LaSalle Hotel, and St. j- Mary’s, and have been available through , hall representatives of the Rebels.
Committee men and workers for this party were under the supervision of Ray Hymel, with Fletcher Daniels heading the Ticket Committee and Greg Despot in charge of decorations. Others to whom -J credit is due are Jerry White, new President of the Rebels, Bill Slavick, handl-* ing publicity, and Dick Ahearn, who served as Secretary.
■ Mildred Martin, St. Mary’s senior from _ St. Martinsville, La., will reign as Queen of the Mardi Gras as Chairman Ray Hy-— mel’s date. Her maids of honor will be:
Mary Louise O’Donnell, Louisville, Ky., ■* the date of Greg Despot; Christine Ma-gruder, Jackson, Miss., escorted by Flet-chei- Daniels; and Marie Shea, Memphis, Tenn., accompanied by John D’Antoni. All are St. Mary’s students.
Another St. Mary’s girl, Penny George, will be the featured soloist of the occa-

NFCCS Vets Favor Military Training
By FRANK KEENAN
Catholic college student veterans last weekend made known their views on the controversial question of compulsory peace-time military training. Speaking through their representatives to the fourth regional congress of the National Federation of Catholic College Students (NFCCS), veterans overwhelmingly supported a program of universal military training, with certain qualifications.
Voting at the final general session of the congress at St. Joseph’s College (Collegeville, Ind.) the delegates unanimously adopted the resolutions presented by the Veterans Affairs Commission, chairmaned by Notre Dame’s Tom McCaffery. While opposing such a program of military training “in principle,” the six-point program recognized the necessity of universal military training, “in the light of the present international situation” and “. . . until such time as the United Nations Organization proves itself capable of guaranteeing international peace, or until an alternate solution for world security is found.”
Delegates were adamant, however, in their opposition to the present War Department plan of UMT. Stating their “definite opposition” in the third section of the resolution, they went on to declare in the fourth, “That any program of universal military training should be strictly military, conducted under Army regulations, and as intensive and as brief as conditions allow, as for example, the

Nominations for the nine executive offices of the Veterans Club were opened at a meeting of the organization Tuesday night in the Law Building and will continue until noon, Tuesday, Feb. 18. Officer elections will be held Monday, Feb. 24, in the basement of the dining hall at the lunch and dinner periods.
One slate of officers, headed by H. Smith Keel as candidate for president, was nominated at the meeting.
To be eligible to vote in the election a member must present his membership card. Those veterans who have not pro- . cured a card and desire to vote in the election will have an opportunity to do so on the voting day or by contacting the present club president, Joe Dillon, at 218 Badin Hall.
To Elect Nine Officers
Nine club officers are to be elected, namely: president, three vice-presidents, recording, financial, and corresponding secretaries, a sergeant-at-arms, and a treasurer. A complete slate of officers may be nominated or individuals may be nominated for the individual posts by leaving their names with Joe Dillon at 218 Badin before noon, Tuesday, Feb. 18. The Scholastic will publish the final complete list of candidates in its Feb. 21 issue. The elections will be held Monday, Feb. 24, in the basement of the dining halls during the lunch and dinner periods.
The slate of officers nominated at the meeting consists of: H. Smith Keel for president; Bill Duggan for first vice-president; Bill Henessey for second vice-president; Bob Uhl for third vice-president; Gunnar Hald for recording secretary; Bob Traver for financial secretary; Frank Keenan for corresponding secretary; Zygmont Czarobski for ser-gent-at-arms; and John A. O’Connor for treasurer.
In a short address given at Tuesday’s meeting, Keel outlined his platform, which, in essence, calls for a tighter organization of the club and a broader program of activities.

SEMI-FORMAL FOR VETS
Notre Dame veterans have been invited to attend the semi-formal dance sponsored by the 60 girl members of the St. James Parish Club, the Veterans Club announced.
Dancing and refreshments—free— will be the fare on Feburary 18th. Time: 8 to 11:30; place: St. James Parish Hall, 117 N. Lafayette St.

Another innovation was provided by Dan Gentile, who announced a half-hour * radio show over Station WSBT, the main , feature of which was Maestro Jarrett’s music.	<-
600 COUPLES BRAVE INDIANA ELEMENTS TO LIVEN SOPH COTILLION FESTIVITIES
A smaller turn-out was in view Saturday as the Notre Dame Cavaliers provided the music for a Palais Royale tea dance. According to one unbiased onlooker, “Everybody looked a bit sleepy.” 1
Notre Dame’s basketball team even looked “sleepy” to some Saturday night, ' but it mustered enough court'prowess to swamp Michigan State, 70-54, before 300 Cotillion couples, thus ending the official week-end activities. Cold weath-er hampered the usual sightseeing tours about the campus, and by Sunday even- -ing the out-of-town guests were on then* way.

Old Man Weather tried his hardest with a driving snowstorm and. sub-zero weather, but all of his efforts were to no avail. A conservatively estimated 600 couples massed enough courage to brave the elements and turned the Sophomore Cotillion—first formal dance of the
Palais Boyale “atmosphere"—something new and obviously enjoyable.
1946-47 school year—into as much of an attendance success as a five-alarm fire.
Art Jarrett was on the bandstand and his orchestra served up a healthy fare of slow numbers, spiced with an occasional rhumba and fast piece to keep the clientele happy. The theme of the affair was the ’49 gold rush, but it was perhaps the least unique feature of the dance. First of all, the programs did not provide spaces for allotting dances, a custom that now seems to be fading. Secondly, the refreshments were free, something that usual patrons of the Palais Royale found difficult to believe.
Midway through the evening of dancing, Miles Quail, a member of the general committee, introduced the “Belle of the Ball” and the “Sweetheart of the Claim.” In the role of the “Belle” was cast Miss Mary Frances Harding, a lovely brunette sophomore from Lake Forest’s Barat College. Miss Harding, clad in a fire-engine red frock was the guest of Sophomore Class President Terry Brennan. Miss Joanne Sullivan, snappy and brunette, Toledo University junior, was the “Sweetheart.” Clad in black, Miss Sullivan was the guest of Vice-president Bill Murtaugh.
What the out-of-towners thought of Notre Dame is hard to prognosticate. Most of them probably thought it to be < a mighty cold place in the winter time. However, few will disagree that the Cotillion week-end was (to quote the dance program) a “solid gold” example of good planning by the Class of 1949.

The Humanist
I In last week’s column, the immediacy । * of the problem of pending labor legisla-2. tion was brought to your attention. The q' replies received were indicative of serious * consideration of the problem on the part L	of several students and resolved them-
j	selves into varied but definite points of
j * -view. These written replies were augmented by an oral survey conducted 1 among students of the various colleges । ‘ with the purpose of compiling a crosssection of opinion in these respective
I groups.
Closed Shop Discussed
‘ The most discussed aspect of the ques-r tion was the “closed shop.” The major-J ity of the replies indicated an antago-' nism to the closed shop. Unfortunately, । however, these opinions were unqualified I inasmuch as no distinction was made be-2_ tween the open-union and closed-union | types of the closed shop. The most popu-- - lar of the arguments used to substantiate this antagonism was that the closed shop ,	deprived the individual of much of the
1	personal liberty that is held to be natu-
ral and a necessary part of a democratic society. It was also maintained by this same group that since the “yellow dog” J-	contract—an instrument used by man-
! agement to force the individual worker - v to sign an agreement to the effect that he would not join a union—has been declared illegal, it is merely a matter of । reciprocal justice that this seemingly coercive practice on the part of labor be <- likewise declared illegal.
। The few who favored the closed shop • ! - - qualified their stand by pointing out that they were only in favor of the open-union ~ type of closed shop inasmuch as they । believed that there should be no restric-, * tions regarding the number of workers in a particular trade—which restrictions ! the closed-union type invariably pro- ’ J duces—and they further maintained that the worker is entitled to a period of consideration prior to being compelled to join a union. Their chief reason for j justifying the closed-shop policy was that only by enjoying the support of all 1 the workers of any industry can the -	- unions remain an effective and succesful
bargaining agent. A few of these students indicated a definite sense of social responsibility by pointing out that it is the duty of the individual as a member of a complex society to forfeit a small portion of his personal liberty when the common good demands it.

Percentage opinion on the closed shop:

Science 			 49%	28%	23%
Engineering ..		 21%	42%	37%
Law 					 51%	41%	8%
A second feature of the problem that received a great deal of attention was the measure proposed by Senator Ball to make compulsory arbitration a part of our- national labor legislation. Even most of those who were opposed to the closed shop voiced the opinion that such a measure would prove to be impractical and unenforceable. The more specific opinions on compulsory arbitration pointed to its glaring failure in Australia, New Zealand, and our own state of Kansas. They also noted that such settlements are effected by the force of numbers rather than by a compromise acceptable to both parties concerned. This attitude was so generally expressed by the students interviewed that a percentage break-down seemed unnecces-sary.
Industrial Peace Needed
For the most part the students seemed to realize the pressing need for achieving industrial peace if economic stability is to be obtained. Many expressed the opinion that labor has been excessive in using its power in a few instances and has shown little consideration for the national welfare. Apart from their stand on the closed shop, most of the students hesitated to advocate further legislation of a more drastic nature, such as the proposed Case anti-strike bill. They realized that such legislation would be a return to the impossible and chaotic conditions that existed prior to 1935. They did, however, concede to a need for a check that would offset what appeared to them to be an unwarranted bargaining advantage now held by labor. There were evidences of extremes towards both sides of the question. A few held that labor has a carte blanche to do everything it can get away with and there was also a small group composed of remnants from a by-gone era who were opposed to anything that would benefit the working man. Fortunately, these were inconsequential in number.
This ci-ystallized picture of the opinion of the average student concerning pending labor legislation and labor in general is, from all indications, more
encouraging than that evidenced in previous years. It is indicative of a more rational and mature consideration of contemporary problems inasmuch as a constructive labor program is no longer held to be necessarily a Communistic one, despite the admonitions of the Chicago Tribune. This transition is, perhaps, due to the influx of the veteran who is, of course, more mature and represents a more diversified background than the student of former year’s. It is unfortunate, however, that there still remains a group that insists upon adhering to the dictates of the vested interests as expressed by the “world’s greatest newspaper-” and similar reactionary influences. It is hoped that the members of this latter group will realize the necessity for the responsible, thinking person to formulate his own conclusions, free from coercion of any single source of “information.”
The problem that has been chosen for next week’s consideration should be of paramount interest and deserving of your wholehearted attention: Do you feel that our diplomatic attitude toward Russia should be one of severity and firmness supported by military force and the threat of the atomic bomb? Or do you believe that we should maintain a policy characterized by a sincere attempt to bridge the yap between the tivo states by attempting to understand the- basic tenets of the Russian political philosophy and the psychology of the Russians themselves? This latter alternative by its nature implies that we nse reason rather than force.
Please address all replies to The Humanist, Box 174, Notre Dame, Ind., by Monday evening, February 17.
Buffalo Club Arranges Journey to Canisius Game
A large group of students, mostly members of the Buffalo Club and other western New Yorkers, are journeying to Buffalo to witness the Notre Dame-Canisius College basketball game on the night of February 22.
Through the efforts of Lou G. Streer and James “Doc” Crowdie, Graduate Manager of Athletics at Canisius, tickets were made available in a choice reserved section.
At the half time in the game, Jack Shine, president of the Buffalo Club, will present a trophy in behalf of the Club to the most valuable Notre Dame basketball player during the season. The trophy will be called the Buffalo Memorial trophy in honor of all the former Notre Dame students and alumni of the Buffalo area who sacrificed their lives for their country in the war. Choice of the player will be made by the members of the Club, assisted by Coach Krause and the players.

Summer Sessions Start on June 19
After being suspended for the last three years because of the war, the Summer School at the University of Notre Dame will reopen this June with both graduate and undergraduate courses for members of various religious communities, it was announced here yesterday by the Rev. Howard Kenna, C.S.C., Director of Studies at Notre Dame.
Registration for the 1947 Notre Dame Summer School will be held on June 17 and 18, with classes to start on June 19. The eight-week’s session will end on August 13.
In addition to the regular courses in all five undergraduate colleges and in the Graduate School at Notre Dame, special courses will be offered this summer in library7 science, teacher training in mathematics, and religion. Arrangements also have been made for undergraduates to major in religion.
Credit in the Summer School will be the same as that for the regular school year. The maximum number of hours possible to earn in the Graduate School is six, and in the undergraduate, nine. Classes are taught a full hour of 60 minutes so that the usual 3-hour-credit course is held five periods per week.
A Notre Dame Summer School Bulletin Avill be ready for distribution in a short time. All requests for information should be addressed to the Registrar, University7 of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana.
SC Appoints Junior Prom Committee
The Student Council has appointed a committee, headed by7 Larry7 Turner, to appoint members from the Junior Class to organize and set in motion plans for the Junior Prom. This action was necessary7 due to the fact that the Junior Class has no officers. Turner suggested that he first contact all candidates for the original elections and solicit their aid. He received approval by a unanimous vote of the Council and will begin to organize the Prom Committee this week. A total of 84 members of the Junior Class voted in the elections last November and this number was declared insufficient to constitute an official election by the Prefect of Discipline’s office and the Student Council.
The Council appointed Fred Tansey, representative of the Off Campus Students, to organize some student entertainment both before the basketball games and if possible during the halves. A boxing or wrestling match has been suggested with members of the Physical

Education Department filling the card. Also suggested was a tug-of-war between the Freshmen residing in Breen-Phillips and Farley Halls.
Brothers Receive Tribute for Work
High tribute is paid to the work of the Lay Brothers of Holy Cross in a new pamphlet, “Behind the Scenes at Notre Dame,” issued yesterday by the Rev. John H. Wilson, C.S.C., Director of Vocations at Holy Cross Seminary.
The pamphlet points out that “in a ‘city’ as large and complex as the University7 of Notre Dame many skills and talents are needed. Some of the Brothers come with a trade already developed through their work in the world. Others learn one after entry.”
“The Brothers’ assignments,” according to the pamphlet, “range from that of guest-master to engineer in Notre Dame’s huge steam plant, from prefect in one of the student halls to cook in the seminary7, from accountant and bookkeeper to electrician and maintenance man. A Brother nurses the sick and aged in the community7 infirmary. A Brother expertly handles the many7 details in the sacristy of the campus Church where there are 31 altars and 45 Masses a day7. If a fire should break out, you would have to hop out of the way for the Fire Department with its modern equipment and efficient crew composed of Lay Brothers of Holy Cross.”
The pamphlet, illustrated with pictures of the Brothers at work, can be obtained from Father Wilson at Holy Cross Seminary, Notre Dame, Indiana.
California University Has 21 ’’Stateless" Students
BERKELEY, Cal.—(ACP)—Twenty-one men and women without a country are registered on the Berkeley campus of the University of California, according to Allen C. Blaisdell, foreign student adviser.
Most of these “stateless” students, Blaisdell said, came to the United States from the Far East to which their parents had moved from European countries without having their citizenship clarified. Generally, they are in this country on temporary passports or visas or by special State Department permit.
Blaisdell also noted that four Japanese citizens are registered on the Berkeley campus. These students were brought to this country by their parents while they were still infants and, under later legislation, are prohibited from becoming United States citizens, even though they have lived here practically all their lives.
"Ave Maria" Calls for United Front of All Religions
A “United Front” of Protestants, Jews and Catholics against materialistic com- k munism which seeks to destroy all religion, is urged in a recent issue by the Ave Maria, national Catholic weekly published at the University of Notre Dame.
Endorsing efforts by the National Conference of Christians and Jews to establish “a firm stand against materialistic trends” that are a major obstacle to world peace, the editorial says, in part: “No man or woman who accepts Chris- * tianity as essential to civilization should withhold support from this worthy objective at this or any time. Anybody .1 who has given thought to world conditions today cannot escape the conviction that the world at this moment is faced by a conflict between materialistic com- *-
•munism and Christianity. The children of the future here in America and everywhere else will be Christians or atheists, ‘k depending on how Christianity meets this testing challenge in these trying days. Catholics, Protestants and Jews believe in God. The communistic objective is to liquidate God. Surely the x Catholic, the Jew, and the Protestant can unite for this one brave objective— y to keep God in His universe and in the hearts of His people. So let us hold the line in this united front.”
Admirer Sends Florida * Coed a Boxed Skeleton
TALLAHASSEE, Florida.—(ACP)— 4 Would someone like to keep company with a nice friendly skeleton? Frances Myers, a student at Florida State College for Women was rather surprised * the other day when she returned from classes to find a curious crowd gathered around an ominous looking nine-foot box addressed to her from Rockmart, Ga.
Looks like a coffin,” one of the spectators volunteered. “Maybe there’s a cadaver in it,” another cheerful soul added. Little did they know!
Frances hurriedly found a hammer and opened the box. There, grinning up i at them, was a very real human skeleton. One of the biology profs, a bit amazed, said it was a very well-preserved skeleton and valued it at about $125. The r girls are still wondering what to do •with “it” and Frances is still saying, “But I ’ don’t know a soul in Rockmart, Georgia. > I wonder if we’ll be prosecuted.”

ND Debaters to Sing 4^. Praises of Women
One of the most unusual debates on record, conducted by mail and lasting a ' month, began this past week, with the , debating teams of the University of J Notre Dame, and Wichita (Kans.) University participating.
’' Every aspect of the debate bears an unusual trait. There will be no speaking ~	in this “by mail” verbal tussle, and it
।	will be carried on over the course of a
!	month instead of being completed in one
T'	day. According to the regular rules for
debate, each member of the negative • - and affinnative team is allowed 15 minutes for the presentation of his argu-y	ment and rebuttal. However, in this
i	debate, the affirmative team will be given
I * a total of 14 minutes for argument and X- rebuttal, while the negative side must ] content itself with 13 minutes to accom-■ | plish the same ends.
« The question before the two squads i is: “Resolved: Women are More Intelli-I 4 gent than Men.” Notre Dame—an allI male university—has been assigned the affirmative side of the question, while Wichita’s all-girl team argues from the
negative approach. The arguments and rebuttal of each team will consist of timed manuscripts, and will be mailed to the coach of the respective squads, who in return will give his squad only two days in which to prepare an answer.
Notre Dame’s opening 5-minute argument has been air-mailed to Wichita. By Feb. 15, the Kansas school must have mailed its reply, a 6-minute opening speech. Notre Dame must reply with another 5-minute speech by Feb. 22. Wichita must mail its 7-minute rebuttal back to Notre Dame by March 1. The Irish team puts in the final blow of the contest with a 4-minute rebuttal which must be on its way by March 8.
Upon the close of the mail debate, the manuscripts will be broadcast over a Wichita radio station. However, neither team will be judged the winner, for in reality, both sides are debating against their fundamental principles; namely, the mental superiority of their own sex.
Dr. Leonard Sommer, Professor of Speech and debate coach at Notre Dame, has chosen a squad composed of Bernard Thomas of South Bend, and Al Foster of Wilkes Barre, Pa., to oppose the girl’s debate team from Wichita.

Prior to this he had received the Navy Cross from Admiral Nimitz for “extraordinary heroism "on Tarawa.
Al EE Society Sponsors Aptitude Test Lecture
Mr. Edward R. Quinn of the Department of Testing and Guidance will speak before an assembly of engineering and non-engineering students and faculty members at 4:15 p. m. Monday, Feb. 17, in the Engineering Auditorium. His topic will be “The Use and Interest of Aptitude Tests in Industry.” Mr. Quinn will be the second speaker in a series of talks sponsored by the Special Lecture Committee of the Student Branch AIEE Society.
In line with the newly created series, the talks, delivered by recognized experts in their fields, will offer students an insight on vital problems facing the nation.
The favorable response shown at the first of interesting afternoon seminars held last month in the Engineering Auditorium has spurred the committee in charge of the talks to greater efforts. As a result of the acceptance of the unique idea of afternoon meetings by more than 250 students at the first talk and discussion, the committee has outlined an advanced program and intends to present a different speaker every two weeks.
The idea of projecting afternoon lectures of vital import, primarily for en-gineei-ing students, for whom most classes are unscheduled at that hour, was originated by Mr. John J. Curtin, of Providence, R. I., Chairman of the Special Lecture Committee of the Student Branch AIEE Society, and Prof. L. F. Stander, club counsellor.
It was felt that the engineering student, whose training is of a technical nature, was perforce lacking in various phases of a liberal education; therefore, the committee was formed and plans were drawn for the scheduled talks toward liberalization.
Mr. E. H. Worcester, assistant to the Personnel Director of U.S. Rubber Co., speaking on industry’s expanded use of the aptitude tests inaugurated the series of talks.	-
Among the subjects to be presented during subsequent lectures will be “The Current Labor Problem,” involving both labor and management views, “Russia Today,” “The Palestine Question,” and “Commercial Law.”—Steven T. VaZetich
Professor: “Why don’t you answer me?”
Student: “I did, professor, I shook my head.”	.

DOME DELAY PROBABLE, EDITOR SAYS; SHORTAGES CAUSE POSTPONEMENT
In all probability the 1947 Dome will not be ready for distribution until after the close of the school year in June. In order to acquaint the student body with the various reasons for this delay the following report was submitted for consideration by John Walker, Dome editor.
Conditions Within the University
In the years prior to the war, each Dome was prepared by a staff that had been the result of some years training in previous year-book work, and who at least had some insight into the technical difficulties of modern bookmaking. Inasmuch as the Dome has not been published since 1942 the continuity of training has necessarily been broken, and the present Dome staff is as a result largely inexperienced in this line of work. In addition to its relative inexperience the staff is numerically very small.
Student cooperation with the Dome staff has been for the most part excellent, except in several instances where organization and club presidents failed to fulfill obligations as to appointments with Dome photographers. Cooperation from the various departments of the University itself has ranged from excellent to disappointing. Lack of cooperation from one department of the University has already seriously delayed a section of the book. Under normal conditions the delays occasioned by the circumstances in this paragraph would mean little as to the final date of publication, but these are not normal times in the publishing industry.
i
Conditions Outside the University
In the beginning of the Dome's operation a printing house was secured which gave verbal confirmation to the fact that they would take the Dome’s printing business. Sometime after this the printing company in its formal bid for the business restricted its acceptance of the contract only if the Dome were considerably reduced in size, in the amount of color material used throughout the book, and in the number of copies. Rather than sacrifice the content of the Dome a second printing house was secured and they are presently engaged in printing the opening sections of the book. However, this printing company definitely states that under no foreseeable circumstances could a Dome of the scope and nature of the present one come out prior to the conclusion of the academic year. As far as the printing and the engraving business
are concerned, the war is not over. Labor conditions, scarcity of materials, and a great over-abundance of business have contributed quite a measure to the present situation. Then there is the matter of the binding, which for Domes published prior to the war necessitated a matter of days; to bind the 1947 Dome will require three weeks.
For the above reasons and many others which are too numerous to chronicle here, the Dome will necessarily appear after the close of the school year. Ar-rangments will be made to mail copies of the Dome to all the students who will graduate in May, and those who graduated in January. As you know, the Dome is distributed without direct charge to the students as its cost is included in the general fee. The editors of the Dome sincerely regret that the publication will not appear on the campus in line with previous years, but circumstances, the majority of which are out of the direct control of all of us, are largely responsible. We will, however, go on with our work as though the book were to be published on time, and if by the intervention of some unseen hand, delivery is assured prior to the closing of the University, appropriate and definite announcements as to the time, methods, and places of distribution will be made.
ND Commission Leads Regional Congress
With the purpose in mind of furthering Catholic Student Action on the Spanish question, the Fort Wayne Regional Commission on International Relations and Inter-American Action proposed six resolutions to the NFCCS Regional Congress held at St. Joseph’s College, at Collegeville, Indiana, on February 8-9.
As Notre Dame had the Chairmanship of this particular Commission, the meeting was conducted by two N.D. delegates: Tom Murray, Chairman; and Ralph Fenderson, Secretary; both members of the local Inter-American Affairs and La Raza Clubs.
The first part of the meeting was devoted to three talks by two speakers with discussion following. The first speaker was Virginia Binsack of Nazareth College, who spoke on “The Background of the Spanish Question” and also on “The Report of the Spanish Sit
uation to the UNO in June, 1946.” The | second speaker, Louise Muldoon of St.	t
Francis College, spoke on “The Catholic	‘
Students Responsibility to Overcome His H Indifference to the Spanish Question.”
w .
After a period of discussion, the second part of the meeting convened in -which six resolutions were proposed. The first four of these provide that every * local club study the Spanish Question more thoroughly and exchange their find- 51 ings and conclusions on the matter with » -the other clubs in the region.
The fifth resolution urges that, in view' of the facts of the matter, diplomatic » relations between the U. S. and Spain be resumed. The sixth and final resolution states that Louise Muldoon’s talk be submitted for publication in Cogs, the NFCCS Fort Wayne Regional news- . paper, and in the local campus publications.	<
’ All of the above resolutions were pass- , ed at the Plenary Session of the Congress, and an additional one—stating that the 5th resolution in full be sent to^ the State Department—was tabled.

At the February 5th meeting, James Murphy (senior English major) decried certain aspects of the present procedures of justice in this country, citing statistics on high rates of criminal “repeaters” as proof that our present penal system has not only failed but has acted as an incubator for further crime. As a remedy Murphy generally listed better sentencing and penal procedures and specifically pleaded for a separate ‘'sen-fencing” board to be composed of psychiatrists and doctors rather than jurists.

Oldest Notre Dame College Building Now Headquarters for Missionaries
By E. W. JOYCE
Set your mind a-ticking and imagine the old time circuit rider. You’ve seen him in the movies. Abe Lincoln-ish, his feet are too long for the stirrups. With a bible in his hand, and fire and brimstone on his mind, he has a blessing on his lips. The people he visited had a deep appreciation for what he went through to bring the church to them. Father Sorin, more than he, was a man typical of his time.
One of the many present day occur-ences that we take for granted is the yearly misson held at our local parish churches. The evolution between the mission as we know it today and as it was in yesteryear is a prime example of the advance of the Catholic Church in America.
During the winter of 1842-43, Father Sorin, guided by young Alexis Coquillard, who later became the initial student at the school, entered the clearing at the side of St. Mary’s lake. His arrival marked one of the primary foundations of the Church in this section of the country.
In the spring of 1843, the Metropolitan Catholic Almanac made first public mention of the new school. It read that a school for young men had lately been opened at “Southbend, near Washington, Ind., under the direction of E. Sorin.”
These missionaries of the Holy Cross, after officially opening their school, divided their* time between teaching and going to the outlying districts on missionary work.
work on a full time basis. Thus following in the footsteps of Father Sorin, began the first band of Holy Cross fathers to work solely on mission duties.
These men, and those who are now in the band, are not to be confused with those of the order who are serving in the Bengal missions, and who take yet another vow besides those of poverty, chastity, and obedience. This, the foreign mission vow, is taken only by those who wish to serve outside this country.
The first college building, which still stands next to the log chapel, was opened

once again, and made the headquarters for these men.
The fact that they are booked, almost entirely up to 1950, attests to the excellent reputation they hold in this country for putting new zeal into the hearts of all laymen.
These priests, wholeheartedly devoting their lives to their work, now number twelve, under the leadership of Father Thomas Richards. They travel from border-to-border and coast-to-coast. Always on the go, they have little time for themselves. But the lack of free time is compensated by the graces they are able to bestow.
So today, the epitome of the campus, the original college building, is fulfilling one of its initial purposes, the housing of a band of priests who go to the people and spread the word of God.

Missus to Be Met In Mirthful March
Going into rehearsal this week is “Meet the Missus,” an original musical comedy about student life at Notre Dame. Opening night is scheduled for early March in Washington Hall. Music and lyrics for this all-student production are by Ed Cashman of Peoria, Illinois, who will be remembered by many students for his musical hits in the 1943 success, “Let’s Get Going.” The book for “Meet the Missus” has been written by Jim Murphy and Jim Sheridan in collaboration with Cashman.
George Bariscillo will produce the new show, with direction by Noel Digby and
John McKeon. Digby has produced and directed plays in Wisconsin summer stock theaters, while McKeon has studied drama at Catholic University in Washington, D. C. Sets for the musical are being designed and executed by Wib Marshall.
Although the production staff has been reticent to disclose information, announcement of the title, “Meet the Missus,” has led campus logicians to predict that married life may well be involved in the theme. Further strength to this theory was given by the fact that tight-lipped Producer Bariscillo, when questioned, loosened his lips sufficiently to snap, “You may say that the show will abound in beautiful women.”

Career Girls—Phooey
By JERRY OLWELL
Taking my cue from Pic’s Bill Pearsall, I am now prepared to unleash a vigorous attack on a new group which I call the “LAB.” The League of American Businesswomen. And in doing this I hope to stir up some discussions here on the campus on Career Girls. Although my name appears above, what I have to say, I feel, wall taste fine to the majority of students here at Notre Dame.
Naturally I am not going to make any general statements, and condemn all American womanhood of today, for surely there must be some gals left in our fair land who have retained some of Grandmother’s feminine graces. But there is definitely an ever-increasing segment of the United States’ feminine population which is all out to prove that men are on the decline, and that it will soon be a woman’s world.
I’m speaking of the Career Girl of today. She’s the young lady, who for the last few years, while you were indigesting K-rations, was earning so much riveter’s overtime pay that she didn’t know what to do with it all, except to become economically independent, and in doing so forgot all she knows about femininity.. For when it comes to appearing and acting feminine the latest batch of the nation’s lovelies are a sorrowful bunch. Accustomed to the nine-to-five routine, as smart dumpy executives, they have formed a legion of tailored mannequins, each with the warmth and personality equal to my new Westinghouse ice-box.
European Woman Superior?
It will all come out in the wash, as the saying goes, for even today it still provokes no end of ire on the part of the American girl when her newly returned GI friend tells her how nice the French, German or Australian girls are. As a former Stars and Stripes correspondent recently noted, the European woman is heads-and-shoulders above her American counterpart when it comes to displaying a few of the proprieties normally expected of women in public. And to say, “Well, why not go back overseas,” is a poor argument. Instead of poise and feminine charm, the American woman appears in public, radiant—with a rude, brash cacophony born of long hours dictating the policies of a business office.
For an example let’s turn to my home town, New York, and a friend of mine
16
who is out of the Navy six months. He has found that readjustment to normal life with his wife can’t be done by the numbers. It is all SNAFU. I saw him during the Christmas vacation. He expressed fear for his marriage, and his home, or rather HER home, and there’s where the trouble is. While he was overseas his wife got a fine position as a fashion coordinator with a large firm. She also had the foresight to get a nice apartment. Now whenever she mentions the apartment or anything in it she says, “mine” and never “ours.”
Self-Sufficient Females
All in all, it appears to me that the modern female is considering herself an entirely self-sufficient individual, one free from that bothersome necessity of a guy in pants. If you want this situation brought home to you clearly, just peek in today’s comic books. “Super Woman” among others, hits you right between the eyes. Charles Moulton, her creator, has based his comic strip on the theory that within 100 years the world will be dominated by a race of Amazons, leaders in science and industry, and everything else for that matter.
I guess it’ll be MRS. and Mr. Olwell someday.—Career Girls, phooey!
Toledo Party Success Despite Near Flood
Members of the Toledo Club gave a mid-semester party on January 26, 1947. Held at the Ottawa Hills Tea House, the affair began at 8:30 and lasted till 12:00. In charge of preparation were Charles Comes, Harold and James Hoffman and George Korhumel.
Good fortune surrounded committee members when at the last moment they learned that the place which had been rented, the Toledo Tennis Club was flooded and therefore it would be impossible to hold the party there. The Tennis Club might have been large enough to accommodate 25 couples, though the committee had no idea what they would do with any extra guests. A happy solution was found when the Tea House became available, for this location boasted of three large rooms, more than enough to accommodate any number of couples which might attend. The party was a huge success.
Business Employing More College Men *;
EVANSTON, Ill.—(I.P.)—An in-crease of 51 per cent over the prewar year 1940 in the employment of inex- | perienced college and university gradu-ates by business and industry is expected ' in 1947, according to Frank S. Endicott, 4 director of the bureau of placement of Northwestern University.	]
Endicott’s survey, for which 110 com-panies supplied information, indicated that 90 firms estimated their needs for inexperienced college graduates during 1947 to be 4,871, an average of 54 per * company. Spokesmen for the firms told 4 Endicott that they expect the need to continue at the same level for several » years, provided there is no national economic setback.
The greatest need in 1947 will be for engineers, 2,315 of them among the 90	*
companies, in this order: chemical, me-chanical, electrical, civil and aeronautical. Second only to the need for engineers V will be that for men with general business training received in schools of commerce or colleges of liberal arts. Chemists and salesmen place third and fourth, respectively.
In view of the greatly increased en- I rollment in colleges and universities, an h oversupply was predicted in certain fields by 48 per cent of the respondents.
Continued shortages in other fields were predicted by 47 per cent. Fields in which an oversupply was forecast in-elude personnel work, business administration, accounting, industrial engineering, and advertising. Shortages were predicted in engineering, chemistry, physics, and secretarial work.
Buffalo Club Elects Shine
John P. Shine, of North Tonawanda, N. Y., a commerce student who returned to the University of Notre Dame in March, 1946, after four and one-half years in the Army, has been elected president of the Buffalo Club at Notre Dame. Other officers are Donald E. Colgrove, vice-president; John A. LaVigne, secretary, and James J. Jacobi, treasurer. All three are from Buffalo, N. Y.
Wanted at Iowa State: the formula for the white paint used on the campus walks at homecoming. Ben W.

V It is not to be expected, however, that those in possession of the formula will publicize the fact.	((

! w Glee Club Completes Extended Tour; Stranded in Sheboygan By Blizzard
Under the direction of Dr. Daniel H. , Pedtke the Notre Dame Glee Club com-’■ pleted its latest concert tour at the end of last month. Members agreed that the trip was very successful.
‘ Leaving Notre Dame on Sunday morning, January 26, the boys first traveled 5 to Joliet, Illinois, giving their first conceit of the series before a packed house that evening. Immediately after the per-formance the group left for Rockford, Illinois. On the following day they were A entertained by Mr. Edward Gannon at his estate, Meadow Lane. The men were enthusiastic about the “wonderful” treatment accorded them.
On the night of the 27th they sang before another capacity house at the t West High School auditorium in Rockford. After the concert they were given a dinner dance in the Rainbow Room of ' the Faust Hotel by the Young Ladies’ ! Guild of Rockford. Their visit was brought to a close on the next day with a luncheon at Mr. Gannon’s estate.
Snowstorm Impedes Progress u
On the 28th, at Appleton, Wisconsin, the next stop on the tour, Dr. Pedtke directed the group in a performance before r a near-capacity audience. After the concert they traveled to Sheboygan through * a heavy snowstorm. In Sheboygan Dick ; Conrady, Notre Dame alumnus of the class of ’41, received them. He was in charge of entertainment for the glee club during its stay in Sheboygan.
By this time the snowfall was begin-» ning to impede traffic. When the boys began their concert, they realized just ”	how deep it had become. Although eight
i	hundred tickets had been sold for the
J .
event, only one hundred and fifty people * were able to attend.
Originally planning to return to Notre Dame from Sheboygan on the night of . the 29th, Dr. Pedtke was unable to bring the group back before the 31st. Even then they drove from Sheboygan to Milwaukee through fourteen-foot drifts. The trip, a matter of two hundred fifty miles, took fourteen hours.
One of the men remarked that by the f time they reached the Circle everyone was in a state of near-collapse from exhaustion.
। Dr. Pedtke considered the results of 1 4 the tour to be very satisfying. The glee J club, he said, received excellent reviews f in the newspapers of all the cities it , visited.
Members of the organization praised Dr. Pedtke for his capable management of the trip. They also were grateful to Brother Robert, C.S.C., who accompanied them.
Soloists in the series of performances were Charles Thomas Devine, Roy O’Neil, Jack Owen and Nolan Kehan. Coming on the agenda for the Glee Club is a performance at Fort Wayne on the last weekend in February. After that it will give concerts on the first four weekends in March at St. Joseph, Michigan, Indianapolis, Morris, Illinois, and at Rosary College, River Forest, Illinois, respectively. Plans are being made for an eastern tour of ten days after exams. States which the group will probably visit are Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, and Pennsylvania.

Museum Has Display of Diamond Replicas
By ALVIN FEUER
Competing with physics and math for popularity in the Science Building, the museum has been buried and lost under a mass of mathematical formulaes. It is about time it was dug out, polished up a bit, and brought to the attention of that portion of the student body who possibly have never heard of it until now.
I admit the most fascinating article of interest is the old moose head, lying defiantly on the floor in the rear. In the showcase next to it, however, is a model exhibit of fifteen of the world’s largest diamonds. The replicas are, of course, only made of glass; but the most exciting one is the Hope Diamond, which is a deep blue in color and is undoubtedly the most famous blue diamond in captivity. The curator is also trying to acquire a glass model of the Cullinan diamond, which was originally the size of a man’s fist, but now has been cut into nine smaller stones.
Another object of interest is the exhibit of precious amber that came from the countries bordering on the Baltic Sea. Amber- is probably the oldest gem mineral and was formed from the sap of ancient trees. Insects were often trapped in the resin and some of the amber specimens contain them.
The Science Museum was started by Father Zahm over 50 years ago and has grown rapidly since then, until now it
includes thousands of objects from sulphur crystals of Mount Vesuvius to a model of the Rosetta-stone. One of the oldest pieces in the collection is a petrified log from Arizona that weighs approximately 300 pounds and may be used as a chair if your feet are aching after that long run from the Social Science Building. Fossil forms of many plants and ancient marine life are also included with a large variety of quartz formations and minerals. There is a collection of Uranium ores and even a scale that can weigh an amount as small as one two-hundredths of a milligram, in case anyone has anything that weighs that much, especially after an expensive week-end.
The next time you are in the vicinity of the Science Building, stumble in and acquire some of that knowledge they say isn’t found in textbooks; and maybe the next time someone asks if you have seen the new Ammonites giganteus, you will know better than to answer, “No, what hall is he in?”
Hinkel Lauds 'Tribune1 At Press Club Meet
The South Bend Tribune was characterized as a model small-city newspaper and worthy of study by student journalists by John V. Hinkel, director of the Department of Public Information at the University of Notre Dame, speaking at a meeting Tuesday of the Notre Dame Press Club, composed of more than 40 students in the Department of Journalism at Notre Dame.
Mr. Hinkel offered advice to the Notre Dame journalists based on his experience as a newspaperman from 1930 to 1940, most of that time with the New York Times.
Students can learn a great deal of the techniques of newswriting, editorial writing, advertising, newspaper makeup, and other important phases of newspaper work, he said, by using the Tribune as “a living text.”
At the election of officers which preceded Mr. Hinkel’s address, deadlocks occurred in the election of a president and a secretary, while Paul Limont, of Pittsfield, Mass., was elected treasurer of the club. At next week’s meeting, the members will be called upon to choose between Noel Digby, of New Orleans La., and John W. Noonan, of Medford, Mass., for president, and between William Brown, of Chicago, and William Mulcahy, of Merrick, N. Y., for secretary. John V. Hupf, of Pittsburgh, Pa., was retained as vice-president.

DEPAUL, CONQUEROR OF KENTUCKY, PLAYS IRISH NET SQUAD MONDAY
By PETE BROWN
In the white trunks Monday night will be Notre Dame, who was beaten by Kentucky, 60-30, and in the blue trunks DePaul who beat Kentucky, 53-47. This should be the top home game of the season and a scrap to the finish.
On the season records of both teams, it would seem unlikely that such scores could be possible. But this season seems to be slightly queer that way. Illinois with their Whiz Kids back in the saddle seemed to be a cinch for the Western Conference title. Now, because of several setbacks, they are fighting to stay in the first division. Iowa, now guarding ninth position in the Big Nine, is the same team that almost won the title last year.
Notre Dame among the midwestern independents (news service title) was picked to have a good season. They beat Indiana for their first big test and then lost an overtime decision to Wisconsin. As it has turned out, the low-rated Badgers are now leading the Conference. The next crippling blow was administered by Purdue, but that was avenged. Then came what was thought at the time the coup de grace, the Kentucky slaughter. But the agonizing groans lasted only a week. DePaul stepped on the scene
18
and accomplished what only one other team in the country had done. They beat Kentucky.
DePaul is another member of the select midwestern independents. Before the season they were rated low because of the loss through graduation of George Mikan, their 6'-9" All-American center. Nothing was done by the Demons to disprove their rating. They plodded along beating teams like Chicago Teachers College and Michigan State and getting beat by Oklahoma A. & M. and Bowling Green. Then suddenly they departed from the form sheet and upset Kentucky.
This year’s DePaul team, who the rating experts considered their last reputation saver, is coached by Ray Meyer, a pupil of the late George Keogan and captain of the ’36-’37 and ’37-’38 Notre Dame squads. Meyer’s boys are Gene Stump and John Federinko at forwards, Whitey Kachan and Chuck Allen at guards, and Ed Mikan at center.
Stump, Allen and Kachan are keeping in the tradition of George Mikan by wearing the same kind of black encased glasses that the Big Man made famous. But that is not their only claim to fame. All three are pretty fair at putting the
ball in the metal hoop. Ed Mikan, the younger and smaller brother of George, a i is slow getting off his feet under the . Sa backboards, but is flawless at the fret®,^ throw line.	I ri
The battle of the independents had its
inception in 1913, but it was not until ( 16
1943 that the two schools went at it in Ba
earnest. The Irish won the first two ea battles in ’13, but DePaul has held the upper hand since the series was renewed < ida with three victories against Notre Ca Dame’s two. Last year’s initial encounter I ufv.
played here was highlighted by Bill Has- , wi set scoring his only basket of the game Ch as the gun went off, winning the game | th' for the Irish.	j Mi

IRISH MEET MARQUETTE, MICHIGAN NORMAL IN INDOOR TRACK DUEL
By UM HOWARD
Tomorrow afternoon Notre Dame will play host to Marquette and Michigan Normal in a triangular track meet in the fieldhouse at 1:30. The meet will be the first involving the three schools, consequently all marks will be records.
It will be the third contest of the season for all schools. None of the participants scored in last Saturday’s meet at Michigan State. N.D. enters the contest a favorite in view of theii- smashing triumph over Purdue two weeks ago. Marquette has a balanced squad, but no outstanding performers. Coach Conrad Jennings has built his team around twelve returning lettermen and may have a dark horse outfit. The Hilltoppers seem to possess strength in the hurdles, quarter-mile, and distances. The 440 promises to be a confusing race with Dave Murphy representing the Irish, and Dan Murphy the Milwaukee team.
Michigan Normal does not appear to have an unusually good squad, but may have a few good performers in the dashes and field events. Capt. Bill Cave is a better than average quarter-miler, and Garion Campbell is a strong contender
in the dashes. In March 1932 Notre Dame, Michigan Normal and Marquette placed in the Central Collegiates in just that order.
Last weekend’s snow storm froze Notre Dame out of the Michigan State Relays literally, as the bad weather caused the trackmen to arrive too late for their most important events. Neil Styers, and Jim Murphy were too late for the two-mile event in which they most certainly would have scored. The 75-yard high hurdles trials were already run off, so that Captain John Smith was deprived of running in his speciality.
The Irish will be home for the next, two weeks, entertaining Iowa next Saturday, and a powerful Michigan State track team on March first. Six more meets will complete the indoor season. After the dual meet with the Spartans, the Notre Dame cindermen take part in the following contests:
March 8—C.C.C. meet, East Lansing.
15—Armour Tech Relays, Chicago.
22—Purdue Relays, Lafayette. 29—Chicago Daily News meet, Chicago.

INTKCDLCING
By BOB LEANDER
This is the story of “String Bean” Brennan and not, as he would have had it, the voluminous account of the growth and importance of Bedford, Indiana, in North American living. Bedford, in case you didn’t know, is the foremost source of Indiana limestone and is known for miles around as the Home of the Nation’s Building Stone. From this town of 15,000 people, located some 75 miles south of Indianapolis, came the enormous slabs of limestone used in the construction of the Notre Dame Library. So too ■came Clarence Donovan, a basketball great of the late twenties, and Yank Terry who starred here in baseball and basketball before going on to the major leagues with the Boston Red Sox. But, again, this is the story of John Brennan.
When the season opened the Irish •eagers took the floor against little Franklin College and sitting over on the bench, lost in a blur of gold practice suits, was a 6'-4" freshman. Ball State, Indiana, Wisconsin—the games became tougher, and more and more Moose Krause felt the need for height under the basket. Finally in the holiday tussle with St. Louis U., Leo Barnhorst switched to guard and Brennan guided his size 13 brogans out to the circle and started his first ball game. It was another close one that night, 48-46, but Notre Dame won and Brennan was holding a first moi't-gage on the center lot. From then on it was all Bean’s with now and again some able assistance from lean and lanky Johnny Foley. However, the 200 pound Irishman wasn’t one to be headed as the records bear testimony; with his late start and all John Brennan is number two scorer on the squad just one point behind Frannie Curran’s 172.
That ‘and all’ is interesting too. You see, a late start wasn’t all that stood against the String Bean in his bid for honors unique among ND athletes in having played only one year of high school ball. Yet what a year that was! He went out for the team in his senior year, 1942-43, immediately took over the first string center assignment, averaged 15 points an evening, traveled with his team into the State Tournament, reached the finals only to drop a decision to Lebanon High which .boasted the mighty Paul Hoffman (currently dumping them in downstate for the Boilermakers), was named All-State, and then just to add a touch of frosting to the cake, nabbed
CENTER
academic accolades when he was elected a member of the National Honor Society. The year before he had contented himself with presiding over the junior class at Bedford High and working after school.
Following graduation came two and a half years in the Army Air Forces. John spent a good part of that time stationed in Bury St. Edmonds, England, with the 8th Air Force. As a radar mechanic there was little or no time for basketball, consequently the burly Brennan frame again stands alone as one of the few collegiate performers who missed the call of Special Services. It was only after his tour of duty and assignment to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, that John participated in any competitive caging and then there were merely four games against luke-warm competition.
The youngest of a family of seven, Bean has an older brother, Tom, also at Notre Dame. Tom is pursuing a course in Law while John is studying premedicine in hopes of someday following still another brother who has established a practice in Chicago. At present,
though, his greatest worries are physics and the possibility of facing Kentucky again sometime.
Beard of the Wildcats is the greatest । basketball player he has ever seen, ranking ahead of the previously Paul Hoffman. In looking back on that Kaintuck holocaust, the best that can be said by the String Bean or anyone else is that * the entire Wildcat offense caught fire and our outfit just couldn’t find its way out of the blaze, being lucky to get out of the Louisville auditorium without the roof caving in actually as well as figuratively. But it’s an ill wind that blows no good, John. That Kentucky defeat will >-just add to the enjoyment next year when now both Army and the Southern Colonels qualify to be shellacked and and sent back home as museum pieces.
35 Candidates Report for Bengal Practice
Rumors are being wafted in the campus air this week like a feather in a whirlwind. The biggest University Boxing Championships ever to be held in Notre Dame’s history seems to be in the offing. With the Prelims on March 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th, and the Championships on Saint Patrick’s Day, the racing forms are being put away and the second at Hialeah is being forgotten.
This year’s bouts have a special flavor in that prediction is impossible. The ages of the opponents may differ as much as eight years. The ring experience may vary just as much. The champ of ’41 wonders if the old legs will hold up; but the young 18-year-old keeps his open eye on that shifty veteran. This appears to be a fine tournament of champions. Yet again watching the daily workouts in the Boxing Room in the Fieldhouse, despite the presence of the big names of yesterday, the observer soon notices the bouncing aggressiveness of the unknown quantities in this group of glove pushers. There are 35 men who have definitely entered themselves and many others are known to be working out secretly in the early morning hours.
In the workouts held from 3:30 to 5:30 daily, Coach Napolitano has worked out a pretty thorough conditioning program for each day. Roadwork and wind sprints on 220 track; calisthentics, roap skipping, bag punching, instructions and review in fundamentals and a little 2-min-ute session with the gloves will give anyone a pretty good remedy for poor rind.
Hearing all this activity over at the gym, hearing tales of a terrific stable of left-jabbers and right-crossers from Philadelphia and the potential one-two

INTRODUCING
I
•>
By JIM LEONARD
With two years of college mile triumphs behind him, William George Leonard is entering his third season confident that this will be his best year. He is such a consistent winner and record breaker that he is ranked among the ten top milers in the country.
Bill first gave notice of his unusual running ability at Nott Terrace High School in Schenectady, New York, where he took the state mile championship three straight years, setting a record of 4:29 his last year. He finished second in the National Interscholastic mile at Madison Square Garden in 1942. Before coming to Notre Dame he added the New York state cross-country title, the Manhattan cross-country and Syracuse cross-country victories to his growing list of distance accomplishments.
Entering Notre Dame in the fall of 1942, Bill became the first freshman in twenty-five years to win a monogram. This feat was accomplished with the aid of relaxed rules for college competition due to the war. His first year in collegiate track saw the continuance of record shattering as he ran on the two-mile record holding squad and the distance medley championship team at the Purdue Relays. With Frank Conforti, Tony Maloney, and Ollie Hunter, he contributed to the establishment of the world’s record in the indoor four-mile relay to round out his freshman year.
In the spring of 1943, Leonard was admitted to that distinctive outfit, the infantry. He served two years with the 30th Infantry Division, winning the Bronze Star for bravery, and two special citations from Belgium and Holland for his part in the liberation of those two countries. Landing on D-day plus one, he participated in five major engagements, going all the way from Utah beach through St. Lo, to within twenty-five miles of Berlin.
Bill returned to Notre Dame in Novem-

punch being developed by the traditional Saint Ed’s A. C., leads me to wonder when the man with the tickets is going to ask me to open my door. Nappy’s tutelage and the well-known scrap of the fighters themselves should combine to give us some bouts containing that ingredient which decides a good fight—in the words of Doctor “Nappy”—“A few good punches properly thrown.”
—Michael Kiely

MILER
ber of 1945. He immediately picked up his track equipment, and won seven straight indoor mile contests before losing to Leslie MacMitchel and Tommy Quinn in the Banker’s Mile at the Chicago Relays. He went on to capture the Central Collegiate Mile and half-mile crowns to close his second year. Leonard’s best mile time to date is 4:16, set in the Central Collegiate his freshman year. Both Bill and his coach, Elvin “Doc” Handy, feel this should be his best year. In his first contest of the present season, he turned in a 4:25 performance, and he wasn’t pushed to his limit. Strict training, even to the extent of forsaking feminine companionship during the track season, has been an important factor in Leonard’s distance successes. This year Bill hopes to take his record below the 4:15 mark.
Winning a place on the 1948 Olympic team is his major ambition. If Bill accomplishes this, he will be the first N.D. man since 1932 to represent the United States. The trials for the Olympics will be held this summer. The first three men in each track and field event in a meet between collegiate champs and A.A.U.
winners will automatically become members of the team.
The greatest experiences in his life include running in the Wanamaker mile and the Banker’s mile last year against Les MacMitchel and Tommy Quinn. Taking first place in both the mile and halfmile in last year’s Central Collegiates was also one of Bill’s biggest thrills.
Leonard, who is a Junior physical education major, hopes to coach track and teach History after graduation. He wants to coach in the East so that he can compete in some of the famous indoor contests held in that section every year. The twenty-three year old dark-haired cinderman is a versatile athlete, having a special talent with a tennis racquet and swimming like a champ. One of his favorite pastimes is relaxing in bed listening to the music of Vaughn Monroe. Eating is a large scale task with Bill who needs an abundance of energy for those grueling distance runs which should be record breaking this year.
Bill received an invitation last Monday from the National Athletic Association to run in the 1000-yard dash in Madison Square Garden a week from tomorrow. The University has given Bill permission, to make the trip.
Fencers Defeat Ohio State for Second Win
After the lead see-sawed several times; during the early stages of the matchy the Notre Dame fencing squad pulled away from a 7-7 deadlock to defeat a hard pressing Ohio State Buckeye, 16-11, for its second win in three starts before 200 onlookers last Friday night in the fencing room of the Field House. The match was under the direction of Eugene Williams, veteran fencer from Chicago.
Though the Buckeyes supplied worthy, keen competition, the Irish took the decision in all three weapon departments, winning the foil, 5-4; sabre, 6-3; epee, 5-4. Jimmy Jansen virtually cinched the match when he won his second epee bout.
The individual scoring went like this: Gonzalez, 4; DiCicco, 5%; Ortiz, 2; Jansen, 2%; Witucki, 1; Schlosser, 1. Coach Herb Melton’s prediction made earlier in the season regarding the probability of Mike DiCicco breaking the Notre Dame record for total matches won in a single season seems to be shaping up just that way. DiCicco’s 5% against Ohio brought his season’s total to 17.
Tonight at 7:30 the Meltonmen cross swords with the Northwestern Wildcats in the first of a home and home match series. The match marks the first renewal between the two schools since 1940; on March 4 the Irish journey to Evanston for the return engagement.

CAMPUS CLUBS
By BOB VIERHILE
; TIMES HAVE CHANGED: f-
The Christian Science Monitor (the । lilywhite journal which still thinks card sharks are an extinct species of fish) jumped off the deep end this week, claimed in big, black print that silk stockings were on their last legs. As things stand, should we assume that citizen Al Capone will be named their “Humanitarian of :	the Year” next week. . . . Former cinder-
hoofer Frank MacCauley, Met clubber who was “introduced” on the sports pages of the Scholastic in 1943 as an exact copy of Glenn Cunningham, reread his clippings this week, looked into a mirror, decided that he was a truer copy of Sydney Greenstreet. . . . Add to the Notre Dame handbook: Alumni, Dillon and Walsh Halls, long known as the r Gold Coast, had their rivals last week.
Zahm, Cavanaugh, Breen-Phillips and Farley Halls are now being dubbed the COLD Coast.

FOOLS' DAY FOLLY:
On April 1st at the Indiana Club, the Notre Dame basketball squad and guests will be accorded more than a diet of beans. According to the Villager’s Club, sponsor of the affair, those present will be chucked full of meat, potatoes, speeches and basketball. The list of tentative speakers includes such sports monickers as Adolph Rupp, Kentucky University cage mentor; Tony Hinkle, Butler U.; Dutch Lonberg, Northwestern; Doug Mills, Illinois; Johnny Wooden, Indiana State; Jim Costin of Jim Costin Says. Bill Fox, sports scribe on the Indianapolis News, is being lined up as toast
master. Ducats for the dinner will go on sale at the downtown ticket liveries (Sonneborn’s, Bruggner’s etc.) and in the cafe basement in about a week. General admission will be $3; students $2.50. The headaches and hurrahs are being handled by Villagers Tom Hynes, Jim Miller, Joe Hickey, Jack Miles, Art Clark, Bill Sheehan and Ed Andozeyew-ski, members of the entertainment committee.
FROM THE CORNFIELDS:
Not since 1942 had it happened. Last week Bob Newgard of Des Moines went clubbing for lowans, found a corn-crib-ful. On February 6th over fifty of them met in a body (pardon the expression) and decided to put the long defunct Iowa Club back on the profit side of the ledger. So this week the Iowa Club became the 66th campus club at Notre Dame. Said revivalist Newgard, “We have the welcome mat out for you Iowa cornhuskers. If you’re interested in our club contact Ben Condon at 206 Dillon, Dick Leslie at 303 Lyons, Frank Kneeland at 230 Alumni or myself at 341 Morrissey.” As Bob had said, all they needed now was more corn fodder.	’

They claim that “Schlitz did not make Milwaukee famous, only gave it a big head.”

WITH THE STEELERS:
The character who made the classic crack that Notre Dame is deader than an Egyptian tomb should have dropped in on the Pittsburgh Club meeting last Thursday evening. It started with a * touchdown by touchdown description by John Mastrangelo, program weight 210, of the Notre Dame-Navy game. John modestly admitted that that game was “the hardest way I know of building character.” Following a few bottles of cheer, the club elected John Ducato of Arnold, Penn., president; Jack Collins of Midland, vice-president; Bernie Powers of Pittsburgh, secretary; Leo Vogel, Pittsburgh, treasurer. John Ducato picked up the gavel immediately, pounded out plans for an after-Lent semi-formal dance. Don Fitzpatrick was named entertainment chairman, while Bob Slocum was made publicity chief.
OLD SKELETONS:
No sooner was king football laid to rest than his skeleton was dug up again. Bob Casurella and Louis Louro of Chicago and Akron have come up with another alphabet club paralleling last year’s SPATNC club. They call their brain child WAFOTS (Wallop Army For Old Times Sake).
HOT COPY:
While opening up this morning’s mail, I noticed a suspicious looking letter marked “handle with care.” Overlooking this warning, I ripped open the envelope hurriedly. I dropped it just as fast; it was hotter- than six feet in you-know-what. After treatment for “third degree” burns at the Infirmary, I came back armed with a pair of asbestos gloves and fire extinguisher, proceeded to read the following: “Look,” snapped the letter,

EXPLANATION:
According to Roy Lang, maestro of the Notre Dame Cavaliers (and he should know), his outfit definitely will not play at the Rebel’s Mardi Gras festivities tomorrow. Whatever the orchestra is, it is not the Cavaliers, he emphasized. And so we hasten to rectify last week’s error.
POLITICKING:
From the bottom of a stuffed ballot box we learned that the Illini Club has changed hands. Jim Cassidy of Peoria, Ill., is now in the driver’s seat, while Jim Twomey of Bloomington is holding down the secretary slot. John Amberg and Bob Mahoney, both of Peoria, were elected vice-president and treasurer respectively. . . . The California Club high command also got an airing out last week when footballer Bill Vangen of Bell, California, was elected president; politico John Glaab of Long Beach, vicepresident; John Clarke of Santa Monica, secretary; shovel-handed Kevin O’Shea of San Francisco, treasurer.
ELECTRONICS ENGINEER
MINNESOTA '37
The Story of
DICK LONGFELLOW
NO small factor in Dick Longfellow’s decision to come with General Electric was the knowledge that at G.E. he could continue his studies in electronics engineering.
Dick had grown up with electronics. He had operated his own amateur radio station when he was 14, and at Minnesota he had specialized in communications.
With this background of intensive study, he was well-prepared to take advantage of the courses available to him at General Electric. His outstanding work during two years of high-frequency studies earned him electronics assignments first, in the Research Laboratory, and later, in 1940, with the Transmitter Division.
Since then Dick Longfellow has been shaping for himself the kind of a career he began planning long ago. He has worked in television, has designed ultra high frequency radio tubes, has contributed to the development of radar. Today, after ten years with G.E., he is Chief Engineer of the company’s Electronics Specialty Division.
Next to school* and the U.S. Government, General Electric employs more college engineering graduates than any other organization.
An engineer for his University broadcasting station, Dick handled controls during football broadcasts.
Among his present assignments is included work on radio sonde equipment, used to determine weather data.

Fr. Boland Returns to Head
Dept, of Political Science
On leave of absence since February 1943, Rev. Francis J. Boland, C.S.C., formerly dean of the College of Arts and Letters, has been appointed head of the Department of Political Science, replacing Paul C. Bartholomew, who has been acting head of the department.
Father Boland, a Navy chaplain and a lieutenant commander at time of discharge, returns to the campus after serving on the U.S.S. Highland, which carried the first occupation troops into Japan and saw action in the invasion of Iwo Jima and Okinawa.
A Massachusetts-born author (Catholic Principle's of Politics), he was graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1918, and received his doctor* of philosophy degree from Catholic University in 1924. Except for a period as vice-president of St. Edwards University, in Austin, Texas, Father Boland has been a member of the Economics and Political Science Departments since 1924, organizing the latter in 1935. He also held the position of prefect of discipline (1934-37) and was dean of Arts and Letters from 1940 until he entered the Navy.	—Shaun McDermott

Lyons, Howard Lead West Division of Interhall League; B-P Tops East
By BUZZ WRIGHT and JOE DOYLE
Another week of cage play at the Rockne Memorial left only three teams with unblemished records in the Interhall Heavyweight League.
In the Western Division high-scoring Lyons and fast-breaking Howard are tied for first place with two victories and no losses. The former quintet whipped Morrissey 36-20, while Coach John Pittello’s Howard five outscored Dillon 42-37. In other games the past week Badin fell before Alumni 42-29 and Dillon bested last-place Morrissey 35-25.
Unbeaten Breen-Phillips held first place in the Eastern sector by snaring their second win, a 36-20 decision over luckless Cavanaugh. Meanwhile, Coach Frank Mancino’s St. Edward’s Saints stayed close behind with two victories and a single defeat. The Saints edged Walsh 36-34 and then rallied to top Cavanaugh by a 25-22 count. Farley was initiated into the league by losing a heart-breaking 24-23 decision to Sorin, but Zahm trounced the latter 35-19.
Zahm leads the four-team Lightweight League after disposing of last-place Cavanaugh 31-25. In other contests B-P downed Cavanaugh 24-15, but took a 30-14 shellacking from Morrissey.
Openers were played in both the Club League and the Graduate League during the past week. The Villagers were 27-21 victims of the Aesculapians, and the Chemical Engineers won by 37-18 over the Chemists.

Father Norton said once that there are graduates of this University who still think that they were taught by Jesuits. We didn’t take him seriously at * the time, but now we’re beginning to wonder. On the society page of the Cleveland Press we found this bit of subtle blasphemy, “Tea will be served following a discussion centering around the poetry of Rev. Father Charles L. O’Donnell, S.J.” Pretty soon Fordham will claim to ' have discovered synthetic rubber.

We will admit to letter- writer Robert Stock that Dining Hall cooks don’t know how to cook weiners, but they certainly k try often enough. We do think that when it comes to the stage where weiners are served three times in one week, as they were recently, a serious protest is justified. As Peter Lind Hayes said the
other night, “Our weiners are untouched by human hands, unseen by human eyes, and unfit for human consumption.”
We’ve heard of St. Cyril of Jerusalem and St. John of the Cross, but we must confess were surprised to hear on the radio Sunday about St. Joseph of Mishawaka downing St. Stanislaus of Benton Harbor.
♦
As far as we’re concerned this Old University is hobbling into the Atomic Age on crutches. Last week’s Scholastic reported that back in 1879 it took only three months to erect the hulking Main Building. It also said that under favorable auspices the remodeling of the wartsize Huddle would be done within two months of the initial scratch. With two weeks of the semester already gone we’re afraid to ask to have our locker door fixed.
The Sunday Chicago Tribune reported with becoming modesty that “Juneau (Alaska, of course) hails first Tribunes shipped by air. . . . Papers eagerly snatched up in Alaskan capital. ‘This is the kind of reading I like,’ declared Sen. E. B. Collins. . . . ‘We don’t get enough of it up here’.” Perhaps the senator, Republican, (or did you guess?) has something. Why not ship all the Tribunes there?

The purpose of this column isn’t to treat jazz alone, but there should be a < further word on another great blues artist. Last week Bessie Smith was mentioned and this week she is recommended
4 again, along with a note on her- life. The note is from a book that is important for it records a part of American history, not from the top looking down, but from ‘ the bottom looking up, in deference to Mr. Lowbrow and Highbrow alike. The book is Really The Blues, written by Milton “Mezz” Mezzrow and Bernard Wolfe; published by Random House at $3.00.
' “Bessie maybe never practiced her scales in any conservatory of music, but she was an artist right down to her fingertips—a very great artist, born with silver strings for vocal cords and a foaming, churning soul to keep them aquiver.
( _____.............. .....—
“Her style was so individual that nobody else ever grasped it. The way she let her rich music tumble out was a perfect example of improvisation—the melody meant nothing to her, she made up her own melody to fit the poetry of her story, phrasing all around the original tune if it wasn’t just right, making the vowels come out just the right length, dropping the consonants that might trip up her story, putting just enough emphasis on each syllable to make you really know what she was getting at. She lived every story she sang; she was just telling you how it happened to her.
“You ever hear what happened to that fine, full-of-life female woman? You know how she died? Well, she went on for years, being robbed by stingy managers, having to parade around in gaudy gowns full of dime-store junk and throw away her great art . . . there must have
been plenty of nights when she got the blues she couldn’t lose, but she went on singing, pouring out the richness and the beauty in her that never dried up. Then one day in 1937 she was in an automobile crash down in Mississippi, and her arm was almost torn out of its socket. They brought her to the hospital but it seemed like there wasn’t any room for her just then—the people around there didn’t care for the color of her skin. The car turned around and drove away, with Bessies’s blood dripping on the floormat. She was finally admitted to another hospital where the official must have been color-blind, but by that time she had lost so much blood that they couldn’t operate on her, and a little later she died. See that lonesome road, Laivd, it got to end, she used to sing. That was how the lonesome road ended up for the greatest folk singer this country ever heard.”
That’s all on Bessie Smith, and it’s a recommendation of her to anyone that cares or wants to know what the blues mean. Go down to the record shop and just ask to listen to some of her recordings. If you’re a non-believer when you come out, well—ounce-brain!

CAMPUS MYSTERY
Last week’s ill wind blew less good than usual. South Bend FBI officials, acting on an anonymous tip from a hysterical phone caller, entered a local eating establishment, carried off one Lucretia Borgia, accused of perpetrating the epidemic of food poisoning which laid many an ND man lower than usual.
Smelling an insidious plot against the American way of life, the Scholastic sent out national feelers, tried to find out what manner of plot it was, sounded out many national figures on their opinion of the catastrophe.
Said Arnall Ellison, erstwhile governor of Georgia, “This Borgia is from Georgia.” Said his rival, Summon Bum-mon, “This is a vicious attempt to destroy that great American protection organization, the Ku Klux Klan.”
Reached at his Chicago estate, where he was found pruning a plum tree, Col. McCormick Roberts, historian, inventor, editor, prophet, and all manner of things, had more to say. Bellowed he, shaking his gray mane in the February blizzard, “This is a communistic attempt to overthrow the democratic way of life, the Midwest, Chicago, the Great Lakes, and the Republican Party. Miss Borgia’s name is really Borgiavitch. She comes from Pinsk by way of Hyde Park. Furthermore, she is in the employ of the Dowager Duchess of Kent. I will publish a more complete expose next week.”
The New York newspaper, The Wailing Jerker, editorialized on the matter, “This is obviously a plot of the fascist reactionaries to destroy the proletariat and the right of the workers of the world to unite. It is an insidious project which has in mind solely to defame the name of Lenin and to turn the Kremlin into a dime store. The Borgia woman is the sixth cousin of Mussolini in disguise.”
Less certain was Eastbrook Eggler, who could not decide if Miss Borgia was a tool of Press, Fay, Elliot Roosevelt, or George Raft, but knew that any or all of them might have had a hand in it. Declared he, “I am absolutely certain that this Borgia person is but a minor tool in a great and organized attempt to destroy permanently the true freedom of the American workingman, to work where he chooses without interference from a Union. Miss Borgia may be Phil Murray in disguise.”
At presstime, Miss Borgia had refused to crack. FBI men shook their heads in despair: She had sat through “Three Wise Fools” three times without breaking. Asked for comment, she shook her locks defiantly, would only mutter, “I come from an old respected family. I shall not submit to such vicious persecution. I got my rights.”

Valentine, but the sentiments are just as lush. But whether it was the birds, the Norman word for “wolf,” or the Roman “hit or miss” method of getting a date that was responsible for the practice of sending Valentines on February 14th, it seems probable the Atomic Age won’t interrupt the flow of “sweet nothings” through the mails. That is, human nature being what it is.
VETS FAVOR TRAINING
(Continued from p. 9) thirteen - week Infantry Replacement Training Course.”
Provision was also made for further technical training for “such men as display an aptitude and desire,” within limits of military necessity, in order to establish a permanent nucleus of technically trained personnel. Such technical training, under the terms of the resolution, would be subsidized by the government and conducted in civilian schools.
The resolution forcefully condemned the “immoral attitudes and crude treatment” that was so widely prevalent during the last war, and called for the treatment of trainees under UMT as gentlemen. To effect this, recommendation was made for the training of instructors of high moral integrity, “devoid of the false materialistic attitudes characteristic of many of the officer and non - commissioned training personnel during the last war.”
Besides Notre Dame, two additional mens’ schools in the Fort Wayne region were represented on the Veterans Affairs Commission, which drew up the resolution following three heated sessions. Representatives of St. Joseph’s and of Aquinas College (Grand Rapids, Mich.) took part in the Commission discussions.
An indication of the widespread interest engendered at the congress on the subject of universal military training came at the conclusion of the reading of the resolution by Commission Chairman Tom McCaffery. A wave of applause greeted the resolve, spontaneously joined in by female delegates from St. Francis College and co-ed Aquinas. It was immediately moved and seconded that the resolution be adopted, but a tabling motion was made and became enmeshed in faulty parliamentary procedure. When it finally came to a vote, however, the latter motion was soundly defeated; and the resolution was subsequently approved without a single “nay*’ being registered.
Besides Chairman Tom McCaffery, the Notre Dame delegation on the Veterans Affairs Commission at the regional congress included: Bill Walsh, Bob Flannery, Roger Cahaney, Dave Mosier, Fred Veit, Bill Hoene, Dave Slattery and Frank Keenan.

Boating Club Once Sailed on St. Joe’s
By JOSEPH T. MALONEY
There was a time in our Alma Mater’s history when St. Joe’s Lake was more than just a liquid splotch separating us from our beloved neighbors on the ‘Rock.’ In Father Lemonnier’s day, our undoubtedly clever predecessors found a use for this body of water other than the esthetic—boating.
This adventure (?) bent circle founded a club to which they gave the official monicker of the “St. Joe’s Boating Club.” The first boats they procured were large cumbersome jobs which they rightly nicknamed, “barges.” They christened their new crafts The Santa Maria, The Pinta and their staff boat, the Nina (more evidence of N.D. originality.) They built a boathouse on the lake shore, and held races twice annually, viz.: St. Ed’s and Commencement Day.
The new proposition clicked, and the club was obliged to buy two other boats, six-oared specimens, which they named the Evangeline and the Minnehaha.
When Father Lemonnier died, the club, always an ardent admirer of the former president, was duly renamed the Lemonnier Boating Club in his honor. As the club prospered, more equipment was purchased in an effort to build a wellsized, up-to-date fleet of racers.
Gradually, the old boathouse became obsolete due to the increase in boats, and a two-story replacement complete with a gym and reading room was erected.
The races were always started at the east end of the lake, and the crews sprinting off towards the opposite end, rounded a buoy placed there, and started back to the initial point.
However, heated competitions weren’t the only interests of the club, and they considered pleasure trips just as necessary. Occasionally, the boats were carried to the St. Joe. River, and the boys made an all day affair of rowing downstream twelve miles to Niles, stopping on the way for a picnic lunch. When night fell and the trip was completed, the boys tiredly hauled themselves and their boats on a train for the trip back home.
The club soared in popularity to become one of the outstanding groups on the campus, but it never quite reached the point of intercollegiate competition. Its last phase of life ended somewhere in the late nineties. Now this club is almost lost from all memory, and the races are no more, but perhaps one of these days some group of students with Viking instincts and a love for the “wet” will once again re-establish a boating club at N.D.
