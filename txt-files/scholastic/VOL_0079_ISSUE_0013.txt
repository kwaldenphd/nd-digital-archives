“Whip The Wolverines!”
ONE FOR THE BOOKS
Great game last week. Nice plays. Nice scoring. Nice going, team. The N. R. 0. T. C., spic and span to the last man, kept their distance from the rest of us who were woefully in want of pleasant companionship. Not only were the Walsh boys the best-dressed set in the stadium; their associates were eye filling. As usual (and we told you so) the best of the flock were the dates from
By the way, the pep rally wasn’t bad at all; but it lasted forever, and that is not necessary; almost made us miss the show in the Navy drill hall, a show by far the best yet presented.... We missed the Engineers’ Ball, but were told that it lived up to all expectations, thus proving that a Friday night dance can still be staged successfully. Incidentally, with all the big week-end celebration, we are having the devil’s own time trying to raise $3.00 for that Ann Arbor trip. Fortunately, we ran into a program salesman and achieved our goal.

the “Rock”. . . . From one of our usually reliable sources comes the report that one of the Marines was seen standing up during the third quarter—sort of a seventh-inning stretch, no doubt.
ORCHIDS TO
The Navy officer who jumped out of the stands to lead the Middies in a cheer for Georgia Tech and a cheer for Notre Dame—that was the sporting thing to do. . . . And to those asking why Middies sat in that particular spot, here is the answer; V-7 men outrank all other Navy trainees at the school, and therefore headed the contingent of servicemen attending the game.... And wasn’t the old weatherman a gentleman, for once!__ People in the boxes are always interesting, aren’t: they? ... .We thought, the band was very good; but the play-, ing of the “Victory March” so often tends to make a highly respected song very common. We remember when everyone in the stadium used to stand with bared heads during its rendition — but that tradition was not borne out Saturday. ... By the way, Philbert, do you know of anyone with^a big-truck going by Ann Arbor this coming Saturday? We can assure the fellow that he won’t be lonesome. .	.
IT CAN HAPPEN HERE
' This business about Navy Company B is really getting serious. From our' un-' derstanding of it, there are- seven men vested with power to take demerit cards upon the slightest notice. They are affectionately called the Gestapo . Goat Guards. One of the more amiable members of this group last week even wore an arm-band with a large “G” on it....
HERE WE GO AGAIN
Ah, fall! ah, leaves that are falling! ah, the belles that take their toll! With all the dances now going on at Notre Dame, the denizens of that high-towered, hamlet are starting to hang out that old familiar shingle bearing the tell-tale. war cry: “St. Mary’s Can Go.” And that’s supposed to make everybody just too, too happy. From usually reliable sources (again), we overheard our ghost writer, Augustus Gump, declaring that a crop of unusual Freshmen over there has compelled some Seniors to stick a big neon, sign above the driveway arch, reading “(H) OPEN FOR BUSINESS.” And darn if we don’t invariably fall for it, bless their little hearts!
ROMANCE .
The big game got under way with Wilburfore and his beloved, bedraggled Mildred munching Paul’s Enriched Kreamo bread in the north stands. But alas! catastrophe struck. As Mello find the Bert went to work Mildred began to cry. She had forgotten her slide rule . . and was unable to keep track of the . score. It grieved her very much because she had. all her money sunk into a total-score pool. Wiburfore, being. a commerce man, couldn’t do a thing with-
. but a calculating machine. So tears ran down, the cheeks of pretty Millie. And as they did they cut grooves in her
make-up, and suddenly she was carried off by four guards. Wilburfore was sad. Mildred had been mistaken for Mrs. Pruneface.

100th Commencement October 29th
209 to Receive Degrees
Notre Dame’s 100th Commencement, long awaited and long planned, was announced by Rev; Hugh O’Donnell, C.S.C., president, to be held on Friday, Oct. 29.
War has modified its original scope severely, but in its present plans are the symbol and the implications that were to mark the formal closing of the University’s centenary year.
This 100th Commencement will be the last formal commencement for the duration. Those coming after this Class of 1944, — which numbers 209 on the program but an indefinitely smaller group in those who will be present to receive their degrees — will be awarded degrees in convocations at the close of each of the three war-year semesters now embodied in the calendar "year.
. Hon. Harry F. Kelly, ’17, governor of Michigan, veteran of World War I, former president of the Notre Dame Alumni Association, will deliver the Commencement address at 3 o’clock Friday afternoon, in Washington Hall.'
The baccalaureate Mass will be celebrated in Sacred Heart Church at 9 o’clock on Friday morning. .
Most Rev. William P. O’Connor, D.D., Ph.D., bishop of Superior, Wis., will preach the baccalaureate sermon Bishop O’Connor, consecrated in 1942, is a veteran-chaplain of World War I, and a former president of the American Catholic Philosophical Association. He was a member of the faculty of St. Francis Seminary, Milwaukee, for many, years.
The Mass will be celebrated by Most Rev. John F. Noll, D.D., LL.D., bishop of Fort Wayne. The flag presented to the University by the Class of 1944 will be blessed at the Mass.
A special feature of this historic commencement, echoing its original scope, will be the reading of a letter from His Holiness, Pope Pius . XII, to the University on the occasion of its centenary. Notre Dame, was one of the stops made by the present pope when he visited this
country as Cardinal Pacelli, and it has remained close to his heart.
Leo T. Crowley, recently appointed as foreign economic administrator after a brilliant record in business and public affairs, will be among those to be honored at this historic commencement with the honorary doctorate of laws. Bishop O’Connor and Governor Kelly will be so honored.
Mr. Crowley, long recognized in the Middle West as a business leader through his several enterprises in Madison and the State of Wisconsin, achieved outstanding national stature as chairman of the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and his new post gives him added honors of world scope and significance.

500 Expected at V-12 Dance Next Week
The big Notre Dame V-12 Ball, scheduled for Friday, October 15, is speedily drawing near, and approximately 500 Navy and Marine students are excitedly awaiting the night. A surprisingly large number are importing; and there are other indications that the V-12 fellows are having trouble' getting acquainted with local dates. Accordingly, a tea dance this Sunday at St. Mary’s has been arranged for the tentative Ballgoers, in an effort to strike up encouraging and new acquaintances for them.
Ticket sales to the Navy students last Tuesday were good enough to ensure the success of the dance. The additional sale of tickets to the Marines on Wednesday were proportionately high. However, due to some misunderstanding, many who had planned to go did not learn of the sales until Wednesday night. One additional day of sales, therefore, has been decided necessary to accommodate these other students. John Toole, general chairman of the dance, has accordingly just announced that those still desiring , tickets may get them on Mon
ley is a Knight of St. Gregory and an outstanding American Catholic layman.
The war-will be evident in the absence of many of those receiving degrees, and in the presence of a number of graduates in the uniforms of the services, especially the V-12 programs on the Notre Dame campus. The summer school, which did not hold a commencement during the summer, will also award its degrees, largely’in the graduate field, on Oct. 29.
AH of the extra-formal ceremonies have been dispensed with in the interest of the war program. Alumni reunions, once an integral part of commencement, have been suspended for the duration. Only the immediate families of the graduates will be in attendance.
day, October 11, but on that day only. They will be sold in 211 Dillon Hall.
This additional sale of tickets will also allow the decorations committee to continue with their plans to make this the most sumptuous ball in Notre Dame history. Nothing will be spared to detract from the Naval precedence of finery and formality. And novel ideas from the refreshment and favors committees also suggest that those attending the dance are in for a surprising night. None, however, will need bother about corsages. This was decided when it was learned that a representative number of V-12 students could not afford a bid, corsage, and haircuts altogether in one week.
At a recent meeting of committeemen, Dave Curtin, of the Marines, and Jack Whitely, of the Navy, were appointed Aides to the Captain on the night of the dance. In addition, Nagy, of the Marine. Detachment, was selected to head the favors committee; and Naval student Joe Byrne was left with the problem of transportation.

N. D. Emigrants to Pour. Into Ann Arbor;
"Student Opinion" Poll Gives Irish Edge
BY AL LESMEZ
There’s another- great day for the Irish coming up this Saturday, and very few of the clan are taking any chances of missing it. For the last two weeks frantic preparations have been in the making, money has been in the accumulating, and enthusiasm has been rising. The result will probably be a rather denuded campus tomorrow afternoon and Sunday morning, with all who can beg, borrow or steal the permission, the money, and the time taking the road for Ann Arbor and the biggest game in the country.
Many emigrants are planning to cover the distance by hitch-hiking, and a suggestion is here given to those exemplars of determination: drop into the book store and pick up the largest and most gaudy Notre Dame sticker the good Brothers have on hand and tack it to your grip. Place the grip in front of you ’ on the highway, sticker out, put a clay pipe in your mouth and a green tie around your neck, and then just stand aside and watch the passing subway alumni fight for the privilege of carrying you and your effects wherever your way wends. Preying on public sentiment may in some instances be bad, but undoubtedly the end justifies the means for this weekend.
Everyone on campus has been extended permission to go to the game, civilians through the regular channels of permissions from home through their rectors, trainees through the benedic-. tions of their superior officers, whose only consideration is that the applicants be free from a prohibiting array of demerits.
It’s going to be Notre Dame over Michigan, if popular opinion on campus can be relied on. Notre Dame has been ranked as the top team of the country, with Michigan a close second, but the service men on campus are putting their money on the Wolverines.
Bob Gludowatz was closest again in last week’s poll, and since this is the second week in a row which he has guessed so closely, we begin to suspect him of being an old forecaster. We, therefore, invite him for the second time to be the guest interviewee on tomorrow’s game with Michigan.
Sophomore Bob Gludowatz, Detroit, Mich.: “Right now it’s either Michigan or us for a national championship and I think that Saturday we’ll prove it’s
-6
us by walloping- Michigan 34-19.”
Edwin J. Wilson, V-7, Duluth, Minn.: “Michigan will win by about 14 points; the score will be 36-21 in favor of Michigan. It will be a high scoring game. Michigan has a heavy Navy backing, and so does N.D., but due to the breaks, Michigan has received the so-called cream of the football crop. This includes several of the University of Minnesota players.”
Sophomore Harry Kain, Saginaw, Mich.: “If we play the kind of football we played against Georgia Tech, I am quite sure we will stop Michigan, although it will be close. The score will be 28-20 in our favor.”
John A. Knutson, Marine, Minneapolis, Minn.: “Michigan null beat the heck out of Notre Dame. Hirsch and Daley will leave that N.D. line quite flat. The score won’t be high: 14-7, Michigan’s favor.”
Sophomore Phil Martin, San Diego, Calif.: “Notre Dame will take advantage of the breaks to win in a high scoring game of 21-13.”
John Lennan, V-12, Chicago, Ill.: “Even though Michigan is strong, Notre Dame will win by 13 points. The final will be 27-14.”
M. Louis Wodlinger, V-7, Ocala, Fla.: “This will be a close game with Notre Dame winning 28-21. You can bet it won’t be another Tech game.”
Freshman Joseph Dooley, Harrisburg, Pa.: “Michigan is going to really start rolling, and I’m afraid most of the rolling is going to be over N.D. men. We’ve been pretty lucky up to now, but wait until we meet a real team. We’ll lose 28-13.”
R. B. Lightbody, V-12, Malden, Mass.: “I believe Notre Dame might win, and all I can say about the score is that it probably will be close.”	. .
James Kearns, Marine, Freeport, L.I., N. Y.: “Notre Dame is going to end a nice, but lucky, winning streak tomorrow. I’ll be sorry to see the Irish lose 21-7, but the better team is going to come out on top this time.”
Herb Abshire, Marine, Clinton, Iowa: “Notre Dame really has a team this year and will make those Michigan Wolver- ; ines crawl back into their caves to lick their wounds after Saturday. I think the score will be 20-7 in favor of Notre Dame.”
Over 150 Couples Attend Engineers Ball; Boyle Plays
By Dick Ames
True to expectations the Engineers did not entirely desert the landmarks of their profession at their Ball last Friday night. The first thing that met those who came through the door of the Progress Club was the clear outline of blueprints set out on a regulation draft board. In the ballroom, suspended from the ceiling,
was an eight foot demonstration slide rule. The tables downstairs were covered with drawings of numerous interesting looking if inexplicable, gadgets, tools, and left-handed donkey engines. Al- j though these were a complete maze to the non-initiate liberal arts men, they provided an excellent source of prolonged and unquestionable conversation for those who knew something of what they ■ were seeing.
The music provided by Johnny Boyle and the Cavaliers was as good as predance expectations led the comers to expect. Many of the original band were unable to play because of restrictions : against service men playing for money, but the fill ins were of more than aver- ; age ability, and held up the reputation	:
which the band has so far earned for	!
itself on campus.	;
Over 150 couples swayed on the floor, ; relaxed in the easy chairs across from the ballroom, or laughed and drank Coke, Seven-Up and cream soda in the recreation rooms downstairs. From start to finish the dance had the easy flow and tinge of excitement that makes such af- i fairs worthwhile.. -	.	'
With the breakup of the dance there i was the usual grand rush for cabs, com- i plicated by the NROTC ball held in the Indiana Club. Some industrious engi- . : neers planned to bring the necessary parts to assemble a cab in order to avoid this confusion, but as far as is known they failed to carry out the idea. It is supposed that they were unable to get ; gasoline for the occasion, and so were j forced to join thie rest in scrambling.	j

Zahm Marines Murder Outclassed Alumni Sailors
By Al Bisbee
Displaying a power - laden backfield and line, the Zahm interhall football team last Sunday thoroughly crushed a hapless Alumni squad 43-0.
With the score piled up at 27-0 by the end of the first quarter, the Marine attack began to soften somewhat and accumulated only 17 points during the three remaining periods. This Zahm club could easily prove one of the best accumulation of players in Notre Dame interhall history. Every one of the members of last Sunday’s aggregation has had collegiate experience. Most of these men feel unable because of lack of time or ability to go out for the varsity squad, but with a little practice, they have worked themselves into an interhall unit that appears to be headed for the top.
At left guard for Zahm is a boy named Wilson, from Illinois U., all-conference player in the Big Ten. He booted a field goal and all the extra points. The Zahm-bies also claim Weskunas, first string center at Illinois last fall. He did not play last Sunday, however.
Under the capable direction of Chief Robertson, popular all-American back from U. S. C., the Marine outfit has developed an attack that will prove hard to stop. “Coach” Robertson, however, claims that their running attack is very poor and could stand improvement.
Most of the scoring last Sunday was on passes, pass interceptions, and punt returns. The ex-Troian is hatching a revolutionary new formation for his allstar leathernecks. To avoid giving out any vital information to opponent scouts, he has called it “the Sweeney shift.” Maybe it’s a new version of the T-for-mation.
Two injuries for Zahm marred the afternoon. Kessler left the field with a
sprained ankle, and King with a hurt shoulder.

Irish Smash Rambling Wreck in First Home Game, 55-13
By Rollie Steinle
Frank Leahy and the “lads” climbed into their Model “T,” took advantage of a beautiful October afternoon to tear the top down, and proceeded to chug up and down the striped turf last Saturday. The Irish piled up a -5-5-13 margin over a tired Georgia Tech team that rode into South Bend with the reputation of being one of the best outfits in Dixie. Completely outplayed in ever quarter, the “Rambling Wreck” yielded 24 first downs, eight touchdowns, and seven extra points to a spirited Notre Dame team that seemed in danger only once in the • course of the afternoon. A crowd of 30,000 watched Bertelli throw touchdown passes to Rykovich, Miller, and Kuffel, while Mello accounted for another three touchdowns, and Hanlon and Sullivan one a piece.
The answer to the crushing defeat of Tech lies in the outstanding teamwork displayed by every combination Notre Dame put on the field. The great running attack the Irish backs launched was made possible by a forward wall which outcharged and outblocked Georgia Tech. The beautiful runs of Mello, Rykovich, and Miller were made through holes that Filley and company blasted in the line, and along the paths swept clean in the Tech backfield.
The first thrill of the game came midway in the first quarter, when Rykovich took the ball deep in his own territory and raced to the Tech 19 yard line a 61 yard jaunt. But the play was called.back
due to offsides on the part of Notre Dame, and the Irish had to start all over again. With Miller, Mello, and Rykovich racing through the Tech defense, the ball was advanced to the six, where Mello hit center for six points. Bertelli added the seventh. On the first play of the second quarter, Bertelli fired a pass from beyond the- Tech 20 yard marker to Rykovich, who crossed the goal line standing up. Bertelli kicked the extra point, and the score stood 14-0, Notre Dame. But Georgia Tech then put on its best show of the afternoon by quickly punching over 13 points on touchdowns by Scharf-schwerdt and Logan, and a successful point after touchdown by Broyles. Before the half ended, however, the Irish had brought the score to 21-13, covering 70 yards in 11 plays. Mello cut through from the three to score his second touchdown, and Bertelli once more converted.
Notre Dame scored three times in the third quarter to bring the score to 42-13. Bertelli started the first drive by intercepting Prokop’s pass on his own : 28, and a few plays later he passed to Miller who went over from the six. Bert made it four kicks in a row. A poor punt by Tech gave the Irish the ball well in the Tech territory, and Mello carried the ball around his right end on the first play for a touchdown. Again Bertelli added the point. Then late in the quarter Ray Kuffel took a Bertelli pass, after the Irish had received two successive 15-yard penalties, and crossed into pay dirt. Bertelli kicked his sixth straight extra point of the afternoon.
Late in the fourth quarter Lujack passed to Zilly on the Tech 13, and two plays later Hanlon went over for. a touchdown. Lujack made the score 49-13 on a successful extra point. Right after the kick-off the Notre Dame line gained revenge for the statue-of-liberty play Tech used to advantage last year, by smashing through and breaking the old play up, causing Prokop to fumble into the hands of 17 year old George Sullivan, who converted the fumble into the eighth Notre Dame touchdown. Ed Krupa missed the try for the extra point. As the game ended the Irish were once more on the march.
Since 1922 the Irish have won 12 out of 14 games with Tech, and last Saturday’s one-sided game represented the ' worst defeat Tech has suffered since 1929. The statistics on the game show the Notre Dame superiority clearly. In every branch the team outplayed its opponents. Sweet revenge, has been gained for last year’s 13-6 defeat by Tech, and now the Irish look forward to even sweeter revenge against the Wolverines of Michigan.

N. D.-Michigan Game to Do
Notre Dome - Michigan Game a Toss-up;
Winner to Collect National Spoils
BY BILL CAREY
Sports Editor, Notre Dame "Scholastic"
A battle for the probable National Championship is the magnet that will draw 85,000 football pecans through the turnstiles at Ann Arbor tomorrow to eye Notre Dame and Michigan slug toe to toe. This match of the Goliaths of the American gridiron will fence within five thousand square yards of green two powder kegs of pigskin power. High man on the score board at the final gun will earn the title of “Mightiest in the Nation.”
Rivals Since 1887
On a muddy field in November of 1887 the white clad Champions of the West, mighty Michigan, explained the rudiments of football to an enthusiastic group of “green” Irishmen. Then for eight years the highly touted Wolverines trounced their ambitious pupils — until 1909 and Red Miller. Thus was born the rivalry between Notre Dame and Michigan that has lived even through thirty years of inactivity.
Last fall in the greatest demonstration of campus spirit in years it was resurrected before the best game of the year from a competitive standpoint. The Leahymen were outscored 32-20 in a blaze of offensive might. This is the second game in the modern series — a contest played at Ann Arbor that Notre Dame men have visualized for years. The setting is -flawless. The game is all important from a national standpoint; a record crowd will fill the stands; a win on this single Saturday will make the year a success for the school. •
There the story stands today — nine wins for Michigan and a lone desolate triumph for the sons of our Lady — the ugliest blot on the athletic history of Notre Dame. The Irish — the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame — are determined to bring back the first victory in thirty-four years over this traditional foe. Oui-club is a hungry one — hungry for the blood of the Wolverine. A team with such fire in its heart is a battler that will stop nowhere short of victory.
8
Notre Dame and Michigan are ranked one, two by the sports writers of the nation. Their records to date are impressive run-away triumphs over all opposition. Both Frank Leahy and Fritz Crisler, however, have pointed their boys for this contest — mentally and physically. They have mothered both squads till the ideal point of competitive spirit has been reached. Blanketing their prize plays and players to date, both will “deal the deck” at Ann Arbor.
On paper Michigan is the dream team of Mid-Western football. Added to their returning veterans by the Navy program, have been seven standouts from the loaded 'Wisconsin club of 1943, the best back from Minnesota, and regulars from nine other colleges. Flavor liberally with the tangy salt of Herbert Orin Crisler’s coaching and Michigan is truly a team of teams.
Same Eleven to Start
Coach Frank Leahy will start the same team against Michigan that has faced Pitt and Tech: Limont, White, Filley, Coleman, Signaigo, Czarobski, Yonakor, Bertelli, Rykovich, Miller and Mello. The line outcharged Tech and played a sparkling game. If they can do the same against Michigan, Bertelli and his comrades in magic will more than attempt to equalize the more widely publicized Wolverine “dream” back-field. Against the Yellow jackets Bertelli selected plays with skill and imagination. The Magnificent Faker has no peer as a ball handler in the “T,” and has completed nine out of ten passes to date. Jim Mello played All-American ball all the way last week, while Rykovich and Miller are proving themselves two of the finest halfbacks the Irish have boasted in years. John Lu jack, Bob Palladino and Vic Kulbitski should also see much action at Ann Arbor.
Bertelli will carry into the game a helmet full of new plays designed to confuse the foe. The Springfield Rifle will no doubt unlimber the slender right arm for what is' really the first time this year. Also of vital importance is Bert’s
Such Passes Will Be Impoitnt
place-kicking ability. Michigan is notori- . ’4 ous for its skill at conversion.
If the Sons of Erin can beat off the qi attack of the ravenous Wolverine with 4 their “T”-headed shillalah Notre Dame 1 will be firmly entrenched on the national pinnacle. The game promises to be a	1,0

Power-Laden Michigan Looks for Victory;
87,000 Fans Expected for Biggest Game
BY HARVEY FRANK
Sports Editor, "Michigan Daily"
Ann Arbor, Mich., Oct. 7—A capacity crowd of over 87,000 people will pour into Michigan’s huge stadium tomorrow to witness the year’s greatest gridiron battle, the clash between two of the top teams in the country, Notre Dame and Michigan.
Ann Arbor is a highly crowded, feverish hotbed of excitement tonight, with all the hotels and rooming houses booked solidly for the week-end, with restaurants and theaters filled to the brim. And many more fans are expected to arrive here tomorrow via the bus lines and railroad.
The radio coverage of the game will probably be the best of any football game ever played. Three national networks, Blue, NBC, and Columbia, and eight individual stations will air the game nationally, and among those who will describe it are Bill Stem and Ted Busing.
This is the game the fans have been looking forward to for the past year. Ticket applications began pouring in way back last spring, and only end zone seats were left two weeks ago. There appears to be more interest in this game than the clash with Minnesota Oct. 23, and the annual clash with the Gophers has been THE game in the Michigan schedule for over 20 years.
Although they admit it will be close, Wolverine fans are all pretty confident of a Michigan victory. They point out the ease with which the Maize and Blue conquered Camp Grant, 26-0, and Western Michigan, 57-6. And the team itself, they realize, is pointing for this game just as it did for the clash with the Fighting Irish last year.
Both teams, their ranks filled with Naval V-12 and Marine Reserve trainees, seem to have offensive powerhouses, and the game will likely develop into a high scoring contest on the same lines as last year’s.
The Wolverines will be pitting the
power of their “dream” backfield against the passing of Angelo Bertelli, and the running of Creighton Miller, Notre Dame’s two greatest scoring weapons. And that backfield, consisting of four of the best runners in the Big Ten last year, is a combination of Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan.
Bob Wiese, the Wolverine’s starting quarterback, was Michigan’s leading ground gainer as a sophomore fullback in 1942, but moved over to the signal calling slot to make way for Bill Daley, a Naval trainee and ex-Gopher. Wiese rarely carries the ball now, but he does most of the team’s punting and some passing. Jack Wink, a Badger regular last year, and Joe Ponsetto, a freshman, will be Wiese’s replacements.
Daley was a regular for three years at Minnesota, and played a major part in beating Michigan in 1940, 41, and 42. He’s the hardest runner in the Maize and Blue backfield, standing 6'2", and tipping the scales at 206 pounds. Don Lund, Bob Stenberg, Wolverine lettermen, and Earl Maves, a letter winner at Wisconsin last year, make the fullback post one of the strongest in terms of reserve strength.	■
Capt. Paul White and Elroy Hirsch, both Marine trainees, round out the backfield. White was Michigan’s leading scorer last year, while Hirsch was fifth in total offense in the Western Conference with Wisconsin last year. Both are excellent broken field runners and above average passers, Hirsch passing right handed, White tossing from the southpaw side.
Bob Nussbaumer, a player who would be a regular on almost any other team in the country and the leading halfback replacement, suffered a shoulder injury in the Western Michigan game and won’t be available against the Irish. However, Walt Dreyer, a Marine, and Bill Cul-ligan, in the V-12 program, are capable halfback replacements.

Civilians Trample the
Dillon V-12ers, 14-6
By Al Bisbee
Last Sunday on Cartier Field, a scrappy civilian team under the banner of Sorin Hall, edged out the Gallagher-coached Navy boys from Dillon in a 14-6 decision. The contest was highlighted by several freakish plays, and both squads showed a lack of practice and experience. But it was a fight all the way, as the score might indicate.
It looked at first as though it might be a pushover for the sailors, when on the secoond play from scrimmage Fred Cardinal of Massillon High and the Irish frosh, ran through the Sorin line and secondary for an easy touchdown. But the civvies coached by Chiefs Horen and Ijams tightened up, and in the second quarter evened the score with a beautiful pass interception by McCarthy which re carried over the end stripe.
With an all out in the closing minutes of play, the Dillonites attempted a pass from behind their own goal. The passer was forced back out of the end zone, inadvertently scoring a safety and another two points for the opponents.
Although they dominated the second half, Sorin lost a good punter and long passer when John Damrich received a spine injury and was carried from the field on a stretcher.
Jim Carroll, sparking the Navy attack, was knocked cold twice during the game as a result of his hard running, but kept coming back for more. The plunging of Fred Cardinal, “the dark Irishman.” was hampered by a shoulder which popped out of place three times.
Under the field generalship of Bob Marshall, little Pat Rega did some scrappy ball-carrying for the: light civvies, aided by Frank Curran and Joe Fahey.

Frank Martin Runs Away With Cross Country Title
By Joe Fahey
The Interhall Track Championships for varsity berths were run off Sunday morning under perfect weather conditions. At post call, eighteen well - conditioned thinlies warmed up. The run was a little late getting off, but at precisely 10:50 the gun barked and they were off in a clean break. Doc Handy, his coaching staff and this reporter then had to jump into a car and roar out to the one, two, and three mile posts in order to give the runners their time. It was no easy job keeping up with the boys who ran as “the crow flies,” along the paths. The car had to keep on the roads and stay under seventy when visitors were strolling on the roadside. At all stops Frank Martin, (erroneously christened Bill by the Scholastic) had the best times. He finally jaunted in nearly a quarter of a mile ahead of his nearest competitor. The following men who received gold medals were Kunzler, Kiley, Woods, and DeWolfe. Ten other medals were also awarded in order to Strosh-eim, Walsh, Hill, Stupay, Butler, Mis-tretta, Forester, Bonta, Islinger, and Over.
Walt Brehmer, although a pre-race favorite to push Martin to the limit, was one of the two casualties of the meet. Rounding St. Joseph’s Lake, he stepped on a fallen walnut and sprained an ankle. Pete Schinn aggravated an old injury and was not able to finish.
The first intercollegiate meet will be run at Loyola University of Chicago. The team will be composed of the men who placed high up in the interhall meet. It will probably be a seven man squad led by Martin. Brehmer, who was a varsity track man last season, will be a sure starter if his ankle comes along as expected.
NROTC Gridders Face
Bunker Hill Tomorrow
By Jack Houghteling
The Notre Dame Naval R.O.T.C. football team will open its 1943 season against the Bunker Hill Naval Air Sta-. tion, Saturday afternoon, Oct. 9 at Kokomo, Ind. The Irish squad will make its intercollegiate debut against a Navy team loaded with many top-flight players.
The air sailors began play last Saturday by defeating Patterson Field at Dayton, Ohio 9-6. The Bunker Hill squad is led by Lt. (jg) Mal Kutner, All-American end at Texas in 1941. The team also lists Bill Baumgartner, Min
nesota end last season, and Jim Rees, Ohio State letterman, at fullback.
The N.R.O.T.C. will put a line on the field averaging 190 pounds to cope with the Navy stars. Tom Mahar and Al Bohn will be at the wingposts, Dan Hecht and John Kramer will be the tackles, John Johnson and Jack Houghteling will hold down the guard spots and Frank Sullivan will be at center. Bohn, Hecht, Kramer, Johnson and Sullivan all hit the scales at close to or over 200 pounds. Bohn, Hecht, and Sullivan all boast varsity experience and should be the outstanding men in the forward wall.
The backfield averages 180 pounds and is paced by left-handed Don Finelli. Fi-nelli plays the right half spot and is the fastest back on the squad. Al Stello at fullback, “Tex” Crowley at left half, and Ed Ghigliotti at quarterback complete the backfield.
The NROTC does not present a very strong offense and must rely on its defensive play to bring victory. The strength is shallow and several members of the. starting lineup will undoubtedly have to play the whole game. Guards and ends are especially weak on reverses while the fullback spot is completely shy of material. To provide Stello with rest, “Tex” Crowley must be moved into fullback from halfback and Bill Raese sent in to take over the vacated spot.
The Bunker Hill team will be the favorite to take the fray both from the point of material and experience. However, the Irish players may prove a surprise to themselves and everyone else.
The entire Notre Dame squad of 37 players will leave Saturday morning at 9:30 and will travel in the Navy trailer. The team will return immediately after
Record 16- J 4 Set Played in Interhall Tennis Games
By Dan Reardon
The interhall tennis season is fast drawing to a close.
To settle the championship in League I, Alumni has defeated Dillon, 4-2. The most spectacular match of the series came in the second doubles encounter when Coy and Rubinelli trounced Jack Collins and Bill Talbot, 6-0, 1-6, and 16-14. By this record score it can easily be seen that the last set was a gruelling affair. All four men were completely exhausted after the 43 hard-fought games, the longest ever played in the history of Notre Dame tennis.
In the final tournament, .which got undei- way Sunday, October 3rd, Charlie Samson edged out Ed Caparo. Capa-ro started with a powerful burst, but (Continued on page 11)

ning because there was certainly a lot of
noise within the confines of the fieldhouse. But what happened at the game? One of the field sources state that outside of the ball-goers and their guests, the enthusiasm was quite stifled and muffled on the
Bill Waddington student and trainee side. We were aware of the fact that the Marines generally are rarely wanting in enthusiasm, as heretofore witnessed; but they were not quite up to par at Saturday’s encounter. The least that the uniformed boys in ' the Notre Dame section could do was to cheer for the sake of their buddies who were in great abundance on the Irish squad. We fully ally ourselves with Jim Costin in stating that it’s definitely poor taste to sit in the N.D. section and then give out with hip-hip-hooray for the opposition when something startling comes -off. What do you say, men, let down your hair and give the campus comrades a

break — they’re certainly more than deserving after two weeks of massacre. And to the civies — don’t let the uniforms weary your spirit, let’s hear it! There’s room for V-12 improvement. Middies! We’ll appreciate your all!
If tomorrow’s contest at Ann Arbor doesn’t strike the keynote of being a possible national championship game, then the experts will have to dig deep into the past to dope out a situation where • similar conditions existed. Wiese, White, Hirsch and Daly constitute the backfield that will cut loose with the bulk of the Wolverine attack. In comparison, we offer the services of Bertelli, Miller, Ry-kovich and Mello. With the latter three running and Bert pitching, there is little doubt in our mind that the Irish will win by two touchdowns. When our seven marlin hitches link together, they do a tremendous job of bowling over the opposition, opening holes like . a Sherman tank. Woe unto the Japs if they ever have to face a horde of Yanks who play with equal ferocity.
The NROTC team puts its practice into play tomorrow when they meet the Peru Naval Base (Bunker Hill) at Peru. The boys have anxiously awaited

their debut in putting the RO on the map athletically. Even if they all don’t get to play, they’ll be satisfied, insofar as it means being away from the Navy routine for a few hours anyway. Good luck, boys!
Staggering Sensation
There were few, if any, inebriates walking out of the stadium last Saturday. There was just the commonly termed “masses” who became tipsy every time they reminded themselves of the final score. Georgia Tech, one of the nation’s tops, got stunned by plain straightforward football and that’s all there was to it. It didn’t take a bunch of goliaths to do it; either, excluding John Adams. With the coordination shown by the green-jerseyed lads, it was apparent from the start that things were going to pop. Besides the eight TD’s registered, Bert toed-over six extra points and a single for Johnny Lujack. They were able to pass around a point to each of the 46 squad members who participated and still have some left. We’ll admit that the Yellowjackets had a long ride up and it didn’t help their playing prowess in the least. Can you figure it out? All we can say is, “C’est la guerre!”
Weather permitting, and any kind will do in this case, there will be a rousing sendoff at the circle for the team before they embark for Fritz Crisler’s hideaway. Come prepared with cough drops this time fellow, as anyone found not to be hoarse after the rally will be put on report. Maybe the good, old-fashioned “lake party” will make its reappearance on behalf of the weak-lunged individuals. Anyway, let’s be sure to send the squad off with the feeling that they’ll take the “wolf” out of Wolverine.
We’re taking the Cards in six games over the -Yanks. Predictions for tomorrow:
Notre Dame over Michigan Wisconsin over Illinois Iowa Pre-Flight over Iowa Purdue over Camp Grant	;
Nebraska over Indiana
Army over Duke Penn over Dartmouth Great Lakes over Ohio State Southern Cal over St. Mary’s Cadets Georgia Tech over Georgia Pre-Flight

Samson tightened and defeated him, 57, 6-3, and 6-0.	.	'
The Walshite, Bill Moore, edged out Art Rubinelli in a close match that ended up with Bill on the heavy side of the scoring. The final tally for their match was' 7-5, 6-3.

CLUBS
E.R.T. Meets With St. Mary's
Group; Paper by Lawler
Last Wednesday, the Round Table met at Blake Gardens with a similar group from St. Mary’s College, chairmanned by Miss Dorothy Sheets. Guests of both organizations for the evening were Mr. and Mrs. William Downey, Mr. Downey being moderator of the Round Table and professor in economics at St. Mary’s.
After the dinner, the paper for the evening was presented by Jack Lawler, NROTC from Tampa, Fla. Mr. Lawler’s topic was “State’s Rights.” After the paper, the meeting was thrown open for discussion, at which point several of the St. Mary’s members presented short commentaries on the general subject of state’s rights.
The traditional joint meeting is a yearly event for the Round Table and the St. Mary’s group, and'the success of the evening this year matched those of other years.
At the meeting of Sept. 22, the speak
er for the evening was Charles Urruela, NROTC, who discussed the foreign policy of the United States, dealing chiefly with the organs of our foreign policy, the State Department and so forth, though not limiting the paper to specific foreign relations with other powers of the world. Chairman for the evening was -Jack Lawler.	'
The paper last Wednesday was given by Ted Cummings, Navy V-12. The topic of his paper was Japan, and the discussion revolved around various political and social phases.

Annual Banquet Sunday
This Sunday, Oct. 10, the La Raza Club will hold their annual banquet in honor of “El Dia De La Raza,” the founding of America. Roberto de Romana of Peru, will be acting chairman of the program preceding the dinner at the La Salle Hotel.
First on the program will be the presenting of three new members of the club, Raul Castro of Cuba, Miguel of Chile, and Jose Lavalle of Peru. After these ceermonies four talks will be given. Gabriel Molina of Colombia will speak on the Commemoration of La Raza
Day, and Professor Francis Langford will speak on the actual situation in Argentina. Virginia Weilert of Buenos Aires, a student at St. Mary’s, will be a guest of the club, and will give a talk on, “My Vacation in Argentina.”
Bookmen Admit Members;
Club Feted By Campbell
Mr. T. Bowyer Campbell, faculty moderator of the Bookmen, played host to the group Tuesday evening at an informal gathering. There was no prepared subject for discussion and so the conversation drifted loosely to eveiy-thing from politics and professors to comic strips.
Plans were made for the admission of new members. Those wishing to join the club should make application, by mail or in person, to F. J. Pequigney, 305 Sorin, or Richard Ames, 339 Sorin, as soon as possible. They will appeal- at the next meeting, to be held Tuesday, October 19th, in the Law Building for an interview before the members.
Election of officers for the comingsemester was held. Pequigney was chosen President and Ames was elected to fill the position of Librarian.

Forum Meets at Town Club;
Van Benton on "Taxation"
By Joe Murnane
The Commerce Forum recently held its annual dinner at the Town Club. Dean James A. McCarthy, of the College of Commerce, congratulated the officers and members on their excellent work in carrying on despite the wartime difficulties. He added his bit to the joviality and informality, of the occasion by his colorful review of the history of the Town Club.
John VanBenton then proceeded to give an astute and very interesting summation of the present tax set up in this country. He recommended simplification and economization as possible cures for the ills of our present system. The higher income brackets, VanBenton stated, supply most of the capital for business reorganization, expansion, and retooling, and there is no intelligent way in which their savings can be taxed further. In the discussion following the paper, however, a forced savings plan was recommended for low income groups.
Mr. Edmond Smith, faculty advisor of the Forum, and Mr. Cletus Chizek, in addition to Dean McCarthy, guided the discussion, and contributed many enlightening comments.
Public Invited to Formal
Opening of Service Center
For the first time in its history, the South Bend Service Men’s Center will be opened to the public on Monday evening, October 18th.
The purpose of this move is to enable the people of South Bend who have so generously supported the Center with their donations and cooperation to see just what they have accomplished. All departments will be in operation for this opening, and the canteen, just recently completed, will take its place in the en-’ tertainment for the first time. Some Waves and trainees from Notre Dame will be on hand to conduct the visitors about, and point out to them the many features of the Center.
It is hoped that this exhibition will act as incentive for continued generosity and selflessness on the part of those whose support is necessary to carry on the work of the Center. One need only see the recreation facilities provided for service men in other and larger cities to gain a true appreciation of the worth of South Bend’s efforts. It is almost certain that the-men who use the Center are aware of this; it is perhaps more doubtful if the. average citizen of South Bend is. For this reason everyone is urged to drop in some time during the course of the evening.

N.R.O.T.C. Week-end Best
On Campus This Semester
The most carefully planned and best executed weekend of the present semester got under way last Friday with the third annual Naval R.O.T.C. Ball at the Indiana Club. The smashing defeat of the Georgia Tech grid club and warm, sunny weather combined to present the cadets and their dates from all parts of the country with an eventful and memorable weekend.
General Chairman Tex Crowley and his hard-working group of committee-men are still receiving the plaudits of the other members of the N.R.O.T.C. for their tireless efforts, which resulted in the finest Naval Ball yet, not to mention the other points on the social calendar over Saturday and Sunday.
Teddy Powell and his orchestra initiated the festivities at the Indiana Club on Friday at 2100. Captain H. P. Burnett, commanding officer of the navy at Notre Dame, executive and instructing officers of the N.R.O.T.C. were in attendance and, with their wives, formed the receiving- line for the incoming couples. Dancing continued until 0100 and liberty expired for the Ballgoers at 0200.
Saturday’s big- event was, of course, the Georgia Tech game. In a special section of the end zone all had the opportunity of seeing the team run rampant over the Yellow jackets. The Victory Dance that evening, sponsored by the R.O.T.C. Athletic Association, was a victory dance in every sense of the word. Ted Gallagan and his orchestra led a large crowd to another evening of fine music in the Drill Hall.
The final phase of the three day entertainment was the tea dance in the Rotary Room of the Oliver Hotel at 1430 Sunday afternoon. Mas Hall provided the music and at 1730 the curtain dropped on a successful program, the biggest weekend to be seen at Notre Dame in a long while.
Buck Madden, Dave Champion, Dick Pedrotty, Jim Houghteling and Joe Con-nerty were the other chairmen of the various committees responsible for making the schedule of events click off smoothly and to the great satisfaction of the entire unit.

When Michigan started its Fall practice, Coach Fritz Crisler planned to build his line around Fred Negus, a Marine and all-Conference center at Wisconsin last year, Merv Pregulman, the Wolverine’s center last year, and guard Julie Franks, Michigan’s great all-American in 1942.
But before practice was two weeks old, Franks contracted a lung ailment and was lost for the entire season. This left it up to Line Coach Clarence “Biggie” Munn, himself an All-American at Minnesota in 1930 and 1931, to produce a line around two centers.

First Pregulman was moved to a tackle position, the third different post he has played in his three years, and Bob Hanzlik, a letter-winning end at Wisconsin last year, was moved to the other tackle.
George Kraeger, a sophomore in V-12, and Johnny Gallagher, a Marine transfer from the Badgers, were put at the guard posts; Art Renner, a sophomore Marine and Rudy Smeja, a reserve for the past two years, and now the only civilian starter, were put at the end positions.
By the time Michigan’s first game had rolled around, Munn and Crisler had moulded these men into a starting line that is the equal of the famous “seven oak posts” on the 1942 Michigan eleven. Negus is up to last year’s form; Pregulman is proving himself one of the best tackles in the country; and all the rest are making it very tough on opponents who try to gain along the ground.
And there is Michigan’s team. This is undoubtedly their biggest game of the season, and Crisler has brought them up to their peaks for this contest. He, himself, is more pessimistic about this tilt than he usually is, and just like most of the fans, he believes it will be close, awfully close.
