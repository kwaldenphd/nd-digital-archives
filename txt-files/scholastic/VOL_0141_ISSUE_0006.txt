Monet in progress
Istill remember, with great fondness, my early. attempts at art .. (W~~n reading this .aloud, there should be loud coughing noises around the word "at-' tempts.") Mrs. Mahon, my elementary school art teacher who loved cats as 
much as I did, wheeled her squeaky, antediluvian craft cart to our classroom each week. I eagerly put on my smock -not that my parents would have been able to distinguish paint stains from the many grass stains I acquired during recess ­and plunged into the latest project. 
My parents, bless their hearts, saved all ofthese unidentifiable treasures. I still have a clay pot with a curious sagging 
problem from fourth or fifth grade, and strange creations made exclusively of pipe cleaners and rubber bands tend to crop up without warning. During my freshman year here, my dad found a drawing I had made when I was in the first or second grade and mailed it to me. Though I think it's just adorable, it concernsmethat my name was scrawled over it, as tf it were a self-portrait. Those were the days, when not even being able to draw a stick figure was "precious." 
In high school, my absolute lack of artistic ability was no longer cute, and I 

cursed every blessed official who conspired to make fine arts a requirement for graduation. After searching determinedly for a loophole, I resigned myself to taking art. 
Mr. Kooistra was a wonderful art teacher. Oddly, he did better with art students who had some artistic ability. I will never forget the first day of class. As we sat at our desks scattered around the room, Mr. Kooistra strolled by to check each of his diligent pupils. "This is too neat," he told someone. "Too perfect. Color outside the lines." He came to someone else. "Very good, that's wonderful." Students beamed as he moved from desk to desk. Then, disaster struck. Mr. Kooistra reached my desk. 
"Oh, my." He didn't quite know what to say, but he got out of it gracefully. "I can see that we're going to have to grade on effort here." 
· I still chuckle to myself when I think about the High School Art Fiasco. But thanks to Mr. Kooistra's willingness to keep an eye on me as I worked and not just look at the finished product, I survived the class, and it was enjoyable and educational. 
At Scholastic, we too believe in the importance of effort. The deadline for the Colloquy for the Year 2000 is rapidly approaching, and we'd rather not wait and just grade the final product. Jared Marx spent much time and effort researching the goals of the colloquy, and his findings -as well as grades (based on effort) -begin on page 16. 
Some students are being graded on only effort in art as Core class takes on a fine arts emphasis. Sarah Childress has the story on page 12. Also, check out Kat Corte' s preview ofThe Water Engine, the next play atWashington Hall, on page 
28. Women's basketball looks to regain the glory of years past; Jessica Daues examines the team's prospects on page 24.

COFFEE AND CANTOS 
The Rhyming Game 
SLF moves coffeehouse to Huddle 
Ifloud, overcrowded Thursday nights at the Huddle seem too few and far be­tween, get ready for one event that will fill in the gap between AcoustiCafes. Notre Dame students will still be taking the stage and the focus will be on lyrics, as always, but of a different sort; the Sophomore Liter­ary Festival will host its annual coffeehouse in Lafortune on Tuesday, November 16 with poetry readings. The coffeehouse was held at Reckers last year, but SLF committee members decided to move it to Lafortune this year. "People gather in Lafortune more than in Reckers," explains SLF Chairperson Sara Branch. By making the move, the committee hopes to draw a larger audience for the students who read at coffeehouse. When SLF decided to host the first coffeehouse, the committee members looked to imitate a poetry slam. At a slam, an open mike is provided and any­one present can step ·up to read or create spontaneously one's poetry. The committee hoped this would provide a forum for stu­dent writers who might not be able to par­ticipate in the festival as readers. "During the actual festival, there are very limited spaces for Notre Dame poets, authors and playwrights to showcase their work," says committee member Amy Sellers. "Coffee­house draws upon those voices that might not be heard and allows more people to share their creations." SLF took the idea of the poetry slam and revamped it, changing the name to "coffee­
. 
house" to create a more intimate setting. The open mike was also discarded for prac­tical reasons. Instead, anyone who wants to read during coffeehouse can sign up for a 15-minute time slot. SLF committee mem­bers will be inside both dining halls on November 10 and 11 with sign-up sheets. This doesn't mean that poets and writers aren't allowed to create on the spur of the moment, though. In keeping with the idea of a slam, those who have signed up are free to invent impromptu poems when their time comes. As Branch says, "You can sign up to be spontaneous." 
Participants in coffeehouse, which will be held from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m., are encour­aged to read from their own writings, but are not limited to these. "It can be reading of any sort," assures Branch. "You can read your own stuff or just something that you like." 
Those who are interested only in listening can expect an entertaining night as well. SLF will provide coffee and the committee plans to add homey touches such as lamps and rugs to the stage to help create a more intimate setting. 
The coffeehouse promises to be an inter­esting alternative to the usual Tuesday night, for both readers and listeners alike. So when heading overto the Huddle for a caffeine fix on November 16, this time fill up on poetry, too.

John Hooker 
Brought to you by the letter 0 
John Hooker is a first year grad student in the MFA program, and he recently has been elevated to the level of campus celebrity. He's the man responsible for the big white 
'O' on South Quad (the title ofwhich is 'O'). He did his undergrad work at Southwest Missouri State. In our interview with John, he spoke freely about the first donut-looking piece he's done here at Notre Dame and showed an amazing reluctance to cut his ear off He also swears that any resemblance between the 'O' and the portal in the Star Trek episode 'City on the Edge ofForever' is purely coincidental. 
What was your inspiration for the piece? 
It has to do with the cross between math­ematics and religion. Kind of like Stonehenge and Easter Island. I was think­ing about what I wanted to do, doing a kind of word association with anything relating to circles, sun, moon, orbit, etc. Anything I could think of. 
So it's not about sex? 
Not unless you want it to be. 
Has O'Neill Hall contacted you about mounting your sculpture on their dorm? 
No, not yet. That would be great, though. I don't know how long it'll stay out in front [of Riley]. 
What are your future plans for the sculp­ture? 
I'm trying to get it into some other outdoor exhibits, hopefully in Chicago. There might be a letter 'L' or 'T' later on. I haven't thought about a coffee cup companion piece. I considered calling the NDSP and seeing if

they wanted to have a photo shoot with it. 
What's it made of, how much does it weigh, and how much were the materi­als? 

It has a steel armature inside and is covered with concrete. There is no cream filling inside, but I wish there was. It weighs about a ton and we have to move it by forklift. It cost about seven hundred dollars. 
That's pretty cheap for a ton. Who's your favorite artist? · Isamu Noguchi. He's a pretty famous stone sculptor, he did the monument at the epicen­ter of Hiroshima. 
Who's your favorite Ninja Turtle? 
Wow. That's a great question. Since they' re all named after artists, I think I like them all. 
Do you call it fried dough or funnel cake? 

Funnel cake, definitely. Fried dough? That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. 
What do you think of the sensation at the Brooklyn Museum of Art? 
It's a win-win situation, both for the artist and for Giuliani. Giuliani's in the paper every day, in Time and CNN, promoting himself. And for the artist, that's going to make the history books now. As for the material, it doesn't bother me at all. 

With recent acknowledgements from several prestigious busi­ness organizations, Notre Dame business majors can rest assured that certain campus stereotypes are just that. In an annual survey entitled "Beyond Grey Pinstripes: Preparing MBAs for So­cial and Environmental Stewardship," COBA was honored by WRI and ISIB for its commitment to societal business issues, in-eluding loan forgiveness programs, intern­ship funding, experiential learning models, community service and faculty research and publications. Notre Dame was one ofonly l O schools nationwidetoreceive thehighestrank­ing on the survey. "I want to acknowledge the College of Business faculty ... because it is their values and efforts to incorporate social service ... that allow this award to be possible," says COBA Dean Carolyn Woo. The COBA alumni network also received recognition from the Business Week Guide to the Best Business Schools, who ranked the school fifth in the U.S. in student satisfaction. Three COBA students also were recog­nizedrecentlyfortheirefforts: seniors Gabriel Alejandro, Erica Sciola and Kevin Wietzke took first place in the Deloitte & Touche National Student Case Competition.

Teri Larkin was a second-year MFA student in 1981 when she was interviewed by Scho­lastic. Larkin's specialty was painting, and she explained how she approached her art: 
"Because toys are like human beings, painting and drawing groups of them is like creating human situations or telling stories . ... Story telling adds another dimension to my painting and drawing and makes it ac~ cessible to more people." 
Included in the October 1981 issue of Scholastic were some of Larkin' s illustra­tions: "The Unexpected Visitor," "Cootie at Bay" and "Cootie Mania."

"Notre Dame really prepared us, espe­cially once we got to the national level," says Wietzke. "Almost all of the accounting professors were there to critique us and pre­pare us on a personal and individual level." 
Wietzke says that the question and an­swerportionofthecompetitionsettheNotre Dame students apart from the rest. "Not only were we prepared, but on the portions that you couldn't prepare for, we all really knew the information and were able to go that extra step." 
This first place award led COBA to be cited in a survey by Public Accounting Re­port as the number-one choice for compa­nies recruiting accounting majors. 
"Accountancy at Notre Dame has a long history of excellence," says KPMG Chair­man Thomas F. Schaefer. "Notre Dame's number-one ranking by recruiters reflect the high regard business professionals have for our students and programs. A big part of our success is the fact that our graduates perform exceedingly well in the business world." 
These honoi"s are proof of what other Notre Dame students won't always admit: that COBA students are at the top of their class.

Journalism concentration is guaranteed its tenure thanks to an endowment in honor ofa distinguished aluni 
BY COURTNEY KERRIGAN bserver News Editor Tim Logan 
plans to pursue a career in journal­
ism following graduation. He has high hopes for his career, but he realizes that his career probably will have humble begin­nings. "When I graduate I'd love to work for the New York Times, but they're just not going to hire me," Logan says. To make his way up in the field, Logan will have to get the all-important "foot in the door," and that's where Notre Dame just might be able to help. 
Logan is earning a concentration in Jour­nalism, Ethics and Democracy. The con­centration will aid Logan and other aspiring journalists in their career search, but until recently there was no_ guarantee that the concentration would be available to future students. That is, until the concentration recently had its future ensured by a grant from the family of John W. Gallivan. 
The program, which is to be endowed in Gallivan' s name, began in 1997 with a three­year grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. Additional gifts from family members Michael and Sharee Gallivan, Ned and Gay Gallivan McDonough and Tim and Pam Gallivan will extend the work of the program by providing scholarship assistance and intern­ship support to students. In addition, the gift will underwrite the program's administra­tive costs, allow the university to sponsor journalism conferences, lectures and publi­cations, and add courses to the Journalism, Ethics and Democracy concentration. 
John W. Gallivan, a 1937 Notre Dame graduatt, has strong ties to the journalism field. He is chairman of the board and pub­lisher emeritus of the Kearns Tribune Cor­poration, which he joined immediately after graduating from Notre Dame. He served as the publisher of the Salt Lake City Tribune from 1960 to 1984, as well as working in nearly every other position at the newspa­per. 
O

"I am grateful to my children for endow­ing [the program] ... in my name, and grate­ful, also, to my alma mater for her lifetime guiding hand," Gallivan says. 
According to Program Director Robert Schmuhl, the endowment will expand ex­tensively the opportunities for students in­terested in journalism professions. "The thrust of the endowment is to answer the needs of students who are interested in ca­reers ofjournalism through student scholar­ships, internship support, program support and administrative support," Schmuhl says. 
The program, which the College of Arts and Letters formally approved as a five­course concentration in journalism in 1998, already has a distinct Notre Dame flavor. "From the start, [those involved in the pro­gram] wanted to do something distinctive andin character with the Notre Dame spirit," says Schmuhl, who is also a professor and the department chair .of American Studies. "We included in the title, Journalism, Ethics and Democracy, so that students would think about relationships among journalism, the moral collection ofinformation and respon­sibilities that news people have in our soci­ety." 
Gallivan concurs on the ethical objec­tives of the program. "It is my ardent wish that the program be dedicated to the restora­tion of public trust in journalism," he says. "To that end, may these programs be con­ducted so as to inspire all journalists to abide by a strict code of fairness and integ­rity to faithfully, fearlessly and fulsomely deliver the daily news report with full attri­bution and conscientious objectivity." 
Logan thinks the ethical issues discussed in the program are one ofits unique strengths. "I'm glad I'm at Notre Dame to study the ethical issues [ ofjournalism]," Logan says. "I wouldn't want to go to a state school to learn about ethics." 
The concentration, open to students both within and outside of the American Studies major, combines professional training in journalistic skills ancl an examination of philosophical concerns related to the prac­tice of journalism. Some of the classes al­ready available in the concentration include Fundamentals of Journalism, Broadcast Journalism, Writing and Editing, Literary Journalism, Television in American Cul­ture and Online America. 
Loubel Cruz, a senior in the program, is considering a career in journalism but is glad the program is a concentration and not a major. Cruz, who is considering being a reporter or a media attorney, believes that the grounding she has received in her Ameri­can Studies major is important. "My major has given me a more versatile area of study than a journalism major could have ever done," she says. "Journalism classes can only teach you so much about the profession while a liberal arts major can give you a tremendous background that you can use for anything." 
One surefire benefit of the program is the contacts students can make with the mem­bers of the program's high-powered advi­sory committee. Composed solely of Notre Dame graduates, members include Tom Bettag, executive producer of NBC's Nightline; Bill Dwyre, sports editor at the Los Angeles Times; John McMeel, presi­dent ofUniversal Press Syndicate; Matthew Starin, editor of the Boston Globe; Kelley Tuthill, a reporter at WCVB-TV in Boston; Don Wycliff, editorial page editor at the Chicago Tribune; and, of course, the new­est member, John W. Gallivan. 
But with all these high-level contacts, Logan realizes that he probably won't be working too high up too soon. Logan hopes that the endowment will be able to provide more classes in the program, including ones that discuss how journalism operates on the ground level. "I'd love to be a syndicated columnist, but there's a need for focus on real community journalism." And with the aid of the endowment, this and other possiblities have the chance to be realities in the near future. .

Progress is underway to iniprove class registration and end the horrors ofDART 
BY ADAM KRONK 
C~'::_] hink of the future. Imagine a time 
1 ! in which DARTing doesn't drive 
L_; you to insanity. Incessant busy sig­nals don't plague your ears and mock your redial button. That ominous sound, only comparable to the "Whammy" noise on Press Your Luck, doesn't deny you access to every class you have on the three contingent schedules you had prepared so diligently (thinking you had covered all the bases). You don't even have to whine to your room­mates about getting the last possible DART time for the sixth semester in a row. 
Instead, picture yourself in front of your computeron the appointed DART day. Calm and cool, you access the web, type in your AFS ID and password, and DART your brains out. No 15-minute window of time suffocates your mind while a laughably slow, digital voice reads off class times and call numbers. Your schedule takes form before your eyes on the screen. If ' your first choice is full, you can search by time, professor, ,department or related class. You even can see how many places are left in each class at that very moment (not 20 minutes earlier, as on IrishLink). 
If you went to Wake Forest or the University of Minnesota, you wouldn't be dreaming. And in roughly a year, says Assistant Registrar Don Steinke, neither will the students of Notre Dame. Though plans are, according to Steinke, still in the "functional requirements testing mode," ND' s Office oflnformation Tech­nology "certainly has a clear idea" of a potential system for class registration. 
Two options exist for designing a sys­tem. Schools like Harvard have opted to build programs from scratch -a process that is both time-consuming and expen­
8Scholastic News 
sive. The advantage: a system that doesn't require changes to existing databases and perfectly suits the school's needs. The alter­native is to buy a pre-made system and tailor it to fit specific requirements. Wake Forest uses such a package from Software Re­search Northwest (SRN), an information systems company based in Seattle. 
Why buy pre-made? Like any computer­based project, "It's like hitting a moving target: new capabilities are coming out all the time," says Steinke. This makes spend­ing big to repeatedly hand-code original systems unnecessary. One such capability on the horizon ofcomputer technology is n­tiered architecture. Whereas current sys­tems rely on direct interface between the user screen and the mainframe (two tiers), future systems will have "middle men" pro­cessors to relay information. This is a cru­cial development, for with the current two­tier architecture, any change to the end-user display requires a re-working of the central database. In English: to change the way your screen looks when you register, you have to go in and change the entire mainframe's layout. 

Notre Dame is working closely with SRN on integrating one ofits existing products to fit university needs. To Steinke, "It makes sense. It'll do a lot of what we want, work­ing with our cmTent data systems." Over the coming months, ND will conduct tests and produce mock programs to judge their ef­fectiveness. 
There's no big rush to implement the system. Notre Dame, like the rest of the world, is "frozen for Y2K until at least February," Steinke says. Assuming the world doesn't end, progress will continue with

Spring 2001 as the first pro­jected semester for which the new system will be used. 
But don't be impatient. It used to be a lot worse. Before DART was introduced in 
1989, students filled in their desired classes on bubble grids. These forms were pro­cessed and class lists were compiled. Professors, looking at these lists, would then cross off a certain number ofnames. Come the next semester, stu­dents would get a list of their classes -sometimes one, sometimes seven or eight. Because there was no way to know which classes would be full, students were forced to fill in more classes than they wanted. 
This system was deemed unreasonable, and the univer­

of a nude model. in her Core class. 
Roche, recently 

conducted a re-evaluation of the program to determine its strengths and weaknesses and whether it actually was fulfilling its objective. There was positive feedback from not only the faculty but also the students, putting to rest the rumor ofCore's potential elimination from the college. "I want students to know that Core is here to stay," says Core Program Director and Professor Stephen Fredman, adding, "It has always been a favorite with students." This claim appears to be true. In a class ·· where the majority of the time is spent reading different forms of literature and then holding open discussion, the focus is primarily on exploring new ways ofthink­ing. By taking a more in-depth look at a piece of music, literature or work of art, students are forced to think about the fundamental aspects of the work rather than making a cursory evaluation. "It's challenging," acknowledges sophomore Cathleen Jordan. "It forces you to think outside of the square in which you live." Nevertheless, the administration was not about to rest on its laurels, deciding that some adjustments would still be made in the interest of progress and innovation. Fredman set aside a three-to four-year 
· period for experimentation with the pro­gram. "I think this will be a very exciting time [for students taking the course]," he says. One of the main areas of focus for im­provement is fine arts, which is consid­
ered to be the weakest aspect of the pro­
gram. Brainstorming for improvement be­
came a competition of sorts as groups of 
five faculty members, each from a differ­ent department, worked together to come up with a modified model of the program. 
A·ccepted models would then be put into 
practice, with those who created the mod­
els teaching the course. However, Fredman 
stresses that although the program is con­stantly being modified and improved, the 
objective of Core has not changed: "The 
purpose has always been the same, and 
it's going to remain so during the future." 
In the continuing interest of improving Core's fine arts area, a few new additions have been made, such as having a presen­
tation by a Notre Dame art professor, who 
threw clay pots on a wheel, sometimes 
using music as inspiration. Another addi­
tion is the sketching ofnude models by six 
of the 38 Core sections and of plants by the other 32 classes. Admittedly, these 
two subjects are quite different from one 
another. The question has been raised as 
to whether drawing nudes, introduced to a 
group of students for the most part un­trained in drawing, is any more worth­
whi!e than drawing plants and how this 
concept fits in with the objectives of the 
Core program. 
Although some of the students who drew the plant did not see much of a 
difference in how they thought, the ma­
jority of those who drew the nudes felt 
12 Scholastic Campus Life 


that it was definitely a different and more enriched experience. As Jordan points out, "Plants don't hold your attention for an hour. The human form is so incredibly detailed." Despite their enthusiasm fol­lowing the drawing, however, most stu­dents reacted with wariness in the begin­ning. "At first when you hear it, you say, 'No, I don't want to draw a nude model,"' Jordan recalls. "The immaturity takes over." This was especially true as a few of the models are students at Notre Dame. "When you see your peers, there's always a chance that things will be uncomfort­able," Jordan says, but she adds that both the model and the students behaved in a very professional manner. 
The students attempted a blind contour drawing, in which the artists keep their eyes focused on the subject at all times and keep their pencils to the paper. The object, Jordan explains, is to "make your eye and hand move together." This twist to the exercise caused most of the draw­ings to barely resemble a human form, but then, that was not the focus. The point was to teach students to use the right, 'artistic' side of the brain and to look at their subject from a new perspective. Regard­ing this objective, all students agreed that it was successful. "Contour drawing is different than what_you see, it's not your past experiences," says sophomore Ted Fox. "You have to free your mind." David Fiorini, also a student in the program, agreed. "It really makes you see it from a different perspective." 
How does this modification of the pro­gram fit in with Core? According to those in charge, the answer is: perfectly. The objective of the exercise becomes clearer when it is noted that the theme of this semester's Core program is nature and the evolution of man. "And what better way to appreciate nature than to draw man?" Fredman asks. "So much ofart is based on the human form." In addition, the books, poetry and music they had experienced prior to the drawing all contributed to the understanding and further development of the theme. In keeping with their other experiences, the students had studied a book entitled Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, which covers the basics of drawing and elaborates on the concept of blind contour drawing, and applied what they had learned in the class. 
Despite most students' positive experi­ences, there was some criticism of the sketching project because of differing ap­

proaches taken by the various classes. 
Whereas some students discussed what 
they were about to draw and the reasoning 
behind it, others were told very little and 
consequently never were able to under­
stand completely how the drawing fit into 
what they had been studying, suggesting 
inconsistency of curriculum between the 
classes. "Our professor said, 'This is what 
we're doing ... and I really couldn't tell 
you why,'" says Kelly Leddy, a student in 
the program. Fox had the same reaction: 
"It was something that was interesting to 
do, but I didn't see the specific point ofit 
... and the professor dido' t know, either." 
Others complained that although the book 
was helpful in the exercise, there was not 
enough time devoted to its study. 
It appears that this is an experiment that 

was fairly productive, not only fulfilling 
the objective of the program but at the 
same time enhancing it, despite minor 
glitches. Most feel that perhaps if the 
concept had been better presented, they 
would have gained more from the activ­
ity, but they do admit that it was a benefi­
cial experience overall, one that indeed 
broadened their perspective and gave them 
a new respect for art depicting the human 
form. "I certainly don't do that every­
day!" Fox says. 
Overall, most students who drew the 

models say that they \YOuld like to see the 
activity continued in future semesters of 
Core, provided more attention is given to 
instruction beforehand. Even some fresh­
men who will take Core next year have 
expressed interest in the experience. "I 
think it's always good to try something 
new," says freshman Joanne Davidson. 
Mary Tarsha, also a freshman, agrees. 
"The human body is the most beautiful 
form in the world, and I will feel very 
fortunate to be able to have that experi­
ence that only more advanced art students 
would normally have." 
Junior Katie Boyle, who took Core last year, has a similar reaction. "At first, I was shocked," she says of learning that students were drawing nudes this semes­. ter. "But then, I think any time your learn­ing experience is diversified, it's good. ...There's a lot more to learning than just 
reading a book and talking about it." 
So it looks as though the students, at 

least, would like to see this experiment 
stay, but whether it will reappear in next 
year's Core program is the decision ofthe 
director -one can only wonder what he 
will come up with to enlighten us next..

W:en Brother Pedro Haering struted listening to the Big Band program on WSND in the spring of 1989, he grew 
ncreasingly frustrated. Whenever someone called in a request for a song, the DJ would never be able to find it in his collection. At best, he would comeup with the same song by a different artist or another tune by the same artist. 
His frustration growing, Brother Pedro contacted the DJ and made this challengeto him: he wouldpersonally fill all therequests collected on one week's show in time to be played for the next week's show. 
This wasn't a bet he was likely to lose. With 100,000 different songs on nearly 15,000 records in his collection, he was able to fill all the requests for the next week's show. 
. 1 Brother Pedro recalls listening to the show:. "I listened for four to five weeks, and there was only one request my library couldn't fill." Before long, WSND was borrowing frequently from his collection, and when the summer of 1989 rolled around, WSND Advisor Adele Lanan asked him to fill in as a summer DJ. Pedro agreed, and he was
:(
., so successful that the station manager asked him to continue full-time. Now, with two regular radio shows and a loyal following of listeners, Brother Pedro has become a WSND institution and an authority on Big Band and other kinds of pre-rock music. With more than 1000 radio shows under his belt in the last 10 years, he's earned the distinction.
I 
Brother Pedro's first show of the week, titled Words and Music,
·1 
Remembered, airs on Friday night from 8:00 to midnight. He usually selects four themes for the show and tries to play an equal number of songs based on each theme. Sunday"night's show, Pe,formers ofOur Time, ruris froni 7:00 to 10:00 and has a similar format with three · selected themes. . 
. . . . , ..., . .. 
The themes Pedro uses for his shows vary greatly. He has done a theme featuring the music from every year from 1900 to 1975, and he has done themes that feature specific singers, artists and Iyricists. "We have all kinds of themes," he says. "Songs about birds. Songs about streets. Songs around the world," 
Most recently, his themes have revolved around his listeners' favorite suggestions. This July he sent out a letter to his 300-strong 
14 Scholastic Campus Life 


mailing list asking the listen­ers to send in their favorite songs. He got 110 responses. "Every Friday, I make a theme on the preferences of a specific 


Fort e 
listener," he says. "That'll take two years to complete." 

Of course some of his favor­ite themes do get repeated. He considers 1937 to be the "big­gest and best year" for music, and draws upon that year heavily. He believes 1937 had more memorable songs thanBrother Pedro Haering's any other. "It would take me as long to play those as it would

--i 

started his collection in 1937 when he was a sophomore in high school. For his initial collection, he collected only 78s. However, he sold his entire collection to a local radio station in 1948 and used the proceeds to buy 45s, which he believed were going to be the new standard of the recording industry. Now, his collection includes LPs, 45s and some CDs, which he first started buying last year even though he thinks they're too small. ''They're getting too small to conveniently handle. You sometimes need a magnifying glass i:o read the notes." ­
About 25 percent of his collection is Big Band music, and the rest includes other groups, artists, singers, choruses and soundtracks. Though he does have some classical, he says, "I don't get into classical. I don't use it on my programs on WSND. Other shows do that" 
Most of the collection is catalogued by song title on index cm·ds in the comer of his office, where all the albums are kept. Those albums that aren't catalogued have a bright orange sticker so that Brother Pedro's three "secretaries," freshmen who work with him for five hours each week, will be able to catalog them later. 
Brother Pedro rarely gets to relax and listen to his collection. "I don't listen. I don't have time to listen. Ilisten to what I am going to play next week." Indeed, his radio schedule does take most of his time. Brother Pedro estimates that he spends 70 hours a week working on his program. He prerecords all the songs that are on records and plays the songs on CDs live. Additionally, he spends many hours corresponding with listeners. Just this week, he made a mix tape containing 40 songs for one of them. 
Though his collection is not insured, Brother Pedro realizes its value. "So much of it is irreplaceable," he says, "Five or 10 thousand dollars fa nothing ifl can't use it to·replace them." 
His collection is so irreplaceable that he is hunting for a safe place for it in the future. He says, "I wanted and am still open to leaving it to WSND, but they'd have to double their space to give it storage. I would like to know that this is going to be taken care of." The Notre Dame libraries are also interested in making it part of their collection. 
Until then, Brother Pedro spends seven hours a week sharing it with the WSND listening audience-playing his favorites, chronicling the century and trying to meet every request.

The Gipp recently received an e-mail that contained two ofhis favorite subjects: cam­pus gossip and a great set of knockers. "Glowing Boobs," the subject ofthe e-mail, proves that maybe OurLady really is watch­ing over the Gipp after all. 
The e-mail was about a girl who jogs around the lakes wearing a sports bra, in which she keeps a set of flashlights.

The tipper continued, "I spotted her at a Halloween party in which she would turn them on when she wanted a certain guy's attention justby gently pulling back her shoulders." The tipper believes that she uses those little round flashlights that

This is a story about a boy who likes to urinate in his sink whenever he gets drunk, regardless of who might be around. One day, he decided that if he could pee in the · sink, he could just as easily pee in a shot glass and offer it to his friend, who was drunk enough to accept it.

The Gipp is trying to avoid toilet humor and cracks about bodily functions, but he received the following tip from four sepa­rate sources, so he really couldn't ignore it. Take heed and read this segment afteryou're I

According to some gals from Pangborn who ! provided one version ofthe tip, some fresh­man puked for a whopping 20 minutes, "leaving a disgusting pile of vomit, which I looked something like chopped up hotdog with canned Campbell's chicken soup i
I 

poured over it." They dido' t go into details i on the odor, so you'll have to just imagine ! what it would be like to get a whiff of it throughout the game. 
As if this is not hideous enough, some of the puker' s friends offered a $50 reward for anyone who would eat some ofthe barf. One brave freshman took the dare. 
Since the Gipp is feeling too queasy to finish this tale, he's going to let another one of his articulate tippers relay the rest: 
"So they get a plastic spoon, and the guy offering the money scoops up chunks amidst 
juice. You could even see stuff trailing off of the spoon, the big line ofjuicy throw up hanging off of the spoon. And so, he ate it! It was the grossest thing I have ever seen. I · nearly lost it right then and there myself. The guy who ate it merely raised his hands in triumph. He did not flinch or throw up himself or anything. The worst part is that he did not go to the bathroom to wash his mouth out or anything! He sat there and I think he drank a Coke that his friend brought to him." 
As an icky conclusion to this tale, the Pangborn girls added, ''Then the guys around were offering $100 for any girl to give the guy tongue, but unfortunately no one took any of those guys up on t_heir offer." 
The Gipp needs to go take some Tums now. Keep those tips coming and see you next time. .

Human Resources A 
Unlike the faculty section, this section focuses more broadly on development for all university employees. Improved staff commu­nication and decision making, along with iricreased pay and ben­efits for staff members are the primary concerns here. In general, these recommendations .have been fairly effective. Malloy cites increased remuneration for university employees as one of the ultimate outcomes of this document. 
Finances and University Relations A 
· As far as finances go, there is little disagreement that the univer­sity has been successful. Malloy called Generations "the most successful financial campaign of any Catholic institution in tl;le world, ever." Other recommendations in this section calling for increased involvement with surrounding communities and devel­opment ofthe Public Relations department have also been met with success. 
The university should c_ontinue and ~:Xpancl its efforts to promdte the well-being and quality of life of the various communities that make up the Michiana area ... 
Malloy notes, "We need to recognize that we don't live in a vacuum on campus." Malloy agrees that this recommendation reflects the need to aid areas surrounding the university both as a matter of Catholic i"esponsibility and practicality. To this end, he cites the Center for the~Homeless, the Center forSocial Concerns and the Alliance for Catholic Education as programs linked to the university that serve the outside community and have grown since 1993. The university also has participated in the development of economic development plans for the surrounding communities. Malloy says, in addition to financial help for surrounding communities, "We have talent, goodwill and leadership skill that we can offer." D

In 1991, the sports world was introduced to a lot ofnew things. The Atlanta Braves finally won a pennant, the Chicago Bulls 
made a name for themselves by winning their first in a series >-, of World Championship titles, and the Irish men's hockey team ! was playing for a berth in the NCAA National Tournament. 
CL) In March of 1991, the Notre Dame hockey team made a trip from · 1 chilly Indiana to frigid Anchorage, Alaska, to take part in the Jeep/ 
i Eagle Independent Tourna­ment. Other competitors in 
Alaska-Anchorage 10 

this two-round tournament 
included Alaska-Anchor-Notre Dome 2 
age, Alaska-Fairbanks, and Alabama-Huntsville. Tournament or­ganizers hoped that the event would help the NCAA Tournament Selection Committee decide on the at-large bid extended to one independent team. Winning this tournament would help the Irish earn a coveted berth in the national tournament. 
But winning the tournament would not be easy considering the Irish record against the other teams. Notre Dame had faced both Alaska-Fairbanks and Alabama-Huntsville twice, with varying degrees of success. Against the Alaska-Fairbanks Nanooks, the Irish lost two close games, 4-3 and 2-0. The second contest was the only time Notre Dame was held scoreless that season. 
While hosting the Chargers of Alabama-Huntsville, the Irish survived a couple ofnail-biters by winning 8-7 (OT) and 3-2. In the first game, a fast-second shot by the Irish tied the game at seven. They then proceeded to control the sudden-death overtime, scoring after two minutes of extended play. If the Irish were to win the tournament, they would have beaten all the major independent teams, and therefore.would be a leading contender for a berth in the 
0 

national tournament. However, such a feat was not meant to be for Notre Dame. 
The tournament started off well for the Irish. They upset top­ranked Alaska-Fairbanks in a gritty, 4-3 win to face Alaska­Anchorage in the tournament final. Lou Zadra put Notre Dame out to a quick 1-0 lead six minutes into the game. 
Alaska-Anchorage answered quickly, however, knotting the score at one. Notre Dame, undaunted by the quick response, retorted with another score 30 seconds later to regain the advan­tage. 
Anchorage continued the tennis match, putting up another goal to make it 2-2. Anchorage broke serve with five minutes left in the first period, taking a one-goal lead. 
For the remainder of the first period and majority of the next, Notre Dame battled for the equalizer, but to no avail. With seven minutes left in the second period, Anchorage ceased toying with the beleaguered Irish squad and put the game away like money in the bank. 
Anchorage bombarded Irish goalie Greg Louder with 32 shots in the final two periods, scoring seven unanswered goals in the last 27 minutes ofplay. Notre Dame's season ended with a demoralizing 10-2 pummelling, one win shy of a possible NCAA berth. 
"They were bigger and stronger," said coach Ric Schaefer. "They flexed their mu~cles and that was it." 
Not much has changed since 1991: the Braves are still claiming the majority of tl?,e National League pennants, the Bulls still can't do anything witho.ut Michael Jordan, and the Irish are still looking for a chance to play in the national tournament.

COMMENTARY 


Wrongfully Accused 
Tarnished poll unfairly places ND in the top tier ofthe country sdirtiest football programs 
BY GERARD MESKILLWhile Notre Dame waits on the impending status of the NCAA investigation, many people have begun to question where the integrity of the program has gone. Recently, Notre Dame's football program took several public rela­tion blows, dating back to the publication of Under the Tarnished Dome before theJ 993 season to last year's Joe Moore fiasco. In fact, one source feels thatN otre Dame is one of the most scandalous programs in America. Findlaw.com, a website de­

pended indefinitely from the team. 
Not to be outdone, the Wolverines con­tinue to start two convicted felons on their offensive line. (And Coach Lloyd Carr was wondering why Notre Dame needed an ex­tra week of calisthenics against Kansas in preparation for the upcoming assault of the powerful Wolverine offensive line.) 
According to Findlaw.com, the bronze medal belongs to the Irish, based solely on the Dunbar fiasco. This former member of the now defunct Quarterback Club was guilty of bestowing gifts on players using money with this internally." Somebody had better let the Florida State Police in on this one. 
Iowa State player Jerome Heavens'. ef­forts managed to squeak the Cyclones into the top-20. Heavens was arrested in July after assaulting an unsuspecting freshman computer engineer. Perhaps the university's administration cost the Cyclones a top-10 position by removing Heavens from the roster. 
Narrowly edging out Iowa State to place 19th, Florida's drive to the top-20 was led by strong safety Ron Graddy. Apparently

mean or conviction, vaulted FSU to their rightful perch at the top ofthe shame list, though the questionable actions of its players went mostly unnoticed during the first half of the season. 
Warrick brought the program's indiscre­tions to the limelight when he was discov­ered underpaying for items in a Florida department store and charged with a felony. However, the former frontrunner in the Reisman race's charge was mysteriously downgraded to a misdemeanor after pres­sure from boosters and alumni prompted the Florida court system to expedite the pro­cess. 
Meanwhile, Cody was unable to bask in the glory ofhis game-saving field-goal block against Clemson for long. He was charged with marijuana possession and was sus­she embezzled from her South Bend em­ployer. No Irish player has been convicted of any crime related to this case. 

Now, here is a brief rundown of those programs whose infractions were deemed less severe than the Irish. Number 14 North Carolina's defensive lineman Brian Norwood was charged, along with nine oth­ers, of sexually assaulting an• H-year old girl continuously over a two-year period. 
Central Florida's starting tackle David Wilson was charged with a felony after assaulting a bar patron, rendering him un­conscious. Wilson's efforts solidified UCF' s stronghold on the eighth slot. His aggres­sion, however, was not deemed too severe to keep him out of the starting lineup. Head coach Mike Kruczek explained, "I'll deal frustrated by the lack of booster contribu­tions, Graddy allegedly drove the getaway car for two men stealing a $1200 bracelet from a nightclub patron.

' 
otreDame's women's basketball team ~ is used to winning. For the past three 
years, the Irish have proven them­selves over and over to be one of the best women's basketball teams in the nation, earning a combined record of72-22 in the last three seasons. Although last year's second-round loss to LSU in the NCAA tournament was a disappointment, the team finished with an exceptional record of 26-5. The winning percentage of .839 was the best in Irish history. In fact, last year's Irish reached the 20-win mark for the sixth consecutive year in only 22 games and climbed as high as number six in the polls in early December and February, the highest ranking ever in school history. "It will be tough to surpass last year," Head

I Coach Muffet Mc­Graw acknowledges. "Hopefully we can stay healthy." If the Irish do stay healthy, they have the \l./ a b i 1 i t y t O k e e p WW e pace with or maybe even to improve upon last year's perfor­mance. So how does this team compare to last year's? The team's nucleus remains in­
tact. Four of the five starters -center Ruth Riley, forward Kelley Siemon, guard Niele Ivey and guard Danielle Green ­all remain with the team. Lost is gradu­ated senior foward Sheila McMillen, who last season averaged 15.4 points and 4.3. rebounds per game. She earned a place on the 1998-99 second team All-Big East and ended her years at Notre Dame as the all-time Irish career three-point leader. Although McMillen's departure leaves a void in the Irish starting lineup, this year's

freshman class-with Amanda Barksdale, Alicia Ratay and Monique Hernandez ­is rated by McGraw as the best in Irish history. "This year, I think the team will be different, hopefully better. We have more depth and are generally better expe­rienced," says junior forward Katie Siemon. "Our philosophy is different. We know we can score with Ruth and Niele. Now we are focusing more on defense." 
And defense is what the Irish will need. This season, the Big East conference 

Our philosophy is different. 
changed from an 18-game to a 16-game league schedule, leaving more room for McGraw to schedule non-conference op­ponents, such as defending national cham­pion Purdue, Illinois, North Carolina, Michigan State, USC, Florida Interna­tional and Marquette. The schedule, ac­cording to McGraw, is tough. "We're play­ing five teams [Purdue (1), Connecticut (4), Rutgers (8), North Carolina (13) and Florida International (22)] in the top 25." The Big East conference is strong as well, with the Irish, Connecticut and Rutgers each vying for a first-place finish. In the Big East coaches preaseason poll, Con­necticut was picked to finish first with 10 first place votes, Rutgers was picked to finish second with three first-place votes, and the Irish are ranked number three. "The Big East conference is extremely competitive," says McGraw. "Three teams are in the top 10." 

Leading the Irish this season is captain Ruth Riley, a 6'5" junior and arguably the 

Muffet McGraw 

best center in women's collegiate basket­ball. Averaging 16.6 points and 8.4 re­bounds_per game, Riley finished first na­tionally in field goal percentage with a Notre Dame school record of 68.3 per­cent. Last season she was the only unani­mous first-team All-Big East selection, and is currently one of 10 finalists for the Naismith College Women's Basketball Player of the Year Award, one of the most prestigious awards in college basketball. This is a tremendous honor for Riley. "It is unusual for a junior to even be nomi­nated for the Naismith," says McGraw. 
5' 8" senior guard Niele Ivey, the other Irish captain, was enjoying her finest sea­son for the Irish last year when she tore the ACL in her left knee during Notre Dame's win over Rutgers in the semi­finals of the Big East tournament. The season-ending injury forced her to sit out the championship game against Connecti­cut and Notre Dame's two NCAA tourna­ment appearances against Saint Mary's and LSU. After about eight months of recovery time, "Niele is now ready to go," McGraw says. "I don't know if she is 100 percent, but she's close." Last season, Ivey was ranked eighth in the nation in three-point field goal percentage, tied for ninth in free-throw percentage, and 13th in assists. She led the Irish last season with 6.5 assists and 2.6 steals per game. With McMillen gone, "Niele will look to shoot more often," Riley says. "She has a really good three-point shot she never gets a chance to use." 
Joining Riley and Ivey in the starting five are Green and Siemon. Green is re­turning for her fifth year, having missed the entire '96-' 97 season after tearing an Achilles tendon. The combination oflvey and Green, the team's third leading scorer and second leading rebounder, respec­tively, will prove to be quite a challenge to Notre Dame opponents. Second-year starter Siemon, a 6'2" junior forward, averaged 5.8 points and five re­bounds per game to earn the title of the team's third lead­ing rebounder. While Riley is drawing a lot of attention inside, Siemon hopes to keep the opposing defense 
away from the basket. 
Other players include

Imani Dunbar, who was used during her first two seasons mainly for defensive situations. 
The team's freshmen -Barksdale, Hernandez and Ratay -were all ranked among the top 100 high school players in the nation and are said to be the best recruiting class in Notre Dame history. As a senior, the 6'3" forward Barksdale aver­aged 8.6 points, 7.1 rebounds and eight blocks per game. 5'9" guard and USA Today Honorable Mention All-American Hernandez averaged 15.8 points per game, 
9.5 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game. 5' 11" guard Ratay averaged 21 points, five rebounds, four assists and three steals her senior year, earning herself First T!c!am Parade All-American Honors. Ratay also helped the U.S. win a bronze medal in the 1998 Youth World Games. Ratay is in the running for a starting spot this season, and the Irish hope she will fill the shooting void left by the loss of McMillen. "Alicia can pick up right where Sheila left off," Haney says. "The freshman class is very good this year. Alicia has a great shot, Monique is very intense as a point guard, and Amanda is a great blocker. They will contribute immediately." 
Leading the team is McGraw, who has coached the Irish for 11 seasons, nine of which produced at least 20 victories. McGraw is the winningest basketball coach in Notre Dame history with an over­all record of 261-110 (.704). Assistant coaches include Carol Owens, Kevin McGuff and the newly named Coquese Washington, who is currently a member of the New York Liberty and was in Notre Dame's class of 1993. 
The Irish plan to continue their success in the 1999-2000 season, starting with their first exhibition game at 2:00 p.m. on Sunday at the Joyce Center. Their regular season starts next Saturday, November 20th, with an away game at Toledo, and then the Irish move on to Illinois on No­vember 27th and eventually first-ranked Purdue on December 8th. 
"Last season we were the hunted, and every time we went out to play, we were the target for other teams," said McGraw. "I anticipate this season there may be even greater expectations placed on us. I think we handled the pressure well last season and never let anything get in the way of us accomplishing our goals." Op­posing teams had better beware -the Irish don't plan to let anyone get in their way this year either.

. lAUGH IN 

Single, funny and Beautiful 
Humor Artists: all about sex appeal, special guests ... and nipple tassels? 
Ifl were a little less busy and a lot more shameless, the first thing I'd join immediately is the Humor Artists, also known as HA! For those who don't know, HA! is the campus comedy troupe, and they have a show coming up this Friday, November 12, at 7:00 p.m. in the Hesburgh Library Auditorium. Since I'm too shy to be a Humor Artist myself, it's the least I can do as an adoring fan to dedicate my column to their unabashed self-promotion. I am sure that their upcoming show is worth your while, but why should you take my word for it when you can take theirs? Freshman Molly McShane told me about her own personal role in the happy HA! family. "Upon first joining HA!, I was worried that I wouldn't be funny enough .... After a while, though, I began to realize something: I am the funniest person alive, See, some people might think, 'Oh, she's just cocky,' or 'Just because she's gorgeous, she thinks she's funny too.' But that's not the case. When we're practicing, people honestly have to run out of the room because I've made them wet themselves from laughing so hard. One person nearly died when they tried to eat a sandwich while watching a skit I was in." And believe it or not, McShane isn't the only hottie in the Humor Artists. When I asked junior Tony Bondi why he thought people should come to the HA! performance, he replied, "I think you would have to classify me as one of 'the beautiful people,' so I think people would want to come just to see my face. Also, I'm a business major so I have a lot of time to practice being funny." King of HA! (co-president of the organization), senior Andrew McDonnell, reminded me to mention the accessibility of the beau­tiful people in HA! He said, "We write and ac_t out our own skits, so if you' re interested in stalking any of us after the show, we cut out that distant Hollywood middleman. Chances are we'rejust a couple of dorms away. Easy-access stalking victims -yeah, that's what HA! is all about." McDonnell lives off-campus, but if anyone is interested in stalking him, I could hook you up with his address. I don't think he would mind. Of course, the sexiness of the Humor Artists themselves might not be enough to satisfy the more gluttonous members of the audience, so I asked sophomore Shane Hudnall to tell me what's in it for them. "Saying lap-dancers were coming to the show would just be wrong," he replied. "So we called a few places and got nudes instead. Think of it as our little incentive saying, 'Thank you for supporting HA!, champagne room on your left."' When I asked him if he was kidding, he said, "Guaranteed or your money back." In case any administrators are reading this, I might as well make it known that it's a free show, so his guarantee is null and void, but funny just the same. 
Sophomore Jeff Raedy added, "When you go to the HA! show, just stare at that crucifix above the stage and think, 'How can they SAY that in front of Jesus?!' Lord knows I do." But don't let the scattered depravity of the HA! show deteryou. Raedy continued to say, "HA! has been informed that for every person who reads Scholastic and does not go to the HA! show, one sweatshop worker will be denied executive washroom privileges." See, it's all for a greater good. 
Of course, the phrase "greater good" could be interpreted in several ways. Senior Mike Bradt said, "At HA!, we' re willing to sell our bodies (and our souls) for the greater good. And, of course, by 'the greater good' I mean nipple tassels." 
But if the greater good, in any sense of the phrase, won't get you to attend, the special guests certainly wilL HA! doesn't have a big enough budget to invite any big-time stars to the show, but that's okay because they're delighted to just pretend. Mahoney informed me that "there will be a Backstreet Boys pe1formance in our show, as well as appearances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Ricky Martin,. I am not one of them, but lmust admit they do a fine rendition oftheir songs." Does Leonardo sing? I guess we'll all find out on Friday. 
Junior Mike Boreale considers HA! to be not only a club, but an agent of salvation. "HA! is the essential part of my existence, without it my nights would be spent staring at a wall, thinking about how funny I could have been if only there was a top-notch sketch comedy group on campus, while simuHaneously drinking myself into oblivion." ­
Though some Humor Artists seem as though their lives depend on whether people show up at their show, others seem confident no matter what the audience looks like. McShane says, "Ifpeople don't come to our show, I'll be okay with it. Because when I look in the mirror everyday, I say to myself 'Hey, they're justjealous. It's not your fault. They're all going to rot in hell, anyway.' And then I smile, take a deep breath, and feel.better." 
And perhaps Hudnall says it best; "The show is for everyone: funny people, grumpy people, prostitutes, old people, crack ad­dicts, porn stars. The show is free and the only payment we receive is a good chuckle here and there. What do you have to lose?" 0

Mardi Gras in New Orleans -where an entire city gathers for a last, desperate fling before Lent, a cathru·sis as powerful and hectic as anything the Greeks could throw at you. 
What's that? You'd be down for some of that? Well, party animals, Cowboy Mouth, a New Orleans rock band that infuses the Dionysian spirit ofMardi Gras into its live 
'·'\'' -'i:: performances is coming to Notre Dame's Stepan Center on Wednes­day, November 17th, at 8:00 p.m. The band evades easy classifica­tion, melding a roots-rock feel based on classic rock, Cajun and zydecko music into catchy, straight-up rock and roll with a dark side. 
,l.':~j Cowboy Mouth draws its name · ·c from a play by Sam Shepard and Patti Smith, which says, "You gotta grab all the little broken-up, busted pieces ofpeople's frustration .... You gotta give it back to them bigger than life .... You gotta be a rock 'n' roll Jesus with a cowboy mouth." This has become the band's philosophy, using a frenetic live playing style to remind people of the joy of living. Their music deals with herutbreak and loss as often as celebra­tion, though the dark, bittersweet lyrics are meaningful and full of hope. Thefourmembers, whoti·ade off as the lead singer, are all sea­soned musicians, having played in 
•uc-......... a vru·iety of nationally and locally known groups before coming to­

today only the occasional drunken Greek reveler still worships Dionysus, the spi1it of the festival has been resmTected throughout history: The Romans' Bacchana­lia, the San Sebastian fiesta in Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises, Carnival in Europe and, ofcourse, band, The Red Rockers, and toured with U2 and Joan Jett. However, Cowboy Mouth's music has more in common with the Eagles, Tom Petty and R.E.M. than with Depeche Mode orTeru·s for Fears. Griffith's guitar d1ives the music, 
backed by rhythm guitarist Paul Sanchez, bassistRobSavoyanddrum­mer Fred LeBlanc, who shru·es most ofthe songwriting duty with Griffith. The band played for years as an un­derground act, always skirting the barrier ofmainstream success. There seems to be an unwritten rule in the music industry that bands have a shelf 


life ofa few years at best, yet Cowboy Mouth's three indie albums and constant touring have built a loyal fan base that has allowed them to outlast other acts and grow greatly in popularity over the yeru·s. In 1996, the band released its first major label album, Are You With Me, and is now on the verge ofexploding onto the music scene.Are You With Me, recorded during Mardi Gras, contains infectious grooves, slow, introspective pieces and powerful rock songs, such as 
"New Orleans" and the single "Jenny

acknowledged frontman, stining up the crowd with his energy. He becomes the rock 'n' roll Jesus, bringing the people to a sort of musical salvation, an expe1ience that allows them to revel in the beauty of life. "The goal is everybody getting off," LeBlanc says. "Life's not about fitting in, it's about finding your place." During the show, LeBlanc will roam through the audience, bringing the concert to a frenzied pitch.

to fill Washington Hall witb mystery and intrigue 
Chicago, 1934. As night falls on the mag­nificent Century of Progress Exposi­tion and tired visitors straggle out of the fair, a concerned barker walks Charles Lang to the gate. "This'll cheer you up," the barker says. He unfolds a letter and begins to read: "All people are connected. No one can call back what one man does." For Lang, the inventor of an amazing new engine powered by water and the main character of David Mamet's play The Water Engine, this conversation with the barker is the moment of truth. And for the playgoer, it is a moment when a 1930s world crawl­ing with a mysterious cast of colorful figures from radio stars to policemen begins to sort itself out. All people really are connected, and Lang and his water engine are an important part of that web. Now the race is on for Lang to use the connection to pass on his incredible invention before it can be stolen from him. The Water Engine, which tells the story of Lang and his fight to earn a patent for his engine, is the new Mainstage Production showing at Washington Hall from November 17-21. Directed by senior theater major Elaine Bonifield, the play chronicles the struggle ofan individual and his invention against the collective force of industry. But beneath this impor­tant theme is a play teeming with dramatic charac­ters, a mystery chock-full of murder and lies. The script's mysterious plot attracted Bonifield to the play, which faced tough competition in being chosen for the Mainstage Production. "They let me pick the play, which wouldn't happen in a profes­sional case," Bonifield says. "I stayed over fall break my junior year and read about 50 plays." The Water Engine grabbed her attention for several reasons, one being that Mamet wrote it. 
Famous for the gritty nature of his works, Mamet has authored screenplays such as The Postman Al­ways Rings Twice and The Untouchables. In 1992, Mamet won a Pulitzer Prize for his play Glengarry Glen Ross. A long-time fan of Mamet's work, Bonifield noticed that other Notre Dame students were also fans even though none ofMamet's play had ever been performed on campus. 
"I love David Mamet," Bonifield says. "I love that he's a living, writing playwright from Chicago." Bonifield decided to be the one to introduce the rest of Notre Dame to the work of this modern writer. 
The Water Engine proved to be the perfect play for that introduction. For one thing, as Bonifield laughs, "There's no cuss words in it!" The history of the play especially interested Bonifield, for The Water En­gine originally was written as a radio play for Na­tional Public Radio. Later the play made the transi­tion to the stage and finally to the screen as a televi­sion-movie. In a note preceding the script, Mamet acknowledges these transitions and offers directors the opportunity to choose whether to keep the origi­nal radio play idea in its entirety or to integrate that idea into a stage production. "The actors and direc­tors should feel free to use the device ofspeaking into microphones as much or as little as they wish," Mamet writes, "and should feel constrained to be consistent only to their own creative fantasies." 
This poetic license especially intrigued Bonifield, who chose to keep the original concept of the radio show and then pick scenes to extend from the show into real life, as acted out on the stage. "They're in the studios for a while, and then they come out into the real world," Bonifield explains. In this way, the characters exist on two levels: in the studio as actors and in the world as real people. 
Apart from the choice of the play, the decision to 
,c:L.>,,.28:Scholastic Ent~rtainmenL::,· . · . 

have a student di­rector in itself dis­tinguishes The Wa­ter Engine as a unique production. "We had decided to use a student direc­tor and that's a rar­ity," says Washing­ton Hall Manager Tom Barkes. A stu­dent directed a Mainstage Produc­tion two years ago, but student direc­tors before then were few and far between. 
Bonifield came into the role of di­rector with exten­sive experience. She began direct­ing her freshman yearatNotreDame with a Freshman Four play. Last year Bonifield di­

rected Three Tall Women by Edward Albee as the final project for a directing class and acted as assistant to the director in the Mainstage Production Getting Wrecked. The combination of these experiences, as well as the quality of her work, impressed the Film, Television and Theater Department, earning Bonifield the job. "It takes a special student to get to the point where the whole faculty feels that a student has the maturity to pull it off," says Barkes. "Elaine certainly had the expertise." 
Even casting for The Water Engine was interesting, as the script calls for only 10 actors for the play's 40 different characters. "They're all onstage at the same time," Bonifield says, explaining how an actor will switch characters by merely donning or removing a hat. "It's very fast-paced and very short." 
Bonifield added her own twist by having a woman play the role of protagonist Charles Lang. Erin Lutterbach, a senior FTT major who plays the part of Lang, was attracted to the play by this choice. "It seemed like an interesting directorial decision to me," says Lutterbach. "I became immediately attracted to this challenge of playing a woman in what would normally be a man's role." 
Bonifield also decided to change the mysterious voice-overs of Chain Letter into a real character, a lounge singer played by junior Katie Sise. "I play a woman who was previously a very big radio star and who now haunts the studio," Sise explains. Throughout the play, Chain Letter reads bits and pieces of chain letters, which provide motivation for the other characters. "They're like the stories you read when you open your e-mail and are annoyed," Sise says. The voice-overs, however, made Chain Letter's role slightly confusing, causing the director and cast to come up with their own singing version of the role. 
Chain Letter dons one of the most interesting costumes in the play: a vintage black dress from the 1930s, which she will wear with 
.

a white ostrich boa. Costume designer Jane Paudnicka, who hunted through Notre Dame's stock and spent a day shopping in Chicago forjust the right costumes, found the dress at the Cassaday Costume Collection in South Bend. "I think it's a really great find for that period," says Paudnicka. "Sometimes you can have a wonderful dress, but it doesn't fit. For Chain Letter, we found just the right dress and it fits her perfect!" 
Like Chain Letter's dress, most of the costumes in the play are authentic clothes from the 1930s. Not every costume could be found, though, and for those Paudnicka researched and then recre­ated costumes. "Our police uniforms are replicas," she says. 'They're the 1930s style, but it's actually a remade tuxedo." 
As hard as Paudnicka worked to find the perfect costumes, the actors worked just as diligently to polish their parts and to refine the characters who will be wearing those costumes onstage. Once practice began, the cast met from 7:00 to 11 :00 on weeknights to rehearse. Despite the time involved, the actors enjoyed the process. "It isn't so bad spending four hours a night in rehearsal when you're sun-ounded by friends," Sise says. 
Bonifield agrees that the cast has added a lot to the play' s progress. "Every single person wants more than anything for this show to be a success," she states. 
And even afterrehearsingevery scene hundreds oftimes, Bonifield and the actors remain excited about the story ofLang and the water engine. "The play is like a puzzle," Sise says. "Every time I read the play or perform it, I find something new that piques my interest." 
The title of the play may focus on a mechanical invention, but Mamet's The Water Engine offers much more than just the story of an inventor trying to get a patent. As Sise says, "It's a pretty exciting story. Hit men, chase scenes, cool gadgets .... But you'll have to come see it if you want to know the rest of the story."

How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Machine 

The ultimate realization that rehab is for quitters 
BY MATI CREMER
Iknew it would happen eventually, but I didn't think it would happen so fast. It started with simple experimentation, you know. I would hear myself saying, "Well, it's okay because I only do it on the week­ends." But pretty soon I started my "week­ends" on Thursday nights. Nights eventu­ally became afternoons and afternoons be­came mornings. I thought I could control it. I kept saying, "It's not gonna happen to me." I was wrong. I guess the major warn­ing sign was when I couldn't face my class­mates the next day in calculus because my thumbs were bloody and raw from an all-night binge with my roommate :~/ and a guy from down the hall. I ~, told the doctor at student health ~ 
me with glossy eyes, he snarls, "Hey, dude, wanna play some NCAA 2000?" At that moment, I was struck by a profound epiphany. It was as ifI stepped outside my own grotesque, racked body. My soggy, junkie brain recoiled in horror. "I've got the FEAR!" I screeched as I started gnashing my teeth and tearing the hair out ofmy dry, crusty scalp. 
I must have collapsed shortly after that. I tried to run out the door, but I found only a deep black despair where I spentthe next 48 hours staring at the end of my shoe ­twitching and babbling the entire time. The Fear must have caused some neurons to misfire in my already mushy cerebrum. I

And for god's sake,_ wil_l someone please stop these flesh-eating spi­ders from gnawing my legs off?" 
My roommate didn't help much either. I came back to the dorm, weary from the day, completely wrung out, and what did I find? The devil himself in all his wrath and fire. Rotting in his hellish stench and staring at

maybe no­where-perhaps it was all a movie playing on my eyelids. Nevertheless, I knew I couldn't deny the Need any longer. 
A faint whispering caused me to awaken. The Siren's song grew in its intensity until I could no_ longer deny its existence. 
"Matthew? Maaaaaatt? · I know you can 
l 
hear me," the horrible Playstation whis­pered. "Come back, Matt. We had such great times together. Remember that time when you scored the winning touchdown to defeat your roommate in double overtime? Or maybe the time when you had five inter­ceptions? I know you want to play. 'It's so easy. You know what to do. That's right, you need me." 

I still tried to fight the war I couldn't win. After all, my flesh was weak and the ma­chine, the horrible machine, coldly per­sisted until I could bear it no longer. 
"Look at you!" it growled. "You're such an idiot! Don't you know that I can solve all your problems if you would just LET ME BACK IN? Now get down here and play me!" 
That last snarl put me over the top. I tore offmy tangled, sweat-soaked sheets and ran to my salvation, my fix. The nightmare of the last few days defeated all the self-con­trol I had. I knew that I was too far into it. Buy the ticket. Take the ride. The warmth qufokly returned to my body as I hit that power button. The twitching and burning stopped as I took a firm grip on the control­ler. The familiar euphoria that only a Playstation can give me coursed through my veins once. again. Back-brain pleasure nodes soon became bathed in the bliss ofEA Sports. I accepted my fate as a Playstation addict.

For those unfortunate souls, ihave just one piece of advice: Don't · waste time trying to kick the machine habit, because the only real solution to this addic­tion is death. Only in death can you escape the Fear. Instead, redirect your fear into · Playstation prowess by focusing on devel­oping a healthy, addicted relationship with the machine. Stop worrying and let your brain atrophy in mind-numbing, electronic, Playstation bliss.

by Father Theodore Hesburgh 

Changing Times 
I find that students today have no .:idea ·how bad things were back in ·the late'50s and early'60s; It was ... a legacy of slavery and the century 
following slavery. 
Father Theodore Hesburgh is the former president ofthe University ofNotre Dame. 

Considered by many the most influential and effec­tive president Notre Dame has ever had, Father Theodore Hesburgh has seen-andbeen involved in -many ofthe major events ofthe 20th century. In lightofthis week's cover story on how the school has fared in reaching its goals for the year 2000, Scho­lastic charged Hesburgh with the task oflooking into our society's goals as well. We asked him to choose the most influential or important event of the cen­
.tury. The magazine staff would like to thank the former president for his time and cooperation.
There were a large number ofstupendous hap­penings during the past century. It would be difficult to pick and choose among them for what was most important. 
If one focuses on the United States, one cannot overlook the enormous cons e q u enc es of World War I, World_ WarII, Korea and Viet­nam. The impacts of those four wars on the United States and its life are gigantic. Again, that is too big an event 
to sum up in a few words. There are a whole string of lesser events that certainly are important in their own right, but again, it is difficult to pick and choose among them. Speaking for myself and my own experience, I would highlight the civil rights revolu­tion, which ran through the '50s, '60s and even '70s and, of course, is still continuing to a lesser extent. 
My involvement began in 1957 when President Eisenhower asked me to become a member of the six-person Civil Rights Commission which had just been set up by the Congress. He picked three Repub­licans and three Democrats (I am an Independent, really) to form the commission in the fall of 1957 and we were sworn in at the White House on January 2, 1958.Fortlieensuingmonthsleftinthetwo-yearlife of our commission, mandated by Congress, we held hearings all over the country, where we tried to establish the facts regarding voting, education and employment, which were three ofthe key elements in the civil rights revolution. 
When we published our final report in September of1959,ithadsuchaneffectonPresidentEisenhower and the Congress that our commission was renewed for another few years. We undertook the additional task of assessing housing, administration of justice and public accommodations. Again, we had hearings all over the country, highlighting the problems and suggesting legal solutions. Not much happened dur­ing the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations; but when Lyndon Johnson became President follow­ing the assassination of President Kennedy, he ad­dressed the Congress in January, two months after being sworn in as President, and told them we were going to solve this problem. No one else could have done it, but being a southerner and having run both the House and the Senate, he was able to twist enough ..arms.. to pass the monumental 1964 Omnibus Civil Rights A.it thai:"we:iiaci sugges"ted. Without President Johnson's-support, it would never have been enacted 
by Congress. 
That act, plus the Voting Rights Act in the next year 
and the Housing Act a few years later, literally changed 
the face of America. 
I find that students today have no idea how bad 
things were back in the late'50s and early '60s. It was, 
of course, a legacy of slavery and the century follow­
ing slavery. Blacks simply did not have the basic 
rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, as 
President Johnson pointed out. The Omnibus Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 changed much of that. 
The battle, of course, is not over. Many problems 
still remain, but the fact is that our efforts to liberate 
the blacks also liberated millions of women and 
Hispanics. Theface ofAmerica was changed forever, 
and for the better. There will never be a more heady 
time in the achievement of social justice for our 
nation. There is still a long way to go, but we have 
taken a greafleap forward in assuring basic human 
rights for all Americans, including blacks, women, 
Hispanics and many other minorities. 0
