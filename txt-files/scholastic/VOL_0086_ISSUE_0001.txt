Here’s a fight that’s far from over—against tuberculosis, the dread plague that still kills more Americans between 15 and 45 than any other disease.
Your annual purchase of Christmas Seals since 1904 has helped cut the TB death rate 75% I And TB can be wiped out — some authorities say by the year 2000.
Yet wartime conditions give TB a new lease on life—human life.
So please, help us bring up the reserves^ This year, buy extra Christmas Seals. Remember, there can be no peace treaty with tuberculosis.

The editorial staffs of two of our largest college dailies, the Ohio State Lantern and the Minnesota Daily have been taking the students of those universities to task for the poor sporstsmanship being displayed by the student bodies at football games. Let us hope that it doesn’t fall to the lot of the Scholastic staff to do likewise during either the football or basketball seasons.
Minnesota has restored its Snow Week as an annual campus event after a lapse of several years. That might not occur at Notre Dame; but couldn’t we have a Rain Week? Any week will do!
The University of Detroit’s Inquiring Reporter dug up an old chestnut, to wit: “What qualities do you consider most important in the opposite sex?” Almost unanimously the answer was “Personality is more important than good looks.” Funny, but in our travels around the campus, we have yet to see a picture of that old personality gal hung up on a wall anywhere. Could N. D. students put good looks before personality?

Students Make Trip to Northwestern Tomorrow
Tomorrow, Saturday, November 17, the first post-war Notre Dame student football trip will take place. The destination is Evanston, Illinois, and the occasion is the Notre Dame-Northwestern game.
All classes will be cancelled at the University Saturday morning, thus permitting any and all ticketholders to travel to the fracas with a free and easy conscience. There will be no special trains for the trip, so students attending the game may travel at their own convenience. The extended weekend will begin after the last class on Friday and any student who desires may leave then.
Seven hundred tickets, all that were available to the student body at Notre Dame, have been snapped up, indicating that the Irish will have a large-number of rooters present to cheer them to victory. This assemblage will be swelled by the students who may have already obtained tickets from regular sources. ’
The Notre Dame band, 145 strong, will entrain for Evanston, Saturday morning to provide music and rhythm for the Irish forces. With them will go the school’s cheerleaders and the new Notre Dame mascot, Clashmore Mike II.
Not since the pre-war junket to the Army game in 1941 has there been a student trip at Notre Dame. It is hoped that starting again with this season the trip will return to its former place as the high spot of the football season each fall.

Karl E. Schoenherr Is New Dean of Engineering
Fr. O'Donnell Appears Before Senate Committee
As the winter term opened on November 5, Karl E. Schoenherr, former naval architect at the D. W. Taylor Model Basin in Carderock, Maryland, assumed his position as the dean of the college of engineering at Notre Dame.
Mr. Schoenherr succeeds Col. D. C. Jackson, who resigned when he entered the service in 1942. Raymond Schub-mehl, who has been acting dean of the college of engineering since Mr. Jackson entered the service, will remain as professor in the engineering college.
The new dean, who was born in Karlsruhe, Germany, and received his primary and secondary education in Durlach, Germany, was graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and received a M.A. degree at George Washington university. Mr. Schoenherr received a doctorate degree in mechanical engineering at Johns Hopkins university.
Upon graduation he joined the staff of the U. S. Expl. Model Basin as junior engineer- and advanced in steps to position of naval architect. He is now in charge of the section dealing with resistance and propulsion at the naw D. W. Taylor Model Basin. For the past 12 years he has maintained a private practice as propellor designer and powering specialist. There are about one million tons of American shipping equipped with propellers of his design.
Mr. Schoenherr, who has been associated with Dr. Albert Zahm, former Notre Dame professor now in the Guggenheim Chair of Aviation in Washington, in many recent experiments, is the author of several important articles. Among them are sections of “Resistance and Propulsion” and “Rudders and steering of ships,” in “Principles of Naval Architecture,” published by the S.N.A. and M.E., and three important papers read before this organization in 1931-32 and 1934 dealing with resistance and propulsion of ships. He has made contributions to the discussion of many other papers and many Model Basin reports.
This represents the first step taken in the postwar pains of Notre Dame designed to strengthen the university. The plans call for the rebuilding and strengthening of departments throughout the five colleges of the university, which were necessarily weakened during the war by the absence of faculty members and the dearth of students, and the further development of graduate programs of teaching and research in the Arts and Letters and Science
6
divisions of the Graduate School. The introduction of graduate work into more fields of engineering is also contemplated.
In engineering the tradition goes back to men like Dr. Albert Zahm. In
Karl E. Schoenherr
more recent times the department of metallurgy was one of the first at Notre Dame to offer work leading to the doctor’s degree. Its laboratories rank high among those of American universities. Work has heretofore been largely concentrated in the field of physical metallurgy, but work in other fields will be included in the future. Plans for . development of advanced study and research in other fields of engineering are still in the formative stage.

Pointing out that “while the Magnuson bill may suggest a departure from the traditional relationship of American universities to the government, changing times of necessity bring corresponding changes in methods,” Rev. J. Hugh O’Donnell, C.S.C., president of the University of Notre Dame, testified before the U. S. Senate committee of commerce October 19 on behalf of the proposed legislation which would provide for a national research foundation.
Father O’Donnell explained the reverse in policy of seeking government support for private research by declaring that “in view of what is happening in the world, I believe that it is necessary for the national defense. If it were not for this consideration I would oppose unalterably government assistance.”
Denying he was a “prophet of doom,” Father* O’Donnell said he could see “the formation of a world pattern that seriously threatens the only principles upon which a lasting peace can be built. The opposing philosophies are arrayed against each other now just as surely as they were when Nazism struck its first blows against western civilization. On the one side are those who accept the American—and Christian—tradition and believe in the existence of God, the god-given rights of man, and the dignity of the human person. On the other side is the philosophy of materialism—or Communism, Fascism, atheism, or secularism; call it what you will— that degrades man into an irresponsible automaton that comes into being without God or basic morality, and eventually returns to the nothingness whence it came.”
The Notre Dame president then went on to say the American people must be realists and not “lose sight of the fact that in making peace we must prepare for every eventuality.” Father O’Donnell said scientific “know-how must be accompanied by a stabilizing know-why —a moral and intellectual rectitude that does not confuse the means to an end with the end itself.”
Father O’Donnell concluded by stating “that the passage of this bill will contribute to the general welfare of the people of the United States for defense against both external and internal enemies of disease and want.”

NOTRE DAME STUDENT BODY WELCOMES TEAM BACK FROM ARMY GAME
—Jim Ferstel
“Welcome home gang! It was a grand fight,” said more than a thousand cheering Notre Dame men who met the Fighting Irish at Union Station in South Bend on Monday of this week, as the team returned home from the Army game.
With the cooperation of Father Kehoe, prefect of discipline, the student council, and with a great deal of spontaneous spirit shown by the student body, the traditional practice of meeting the team upon its return from the Army game, whether in victory or defeat, was carried out in a manner reminiscent of the days when Rockne led his stalwarts across the Nation.
Despite the grey overcast morning,
the crowd gathered early at the circle. Availing themselves of busses, taxies, or “shoe-leather express,” students flocked to the South Bend terminal and jammed into the lobby to await the squad’s arrival on train No. 259 from the east. “U. N. D. for the team” resounded throughout the station at approximately 8:30 and the band struck up the Victory March as Captain Frank Dancewicz led his teammates forward to the enthusiastic throng.
Ceremonies at the station were brief. Dancewicz thanked assembled students on behalf of the team, and amid rousing cheers players filed through the crowd to waiting cabs and left directly for the campus.
Pushing their way rapidly out of the station, spirited students formed a huge procession behind the band and started the march back to school. “Go Irish, beat Northwestern,” was shouted by a few rnd soon the entire crowd took up the chant as they surged down Michigan Avenue from the station and moved on through South Bend towards the campus.
There was no moaning over the recent defeat. Army’s might was recognized. But as the crowd dismissed at the circle, looking forward with confidence towards the coming encounter with Northwestern, there was a feeling that when next the N. D. gridmen tangle with West Pointers in Yankee Stadium, the outcome would be somewhat different.
New Profs Added to
N. D. Teaching Staff
Several outstanding men were added to the faculty of the University as the winter semester opened.
Vito a Girone, who has gained prominence in the field of architecture, assumed his duties as instructor in architecture at the University. Mr. a Girone, who has just been discharged from the Army, was an engineer in the Engineer Office of the Alaskan Department, where he was in charge of the Real Property Account study. He has been recommended for the Legion of Merit.
Prior to entering the service, he had graduated from the Newark School of Fine and Industrial Arts in 1932, studied for two years at the Atelier Newark, studied in the New York University School of Architecture and won a scholarship to Harvard University in national architectural competition. He studied at the Ecole Americaine, Fontainebleu, France, in 1937 and then returned to this country to complete his Beaux Arts training. He won a medal for interior design in Beaux Arts.
Dr. Leo Camp, former instructor at St. Mary’s College, Calif., has joined the Notre Dame faculty as instructoi-
in English. Mr. Camp received his Ph.D. degree at the University of Washington and continued post-graduate work at Laval, Canada.
Walter L. Wilkens, former professor of education at Notre Dame, has returned from service and will assume duties in the Department of Education and in the University Counselling Service. He was active in clinical psychology at the separation center in San Diego,
Francis X. Bradley, former student in mathematics at Notre Dame, has been discharged from the Navy where he was a Lt. Cmdr., and is serving as graduate assistant in the Department of Mathematics.
Dr. Rufus Isaacs has been added to the faculty as an assistant professor of mathematics. He attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology and received his Ph.D. at Columbia University. The professor was employed at United Aircraft Corporation before coming to Notre Dame.
Meanwhile, Prof. Frank N. M. Brown, head of the Department of Aeronautical Engineering at Notre Dame, has been granted a leave of absence from the University to participate in Government research at the Johns Hopkins Laboratory of Applied Physics at Silver Springs, Maryland.
Over 500 Veterans
Attend Club Smoker
More than 500 veterans attended the Smoker sponsored by the Notre Dame Veteran’s Club Wednesday, November 7, in the West Dining Hall to welcome the new veterans enrolled in the University. Jerry Wayno, club vice president, headed the committee in charge of arrangements.
Highlight of the evening was the showing of the 1945 Notre Dame-Navy game film. Tim Bradley, who spotted the game for Ted Husing, narrated dur-, ing the showing of the film.
Short talks were given by Rev. John Cavanaugh, C.S.C., vice president of the University, who welcomed the new veterans to school, and Rev. Theodore Hes-burgh, C.S.C., club Chaplain.
Music for the evening was provided by Bob Olcese and his University Dance Orchestra. The 12-piece band played hot jive numbers that made the Dining Hall jump, as well as smooth swing. Frank Kowalski m.c.’d the show, which included the singing of Johnny McGuire, who has a tenor voice as Irish as his name, and the superb piano playing of John Galloway.
The serving of refreshments concluded the evening’s activities, which lasted from eight p.m. until eleven.

NOW
Your NOTRE DAME
Welcome to Notre Dame! This greeting is extended to all Freshmen, returned veterans, and everyone on the campus. Our Lady receives you with open arms.
Here are a few practices which are part of our daily routine: it is customary to greet those encountered on the campus even though their names are not known, and for civilians to tip their hats to the religious; it is also customary for every student to visit the Grotto at least once a day; it is traditionally improper for the students to use the front steps of the Administration building until the day of graduation; it is also traditionally improper for any student to smoke in the old quadrangle; uniformed men in marching array are always given the right-of-way; and the Notre Dame monogram is the only athletic emblem worn on the campus.
The Notre Dame Scholastic made its first appearance on the campus in September, 1867. Although the character of the magazine has changed over the years, it still is, as it was in those days, a valuable source of information for anyone who wishes to keep abreast of events at Notre Dame.
In the early days strict disciplinary supervision over the students was maintained. One hundred years ago the Notre Dame boy rose at 5:30 for prayer and meditation. At 6:30 he attended Mass, which was followed by a brief period. of study and breakfast. The rest of the morning was set aside for classes, except for a 15-minute recreation period. Following the noon-day meal classes began at 1:30 and continued uninterrupted until 4:00, when 30 minutes of recreation was allowed the pupils. They went back to their books until 6:00, when they gathered for a spiritual conference and prayer. After supper there was another study period. Promptly at 9:00 everyone was in bed, and glad to be there too!
The class dances which form so large a part of every student’s life did not begin at Notre Dame until 1905. Father
Arthur Hope, C.S.C., in his book “Notre Dame, One Hundred Years,” reports: “In April of that year the seniors held a ball. It took place in the apparatus room of the gymnasium. The room had been decorated with bunting and streamers, the orchestra was concealed behind a forest of palms, and a punch bowl ensconced in an artistically decorated booth!” At the intermission, it is said, more substantial refreshments were to be had.
After Father Sorin’s death in 1893, considerable effort had been made to secure a heroic statue of this beloved priest who devoted his life to Notre Dame. It was to cost §25,000. But it was not until May 3, 1906 that the statue and its massive granite pedestal were in place and ready for the unveiling at the entrance of the old quadrangle.
The reason why the movies in Washington Hall are so outmoded is that the South Bend theatre operators prevailed upon the film industry to withhold the new pictures until they have been exhibited in South Bend movie houses three times. The agreement dates back to the early nineteen hundreds.
Knute Rockne was not the first paid coach at Notre Dame, as popularly supposed. Jesse Harper, a Chicago University alumnus, came to the campus in 1912 and remained for six years. Rockne took over the reins in 1918 and, until he met his untimely death in 1931, kept the “Fighting Irish” in the front of the Nation’s teams.
The Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes is the most frequently visited spot on the campus. It is here that all Notre Dame men since 1896 have come to pray, and to ask Our Lady for some special request. The Grotto is constructed of huge boulders, some weighing two or three tons. The statue of Our Lady of Lourdes rests in a niche at the right, and facing her, on the pavement below, a replica of St. Bernadette. Father Thomas Carroll, whose generosity made

it possible, would indeed rejoice if he could see the steady procession of students who come to kneel before Oui‘ Lady’s outdoor altar.

Rockne Memorial Pool Will Open Next Week
Swimmers here will be glad to know that renovations will soon be completed on the Rockne Memorial swimming pool.
The work on the pool was originally scheduled to be completed by the start of the semester but because of labor difficulties the pool was not in readiness. John Scannell, head of the Physical Education Department, expects that the pool will be open for use by next week.
The facilities of the Rockne Memorial
are perhaps in their best condition since the erection of the building as a result of the painting, varnishing, and repair work that has been done throughout the athletic center. The walls of the handball courts have been painted and the floors varnished as were the floors of the basketball courts. The apparatus rooms were also put into their best condition.
Mass Club to Meet
New students on the campus are invited to join with the Mass Club members in a meeting this Sunday evening at 7:30 in the Architecture Building library. The club was formed several terms ago at the request of students who are interested in knowing more about the Sacrifice of the Mass and the Liturgical Life of the Church.
It's Happened Every Year For More Than a Century
It was on January 15, 1844, that the legislature of the State of Indiana chartered the University of Notre Dame du Lac, and from those early days when the first Indians and trappers came out of the surrounding woods and lined up for admittance, and until the present, 101 years later, there has been laid upon our city of knowledge the curse of registration. Lines to see the director of student accounts, lines to fill out census cards, lines to see the dean—need we go on?
Possibly such thoughts were in the minds of many last Monday and Tuesday as the returning veterans received a second helping of one of the more disagreeable aspects of army life; the fledgeling, awaiting his message from the President, got a preview of what was awaiting him; and the 4-F got a taste of what he was missing.
This semester, with civilian enrollment swelled to the highest point since pre-' war days, the rigors of registration were multiplied many-fold. Travel-weary students signed and re-signed their John Hancock. Long lines stretched through the corridors of the main building, and newcomers endeavored to follow the signs which pointed to the dining hall, the laundry, etc.
Timid, unsuspecting souls paid their-hot water- fees. The lamp used originally by Knute Rockne was sold and re-sold. The one-and-only easy chair in which rested the hulk of the Gipper became part of the quaint legend surrounding many an overstuffed monstrosity recently put up for sale.
Truck load after truck load of baggage rolled up to the circle as a straggling procession took place similar to the migration of the Okies or the flight from Warsaw, as haggard students staggered with lamps, chairs, old books, etc., from Breen-Phillips to Dillon, from St. Ed’s to Walsh to Sorin, and even over to Badin.
Yes! the first days were ones of turmoil, and perhaps confusion still lingers. But don’t worry gang, it should seem like fun thirty years from now when you look back on it—so it says here.
Oh, well! when your kids go through it, think of the revenge you’ll get.
DEBATE CLUB
All those interested in joinin? the Debate Club should appear in room 327 at 4:15 Monday, November 19th, Main Building.
May we offer a word of warning to the new freshmen (by now no doubt completely bewildered). You have spent a large part of your time here waiting in line—for- meals, for books, for laundry. Now put down on your list something else to wait for—the “Scholastic” (local propaganda organ) to come out each Friday. You -will find in each issue (we hope) this column which represents our combined talents (which our profs will tell you don’t amount to much). We shall endeavor to set forth material which will brighten your first semester here at N. D. and so, with this word of warning, we launch into that example of humor which bears the sibilant title “Frosh Froth.”
SONG OF NEW FRESHMEN
Well, here I am at Notre Dame It says so on my jacket
In three-inch letters, gold and blue.
(I hope that wear won’t crack it!)
I hear they’ve got a football team
(I guess I could have made it)— “All-State back from Podunk High”
I’m sure I’d be a great hit.
ADAM FOOL REPORTS
Dear- Characters,
My second crusade has passed through the quiet streets of South Bend, leaving in its wake a trail of frightened kiddies, puzzled men, and screaming women. Now the normal living of this little Indiana hamlet has resumed its peppy pace, because once again I’m safely behind the locked gates of my alma mater.
This beloved Dachau of mine has not changed much during the ten days I have had off for good behavior. The food is as much of a mystery as ever, the discipline as lenient as before, the guys still bum my cigarettes, and St. Marys is still a mile and a quarter through the woods. But enough of this griping; I must be happy, gay, joyful and witty, not being the possessor of the visage that makes little children cry out, “What the heck is that?”
Well, dear children, my homework is calling (heh! heh!) and I must meet her to help her keep up the wall at Walgreens. So you’ll be seeing me (but not if I see you first).
Your Pal,

CAVANAUGH HALL READING ROOM
AU this and a new coat of paint.
That soft - chair- cigarette - and -a- book idea has certainly taken hold. The Cavanaugh Hall Reading Room has already more than proved its value to the student body.
Two terms ago the student chaplains contributed their libraries, consisting of over 2000 volumes; the Rector of the hall reopened the recreation room in the Cavanaugh basement which had been closed most of the five previous years, and the administration of the University lent its willing help. Students immediately took over. Easy chairs of departing students were donated; lamps, ash-trays, end tables and bookends were added. Things were shaping up. Men from Cavanaugh, Zahm and Breen-Phillips pasted book-plates and catalogued the library; others offered one night a week of their time to become
Eligibility Under Gl Bill of Rights
By DAVE OLSON
It is reasonable to assume that because of the large number of naval trainees enrolled here at Notre Dame there would be continuous discussion among the men of the program as to how the GI Bill of Rights pertains to them when the long awaited discharge arrives.
Questions which arise differ with each individual status in the program. Some are men with previous sea duty and college credit; some have sea duty and
librarians.
Results? Nearly 2200 students have spent a restful evening browsing through books, reading periodicals and newspapers, studying. Book-borrowing has mounted up to nearly a thousand. New books have been added to increase the library by 290. The student body likes the place. They talk about it, they bring a friend with them when they drop in. Not a book has been lost, not a book mutilated and fines are paid cheerfully. Men of wide tastes visited the reading room last semester. Books in every section from novels to theology were borrowed.
The reading room is again open this term, welcoming all — especially the frosh. Hours are: 7:00 p.m. to 9:45 p.m., every day except Saturday.
no previous college credit; others entered the navy college program directly after graduation from high school and began with a regularly prescribed navy course, later launching into the desired major field; and still others were already enrolled in colleges and universities when they enlisted and merely continued in the field of their choice under V-12 or NROTC. Questions likely to arise are varied and rather involved in nature. One of the more pertinent concerns the educational benefits of the bill.
If any man in the navy program completes his training and receives a commission, educational benefits cannot be (Continued on page 21)

Library Gets Recordak
A Recordak Library Film Reader, which the library tried to secure just before the war, has arrived. For the present it has been placed in Miss Conley’s office just off the main reference room and is ready for use. It will handle either 16 mm. or 35 mm. film. Some films are available in the University Library, particularly in the fields of American History and Church History. Film may be borrowed from other universities, from the Library of Congress or from other libraries; it may be purchased at a very reasonable rate. The University Library for some time has been microfilming documents and rare books here in the library at the request of persons away from the campus. Films of manuscripts in libraries in foreign countries, if at all obtainable, may be purchased through University Microfilms, 313 N. First Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Band Makes Trip to Game
Mr. Hope has stated that the band will journey to Evanston, Illinois, for the Northwestern game. The Notre Dame band was the first college band to play the “Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe,” using Mister Hope’s own arrangement of the hit just when it first came out.
There are now approximately 140 players in the Notre Dame Band, showing a great increase over the number of men in the organization last semester. For the first time since the naval program was inaugurated at Notre Dame, the Band consists mainly of civilian students. Mr. Hope is especially pleased at the large number of clarinetists who have recently entered the Notre Dame Band. At the Northwestern game the Band, in answer to popular request, will play the “Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe,” and will execute the routine given previously while playing the “Surrey with the Fringe on Top,” which was published in the Octobei- 15th issue of Life magazine.
Mr. Hope has divided the Band into two parts: the Pep Band, which will play at all the Basketball games this season, and the Marching Band, to be used for other occasions. Mr. Hope is definitely looking forward to an especially good concert series this coming season, aftei- the Basketball Season is completed.
Ninety-five Students
Sing in Glee Club
In preparation for continuing their successes of last semester, the members of the Notre Dame glee club met during the past week to begin their regular noon-houi* practices. The ranks of the organization were opened to new members for several days, and when the try-outs were finished on Friday, the glee club possessed over 95 voices.
Mr. Daniel H. Pedtke, director of the glee club, is now making plans for the semester’s activities. These will include several campus concerts and concert tours in Indiana and Illinois. One of the concerts to be given will be a special Christmas program.
Students Go To Chicago
A Demonstration Quiz Match on Inter-American Affairs was held November 11 at St. Xavier College, 4900 Cottage Grove Avenue, Chicago, between the Inter-American Affairs Club Team (Frank Foss, Captain, U. S.; Tom Murray, U. S.; Ernie McCullough, Canada) and the La Raza Club Team (Jaime Velez, Captain, Colombia; Edgar Cordova, El Salvador; Juan Anza, Mexico).
Father George I. Smith Stresses Cardinal Virtues in Talk at Fall Convocation
Thomas McCaughey, president of the graduating October class receives his degree from the Rev. J. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C., president of the University. The Rev. George L Smith (in white robes), convocation speaker, is seated at the right.
All relations with our fellowmen and with God must be governed by a code of right living built on the stable foundation of the cardinal virtues of prudence, justice, fortitude and temperance, Rev. George I. Smith, O.P., associate professor of engineering at the University of Notre Dame, told graduates of the University at the Fall convocation, held on October 25th in Washington Hall.
“A man’s character and moral life find complete expression in his habits.” declared Father Smith. “Present habits disclose the nature of past career: the ease and facility now acquired through them are the results of victories in the struggle to overcome difficulties, or of defeat, surrenders and neglected opportunities . . . Habits are an index of future performance; although they are not irresistible and do not destroy freedom of action, nevertheless they do produce such facility and promptness for acting in one particular way that the probabilities are, when habits are strong, that a person will continue to follow them in the future as he has done in the past.”
Father’ Smith emphasized to the graduates that some of them will be pledged to the observance of the particular code of ethics of their respective profession, but pointed out that every true code of ethics must be based on the cardinal virtues.
“Codes of ethical standards in business,” continued the professor, “advocate truthfulness in advertising, honest salesmanship and fair competition. The origin of such worthy motives can easily
be traced to the same principles that generate the cardinal virtues.” He went on to explain that professional men have codes of ethics to safeguard the integrity of their professions.
“The cardinal virtues,” explained Father Smith, “transcend the various so-called codes of ethics in scope and object; such codes do not pretend to make men morally good except insofar as their actions pertain to the particular vocation to which they are called. Vocational ethics may be lax in matters considered foreign to a particular business or profession. Immoral habits of intemperance and imprudence, unless notorious, may not entirely ruin a member’s standing among his associates. Vocational ethics seem to leave it to public moral consciousness to condemn offenses that appear to have no bearing on efficiency and reliability in the vocation itself. In this respect the code of ethics falls far short of a true moral code in perfect conformity with the four cardinal virtues.”
Father Smith concluded with the thought that Catholics have no monopoly on the moral virtues, but they do have the additional aids and incentives provided by the instruments of Divine Grace—prayer and the sacraments.
“Your practice of the cardinal virtues,” he said, “is enhanced by the infused virtues of faith, hope and charity. All virtues are so connected that none can possess the perfection of any single virtue without having all the virtues in some degree.”

ATTENTION, ALL JOINERS!
By JIM
The extra-curricular activities about the campus have always been an integral part of life at Notre Dame. Interests among the students, though many and varied, are met and stimulated through the various university clubs and organizations, ranging from the prosaic Aero Club to the ‘fat-chewing’ Wranglers. All the students are urged to seek out those clubs that are best suited to their interests and ambitions. Here is a list and descriptions of the organizations active at present:
The Knights of Columbus is the only national fraternal organization on the campus. Since it was founded in 1910, the Notre Dame Council has been one of the largest and most active of campus organizations. Dedicated to the ends of friendship, charity, and Catholicity, it finds a prominent place in the life at Notre Dame.
The Wranglers is the oldest student organization on campus. As the name suggests, it was in its early years a forensic society, however, it has since developed into a discussion group. Weekly meetings are held at which a paper- is given by a member of the group, and a discussion follows. Topics of the papers are not limited and treat of any and all fields. Membership is limited and subject to the approval of the members.
The Commerce Forum is limited to twenty-five members from the College of Commerce. At the weekly meetings, papers treating of topics in the fields of business and commerce are presented by members and at times the group is addressed by some prominent personality in the commercial field.
The Economic Round Table was founded over a decade ago to further interest in economics and economic problems. At each meeting of the group, some faculty member is entertained who addresses the club and then passes comment on the evening’s discussion.
One of the most interesting organizations on campus and, in pre-war days, one of the most active groups, is the Radio Club. The purpose of the club is to provide an outlet for those students who feel that their talents may best be employed in radio. Much training is provided for professional work. The club holds semester tryouts and hopes to resume its pre-war activities of five programs a week over station WSBT.
Students who hail from the nations of our South and Central American Republics form themselves into the LaRaza Club, meeting under the direc-
12
BURNS
tion of Fr. Cunningham, C.S.C. With the war over, the club will once again take up its important activity of sending a five-man panel to other colleges in the Mid-West to give a series of talks on Inter-Americanism.
The Inter-American Affairs Club is designed to strengthen and promote Inter-American affairs. At the weekly meetings, a membei- presents a short talk on the political, social, and economic highlights of his native land.
Membership in the Law Club is open to all law students. The lounge in the Law building is the accepted meeting place of the would be lawyers. Efforts are made to further the professional interests of the group.
The ‘Aero’ Club has been formed by students having a common interest in the problems and complexities of aviation. The Club’s program is so designed that new phases and problems of the aviation field are brought to the attention of the members for discussion and introduction.
To help the veteran through the difficult transition from service life to college life, is the purpose of the Veterans Club. Meetings are held weekly and the vets are addressed by prominent speakers, and a zealous effort is made to aid the ex-servicemen regain their educational interests and to orientate them in university life.
For the benefit of the off-campus students who do not have the fraternal element of the residence halls, the Villagers Club has been organized. It is the purpose of the club to unite these homeless souls and to further their social life and activities.
At present, many of the clubs that met in pre-war days have not reorganized. However, it is expected that the engineering societies, the city clubs, and others will appear in the near future. All the clubs and organizations from time to time sponsor dances, dinners, and picnics; so tear yourselves away from Rosie’s and the books, watch the bulletin boards foi* club announcements and become active members of some organization.
Talks in Detroit
Rev. William F. Cunningham, C.S.C., professor of education at Notre Dame, addressed the Michigan Catholic College Association at Marygrove College, Detroit, Michigan, on Wednesday, November 14. Subject of Father Cunningham’s talk was “College Education in a Democracy.”
Navy Students May Request Transfer
In accoi’dance with Navy V-12 Bulletin No. 334 naval personnel who are at present enrolled under the NROTC, V-12, or V-5 training programs may request to be transferred to general service. Before the issuing of this bulletin a trainee could be separated only for the following reasons: physical disqualifications, academic failure, lack of aptitude, and disciplinary reasons.
If a trainee wishes to be transferred, he must make immediate application through an official letter to the Chief of Naval Personnel via his Commanding Officer. The Commanding Officer will then forward the letter to the Bureau of Naval Personnel.
The submitting of a request for transfer does not necessarily mean that the trainee will be transfered. Because of this, Commander Hutchinson has ordered all trainees who have submitted their requests to continue with their studies until confirmation of the approval of their requests has been received from Washington.
Chest Drive Opens
The Annual War Chest Drive was officially opened for this county at a breakfast in the Rotary Room of the Oliver Hotel at 7:45 Monday morning. Attending for the University was Reverend James J. Leahy, C.S.C., Administration Assistant, and James E. Armstrong, Alumni Secretary. W. R. Walton, Managing Editor of the South Bend Tribune, presided as chairman.
Present Laetare Medal
Gardiner Howland Shaw, winner of the Laetare Medal for 1945, was praised for his exploits “beyond the call of duty” by Rev. J. Hugh O’Donnell, C. S. C., president of the University of Notre Dame, in a citation read at presentation ceremonies in St. Patrick’s cathedral, Washington, D. C., Oct. 22. Mr. Shaw, a former assistant secretary of state, was lauded by Rev. O’Donnell for his application of Christian principles in the diplomatic field and for his work among delinquent boys. The Notre ■ Dame president, in the citation, noted that the Laetare Medal was established by the school’s founder, Father Sorin, as a “distinctive award for American Catholic laymen, who, by their life and service, have enobled the arts and sciences, illustrated the ideals of the Church, and enriched the heritage of humanity.”
Julius A. Nieuwland Professorship Goes to George A. Hennion of Chemistry Dep’t.
The first appointment to the recently founded Julius A. Nieuwland Professor
ship has been awarded to George F.
Prof. George F. Hennion
Hennion, associate professor o f chemistry at the University of Notre Dame, according to an announcement by Rev. J. Hugh 0’ Donnell, C. S. C., president of the University.
The new professorship honoring the late Rev. Julius A. Nieuwland, C.S.C., was founded by Father O’Donnell and the academic council of Notre Dame to perpetuate the memory of the world-famed chemist.
Father Nieuwland, who came into prominence during World War I for his contributions to the deadly Lewisite gas, is best known for his work in acetylene which led to the discovery of synthetic rubber known as duprene and neoprene. He was also prominent in the field of botany and founded the Midland 'Naturalist, botanical publication. It was announced recently that Dr. Theodor K. Just, former head of the Department of Biology at Notre Dame, had been appointed the first incumbent of the Julius A. Nieuwland Professorsip in Botany.
Dr. Hennion came to Notre Dame in 1928 as a freshman student in chemical engineering, and during his student days served as a student assistant to Father Nieuwland in the Department of Chemistry. He received a bachelor of science in chemical engineering at Notre Dame in 1932, a master of science in 1933, and a doctor of philosophy in 1935. During the period’from 1932 to 1935 he served as assistant in the Department of Chemistry and continued as assistant to Father Nieuwland.
In 1935 Dr. Hennion was appointed an instructor in chemistry, and from 1938 to 1941 served as associate professor of chemistry at the University. Since 1941 he has been an associate professor of chemistry and also served as director of organic chemical research at Notre Dame.
When Dr. Hennion joined the Notre Dame faculty he became the assistant to Father Nieuwland in the laboratories of the Department of Chemistry, and continued these duties until the late scientist’s death in 1936. As an assistant
he aided Father Nieuwland in the research that led to the development of synthetic rubber. He accompanied the scientist to Akron, Ohio, on November 2, 1931, when it was announced before the rubber section of the American Chemical Society that rubber had been prepared from Father Nieuwland’s compound.
Since Father Nieuwland’s death, Dr. Hennion has carried on research in the chemistry of acetylene and has conducted extensive research in synthetic organic chemistry. He has had numerous articles published, mostly in the fields of acetylene derivatives and reaction with boron flourides.
Faculty Members Attend Academy of Science Meet
The Sixty-First Annual Meeting of the Indiana Academy of Science, held at Butler University, Indianapolis, October the 18th to 20th, was attended by several members of the Notre Dame faculty. ,
Two members of the Department of Biology read papers. Dr. Theodor K. Just, J. A. Nieuwland Research. Professor of Botany and a past president of the Academy, presented a paper entitled “The Use of Embryological Formulas in Plant Taxonomy” at the Botany Section and an invitation paper “A Brief History of the Department of Biology, University of Notre Dame” before the History of Science Section. Dr. Noe Higinbotham, Assistant Professor of Biology, discussed “Some Trace Element Deficiencies in Rice.”
Dr. Paul M. Pepper, Associate Professor of Mathematics, gave a paper on “Symmetry of Metric Spaces” and Dr. Arthur N. Milgram, Associate Professor of Mathematics, a paper on “Length of Curves” before the Mathematics Section.
The Indiana Branch, Society of Bacteriologists met in joint session with the Indiana Academy of Science and elected for the coming year Professor J. Arthur Reyniers, Director of the Bacteriological Laboratories, as vice-president, and Assistant Professor Robert Ervin was re-eleted as secretary-treasurer.
The meeting was attended by Professor Edward G. Mahin, Head of the Department of Metallurgy and a past president of. the Academy, and the Rev. Robert J. Sheehan, C.S.C., Head of the Department of Biology. Mr. Morris Wagner and Julian Pleasants of the Laboratories of Bacteriology were also in attendance.
Prof. Earl E. Langwell Speaks at Teachers Meet
Peace will be determined and preserved by the social ideals of individuals and nations just as the war was won in large part by the superiority of our technical and scientific material, Earl F. Langwell, professor of French and head of the department of modern languages at the University of Notre Dame, declared at the joint meeting of the Indiana State Teachers Association and the American Association of Teachers pf French in Indianapolis on Octobei- 26.
“To know and to understand his fellowman is now a necessity for all,” emphasized Mr. Langwell, “and the ' role of the modern language teacher today is to train the greatest possible number of our citizens in this task. The study of foreign languages in years past may have been academic, but now it is of the highest importance in the preservation of our nation’s well-being.”
The Notre Dame head stressed that with the end of the war and the return home of members of our armed forces interest of the students in foreign languages has reached an all time ■ high.
“Millions of our soldiers,” Mr. Langwell concluded, “many of whom will return to the classroom, have been in close communication with peoples of other languages and their awareness of a need for competent instruction is real. With the newer methods the foreign language teachers are able and anxious to meet this demand and to serve the cause of our country in international amity.”
Co-Hop Dance Saturday Night at Progress Club
Notre Dame students who are not attending the game in Evanston tomorrow will find a pleasant way to relax and enjoy themselves after the game at a dance tomorrow night in the Progress Club in downtown South Bend.
The dance is planned by the Co-Hop Organization, a club of South Bend young ladies whoinvite all Notre Dame students—civilians and Navy men—for an evening of dancing and entertainment. Music will be provided by Bud Simpson and his orchestra; dancing will be from 8 to 11; and the admission is sixty cents. Plenty of hostesses will be on hand for the affair.
The Progress Club is located six blocks west of Michigan Street on Colfax Avenue.

Powerful Northwestern Wildcats Await Tangle With Notre Dame Irish Tomorrow
By PAUL WEYRAUCH
Northwestern and Notre Dame will tangle in Dyche Stadium, Evanston, tomorrow afternoon in the 25th game of their time-honored rivalry. A capacity crowd of 48,000 will be on hand to see if the rapidly improving but youthful Wildcats can remove the stranglehold that the Fighting Irish have maintained over Northwestern year after year. Northwestern has won only three games against Notre ’ Dame, while two were ties. Not since 1940, when Don Clawson, Red Hahnen-stein, and Bill deCorrevont whipped Milt Piepul and the Irish 20 to 0, have the Waldorf boys been able to turn back the Irish. Despite the avalanche of Notre Dame victories, these two teams annually wage an arduous contest that has made the game the attraction that it is today.
At the outset of the season, Northwestern was given little hope for much success this year. Waldorf was greeted by a mere sprinkling of experienced men from the 1944 eleven which lost all games except one. From this apparently hopeless situation, Lynn Waldorf has rigged a fighting band of gridsters who never know when they are beaten. The Wildcats opened with an 18 to 6 victory over Iowa State and followed with a startling 7 to 7 tie with Indiana, current undefeated leaders of the Big Nine. Michigan and Minnesota both spotted
Wildcat-Irish fracas promises to be plenty lively.
N. U. early scores but went on to win easily. Then came that eventful Homecoming Day in Evanston when a highly keyed Wildcat team outfought previously unbeaten Purdue for a 26 to 14 win. This game was the turning point in the season for the Wildcats. Ohio State was forced to wait until the final minutes of play before scoring a field goal to beat N. U. 16 to 14. Last week, Northwestern capitalized on Wisconsin errors to win 28 to 14.
No team can afford to make mistakes against this 1945 Northwestern crew. They have turned opponent mistakes into many touchdowns this year. Their line has been good enough in most cases to hold off enemy advances to protect leads, too. Up front, Max Morris has been outstanding at end, to say the least. Jim Lecture and Westi Hansen are the giants of the line. Their ferocious charges have been sparkling; their defensive play consistently good. The performances of Chuek Hagmann and Paul Schuetz are noteworthy in that both of these inexperienced men have proved to be capable, aggressive ballhawks, especially when the going is tough.
Waldorf has uncovered several notable backs. Dick Conners, one of the few veterans, has been dependable for his long runs and general all-around play. The passing of Jim Farrar, and

place-kicking, and running of Don Whan, Bruce Bairstow, and Bob McKinley have at times been sensational. ; Reserve strength will have an import- j ant bearing on tomorrow’s game.. Notre Dame will have an edge here.
Hughie Devore’s spirited team needs f no introduction. It is no secret Frank Dancewicz has established himself as I one of the nation’s best passers and a wizard on defense. No one whispers about the Notre Dame line—the seven men who have outfought every opposing line this year save possibly Army’s vaunted cement block. Even that great line wavered at times. Phil Colella has proven himself as a constant offensive threat and Elmer Angsman has been ripping off large gains all season. Frank J Ruggerio has been a bulwark on offense I and defense. The “toothless” wonders, Angsman and Ruggerio, will be due for plenty of action against N. U.
The problem confronting Devore is one of psychology. The Irish have been through two hard games, not without a physical beating. Army’s 48 to 0 win last week naturally did not raise Irish spirits, either. With many teams, such a defeat would cast a spell of indifference over the players but this | should not be the case with Notre Dame.

Irish Extend Winning Streak to Eight Games, Then Tie Navy and Lose to Army
By UM REGAN
Scoring decisive wins over the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Iowa, the Notre Dame football team extended its winning streak for the season to five games and received the recognition of the sports writers by being named the number two team in the country, outranked only by Army. In the sixth game of the season Notre Dame battled to a 6 to 6 tie with the Naval Academy, preserving its undefeated season and its rating of second college team in the country. Last Saturday Army soundly trounced Notre Dame, 48-0.
Notre Dame annexed its fourth straight of the season and its seventh over a two-year period by trouncing Pittsburgh 39 to 9 and extended each consecutive streak one game by defeating Iowa 56 to 0. In a game which attracted the attention of the entire country, Notre Dame outplayed Navy but had to settle for a 6 to 6 tie, as the Irish were unable to advance the ball over the Navy goal in the final seconds from the one foot line on two plays. The three games attracted a ■ total of 200,000 spectators.
After playing the great 1945 Army team on even terms throughout the first quarter last Saturday afternoon, the

Notre Dame Irish fought gallantly against the terrific onslaught of Army power and ended up with a 48-0 defeat marked up against them. It was the first Irish loss since the Army game of last year, with eight outstanding wins and the Navy tie recorded in the interim.
Notre Dame 39, Pittsburgh 9
Held to but two touchdowns in the first half, Notre Dame rallied in the second half to trounce the University of Pittsburgh, 39 to 9, on October 20 before 66,000 fans in Pittsburgh Stadium. The inexperienced Panthers of Pittsburgh were able to check the Irish in the first half but fell before the Notre Dame attack in the last two sessions.
Notre Dame gained an early lead with Frank Ruggerio plunging for touchdown after Frank Dancewicz had passed to Phil Colella to put the ball on the one-yard line in the first period. Pittsburgh picked up two points on a safety in the second period when Terry Brennan was tackled in the end zone after Pittsburgh had punted out of bounds on the Notre Dame four-yard line. Notre Dame’s second touchdown in the first half came when Dancewicz

passed to end Bill Leonard from the Pitt 10-yard line.
Notre Dame racked up four touchdowns in the second half, with Dance-wicz passing for two touchdowns and setting up a third. Two six-pointers were registered by Elmer Angsman with John Panelli and Ernie Virock accounting for the other touchdowns. Stan Krivik converted three points after touchdown with accurate dropkicks. Pittsburgh scored its only touchdown in the final minutes of the last period on a 40-yard pass play from Smodic to Herb Douglas.
Notre Dame 56, Iowa 0
With the first team playing but 11 minutes and the second eleven playing not much longer, Notre Dame walloped the University of Iowa 56 to 0 in the stadium on October 27 before 52,500 fans. It was Notre Dame’s first victory over Iowa in four games over a period of 24 years.
Notre Dame was much too strong for the Iowa eleven which is the weakest to represent that school in many years. The Hawkeyes’ attack was so impotent that they were unable to get out of their own territory in the first three quarters and failed to make a first down in the first half. The Iowa eleven managed to make three first downs during the second half. On the other hand Notre Dame accounted for 14 first downs and gained 352 yards by rushing and threw but one pass during the game, and this was incomplete.
Notre Dame scored three touchdowns in the first quarter as Ruggerio, Angsman and Colella scored. Krivik converted each of the extra points. The ' second period touchdowns were scored by Bill Gompers and John Agnone, with Krivik making but one of the extra points. The half ended with the score, 34 to 0. The Irish predominated the second half as much as they had the first. Emil Slovak, Joe Yonto, and Leon Traney carried the pigskin into pay dirt in the second half with Krivik converting one extra point and Fred Earley another. Two more points were scored on an automatic safety to make the grand total of Notre Dame points for the day 56.
Notre Dame 6, Navy 6
Outplaying the Navy the entire game except for a short stretch in the second half, Notre Dame nevertheless had to be content with a 6 to 6 tie with its undefeated service rival in a game played in Cleveland’s Municipal Stadium on November 4 before 82,000 spectators. Both teams entered the
game with perfect records and remained unbeaten as each scored but one touchdown and failed to make the point after.
The game ended at a fever pitch as Notre Dame advanced the ball with two long pass plays from deep in its own teritory to the Navy one-foot line. The second of these passes was from Dancewicz to Colella which the latter pulled down near the Navy goal line but was driven out of bounds by Tony Minisi before he could cross the goal line. Notre Dame still had time for two more plays but the stalwart Navy line threw back thrusts by Dancewicz and Brennan. Considerable controversy was aroused as to whether Colella had crossed the goal line or not, but pictures of the game seem to indicate that although part of his body was over the goal, the ball failed to get over the line before he went out of bounds. The pictures were also inconclusive as to whether Brennan had advanced the ball over the line before being thrown back.
Regardless of the tie score, which was the first that these teams have played in 18 meetings, the 82,000 fans realized that Notre Dame had outplayed the Annapolis eleven. Notre Dame out-gained Navy 295 yards to 115 yards but the Irish were able to score but once. The touchdown came in the first peroid as Frank Ruggerio plunged over from the five-yard line after Notre Dame had intercepted a Navy pass and run it back to the Navy 34-yard marker
Intercepting a pass that sailed over the head of Dick Meyer, Iowa's left end, is Johnny Agnone. George Ratterman (9) and Obem'Simons watch the Notre Dame left halfback reach up to make the catch.
and had advanced the ball 29 yards on running plays. Krivik’s dropkick try for the extra point was blocked.
Navy’s touchdown came when Clyde Scott intercepted a Dancewicz pass and raced 60 yards, midway in the fourth quarter. Notre Dame had the ball on its own 45 yard line and Dancewicz elected to try for another score and called for a pass to Bob Skoglund. The pass skimmed Skoglund’s fingertips and fell into Scott’s arms and the Navy back was never touched as he scored the tying markers. The extra point attempt by Jack Currence was -wide and the game remained deadlocked until the final whistle.
Notre Dame 0, Army 48
Notre Dame lost a game to one of the greatest teams in football history last Saturday when Army rolled to a 48 to 0 victory before 76,000 fans in Yankee Stadium, New York. Yet in defeat, Notre Dame lost none of its prestige and maintained its title of “The Fighting Irish.” The. details of the game can well be spared save to say that Glenn “Junior” Davis and Felix “Doc” Blanchard, Army’s veritable atomic athletes, scored five touchdowns while Shorty McWilliams and Clyde Grimenstein added one each to make a total of seven. Dick Walter-house converted six out of seven extra points.
Notre Dame was not without its mo
16
ments in the ball game. After Army had scored early in the game, after 2 minutes and 66 seconds to be exact, the Irish marched downfield 44 yards before losing the ball on downs. A few moments later they engineered a drive of 52 yards only to be halted. Late- in the game they penetrated the Army 1 yard line only to fumble. But never let it be said that Notre Dame did not play as hard a game as any coach or group of supporters would ever demand.
In the pre-game predictions, two extremes of luck may be cited. Gayle Talbot, Associated Press correspondent, said that he would not be surprised to see Army go for a touchdown on the first two or three plays. Army obliged when Davis scored on the fourth play of the game. To Major Amos B. Hoople, former timekeeper on the Erie Railroad, goes the distinction of being the man who picked Notre Dame to defeat Army, 27 to 20. Major Hoople also picked Minnesota to beat Indiana and Columbia to beat Penn, but that is beside the point. Notre Dame should award him a monogram.
Coach Hughie Devore was proud of his team—and so was everyone else. He particularly cited Frank Dancewicz, John Mastrangelo, and Bob Skoglund for their fine play. Said Boley, who really was a bearcat on defense throughout the game, “That was the greatest team I ever played against. It had class.”
Further indication of pride in the Irish came Monday morning when more than 1,000 students including the band welcomed the return of the defeated heroes at the station in South Bend. Notre Dame men walked in on both feet, too, in case Blanchard and Davis had any contrary ideas.
Leahy Is Returning
(The following Associated Press bulletin appeared after SCHOLASTIC had gone to press this week; the story will be amply covered in next week's issue.)
Lt. Cmdr. Frank Leahy, Notre Dame football coach on leave of absence, has been detached from duty at St. Mary's Pre-Flight school preparatory to immediate discharge, the pre-flight school reported today (Nov. 14).
Leahy, announcement said, will return to Notre Dame to act for the rest of the season as advisor to Hugh Devore, acting head coach.
► Splinters from the Press Box <
Many columnists and Monday morning quarterbacks are wondering what happened to the gridmen from Notre Dame in last Saturday’s annual game with the cadets of West Point. There is little discussion as to the relative playing merits of either team. Army entered the game with a record of fifteen straight wins and was highly touted to add another to its victory parade. The score, however, is what perplexes most of the arbiters. The Pointers were expected to annex victory to the tune of something like eighteen or nineteen points—a slightly deficient margin as comparable to the seven touchdowns and six conversions they had amassed before 76,000 people in Yankee Stadium.
The main controversy, then, appears to center about the discussion as to why the Irish line couldn’t halt some of the Army’s power drives; and, why was the Notre Dame secondary able to check but few of the long gains rolled up by Blanchard, Davis et al. Some sports enthusiasts are concluding that this Army club is the greatest accumulation of grid talent ever grouped together on one team. This minority, though, must only be reminded of the FOUR HORSEMEN of twenty years ago, the IRON MEN from Duke of about five years ago, or the accomplishments of Eva-shevski, Harmon and company of just four pigskin seasons past—and their contentions make little impression.
Others are content to rationalize the Army team’s success with the assumption that the academy on the Hudson has assimilated all the stateside grid talent available for the past two seasons. This group—and they constitute the majority—thus claim that Army, with a most auspicious recruiting system, is in reality unfair opposition for inter-collegiate competition. What these dissenters are prone to forget is that throughout the war many colleges would have been forced to abandon football if it were not for an equally efficient recruiting system under the guise of V-12, NROTC, and Marine training. "With all fairness and justification to the Blaik men this accusation of unfairness should in justice be forgotten.
Reiterating: why then was it possible for the number one team in the
country to trounce the number two club by an overwhelming score of 48-0? Can it be hastily assumed they were actually superior by seven touchdowns?
The most logical way to view this lopsided victory is to remember at least four pertinent factors which had much to do with the ultimate conclusion of the game.
Primarily it should not be forgotten that just seven days previous, the Irish had tangled with a powerful Navy eleven; the results of which quite evidently depleted the backfield of not a little bit of its potential power. Secondly, a glance at Army’s schedule up to the Irish tilt will evince that the . cadets never once were required to utilize either their first or second team for any length of time in accomplishing easily attained victories. Obviously then the cadets were in perfect physical condition for their first big game. Thirdly, the old story of youth versus experience was exemplified in this contest. It’s an old sports adage that good, strong, fleet young men are — in the ultimate analysis—no match for good, strong, fleet experienced men. Seven of Notre Dame’s gridsters were newcomers to the 1945 starting lineup; while the West Point clubs of 1944 and ’45 were identical in all but three positions.
Finally, the psychological mood of a team that -has defeated Notre Dame only seven times in thirty-two attempts must be appreciated before any judgment can be passed. Blaik and his assistants know that this is perhaps the last year that Army will be as fully prepared to do battle with the Irish on the grid field. For this reason, Blanchard, Davis, McWilliams and the others were keyed-up to a point of anticipation at meeting the Notre Dame eleven which ten short months from now will not be assessed as being young and inexperienced alongside the now invincible Army mules.
In conclusion, perhaps the best attitude toward the entire discussion can be quoted from Capt. Frank Dance-wicz’s short talk to the traditional welcoming of the student body last Monday morning, “We did our best; we were simply outmatched. In all my years of playing football, I’ve never encountered a team as powerful or versatile as this year’s Army outfit.”

NEW DISCIPLINARY OFFICER FOR NROTC, V-12
Lieut. C. R. Tomlin has been appointed disciplinary officer of the Notre Dame naval units to succeed Lt. Com. Eoy Aaron, who has been appointed head of the academic board.
Lieut. Tomlin received his commission in October 1942 at Princeton University and proceeded to Norfolk, Va., where he was assigned to an LST. Since detachment from that duty and prior to his arrival here, he has been an aide to the executive officer at the Camp Bradford Amphibious Training Base, and was stationed on the U. S. S. Myles C. Knox, a destroyer.
The new disciplinary officer first reported to the naval station here at Notre Dame January 1, 1945. He was appointed a battalion commander and the parade officer, serving in this capacity until the recent closing of the midshipman school; he was then assigned to his present task for the combined NROTC and V-12 units.
One of Lieut. Tomlin’s outstanding characteristics is his willingness to shoulder more than his share of the load. When he assumed his new post, he immediately began revising the existing internal regulations. This task, coupled with his numerous other everyday duties, necessitated much longer working hours than usual. It is customary for him to report aboard at 6:30 or 7:00 in the morning and very seldom does he leave before 8:00 at night. Not only is Lieut. Tomlin the disciplinary officer, but he is also the first lieutenant and battalion officer.
Lieut. Tomlin stated that he will treat the trainees as men and future officers of the Navy. He expects the trainees to conduct themselves at all times with the gentlemanly conduct which should be characteristic of officers. He further stated that all of the men could be assured of receiving fair play and justice. And of especial interest to the men stationed here, is the fact that Lieut Tomlin is an advocate of liberty, when the liberty doesn’t interfere with their other duties.
Track, golf, badminton, and photography claim Lieut. Tomlin’s spare time. Especially proficient in track, he prefers the high hurdles. His voice is a clue to his home town, which is Atlanta, Ga. His more than three years of. service in the Navy will come to a close this January when he receives his discharge. It is his intention then to return to Atlanta and start a chain of stores featuring self-service laundry machines.
Lieut. C. R. Tomlin
Upon entering Lieut. Tomlin’s office, the visitor will immediately notice a series of pictures of a beautiful young lady. This young lady, Lieut. Tomlin will explain, is his daughter Anne, who is three years old. Until recently Lieut. Tomlin and his family resided in South Bend, at 1029 East Jefferson Street.

Charles C. Price Is New Head of Chemical Dept.
Dr. Charles C. Price succeeded Dr. Andrew Boyle as the head of the Notre Dame Department of Chemistry at the beginning of this semester cn November 5. Dr. Price was formerly the research assistant at the University of Illinois.
Dr. Boyle will remain as a professorin the department of chemistry.
The new department head is a graduate of Swarthmore College and Harvard University. He received his bachelor’s degree from Swarthmore in 1934 with high honors and his doctorate from Harvard in 1936. While at Harvard, Dr. Price held a university fellowship and worked under Professor Louis F. Fieser.
Immediately after his graduation from Harvard, Dr. Price joined the faculty of the University of Illinois as research assistant to Professor Roger Adams. For the past nine years he has conducted extensive research in the field of high polymar chemistry in which he has attained distinction.
During the war his time was devoted largely to direction of research projects for the National Defense Research Committee, the Chemical Warfare Service, and the Committee on Medical Research.
In the summer of this year, Dr. Price was associated with the High Polymar Research Bureau of the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, and he has recently become chairman-elect of the Gibson Island Polymar Conference in 1947. He is a member of the American Chemical Society and of several honor societies, including the Phi Beta Kappa. He has served as consultant to the Hercules Powder Company, the Sacony-Vacuum Oil Company, the Eli Lilly & Company, and the Coca-Cola Company.
The acquisition of Dr. Price marks the second step taken in the post-war plans of Notre Dame to strengthen the University. Notre Dame has been traditionally strong in the natural sciences and in accordance with this tradition, the departments of the Science Division loom large in the plans of the future. Since the days of Father Nieuwland and his pioneering work in the field of acetylene chemistry, the University has had a widely recognized department of chemistry.
Research in acetylene chemistry will be continued and also programs in high polymar chemistry and in radiation chemistry, an approach to the solution of problems in chemistry which received

Large Crowds See Romeo and Juliet
The presentation of Shakespear’s Romeo and Juliet was enjoyed and appreciated by large audiences in Washington Hall on the afternoon and evening of Tuesday, November 13. This superb drama, staged by the National Classic Theatre and directed by Clara Tree Major, was presented by the University of Notre Dame concert and lecture series.
From the thrilling beginning to the tragic ending the audience was captured by the play’s spell and frequently showed its appreciation by ovations.
The acting was excellent, each person portraying the character exactly. The scenery by Irving Morrow and the beautiful costumes by Marian De Pew added immensely to the enjoyment of the production.

NAVY G. L ELIGIBILITY (Continued from page 10) obtained through the provisions of the bill. This article is written with the presupposition of a discharge or detachment prior to completion of training and commissioning.
For men with sea duty one fact is clear, and that is that they are certain to get at least one year of education if they have served a minimum of ninety days outside of the navy program, and are discharged other than dishonorably. An additional year will be granted for each successive year of service from September 16, 1940, to the termination of the present war, not to exceed four years, as long as academic and disciplinary records are up to par. But whether the time spent in the navy training program will count toward this additional college work or not rests finally upon the interpretation of. certain pertinent clauses of the law by the Veteran Administrator in each case, since his decisions are final and unquestionable in all such matters. The exact clause in question states that time served in the navy college training program does not count if said navy course is a continuation of civilian studies and is carried to completion.
The second group under discussion are the direct entrants from high school. At present nothing of a substantial nature can be found which would give education to all NROTC dischargees. It is entirely a matter of interpretation of each man’s background, that is, scholastically; and the interrelationship of the subjects taken under Navy cognizance.
Concerning the group composed of those already in college who enlisted in the Navy program, and continued their original course of study; the same rule applies to a slightly more limited extent than it did in the other two cases. For if these men are discharged or detached before completion, they can argue that some of their time was taken in fulfilling Navy requirements, which of course is true for all others as well.
And that is the picture of the educational benefits of the GI Bill of Rights with respect to the naval trainees at the Notre Dame station. It is not too bright a picture, since by far the majority of the decisions remain undecided and rest upon the subsequent interpretations of the bill.

The other day a young woman of Chicago remarked that the average man

“The gentleman should be taller than the lady he intends to kiss. Take her right hand in yours and draw her gently to you; pass your left hand over her right shoulder diagonally down across the back, under her left arm; press her to youi' bosom. At the same time she will throw her head back and you will have nothing to do but lean a little forward and press your lips to hers. Don’t pounce down on her like a hungry hawk upon an innocent dove.

MOVIE REVIEW
For those who have not seen “Spellbound”—a psychological movie starring Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck— we should like to recommend it. We have had little experience with doctors of psychiatry or with the twilight abstractions of their science, so we are not in a position to say whether Ingrid Bergman, who plays one, is typical of such professionals or whether the methods she employs would yield results. But this we can say with due authority: If all psychiatrists are as charming as she, and if their attentions to all their'patients are as fruitful as hers are to Gregory Peck, who plays a victim of amnesia, then psychiatry deserves such popularity as this picture most certainly will enjoy.
Miss Bergman and her brand of treatment is a guaranteed cure foi* what ails you, just as much as it is for Mr. Peck. It consists of her winning personality, softly suffused through a story of deep emotional content, of her ardent sincerity, her lust-

rous looks and her easy ability to toss off glibly a line of talk upon which most girls would choke.
In short, it is the story of a female psychiatrist who falls suddenly and desperately in love with a man upon whom the dark suspicion of murder is relentlessly cast. All of the circumstantial evidence indicates that he has taken the dead man’s place and, is trying to assume his position, that is, until he prudently flees. But the lady, with full and touching confidence in the intuitive rightness of her love, is convinced that her adored one is most truly a victim of amnesia. And so she follows him to his place of hiding, begins the bold attempt to unlock the mind, and finally extracts the gnawing secret of his past.
Not to be speechless about it, David 0. Selznick has a rare film in “Spellbound.”
ANOTHER MOVIE
For those who enjoy drinking—and we speak more specifically of our cloistered friends across the way, for N. D. boys don’t indulge—the motion picture “Lost Weekend” is recommended, being highly entertaining, ultra-realistic and worthy of your academic moments. It is the portrait of an alcoholic. In actuality, it is much more than a picture, it is the soul of a drunk vividly depicted in action—the tortured, lost and confused spirit of a man who cannot find his way, whose one reaction to life has become a desperate effort to escape from it.

Veterans to Hold Semi-formal Dance
The Veterans’ Club, its semester activities already well under way, held its first meeting last Monday night in the Engineering Building Auditorium with Jerry Wayno, vice-president, presiding.
A semi-formal dance to be held in the Palais Royal Friday night, November 30, and open to the entire student body, will be sponsored by the club. The dance will start at nine o’clock and run until one, with two o’clock permissions given to those attending. Bob Olcese and his University Dance Orchestra will provide the music.
A program of activities for the semester was outlined at the meeting. Activities will include a monthly Communion Breakfast, the first to be held in early December, an athletic program integrated with the University’s interhall sports, a social program that calls for at least one function monthly, and an intellectual program dealing with current problems in politics, labor and management, world events, and economics.
It was announced that all veterans will be interviewed by Rev. John J. Lane, C.S.C., Director of Veterans’ Affairs. Veterans whose surnames begin with the letters A to D inclusive were interviewed in Father Lane’s office in the Main Building on Thursday, November 15, during office hours from 8:30 to 4:30. Those whose names begin with the letters E to J were interviewed today. K to O will be interviewed on November 19; P to S- on November 20, and T to Z on November 21.
Club officers will be elected at the next meeting on Monday, November 26.
A movie of the 1943 Notre Dame-Iowa Seahawks game was shown at the conclusion of the brief business meeting.

LOST AND FOUND
Tom Schrieber was so engrossed in saying a good night to a girl for about four hours that he lost his hat. Unfortunately he only knew her first name. Anyone seeing a girl with a size 7% chapeau should contact Tom at once.
IT MUST BE ALTITUDE
Down at the Town Club the other evening, Warren Fronratk, former flying instructor, lost his balance and slid off a chair. I can’t attest as to how high he was, but he had better pack a parachute on these Saturday night flights. Art “The Arm” Walker chuckled lightly, and flexed his muscle over another brew.

PRIVILEGES
Walsh and Sorin Halls were the lucky ones on opening day at S.M.C. The fellows still can’t get over their good fortune in being the first of this semester to behold the bevy of feminine aggressors. You Freshmen had better watch out for all those “we-aim-to-please-but-can’t” hostesses; next thing you know you’ll be shopping for diamond rings. Ask one who knows!

for you premeds, Jim Kennedy is back in school and just as level-headed as ever. Every morning he says it feels like an abused rhombohedron. Poor “Rip" De Galan has piles of troubles. It really is a bloody shame. Vince Meli is the biggest lover that ever hit the campus. Ask him! I guess Neil Kelly is sewed into that new blue sweater of his. It seems that Bob Cunningham finds Maripat more interesting than Accounting; he is leaving school to take up housekeeping.
FOREVER AGNES
While on hearty subjects: How about Dick, “Bubbles” Cronin and a certain disciplinary redhead? Coach Devore better test his heart for undue palpitations of the ventricles.
MUSIC
That Sammy Kaye party should be a good one on November 23rd. What burns while Nero fiddles? Maybe the violinist at the D.A.V.—hmm? What canary food does “Thrush” McGuire endorse?
PRICE OF FAME
Bob Whitcomb, that “rise-and-shine” man, has given out 5,000 autographed pics of himself to the local belles. Besides all those addresses, he is pretty flush— thanks to Harry Nicodemus.
CULTURE
John “Duke” Tenge, Frank Snyder, and the others were enthralled Tuesday evening. On the whole Romeo and Juliet seemed well received. Pete Castelli stayed away because he thought it was Romeo and Joliet.
For your enlightenment we will close with a phrase each week. You language majors pay strict attention!
La biere est bonne.—Rousseau.
Navy Enrollment Totals 898 Men

Metal Society Meet
Mr. J. 0. Almen, General Motors research expert, addressed members of the Notre Dame chapter, American Society for Metals, at a meeting this week in the Engineering building Wednesday. Topic of Mr. Almen’s talk was “Effect of Residual Stresses on the Fatigue Strength of Metals.” Demonstrations and lantern slides illustrated the lecture.
50,000 RADARS
TWO years before Pearl Harbor the Government asked Bell Telephone Laboratories to help perfect radar as a military instrument. The Bell System, through the Western Electric Company, its manufacturing branch, became the nation’s largest supplier of radar systems.
Bell scientists designed and developed many different types of radars—each for a specific job. One particular type was standard for B-29s in the Pacific for navigation, target location and high altitude bombing. Another directed all Navy guns over five inches.
This is not surprising, for radar development and production stem from the same roots that produced and continue to nourish this country’s telephone system.
