Dear Editor:
I was very happy to see that our President and President-elect, Harry S. Truman, carried Saint Edward’s Hall in your straw vote. The Scholastic’s predictions as well as every other poll in the United States were proved wrong last Tuesday. Dewey carried every other hall on the campus. Maybe as St. Ed’s goes, so goes the nation; as Cavanaugh goes, so go Maine and Vermont.

Stock Aid Crusade
Dear’ Editor:
These past few nights have brought me undue anguish. I have tossed, rolled, squirmed, and wriggled in mortal combat with an unknown element. I have considered that it might be the ghost of those departmental mid-terms leering at me from the black depths of my garret, but the mournful wailings of the midnight wind whispered the explanation of my torment.
As the evil spectred wind rattled my window panes the vision appeared of a young Notre Dame student weighing a mere 1 rock (Bro. Stock’s head according to the latest chem research labs consists of one hard rock), ten stones and three pebbles plus a few grains of sand for good measure; and clothed in the tattered remnants of a basketball uniform.
Due to the prolonged lease of a lumber-jacket by an unknown party, this twentieth century Jean Vai jean of South Bend no longer can command the passionate kisses of the South Bend lassies. Gone is his Simon Legree lash over all economics professors; gone is
Notre Dame’s claim to the Mah Jong King of the world; gone is the heartless monster who stole this gayly colored garment, in fact just between you and me I’d say that red lumber jacket is “REALLY GONE.”
As I gazed on this humbled benumbed young man gripped by icy fingered Jack Frost, the realization of my life’s work dawned on me. I had been singled out to lead a crusade. A crusade of charity; a crusade to restore Bob Stock’s red lumber jacket. As leader of this humane movement I contribute one dime . . . to the “STOCK AID CRUSADE” and ask each ND man who chuckles at, yet sympathizes with, the plight of Brother Stock to do the same.
If we all pitch in we can put the wolf back in sheep’s clothing so that he once again will pull the wool over the fair SMC girls’ eyes.

THE WEEK
By Bob Vierhile
Top of the Week
Aeronautical engineers often are baffled by the fact that some girls with streamlined figures offer* the most resistance.
Sam Wants You
Questionnaires from the pollster who demands the right answers, Uncle Sam, have been appearing on the campus in distressing numbers. One fellow over in Zahm has been beating his brains out all week trying to find out if zoology majors are essential. For what, he did not say. This draft business poses an interesting question: Is your father a member of the draft board?
About Dummies
Several stuffed football players (not to be confused with Leahy’s charges) were snitched from the Alumni hall decorations the evening of November 13. If anyone is presently rooming with these fellows, will he kindly assist them to their* natural habitat in Room 305 Alumni. The Athletic Department is getting impatient about their absence from Cartier practice field.
White Christmas in the Black
Christmas decorations went up all over South Bend this week. Department store props were out to make this the
blackest Christmas since 1947. Local radio stations, however, have been playing Christmas carols ever since the second game of the World Series. To increase the tinselly atmosphere, Wyman’s will have Pep Fanelli making like Mr. Whiskers in their big front window. Across the street, Walt Garrity will decorate the Stratigon window. He’ll be costumed as a human being — and will fool no one.
We take great pride in the purity of the white space between jokes.

Juggler Hits Streets, as Expected
The Juggler, product of what English majors refer to as the imaginative mind, was issued last week with about as much fanfare as the issuance of pink slips. The literary quarterly’s newest innovation is that it sells for fifty cents.
Picture of a Professor
My old friend Charlie O’Brien, who handles all of my parlay winnings, reports that all is not well over in the branch office of the National Association of Manufacturers. One of Charlie’s commerce profs asked him last week if he didn’t have a brother of his in the same course last year. “No, sir,” said Charlie, “it was I. I’m taking the course over again this semester.” “Extraordinary resemblance, though,” replied the prof, “extraordinary resemblance.”
Heavyweights
After the Northwestern game, we talked to a middle-aged man who said he was the only guy living who could box Champion Joe Louis and get away without being bludgeoned. His profession was undertaking.
J. Paul Sheedy* Switched to Wildroot Cream-Oil Because He Flunked The Finger-Nail Test
IT'S EASY to laugh at someone else’s wild untamed hair. But when it’s your own, it’s a horse of a different color. So why go through life with three stripes against you? A little Wildroot Cream-Oil hair tonic grooms your hair neatly and naturally without that greasy, plastered down look. It’s non-alcoholic, contains Lanolin. Relieves annoying dryness, removes loose dandruff. Helps you pass the Finger-Nail Test! Ask your barber for professional applications. And run like a zebra down to your nearest drug or toilet goods counter for a bottle or tube, today! Your hair will look and feel better than it ever veldt!

Amethyst Rosary was lost on campus Oct. 25. John J. Reedy engraved on the crucifix. Return to 126 Alumni.
NOVEMBER 19
PALACE—One Touch of Venus. Ava Gardner’s in this one which alone makes the trip worthwhile. The attempt at a plot is as hopeless as solving question 6-b of the history departmentals. Larceny. Not quite as bad as Million Dollar Weekend, but still robbery any way you look at it.
COLFAX—Johnny Belinda. Jane Wyman and Lew Ayres team up to tear off a good-sized hunk of melodrama. The story is set in Nova Scotia, deals in a deaf-mute slave girl, kind-hearted doctor, rape, and murder. Result is a first rate performance by Miss Wyman and a good picture.
NOVEMBER 20
LEX WREX — All the legal eagles gather in the ballroom of the Indiana Club for the Law Ball. The party of the first part, in order that he may gain lawful entrance with the party of the second part, inasmuch as they might want to listen to the music of the party of the third pai-t, Kenny Ger-mann and Orchestra, will be assessed a fee of five moleskins. Tariff for party of the second part, the gal, is nolle prossed.
NOVEMBER 21
STATE—Sutter’s Gold and Seven Sinners. The first of these jobs features some guy named Sutter; the picture didn’t pan out. The second is the warm and human tale of the chow hall attendants.
GRANADA—God’s Country and the Woman. George Brent, complete with bristly mustache and checkered Pendleton, acts rough and tough in an oldie about the northwoods. Alan Hale is here too, looking less rough but a little more ready. If they clash by the lonesome pine, here’s one vote for Hale. Flowing Gold. This job is no relation to Sutter as it mixes up Pat O’Brien, John Garfield, and Frances Farmer. The picture is probably one of those re-releases, but the caliber of acting looks good.
NOVEMBER 23
WASHINGTON HALL—Under the shaking eaves of the auditorium, Charles Biondo leads the Notre Dame Symphonette in an 8:15 concert. Charles Leinhart in Saint-Saens Second Piano Concerto is featured.
NOVEMBER 25
COLFAX—Sorry, Wrong Number. Suspenseful and highly entertaining story about white gloves and murder a la 20th century. Barbara Stanwyck is pretty good as the wife-to-be-killed. Her bushy-browed and muscle drugged husband will be immediately recognized by all sociology majors as Burt Lancaster.
PALACE—Foreign Affair. A lot of good background shots of war-sacked Berlin go to waste in this semi-comical number that has John Lund, Marlene Dietrich, and Jean Arthur. Lund is unbelievably horrible while Miss Arthur’s most noteworthy contribution is her shrieking of the loway Corn Song in an off-limits bistro. Marlene slinks around with her usual grandmother charm. The whole offering should be buried along with the Corn Song. Leather Gloves. A required picture for all the snorting freshmen who haven’t quite grabbed the “defense-out” slogan up in the Rock basketball arena.

For Our Brother Students: a Dollar a Man
One of the best things Notre Dame students have ever done is about to be repeated. With this issue of Scholastic, the campus Foreign Student Relief Campaign kicks off again, and every young scholar in the beaten, broken countries of Europe and Asia is once again looking to us for the friendly help that means so much in an empty world.
Last year Notre Dame topped all the Catholic colleges taking part in the campaign with a contribution of $35,000. That’s fine, but this is another year and another campaign. The national campaign, committee, led by ND’s own Lou Bums as general chairman and Joe Conerty as publicity chairman, has set this year’s national goal at a half million dollars. It won’t be easy to reach that goal. For the national committee it means close cooperation and intensified promotion among the participating colleges; for Notre Dame it means an unflagging effort to at least equal last year’s contribution. Jack Dempsey, the commerce senior from Philadelphia who takes over Bums’ job as campus chairman, knows he and his committee have a big job ahead of them, but they also know that the full backing of the student body can make it easy.
In two weeks — on Dec. 2 — the local committee will start looking for that backing. With the help of the Blue Circle, a
dollar-per-man collection will be made in all the campus residence halls. Scholastic strongly urges that every student on the campus contribute to the collection. Dig down for that extra buck you would have wasted anyway; if you’re not going to be in your room, leave it with your roommate. This is something big. As Catholic college students we’re supposed to know what Christian charity is. The Foreign Student Relief Campaign offers a chance to express that charity in both a material and a spiritual way. The dollar is the material; the unselfish work and devotion of the committee and the student body in supporting the campaign is the spiritual. Our brother students depend on us. Don’t let them down.
COVER: Whan you put a photographer like Jim Ferstel to work, almost anything can come out of the dark room.
Sophomores and other Cotillion goers may not be able to find the Eiffel Tower nor the Notre Dame Cathedral at the
• Palais Royale next Friday, but the theme of the whole affair will be “An Evening in Paris.”
Now I suppose that Ferstel guy will bill us for a quick airplane flight to the French capital. That’s going too far to be authentic.
Some Changes Have Been Made
One impressive thing about Notre Dame is the religious spirit that prevails. When we first came here, we were very much impressed by the crucifixes on the walls of the classrooms. Each class began with a prayer. In a religious school, that is most fitting. But now in the remodeled sections of the Main Building, and in the Social Science Building, one looks up to see a simple sign, “NO SMOKING — By Order of the Prefect of Discipline.”
Something ought to be done about it.

most important accessory in a woman’s attire is a smartly styled watch. The new Elgin Watches are acclaimed in best-dressed circles all over America. Yet, as Miss Russell said, “Brilliant styling is only half their glory.” Beneath their beauty is a remarkable advancement in timekeeping— Elgin’s DuraPower Mainspring.
Here for the first time in any watch is a mainspring that will never rust—and rust is Jie greatest cause of breakage. A mainspring
that holds its original “springiness” for a permanency of timekeeping performance never before possible. Here, in all new Elgins at no extra cost, is a mainspring that eliminates 99% of watch repairs due to steel mainspring failures.
Surely you’ll want the very smartest styling in your watch, and this newest achievement of America’s creative and productive genius. Give someone a gift hint! Only in an Elgin Watch can you have both ... an Elgin with the DuraPower symbol “dp” on the dial.

Second Annual Student Relief Drive Set to Begin
By KEN THOREN
Distinguished Convert Clare Booth Luce
Scheduled for Notre Dame Lecture Dec. 6
Clare Booth Luce, one of the most outstanding women in American public life, will speak at Notre Dame on Dec. 6 under the sponsorship of the Notre Dame Concert and Lecture Series. The world-famed writer, dramatist and lecturer will talk on “The Dramatist and the Mass.”
A convert to the Catholic Church in 1946, Mrs. Luce told the story of her conversion, The Real Reason, in McCall’s Magazine in 1947. It was to be released in book form this year. Last June she received an honorary doctorate of laws from Creighton University as “an American woman . . . combining the noble wifely and material virtues with those of political responsibility.”
Mrs. Luce has attained distinction in a noble variety of pursuits; as journalist, a gifted columnist, feature-writer, war correspondent, editor of women’s magazines; as playwright, winning popular success on Broadway and on the screen; as public orator, speaking courageously and convincingly before a great diversity of audiences; as participant in the political life of America, in national conventions and as the second member of her- family sent to the House of Representatives from Connecticut.
Creighton cited her as an American woman, conspicuously fulfilling the ideal recently sketched by His Holiness Pope Pius XII, and embodied in the Creighton award.
From 1933 to the present she has distinguished herself as an author and playwright. Most notable of her writings were two books: Stuffed Shirts and Europe in the Spring; and three plays: The Women, Kiss the Boys Goodbye and Margin for Error. All of these plays had long runs on Broadway and were later produced as motion pictures.
Mrs. Luce last spoke before a Notre Dame audience in April, 1946, when she
discussed the religious aspects of Communism at a Notre Dame Alumni Association dinner in New York City.
Campus News Time Program To Be Aired Twice Weekly
Something new has been added to WND’s evening broadcasting schedule. As a student service, “Campus News Time” will be coming every Tuesday and Friday evening from 7:00 until 7:15. News of any or all campus, Vetville, and married student organizations and activi-ities will be material for the bi-weekly program. Notes on club meetings, forums, lost and found articles, interhall sports events and general student-interest notices should be dropped to WND by post card, or call Ext. 361.
The program is sponsored by the Department of Journalism under the directorship of Mort Linder, well-known WSBT announcer, who is also a special lecturer in the department.
The recording schedule for WND’s classical music hour, “Collegium Musi-cum,” has been mimeographed and copies are available at the studios.
LAST WEEK'S SCHOLASTIC'
Last week's midget-sized issue of the SCHOLASTIC has occasioned much puzzlement on the campus. Here's the why of it: simultaneous press runs of SCHOLASTIC and the Alumnus, both printed by the Ave Maria Press, caused us to cut our usual 36-page run to 20 crowded pages. At the same time, previous committments forced us to run most of our usual ad copy. Result: what you saw last week. Next week there will be no issue of the SCHOLASTIC because of Thanksgiving. The football issue will be out Dec. 10.
With the meaningful words, “give and pray for destitute foreign students” as their shibboleth, the campus Foreign Student Relief Campaign committee will open its second annual charity drive for contributions on Thursday night, Dec. 2. At that time a canvass of all residence halls will be made, under the auspices
JACK DEMPSEY—campus chairman
of the Blue Circle, with the appeal of one dollar per student as the slogan.
This year’s national goal has been set at a whopping $500,000, which is some $375,000 over last year’s final amount. Notre Dame collected $35,000 of that goal, which was the largest single total of all the nation’s Catholic colleges. The drive is under the sponsorship of the National Federation of Catholic College Students.
Drive States Aims
The purpose of the charity drive is to help foreign students in war-devastated countries. The aims of the campaign are “the physical, intellectual, and spiritual assistance of student victims of war; the strengthening of Catholic student organizations at home and abroad; the vital demonstrations of Christian

Howard Edges Badin For Decoration Title
Clumps of bemused and sometimes bewildered visitors and students could be seen huddled in front of the residence halls last Saturday as they viewed the finished products of this year’s hall decoration contest. Despite the treacherous winds and rain of Friday, most of the hall emblasonments came through in traditional high style. Judgment on the prizeless contest put Howard first, Badin second, and Alumni third.
The unusually imaginative Badin display garnered the largest throngs with its satire on the presidential faux pas that the national polls committed. Neighboring Howard and its eye-catching “Frank Leahy Builds A Dream House,” with its caricatured football players, ran a close second to Badin with the admiring crowds. Alumni snapped back with vindictive players steering over a wake of defeated opponents.
Judges were Mr. John Broderick, Assistant Dean of the Law School; Mr. J. B. Carey, General Manager of the Outdoor Advertising Co.; and Walter Schubert, a visiting student from Georgetown University. After an extensive tour of the campus they began ranking the displays on a 4-3-2-1 basis with most credit going to originality and then to workmanship, color and effectiveness.
The results were close when Carey put Alumni on top. Schubert picked Howard for first place, and Broderick turned in a vascillating tie between Howard, Badin, Sorin and Breen-Phillips for the winning slot. After the votes had been tallied, the final order placed Howard as the winner with Badin, Sorin and Breen-Phillips in the second place groove and Alumni in third. A final boiling down knocked out Sorin and Breen-Phillips, leaving Badin in the runnerup position.
The Paper Napkin and You
Over six million miles of paper napkins rolled off the machines of paper manufacturers last year!
If the almost 40 billion paper napkins produced in the United States were laid side by side, they could encircle the globe at the equator over 250 times. And that’s a lot of paper napkins!
Since 1925, the demand for paper napkins has increased so much that more than seven times as many paper napkins were produced in 1947 as in 1925.
HOWARD HALL HELPS FRANK LEAHY BUILD HIS DREAMHOUSE
City Pockets Jingle to Tune of $10,000,000 Contributed Yearly by University and Students
According to a survey conducted by the Notre Dame Department of Public Information in conjunction with the Scholastic and published in the South Bend Tribune this week, Notre Dame contributes 510,000,000 a year to the collective pockets of the city of South Bend. This includes outlays by students, visitors to football games, operating expenses by the University, and money spent by visitors drawn to the city by the University for various reasons.
The Northwestern game week end alone added 550,000 to this year’s total. University officials figure that at least 8,500 of the 60,000 fans who witnessed last Saturday’s game stayed in South Bend or the vicinity for at least a day. Some 1,500 were estimated to have obtained rooms in hotels and boarding houses within the city itself. These 1,500 spent an average of 525 a day each and combined to make up 537,500 of the total. This does not include the relatively insignificant 512,000 spent by the visiting team during their stay in the city.
Although this is typical of the four football week ends held by Notre Dame during the fall, the amount dwindles to relative obscurity when the yearly total is considered. A breakdown of the cal
culated 510,000,000 showed that at least 51,075.000 annually is spent by students living on campus. Meals in restaurants make up 5276,400 of the amount. Entertainment in the city, including what is spent in movie houses, costs students 5386,683. The Indiana Transit Company’s fare boxes gulp down 572,140 worth of dimes and tokens during the school year. Miscellaneous items account for 5117,470.
These estimates are based on eight months out of the year. There are nine school months all told, but Christmas and Easter vacations, added to the midyear break, rule out at least one month. Nor do the figures include what is spent by students on the campus itself.
Vetville residents contributed 51,300,000 to the city entrepeneurs yearly. This, however, includes almost 12 months, since most of the families take up their residence opposite Farley the year-round. There are also some 5,000 single students living in South Bend and these enrich the city by about 5420,000 per annum.
Hotel managers in South Bend believe that approximately 25 percent of their gross revenue comes directly or indirectly from Notre Dame. This includes football weekend crowds, those relatives and friends of students who come here to

visit the campus, as well as others brought to the vicinity by basketball and other sports, dances and graduations. “Various academic functions attract many visitors, including some of the country’s most prominent business and educational leaders,” according to one hotel manager.
Funds paid out by Notre Dame for its operating expenses will amount to about $8,000,000 this year, it is estimated.

Hall Debates Go On; Only Six Pairs Survive
After- several postponements because of mid-semester tests, quarterfinals in interhall debating are beginning this week, according to Mr. Leonard Sommer, debate coach. Six duos that survived the first round are eligible.
In the eliminations, Dave Matthews and John Gallagher passed their initial test by defeating Ken Snyder and T. V. Williams, for the Cavanaugh Hall title. Austin Hogan and Frank Haendler were awarded a verdict over Bill Rich and Ken Hoelscher in Farley.
Zahm had two tilts, with Bob Wolf and Howard Phillips taking a decision over Bill Dempsey and Charles Fahy; and Ed Waters and Malham Wakin won from Dave Wilmot and Paul Walls.
A St. Edward’s team composed of Harold Cahalan and Maurice Carrol, and an off-campus pair, Marvin Breskin and Lee Sheridan drew byes.
Since all preliminary winners were negative teams, a reshuffling of team positions was necessary. In the quarterfinal schedule Ed Waters and Malham Wakin, speaking affirmatively, tangle with Austin Hogan and Frank Haendler, negative. Dave Matthews and John Gallagher, affirmative, debate Bob Wolf and Howard Phillips, negative. Rounding out the schedule is a contest between Harold Cahalan and Maurice Carrol, negative, and Marvin Breskin and Lee Sheridan, affirmative.
These debates, held in Room 327, Main Building, are judged by Frank Finn, tourney Chaii-man, and the other varsity debaters. Mr. Sommer will be present to personally evaluate the speakers.
The date for the semi-finals and finals, to be held in Washington Hall, hasn’t been decided. Since three teams will emerge from the current round, one will draw a bye while the other two meet in semifinals. Finals between the victorious team and the one gaining the bye, will then be held. Judges will be supplied by the Speech Department.
Embryonic Lawyers To Toss Annual Ball
The Notre Dame Law Club will present its annual formal ball tomorrow evening in the ballroom of the Indiana Club from nine until one o’clock under the co-chairmanship of Ed Caparo and Bill Roemer, Jr., with music by Herbie Germann and his orchestra.
Decorations have been designed to establish faithfully the customary legal atmosphere, the theme being a “Swim in the Legal Sea.” Bids have been issued by “Lord Caparoemer” in Old English style to request the presence of all student lawyers; and special judges and bailiffs will be on hand to insure compliance with court orders to attend.
The guests of the co-chairmen, Miss Florence Mickley and Mrs. William Roemer, Jr., both of South Bend, will be the queens of the ball. The guest of honor is Miss Marie Lawrence, librarian of the College of Law. Dean and Mrs. Clarence E. Manion and Dean Emeritus and Mrs. Thomas F. Konop will be among the other honored guests, which include the members of the law faculty and their guests.
Committee chairmen are: music, Ed Coleman; and Jerry Frazel, co-chairmen; favors, Tony Girolami, and Elmer Steffen, co-chairmen; tickets, Phil Russo, and Gene Mathews, co-chairmen; patrons, James Miller and Marvin Breskin, cochairmen; decorations, Gerald O’Brien and Vincent Scully, co-chairmen; refreshments, John Bodie and James Oberfell, co-chairmen; and publicity, Francis Casurella and John Noonan, co-chairmen.

Fate Of China Hangs On Communist War Manchurian Student Tells South Bend Group
Ferstel in the Lion’s Den
The fate of China and democracy in the Orient hangs on the bitter fight being waged between Nationalist and Communist troops in north central China, Paul Chang, of Antung, Manchuria, told the Serra Club of South Bend last week.
Chang, a graduate student in political science at Notre Dame, carried on espionage work for the American Strategic Service Unit in Shanghai during the war. He was twice captured and subjected to weeks of torture by the Japanese.
“The Chinese Communist Army, effectively aided by Soviet Russia and using the precarious U. S.-China relations, has expanded to a point where it is almost impossible to stop,” Chang said. “At this very moment more than a million soldiers are being thrown into a most savage life and death struggle about 170 miles north of Nanking, capital of the Chinese national government. This war is not purely a civil war among the people, but actually a war planned and operated by the Politburo against democracy.”
The Chinese student outlined Russia’s two-hundred year “grand design to colonize China” and the Soviet’s plans to carry out the design by aiding Communist insurrection in a China laid prostrate by years of conflict with Japan.
“Dangerous events have unrolled in Clrna which may well be of even greater importance for the future of peace, he declared. “China is vital in controlling the Pacific. This vast country is the most essential area for the conquest of all Asia as well as those nations far out beyond the horizon of the Pacific.
“The Chinese Nationalist Army has been left without adequate support from any country except the United States, but this American support has never been sufficient. The present situation is most critical. Only with active help from this country can the tide be turned in favor of those who fight for the liberty of mankind.”
Chang came to Notre Dame in June, 1947, to prepare himself for a possible foreign service career. All during the Sino-Japanese War he worked in the Chinese underground securing information to use against the Japanese. After America entered the war, the SSU (a division of the Office of Strategic Services) enlisted his aid. Twice the invaders seized and tortured him, but both times Chang escaped. A Catholic convert, the 30-year old student was received into the Church by the Maryknoll Fathers in 1935.	.
Chang told the SCHOLASTIC this week that the future of China depends almost
entirely on American aid. “Soviet help to the Communists is such that there must be a strong counter-aid from the United States,” he said. “It must come soon; the fighting in central China will be decisive.”
Sheehan Describes Industrial Unrest Before Round Table
The Economic Round Table was ad. dressed recently by John H. Sheehan, head of the Department of Economics. Mr. Sheehan discussed the problem of human relations in industry. After developing the evolution of the American economy from its agricultural origin to its industrialization, he described the effects this process has had on social life. He told how the various economic groups have grown apart from one another in their interests and have brought about much unrest.
Mr. Sheehan then sketched possible remedies by which the discontented could have greater opportunity and more satisfaction in our economic life. He stressed the importance of good personnel departments in large corporations. He also stressed the importance of giving the laborer greater incentive through various profit sharing plans. Participation in the ownership of the means of production would be beneficial to the economy and stimulate interest in the individual worker.	*

Architectural students at Notre Dame are eligible to compete for prizes totaling $250 in a national design contest announced by the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design, in cooperation with the Tile Council of America.
The contest calls for the designing of an elementary school and kindergarten in which special attention is given to the use of clay tile. First prize is $100, second $75, third $50 and fourth $25. The competition closes Dec. 20 and will be judged between Jan. 4 and 8.
' Students from universities and colleges in the United States, Canada and Cuba have been invited to submit entries in the current contest. A large number of other competitions is also being sponsored by the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design during the 1948-49 school year.
NEARSIGHTED LEO AND CRINGING FRIEND
Realizing that a good half of our readers would not be fooled by last week's cover “The Wildcat Cometh"—for the wildcat was indeed a lion — we thought we'd come clean and let you know what some of the lads go through to get our pictures.
It all began when the devil incarnate, who calls himself the Editor, said in his usual snarl, “Gimme a wildcat." This imperious request resulted in frantic phone calls to nearby zoos, fox farms, taxidermists, to no avail — there ain't a wildcat within miles. So we did the next best thing.
Down to the local roar house did we trip and found there a very large, but very much asleep lion. He was awakened by the handy trick of heaving a convenient brick in his direction. This galvanized “Baby" into action, and he came prepared to correct the cause of the disturbance of the first lap of his winter siesta, by eating it. “It" of course was one Jim Ferstel. Before Baby could complete his task Fearless Ferstel snapped his picture which eventually wound up on the cover. Baby snapped at the same time and you can see the dismembering results above. Fortunately Baby was a little myoptic and missed the camera which is rather valuable.

Elliott Lawrence, 'Evening in Paris' Featured in Fridays Sophomore Cotillion
By VIC DORR
With sweet music, beautiful girls, and all but the tinkling of champagne glasses, a subtle air of French night life will prevail in the Palais Royale ball room next Friday night as the Sophomore Cotillion unfolds its “Evening in Paris,” featuring Elliott Lawrence and his orchestra.
Having been nursed through six weeks of preparation and a maze of sturdy obstacles, next Friday’s Cotillion blooms as a tribute to the ambitious planning and effort of Co-chairman Tom Logan and his colleagues. As a resuit of their work, this 1948 Sophomore formal promises to be one of the most memorable class dances offered in recent years. Combined with the Washington game and the Victory Dance Saturday night, the coming Cotillion weekend shapes up as a full round of entertainment for all takers.
Queens for the evening of Parisian gaiety will be Eileen Bernier and Joan Chamberlin, the dates of Co-chairmen Tom Logan and Ray Miller. Miss Chamberlin, a 20-year-old blue-eyed blonde, is a sophomore at Indiana University. Like her escort, Tom Logan, she is from Ft. Wayne, Ind. She majors in psychology and is a member of the national Alpha Chi Omega sorority. Eileen Bernier, the other queen, a 19-year-old bright-eyed brunette, is a sophomore at St. Mary’s College. Formerly of St. Mary’s of-the-
EILEEN BERNIER St. Mary's Sophomore from Cleveland
JOAN CHAMBERLIN
I. U. Sophomore from Fort Wayne
Woods, Terre Haute, Ind., she tansferred here this fall. Like Ray Miller, her fiance, Cleveland is her home town.
But of course the backbone of next Friday’s revelry will be the suave Mr. Lawrence and his orchestra. Known throughout the land as a great favorite at collegiate dances, Lawrence utilizes a style that has steadily increased in popularity since he organized slightly more than two years ago. For the most part, his 17-piece group depends strongly on his brass section. Though his trumpets and trombones are immediately noted, they are neither excessively ioud nor raucous, but blend smoothly with the other instruments to achieve Lawrence’s distinctive style. Like Tex Beneke’s Glenn Miller orchestra, this is one of the few popular bands to employ a French horn to such success today.
Of particular interest is Lawrence’s unusual woodwind sextet. Composed of an oboe, clarinet, bassoon, piano, base clarinet, and drums, it has gained considerable fame for pleasant renditions of novelty and popular numbers. Probably one of the main attractions with the Lawrence orchestra, however, is its featured vocalist, Rosalind Patton. A comely, sultry-voiced brunette, she gives added spark to the band’s popular ballads. Recording with Lawrence for Columbia Records, she has helped to make some of his best numbers famous. Among these are “Shawney O’Shay,” “Who Do
’Milky Way’ Ticket Distribution Monday
Distribution of tickets for the “Milky-Way,” opening November 28 in Washington Hall, will begin Nov. 22 and continue through the 26th, excluding Thanksgiving Day. The tickets may be secured in the basement of the Cafeteria between one and four in the afternoon. The play will run through Thursday, Dec. 2.
Students and faculty members are eligible for one ticket a piece, married students two. All students must show their I.D. cards to receive a ticket. Additional tickets will be sold for a dollar, tax included.
The demand for tickets is expected to be great since there are only 3,000 available, while over 5,000 students or faculty members are eligible for them. Any further news will be aired on the Dining Hall P.A. system.
Juniors Barn Dance In Navy Drill Hall
Scuttling former plans, the junior Class Barn Dance committee decided this week to hold the Saturday night frolic in the Navy Drill Hall. The change was deemed advisable when the barn at St. Joseph’s Farm proved to be inconvenient. The dance will be held from 8:30 to 11:30 tomorrow evening.
Both square and round dances will be played and ‘called.’ For the ritzy sliders whose experience has been limited to the ballroom, Bill Pritchett and his “Happy Ranch Boys” will be on hand to instruct everyone in the art of ‘promenade’ and ‘two-by-two.’ Cider and doughnuts will be served and buses will run to and from St. Mary’s.
Committee members for the affair are Bob Schlosser, Charlie Mouch, Bob Rohl-ing and John W*halen.
You Love I Hope?” and “At The ITying W.”
Ticket sales for the gala evening at the Palais have almost reached their limit, but a few* remaining bids may be obtained. Along with Bob Klingenbeiger and George Larson, bid chairmen, other committeemen are: Dick McDonald and Bob Huff, decorations; Ken Thoren, Bob Moriarty, Bob Lee and Graig Niephus, publicity; Jack Coryn and Paul Bush, football tickets; Walt McGovern, hotel reservations; and Dave Schoen, favors.
According to Cotillion Co-chairman Tom Logan, efforts are being made to obtain a network opening for a brief radio broadcast of the dance Friday night.

Mimirlring serial heroes of old, fearless student shows softness of South Shore roadbed by lying across two low spots
The South Shore . . .
by BILL LYMAN
For years the Toonerville trolley has zig-zagged across funny pages tickling people’s imaginations. It’s a rather rickety affair, and it gives the folks a pretty rocky ride—but to many, it has color and romance.
Now, nobody’s going to try to tell you that South Shore trains, which have been toting Notre Dame people to and from Chicago for nearly 25 years, have color and romance. If you’ve ever taken the South Shore Line, you’d never admit this, anyway. You might agree, with a typical ND jest, that South Shore trains are rather rickety like the Toonerville trolley, and that they give the folks a pretty rocky ride. But colorful and romantic—certainly not.
Let it be said, then, that a ride on the South Shore Line is a novelty—an unforgettable experience. And, if you really want to carry the thing out, it might be added that Notre Dame people have never been forced to the funny pages to have their imaginations “tickled.”
But the point is that every Saturday afternoon of the school year a contingent of some hundred or so Notre Dame men crowd their way aboard South Shore trains and head for Chicago. And every Sunday night the same horde, a little wearier and not quite so clearheaded, squeeze back into the same cars
C.. S.S., & S.B.R.R.— !9Trains ADay From State Street To the St. Joe
and head back to Notre Dame to rest up for the next week end.
The South Shore Line seems to be like the dining hall and taxes: It’s the best solution to a problem—but darned if anybody can find anything good about a two-hour drag to Chicago. If there’s a consolation at all, say the more philosophic, it’s the many happy moments one gets describing the conditions that prevail.
The South Shore Line, or more formally the Chicago South Shore and South Bend Railroad, started out in
Photos by Bruce Harlan
South Bend in 1908, and a few years later worked its way through to Chicago. Back in those days it ran on high-powered AC current, had all wooden cars and was single track all the way.
So Notre Dame people didn’t begin to use the South Shore much until 1925 and the beginning of its golden era. In

1925 Samuel Insull took control. He put in DC current, all steel cars, double tracks and a new time schedule (one hour and fifty minutes from Chicago to South Bend). And he saw to it that the trains carried diners and parlor cars and had all the modern conveniences.
At the convention of the Electric Railway industry in 1929, the South Shore Line was awarded the Charles A. Coffin Prize for its “distinguished contribution to the development of electric transportation.” And, in the same year at the convention of the American Electric Railway Association it received The Electric Traction Speed ' Trophy for “maintaining the highest average speed between terminals.”
When the crash came later in 1929 and Insull’s empire tumbled, the golden era of the South Shore Line was over. The lean years up to World War II prevented improvement, and nothing could be done during the war with the shortage of materials. Only recently has the stock company that now owns the South Shore been able to improve the road-bed and acquire new air-conditioned cars.
“I think our frequent and dependable service is the big reason why Notre

. . . An Unforgettable Experience
Dame people have stuck by the South Shore in the face of bus, plane and other railroad competition,” says Mr. C. W. Veach, Passenger Agent. “You see, it’s a comfortable feeling to know that a train leaves every hour, and, if you miss one, it won’t be long till the next.”
Mr. Veach adds that the South Shore has always been ready to give special
TROLLEY OF TOMORROW? Make mine Pepsi
service to Notre Dame men. For instance, Notre Dame men always get seats, because extra cars are provided for them.
And there is something of a flavor— particularly about that last train that pulls out of Chicago’s Randolph street station at 9:00 Sunday nights. There’s the last minute rush and the suspense that hangs on catching the train; then two hours, and twenty minutes of pure, cold monotony; and finally another last minute rush and the suspense that hangs on catching a cab to get back to school on time to avoid a welfare card on Monday morning.
There is something rare in the sight of four huge football players balancing a little suit case on their knees trying to play bridge on it, and the cards slipping to the floor, and four or five kibitzers draping themselves over the seats. Or of the parade of grown men marching to and from the water cooler. Or of the fellow trying to study for a Monday morning chemistry exam—his text swaying back and forth, and the lights dimming on and off, and a violent argument raging across the aisle. Or even of the open-mouth dozers who fight a losing battle for a comfortable position all the way to South Bend.
No, you can’t say the South Shore Line has the color and romance of the Toonerville trolley. But you must admit it has just enough flavor to make it stick in your memory till the end of time— for it really is an unforgettable experience.

Circle Adorns Dance By Council Command
Reorganization of committees and passage of a motion that the Blue Circle be directed to decorate the Drill Hall for the Notre Dame - Washington Victory Dance highlighted the Student Council meeting held Monday night. Most of the other’ suggestions brought before the Council were referred to the various committees.
Handed over to the athletic committee was a proposal that Notre Dame join the Midwestern Intercollegiate Bowling League. The group also was requested to investigate a suggestion that the Rockne Memorial be opened during the dinner hour, and on Saturday and Sunday evenings.
Off-campus students Dave Matthews and Dan Brennan asked that the Council examine the parking situation. President Cassidy accordingly appointed those two men plus Bill Anhut as a committee on the subject.
Junior class President Russ Skall requested information on the handling of class finances. Father Kehoe replied that the classes should be organized as non-profit clubs. He added that money may be borrowed from the University by the classes to cover expenses that will be made up later. The office of Students’ Accounts will handle these loans.
Members of the education committee
were then asked to investigate the possibility of opening the Cavanaugh Reading Room from 9:00 a.m. to 2:15 p.m., every day for off-campus students who need a place to study. The committee will later act on a suggestion that the interhall football champions be given a banquet.
Liturgy Club to Mark 45th Birthday of 'Motu Proprio'
The forty-fifth anniversary of the “Motu Proprio,” considered by Pope Pius X as “a juridicial code of sacred music,” will be observed by the Liturgy Club of Notre Dame at a High Mass and Communion Breakfast Sunday.
The Liturgy Club will sing the entire Mass, marking the commemoration in Gregorian Chant. Moderator of the club is the Rev. William J. Doheny, C.S.C., professor of legal ethics at Notre Dame. The Rev. William J. McAuliffe, C.S.C., professor of liturgical chant at Moreau Seminary, is director of the Liturgy Club Choir.
The “Motu Proprio” on Sacred Music was published by Pope Pius X on Nov. 22, 1903, as one of the first acts of his pontificate whose motto was “to restore all things in Christ.” This important document was commemorated on its twenty-fifth anniversary by an Apostolic Constitution of Pope Pius XI, and it was again brought to public attention by the recent encyclical “Mediator Dei” of Pope Pius XII.	.
Trustees Talk Science Bldg., More Research
At a meeting of the Associate Board of Lay Trustees at Notre Dame last week, Mr. Ernest M. Morris, of South Bend, announced that a new scientific research program will be started soon by the University.
Mr. Morris, chairman of the board and a Notre Dame alumnus, said that new laboratories are planned to house the University’s greatly enlarged research program, with expanded facilities for study and experiment in nuclear physics, electronics and radio substances. The laboratories will be located in the new, $1,750,000 Science Building, slated for construction next year. The initial $350,000 has been set aside by the University, with the remaining $1,400,000 to be raised by the Notre Dame Foundation.
According to Mr. Morris, present facilities for scientific research are totally inadequate. The new Science Building will house the Departments of Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics, but the present science and chemistry buildings will be used to their fullest capacities even after completion of the new building.
Special labs for research in atomic energy, electronics, nuclear and polymer physics will be features of the new building. Undergraduate labs and classrooms, a science library and an auditorium are also included in the plans.
Attending the semi-annual meeting’ here were nineteen prominent business executives, bankers and industrialists who are board members; the Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., president of Notre Dame, and several University officials.
Editor Upholds Statistics In Third O'Hara Seminar
“Statistical Usages in Business” was the subject of the third in a series of nine Bishop O’Hara Seminar Lectures held early this week.
Stanley Hunt, editor of the prominent textile trade magazine, Organon, delivered the lectures. His first lecture outlined the general theory of the subject, while the second attacked the practical problems involved.
The Bishop O’Hara Seminar Lectures, honoring the Most Rev. John F. O’Hara, C.S.C., former president of Notre Dame and now Bishop of Buffalo, N. Y., are being held to correlate theoretical classroom instruction in industrial management with practical experiences in the field. The lectures are attended by seniors in the College of Commerce.

N .D. Orchestra Slates Diversified Program
A variation of musical pieces will be offered next Tuesday at 8:15 p.m., in Washington Hall by the Not’’e Dame Orchestra, under the direction of Mr. Charles Biondo.
In this, their first concert of the year, they will begin with the Euryanthe Overture by Carl von Weber (1786-1826). Von Weber is credited with establishing the German romantic opera tradition and his style is found to be much the same as that of Wagner. He is noted especially for his last three operas: Der Frcisehutz (1821), Euryanthe (1823), and Oberon (1826). Not only is the Overture to Euryanthe a curtain-raiser, but by itself it is also recognized as a fine tone poem. The plots for von Weber’s operas were derived from mediaeval romances.
The program will continue with the Symphony No. 8 in B minor by Shubert (1797-1828), better- known as the Unfinished Symphony. Shubert is thought to have completed only two movements of this symphony.
Next will be heard the first movement from the Piano Concerto No. 2 in G-Minor by Camille Saint-Saens (1883-1921). He is known for following the Ger-man Weber-Wagnerian romantic tradition in France, but he mastered every other form of musical expression also. His best known opera is Samson and De'.ila. The Piano Concerto No. 2 was written on scratch paper in 17 days. It was first performed in 1868 and in 1906 the composer presented it with the Chicago Symphony. Charles Leinhart will be featured at the piano in this number Tuesday night.
The program will close with the “Knightsbridge March” taken from the London Suite for Orchestra by Eric Coates. This is a jolly, fast-moving number featuring the brass section. Coates graduated from the Royal College of Music and had long experience as string quartet and orchestra player.

History Dept. Discussion To Explore Catholic Spain
Catholic Spain will be discussed at the second History Department discussion next Monday night at 7:45 p.m., in Room 101 of the Law Building. The complete subject is “Historical Misconceptions about Catholic Spain with Emphasis on the Black Legend.”
The discussion will be opened by Professor Thomas E. Downey, who will explore the situation concerning Spain from Philip II to Voltaire. Professor James A. Llorens will follow chronologically with Spain from Voltaire to the present day. Professor Walter Langford, head of the Department of Modern Languages, will be chairman of the discussion.
The History Department anticipates many matters for discussion since the old “black legend” concerning the cruelty of the Spanish buccaneers . and the modern charges against Franco are at the heart of these historical misconceptions.

and ten minutes. The train reached the La Salle street station at 9:30 p.m.
Officials of the New York Central said the delay in getting the AP Special to the power-house siding was due to a telephone call they received from a university official who said the managing editors were to be entertained after the game. So the AP train was pulled out on the single track and had to wait for 14 other specials to leave before it could get back in.
The managing editors had arrived at the siding in plenty of time to catch the train as originally scheduled, since the entertainment was just coffee and sandwiches after the game.
As the managing editors and their wives stood around watching the people board Ed Gould’s Football Special, a porter stuck his head out of the train door and said, “No use hanging around folks. Mr. Dewey isn’t going to talk tonight.”

A. P. Editors Watch 2 Powerhouses Here
Some 300 managing editors of newspapers from every part of the nation and their wives came to Notre Dame last Saturday. And they saw two Notre Dame powerhouses iri action.
The managing editors came on a special train from Chicago, where they had been attending an Associated Press convention. They were guests of the university at the Northwestern game and at a luncheon before the game in the Studebaker corporation auditorium.
After watching one Irish power-house roll over Northwestern in the Stadium, they walked to the railroad siding behind the Biology Euilding to catch their train back to Chicago. Here they became well acquainted with a second powerhouse.
They found that their Associated Press Special had been moved from the siding for Ed Gould’s Football Special. And rather than stand out in the cold to wait for their train which was supposed to pull in next, they headed for the closest shelter—the Notre Dame powerhouse.
For almost three hours, the nation’s top newspapermen stood watching the power-house clock on the wall, while their wives took seats on radiators, on oddlooking pieces of machinery, on stairs and even on the floor.
Finally, the AP Special arrived at about 7:30 p.m. The men of the press and their wives had seen a little too much of one N.D. power-house and almost not enough of another. But once the New York Central people got the AP Special going, they made something of a record from South Bend to Chicago—one hour

Campus Keglers Begin Long Season Sunday; Plan to Give All Bowlers "Whale of a Time."
Sunday afternoon, 250 students will plod into the heavily-hammered Bowl-Mor alleys. At 1:30 p.m., Easy Ernie Huffman, the two-term president of the Kampus Keglers, will pound a battered 14-pound bowling ball down the Number One alley. Whether it’s a split or a strike, the Kampus Keglers will have officially opened their second season.
This season, although no one is sure of what will happen, looks like the best from a student participation angle. “If we have good luck,” says President Huffman, “we expect to have 36 teams bowling every Sunday afternoon.” When Ernie sounded the call for campus teams to participate, everybody from the Russian club to the La Razas obliged with a long team roster. “We had to draw a
line at 36 teams,” cracked Ernie, “or we’d have had to bowl down Michigan avenue.”
The real advantage of the league is that it gives the duffer as well as the old-time pin duster an even break. Jim Jennewein, the league’s treasurer who earned a $100 check in the St. Joe A. C. Sweepstakes in May, has worked out a handicap system which evens things up like the house wheel in a slot machine. “I bowl about 195,” said Jim, “but, on an off-day, I really have to jiggle those pins to beat some guy with an anemic 135 average. He gets me on that big handicap.”
This closeness of competition has planted much spirit in the league. Last

From behind the tennis courts and in front of the Chemistry building rose the wails of rival coaches and the shouts of their charges; on blackboards in deserted classrooms the last minute defensive strategems were being diagrammed. Dillon and Cavanaugh were preparing for battle.
Next Sunday is the day and the stadium the place for the annual interhall football championship and the game looks as close as a barber’s shave. Neither team has been defeated, tied or even scored upon and both have blasted their opponents by as high as 35 points.
The Cavanaugh team has been playing together for three years. In 1946 most of them worked for Breen-Phillips and last year they moved across the waj- to Zahm where they gave Cavanaugh a bitter argument before bowing. Then they landed in Cavanaugh this year after most of last year’s champs had been scattered all over the campus. This time they intend to win.
Among the valuables they brought with them from Zahm was Coach Paul Bolous, one of the headiest coaches on campus. Bolous volunteered co coach again this year even though he is now married and living in town. Bolous’ chief joy is All-Campus quarterback Bob Barrett, who has been having another great year as the doctor of Cavanaugh’s T-formation. Barrett calls signals, passes beautifully and fakes like Frank Tri-pueka.
He has a terrific back to work with in Paul Schlafly who will play Sunday. Schlafly was declared ineligible for the regular season, but not before he had earned a reputation as one of the hardest driving backs in interhall competition. When Schlafly gets tired, Cavanaugh has backs like Shanahan, Courtney, Culligan and Gentilucci, all of whom know what to do with the ball.
Cavanaugh’s line is feather-light compared to Dillon’s but is fast and aggressive as they proved against the heavyweight Walsh squad. Frank Biggert is a big, agile tackle and a rough man to push around and Jim Driscoll is a carryover of that long lost football institution, the watch-charm guard. He’s light but

O'Dell's Victory-Starved Washington Squad Offers Irish Soph's Experience Next Week
By HARRY MONAHAN
Howie Odell’s emaciated Washington Huskies will be a long way from their Pacific Coast hunting grounds when they arrive in South Bend next Saturday for the first meeting of the Irish and the boys from fog-shrouded Seattle. And unless they can topple Idaho tomorrow it will be a victory-starved canine who will be lead to the slaughter on Nov. 20. The Notre Dame sophomores are expected to clock a lot of game time as Coach Frank Leahy gives them much needed experience.
Odell’s first year in the Husky lair has been far from encouraging. His troubles have included everything from a first string quarterback with a pro contract to a serious illness which kept him hospitalized during the Huskie’s opening games. In the mediocre coast conference play his eleven has won only one game, and that was an “upset” over Bert La LaBrucherie’s Westwood weaklings at UCLA. The Huskies did tie the Oregon State Beavers in their second game of the season. Prior to that Minnesota had shut them out 20-0 and following the UCLA surprise, Washington State, California, Stanford, Oregon and Southern California have fattened their win columns at the expense of the Huskies.
QB Turns Pro
Washington’s woes started when Dick Ottele revealed that he had signed a secret pro contract and would not be available to do the signal calling for

Odell. The backfield juggling which has taken place since then would defy the law against perpetual motion.
Significantly one back wasn’t affected by the juggling. Sophomore Boland Kirkby stayed at his fullback job. Kirkby has been the leading ground gainei' for the Huskies and tosses an occasional pass just to mix up the Washington attack.

When the dust settled Marshall Dallas and Brooks Biddle had the halfback positions in hand. Biddle is playing his fifth year of college ball, having played two years at UCLA and two at Washington.
Toothy Center
Another five-year man will be holding down the Husky pivot slot in the person of all-conference center Bill McGovern. While McGovern was making up his mind whether his dental school schedule would permit him to play, Mike Michael found himself converted from fullback to center and is now the number two man.
Lack of depth in the line is going to be costly when Washington tries to beat back the notorious Irish ground game. John Prechek is a 216-pound left tackle who can hold his own, but does not have any experienced relief. .
At guard Washington will have two all-conference linemen in Bob Levenhagen and Alf Hemstad. Ernie Stein is fighting for all-conference honors at the right end position, while on the other
fiank Chuck Olson and Al Kean give Odell the chance to flip a coin to pick his starter.
Wildcat Gets Nasty
The Irish rested this week after their tight battle against a vicious Northwestern Wildcat. Coach Voigts’ eleven apparently had not been reading the Notre Dame press notices and nearly sidetracked the Irish victory express. Confirming the warning in last week’s Scholastic, Art Murakowski was the rampaging Wildcat who kept the Irish jittery all afternoon.
Notre Dame’s ground attack never looked better as it blasted holes in the Wildcat forward wall. Tripucka seemed to pick Northwestern Capt. Alex Sarkisian’s center slot for the Notre Dame ground work and to very good advantage. The 91-yard first quarter drive whch gave Notre Dame its first tally was a ground operation all the way.
The second Notre Dame drive was also confined to the ground. Bill Gay and Jack Landry combined to crack the Northwestern forwards. The Northwestern aerial defense was tight, but they seemed unable to stop the quickopeners through the center.
Panelli Out	'
John Panelli was hospitalized with a severe concussion and his loss was very keenly felt during the second half. Mike Swistowicz may have to ride the bench for another game if his elbow doesn’t respond to treatment. It is doubtful whether Coach Leahy will risk any injured starters against Washington in order to have the team in the best condition for the western trip the following week.

National Meet Next For Irish Harriers
By JIM HOWARD
Notre Dame’s rugged runners who last Saturday blazed their way to a Central Collegiate cross country championship over the Irish four-mile course will attempt to win the coveted National harrier title next Monday at Lansing, Mich.
The National contest is held annually over the difficult Michigan State course, and features a field of several hundred runners. The battle for the crown will be more difficult this year than in the past because there are an unusually large number of schools which appear to be evenly matched on the basis of their records to date. Generally conceded by most experts to be the two top contenders are the host Spartan team and the powerful Wisconsin squad.
Into the next group of challengers fall the eastern distance groups of Penn State and Army. The Nittany Lions are entering the battle with an extremely impressive array of triumphs. The midWestern aggregation of Indians and Notre Dame also qualify for placement in this category. The Irish qualify mainly on the strength of their impressive 20-point scoring in winning the Central championships, and the fact that Jim Murphy, the pint-sized dynamo from East Providence, R. I., ran the best race of his career as he set the new course record of 20:08. The Hoosiers are top contenders because of their strong running in winning the Indiana State title, and scoring high in the Big Nine Championships held in Chicago last Friday.
In the quest for the individual title, Wisconsin’s Don Gehrman is given top priority, but the Nationals have always been famous for their surprising upsets. If Murphy, the Irish distance ace, can equal his performance of last Saturday, he may show well in the group of first finishers.
Last week the Notre Dame team ran “up to their capabilities” in the words of Coach Handy as they scored five men in the first seven positions to win the C. C.-C. title with a low total of 20 points. The Irish displayed their strength in such force that the other two team members finished in eighth and ninth positions. Marquette was second with 50 points and Bowling Green University of Ohio took third with 73.
Murphy’s time washed away the week-old mark of 20:29.5 set by Indiana’s Dave Dewitte in the State meet. (A picture of Murphy leading the pack appears on page 25.)
The Cadet Rifle
It would not have been hard to pass the slender, affable, good looking Air Corps lieutenant and never notice him in the jostling, aimless crowd which cluttered the Irish acres last week end. If you did, then you missed the opportunity to get a good look at the brains behind the West Point juggernaut elevens of ’44, ’45 and ’46.
Lt. Arnold Tucker, as could be expected, was a very interested spectator at the Northwestern game. He had just returned to duty after spending his annual leave helping the former Army backfield coach, Andy Gustafson, put some polish on his Miami University squad. Along with Harry Wismer, Tucker tried to stir up enlistments among ABC listeners during the halftime recess.
In commenting on the Army-Notre Dame series he said he had heard nothing about a resumption of relations. He felt that an occasional “lapse” is needed to prevent outstanding games from becoming more than just athletic contests. These big games are too much of a lure for gamblers and scalpers.
As one quarterback to another, Arnold singled out John “Knitting for Betty” Lujack as the outstanding Irish player to oppose Army in those three years. The Cadet squad was anxious to get the Rose Bowl bid at the end of the ’46 season and he believed the Academy would have approved the game. Bert LaBrucherie should be very happy that the Pacific Coast Conference sought shelter in the Big Nine storm cellar rather than face the Cadet hurricane, even if the Illini did murder his hapless Bruins.
Musings at Halftime
It is reported that Doc Handy was seen turning handsprings in the corridors of Breen-Phillips Hall after the freshman cross-country meet last week. He kept muttering, “Wait until next year.” At the same time some of the varsity cross-country team got quite a shock out of the times posted and are worried about the competition they will have to face next year. . . . Saturday
SPLINTERS from the Press Box By Harry Monahan
Evening Post is still crusading. The current drivel is based on the ivy-covered myth that football players do not attend class. When the Post editors pull their heads out of the sand, what a cruel shock reality will be to them. . . . Spike Jones came up with a good theme song for Notre Dame’s football opponents: Don’t Talk About Me When Pm Gone. . . .
More Basketball
We hope that the cage agreements with Southern Methodist and St. Mary’s are on the same home-and-home basis as with Kentucky. If the Mustangs cannot bring their grid squad here next year the Irish could still get a look at Walker and Rote in action. The appearance of a Pacific coast team in the Barn would spice up the local cage menu.
Prediction of the Week
We aren’t just coming up from the floor to make another prediction, we are trying to dig our way out of the cellar after last week’s guess. The Washington Husky is a weak canine this year and the Irish terriers' are beginning to smell the red meat of another undefeated season. Notre Dame 42, Washington 0.

Cavanaugh Edges Walsh in Final Quarter
It took the last three minutes of the last quarter to settle the Western division championship game between Cavanaugh and Walsh. Cavanaugh came out on top of a 13 to 0 score in a game which featured rugged line play and good passing.
Nip and tuck was the pattern until the waning minutes of the fourth quarter when Cavanaugh recovered its own punt at midfield and taking advantage of this break rolled to a touchdown.
Barrett passed 20 yards to Bill Egers, putting the ball on the Walsh 32. A penalty against Walsh moved it to the 27. Barrett passed to Kreuz for nine yards. Kreuz on an end around outran the Walsh secondary to the goal. A bad pass from center made Cavanaugh’s extra point attempt no good.
With less than a minute and a half left to play Walsh took to the air in desperation. Bob Culligan, Cavanaugh’s halfback, intercepted and ran 22 yards for the score. The point after touchdown was good.—Rudy Unger
Dillon Cops Western Title
The combination of a devastating single wing attack and a staunch forward wall produced a thorough 35-0 slaughter for Dillon Hall over the hapless Morrissey men last week. The victory gives Dillon the right to represent the West Campus in the Championship game in the stadium on Sunday, November 21. The attack of the upperclassmen was one of puzzling spinners, double reverses, and razzle dazzle play.
In the opening seconds of the fray, little Dom Colletti shook himself loose after a spinner and sped 48 yards unmolested for the score. Jack McGroder split the uprights with the first of his five conversions. Again in the fourth quarter it was Colletti who circled the Morrissey flank for five yards and the final touchdown.
Zeke Lane was another big gun in the Dillon offensive. In the initial plays of the second and third quarters the speed
ster scored on long runs. The first was one of 62 yards down the sidestripe while his final score covered half the distance of the field right through the middle.
Coach McMahon closed this third quarter with a run which matched that of his other seatback, Lane. It was a fitting tribute to the man who has built up such a formidable squad, to be escorted 48 yards to paydirt with vicious blocks being thrown on all sides of him.
Continually bottled up by the booming kick-offs and punts of Jack McGroder, the Morrissey men could not establish a foothold in enemy territory. Quarterback Joe Harmon put on a beautiful exhibition of aerial wizardry but fumbles and penalties nullified his attempts. It was only his passes and a valiant goal-line stand which kept the hopes of Morrissey alive.
—Jack Economon
Presley Sparks Howard Win Over Lyons
Howard Hall trounced Lyons 19-0 in the final game of the season for both teams. Jim Presley ran wild for the victors, scoring 13 points and sparking all three touchdown drives.
For- the whole first quarter, and most of the second, the referees threatened to run away with the ball game; the men in red outgained both of the teams. Shortly before the end of the half, however, Presley, climaxing a steady downfield drive, cracked over from the three.
The second half opened with one of the most sensational plays of the interhall season, as Presley took the kick-off on his own thirty, butted and squirmed his way into the clear. When about to be overtaken on the Lyons twenty, he lateraled to Dave Herbert who carried the ball the rest of the way. Presley converted. Presley scored the final marker late in the last period.
Lyons, although playing fair defensive ball, was unable to put together a string of pay-off offensive plays, and were defeated, because of their inferiorline play.—BUI Riley	'
Bowlers Open Season Sunday
(Continued from Page 21)
year the Champion Villagers Club was getting a drubbing at the hands of the door-mat Jet Propulsion team. The Jets were making such a racket that Fred Tansey, captain of the Villagers, figured that the noise alone was knocking over the pins.
The Vetvillers, authorities on bad luck, dropped last year’s championship to the Villagers by only a couple of pins. The winner got a sizeable lump of the $500 prize money. Each team received a proportionate amount of the gold, depending upon how it finished in the league. At a league smoker at the end of the season, 17 team and individual trophies were awarded.
This season Ernie is looking beyond the crowded Bowl-Mor. “Things are shaping up,” popped Ernie. “If I don’t ram into any stone walls we should have an entrant in the Western Intercollegiate bowling league this year.” This is the league that Ernie and several other bowlers from the Keglers were in and out of all last season. They paid their own expenses to roll several matches aganist Purdue, St. Joseph’s College, and Valparaiso at Collegeville, Indiana, last year. “We hope to have this year’s club sponsored by the athletic department,” said Ernie.
Trainer Hugh Burns, who is a fair country bowler, stopped long enough from his football taping chores to give Ernie a nod on coaching this year’s team. The players will be chosen from the regular Keglers league, picking the top men from the highest individual averages. This will give any man in the loop a chance to work into the squad.
The argument over which teams will tote home the trophies and cash in the Kampus Keglers league will start Sunday. It will not be decided until late in April. But from the simmering pots of pessimism come a few predictions. Pete Lusardi, vice-president of the league, threw a handful of peanuts into his mouth: “Watch the Italian club this year—they’re loaded for bear.” The Italian club pin-topplers were troublemakers last year, but folded in the stretch drive. Cracked Nick Ash, one of the league’s four secretaries (the other three: John O’Brien, Bill Knorr, and Bob Fisher): “It’ll be a race between Detroit, Buffalo, Rochester, the Villagers, and Vetville in the Blue and Gold divisions. But no bets.”
Easy Ernie Huffman has a sharp point that shouldn’t be overlooked: “We’re not out to make expert bowlers. Just have a whale of a good time. And meet the boys.” Probably 700-800 Notre Dame students will get a chance to slap

the mineralite missiles down the Bowl-Mor alleys before the season is over. “I want to make this a sport in which everybody will get a chance,” said Ernie. In collegiate circles these days where sport is associated with experts, it was just an old idea, new style.
Interhall Battle Sunday
(Continued from Page 21) tough, especially on defense. His running mate, Jack Thornton, is heavier than Driscoll and a smooth performer on offense or defense. These men are backed up by Good, Kreuz, Eggers, Ferry, Mel Thornton, Foley and Dick Frankel.
Dillon coach Jack McMahon was T-for-mation quarterback for Dillon last season and a candidate for All-Campus honors. When he became coach this year he introduced the single wing system and brought with him a bag full of reverses and power plays, which ha /e often worked spectacularly. With his deceptive single wing attack, fast backs and a huge line, Dillon might have the weapons to end Cavanaugh’s championship reign. Four of the squad, Ray Doherty, ‘‘Zeke” Lane, Dom Colletti, and Jim Quigley have played on championship teams in the past two years and they’d like very much to repeat.
In the backfield, Colletti, Eikmeyer and McGroder are always dangerous and Coach McMahon proved he could pick up his heels, in the Morrissey game. But the real razzle-dazzle man this season has been “Zeke” Lane, a brilliant seatback and the shiftiest runner in the league. Lane was a principal cause of Lyons’ success last year and the year before and he’s even better this year. Bo Nester is another good runner who has been used principally as a blocking back.
Bill Lyden leads the line, which averages 195 pounds. Lyden, a great blocker and tackler, has been a standout in interhall competition for the last two years. Five ends, Solomon, Charters, Doherty, Hanifin and McDavid are used inter-changably and Celesta and Barnard provide two fine centers. In the middle of the line there are such proficient workmen as Quigley, Swisher, Sutter and Machinchick.
That’s the lineup for the big game. Before it’s over these lads might make the spectators think the Northwestern game was an afternoon tea.
MURPHY BREAKS RECORD ON IRISH CROSS COUNTRY COURSE Marquette's Whalen shadows Jim Murphy at the two-mile mark. Whalen pushed the Irish speedster most of the way, but couldn't match Murphy's last drive which gave him a 100-yard lead at the finish.

is reverence for our war dead. In the Calendar Armistice Day is referred to in the following manner:
ARMISTICE DAY — One minute’s silence for all those poor soldiers and sailors who didn’t return from the Pentagon.
Now possibly this is the Scholastic’s idea of humor, but Catholic gentlemen don’t make jokes about things that are sacred to so many. Men have died in two wars and for these men a day has been set aside on which we should give a little thought to these men and the
purpose for which they died. You don’t make fun of a memory that scars the minds of so many people who have lost loved ones or friends.
It might be rightly humorous to some that Armistice Day was set aside for a “war that was to end all wars” and that now we include another war’s dead in its annual eulogies. However, this is tragic humor to say the least and maybe we wouldn’t have such a situation had people not taken the memory of the first great war so lightly. You’ve scoffed at many things in your magazine, gentlemen, and many people laughed. Now you’ve stepped on holy ground and they’ve stopped laughing. Your irreverence is a disgrace to this university

M.	M. Boring (Colorado), manager of the Technical Personnel Division: It’s my job to contact young men who are interested in technical careers and start them through our training programs. This year we have hired more electrical, mechanical and chemical engineers, more chemists and physicists, than ever before.
MECHANICAL ENGINEEK
H. P. Kuehni, of the General Engineering and Consulting Laboratory: Much of my work has to do with such hurry-up calculating machines as the differential anaylzer. For the engineer with a bent toward mathematics, such machines offer exciting possibilities in problems whose complexities have heretofore discouraged study.
CHEMICAL ENGINEER
Gil Bahn (Columbia), graduate of the G-E Advanced Scientific Program: A graduate of this program wonders which of the company’s diverse fields offers the greatest opportunity. My choice was plastics, particularly the manufacture of synthetic phenol, and I’m convinced it’s one of the most fascinating jobs I could find.

Student Trip Reactions
Dear Editor:
Thank you very much for your letter of November 2, 1948. We here at the Annapolis derived untold pleasure from serving the group of 346 Notre Dame men who spent the nights of October 30-31 at our hotel.
We have handled many college groups over a period of the last ten or twelve years, but I must say your group made itself very conspicuous by its genteel behavior. It is very unusual for large groups of men to get together without some few overstepping the traces.
I hope we will have the distinction of being known as unofficial headquarters for Notre Dame men. It will give us great pleasure to work with them and serve them any time they may have the occasion to visit the Nation’s Capital.

College Newspaper Responsibility
Dear Editor:
Congratulations on the really fine feature, “Profs Take the Stump” in your October 29 issue. It seemed a particularly well-balanced forum, which did not confine itself to a discussion of Republican and Democratic politics, but which added the extremely enlightening article on inflation by Mr. Sheehan and the equally interesting piece on the American election campaigns by a visitor from a foreign country.
I hope the Scholastic will continue, weekly, forums like “Profs Take the Stump.” I hope, too, that the magazine will revive the seemingly-defunct editorial page, for a news organ without one is like a man with amnesia — nobody knows what it is or what it stands for. The editorial page should reflect the per
sonality of its editor and staff, and this page should never be subject to faculty veto. If it is, the editors, though they may never make embarrassing blunders, will never grow to maturity of judgment either, for all their important decisions will have been made for them. If our colleges have the wisdom to look to the future in this matter, as they have in so many other ways, perhaps the time will come when the Catholics of this country will not have to apologize for a Catholic press which has thus far deserted the vital interests of its readers and devoted itself to evangelizing and red-baiting.
Keep up the good work.

S'prise at WIRE
Visited an honest-to-goodness radio station last Sunday. It was WIRE in Indianapolis. Very modern. Very.
After exploring the studios, we were engaged in convei'sation by the slim, dark receptionist. The silly script to S’prize Party, a give-away show which should be given away, greatly interested us.
She was more concerned with the recent wave of molestings in Indianapolis which are selling so many papers it almost looks like a Hearst publicity stunt. But of course, it isn’t. Nevertheless, we left without finding out why giveaway programs must be. Professional secret, eh?

Thank You, SatEvePost
In case you’re interested, and you had better be, the Saturday Evening Post ran an article last week on Jack Benny. Two weeks ago the Scholastic Radio column ran a column on Jack Benny.
Quite a few statements made in the column were in the Post story. F’rin-stance: Benny isn’t funny; his writers make his show, etc.
This isn’t a pat on the back. Maybe it’s just a public way of saying “pleasant blow.” We’re on the right track, anyhow.
Strike on Way
It is possible that in the near future you won’t be able to hear all of your favorite programs. Or maybe they won’t be as funny. The intended strike by the radio writers which has been delayed more times than a Chi Rocket victory, may soon be here. Frank Crozier won’t have to worry — he writes his own stuff. Couldn’t ya tell?

The Scholastic
Music
Just to show we’re not scared by the results of the Gallup, Roper and Scholastic polls, we want in on the confusion.
As you must know if you start these things at the top, this column is supposed to be about music. Most of the time it is, but every once in a while we . . . well you know-how those things go . . . one thing after another . . . first it’s music . . . then it’s girl singers . . . then it’s girls . . . well, you understand. But the editors don’t.
So this way we combine everything. The Scholastic Music Department is conducting a poll. All one of us!
Vote a Straight Ticket
In this poll you can vote for your favorite band, fem vocalist, crooner and soloist. All votes will count, unless of course, your roommate writes saying his roommate has the best voice around. Only our roommate can do that.
In discussing plans for this thing some of the bigger toughs on Cav’s undefeated rugby team threatened violence if Stan Kenton doesn’t cop honors.
On the other hand, our roommate, whom we mentioned above for no sensible reason, and who has much more power than we on this rag, didn’t threaten violence (he wouldn’t dare) but column extinction if Stan the Man wins.
Waving the family flag which says “Don’t Spit on Me” and crying in a loud democratic voice, we say, “Let the justice of a vote win out.”
And we don’t mean Charley the Choo-Choo, either.
Music What's Got It
To those effervescent Kenton fans we recommend “Harlem Holiday.” Some fine Bob Cooper, Eddie Bert and Art Pepper.
There is a rumor that the outstanding music which was the background to Lawrence Olivier’s “Hamlet” (which surpasses everything, as does Olivier) has been recorded and will be out soon in album form. If so, don’t miss it.

principles in the modern world; and the fostering among American Catholic college students of a sense of responsibility within the Mystical Body of Christ.”
Some of the more concrete results which the foreign students receive are clothing, books, food, and monetary donations. Another benefit which they receive is the opportunity to try for scholarships to American colleges, which are partly made possible by the Student Relief campaign. Notre Dame’s Ernest Haindl, of Morrissey Hall, received one of the: Austrian scholarships and can personally attest to the deprivations that the foreign students have to endure.
Archbishop Cushing of Boston in addressing a letter of endorsement of the campaign wrote, “I cannot imagine a more essentially Catholic activity than this by which our students aspire to aid their fellow students who have been victims of war.”
Officially recognized Catholic student organizations, in cooperation with representatives of War Relief Services of the National Catholic Welfare Conference, made all of the distributions of relief materials overseas. Nine European and three Asiatic countries were the recipients of last year’s allocations of the relief materials.
Jack Dempsey, Alumni commerce senior, is chairman of the campus campaign. Bud Condron is the publicity chairman, while Bill Small has been assigned to take charge of the dollar-per-student drive.
Notre Dame figures highly in the national campaign with two local students at the top of the country-wide committee. Lou Burns is the national chairman and Joe Conerty is the publicity director.
Plans for the second gigantic Mardi Gras, which will be held next semester, will be announced shortly by the campus chairman.
CHEST CHECK
Notre Dame students can have their chests X-rayed for signs of tuberculosis at the end of this month. Special X-ray units will be in the basement of the Dining Hall on Nov. 29 and 30 and Dec. 1 from 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 pan.. and from 5 to 7:30 p-m. There will be a charge of IS cents for the service.

Browser’s Column
By MAX A. BROWSER
Are they unsightly? Could be. But are they as unsightly as a candy wrapper, or a crumbled cigarette package?
There are, on the bulletin boards all over campus, a number of brilliant posters proclaiming the Soph Cotillion or Met Club dance or other such things. These posters take time to make and are put there for specific purposes. Anyone who takes them down or covers them with another rates fairly low in this browser’s note book.
The Lost Class
Where, oh where has the freshman class gone?
It seems almost impossible that 1100 energetic souls such as they were at the opening of the school year should have lost all autonomy in the ensuing rush for knowledge. As we recall, this group was subjected to a monster orientation program designed to give them a flavor of Notre Dame “spirit.” Either they didn’t like the taste or, being possessed with it, just don’t know what to do with it because they have been a dead collection so far this year.
We have been looking hopefully in their direction since the semester settled into its dreary routine, awaiting the first explosion of young hormones to come blasting across campus in the form of some big activity or mass meeting or what have you. But what have we? So far — not a thing. '
Our regrets in this respect are intensified after watching this year’s Sophomore class in action last year. They were a hustling crew, quite fired up with initiative and quite effective in getting things done, at that. Happily enough they haven’t cooled down this year and are presenting a great Cotillion next week. They left a great example for those that followed but apparently this has made no impression.
It has been a part of the sad history of student activity around Notre Dame that a class which starts with nothing ends as it starts. Just when it seemed as if things might start moving around here, and when we viewed this freshman class as a shot in the arm, all is silence from the fledglings.
There is still a chance for these newcomers to start something. To accomplish anything, they must organize and do it quickly.
Here and There
We understand that a recent column made many enemies for us among the ND band members. Any objective reading of the column would have revealed

that we were, for the first time as we recall, exposing the basic philosophy of the Notre Dame Band. To those who were offended, our deepest apologies and one clean, white handkerchief for tear absorbing purposes. . . .
Hall decoration hit a new high, according to our standards and all credit to the students who worked so hard to make them what they were. It is ironic justice that there were no prizes this year. . . .
The Notre Dame campus is beautifully laid out. People coming here from all over the country have commented on it to the superlative. To keep it that way, it should be clean. Students are asked to cooperate. And they have to a heartening degree. BUT WHY, OH WHY ARE THERE NO TRASHCANS?
