'"Eleven Adequate Players)) . .. 
COLLEGE football's Centennial Year. From Slippery 
Rock to Southern Cal, the anniversary was observed simi­
larly-an appropriate design limed on the field, "100'' 
decals on each helmet. 

But not at Notre Dame. Ara Parseghian is a funda­mentalist and his boys always will wear the straight blue and gold. Their Stadium is a perfect saucer, containing two scoreboards, ·two goal posts and a playing surface. The end zones are marked with diagonal lines. Nothing superfluous. 
Notre Dame did have an appropriate response for the· Centennial 'Year, a response more significant than all the decals, letters from President Nixon and halftime cere­monies combined. Notre Dame, in 1969, regained that tingling quality which has long distinguished college foot­ball from the professional game-romanticism. 
Parseghian's first five Irish squads all were pre-season favorites or mid-season contenders for the National Cham­pionship. Further, each team was dominated by one or more "name" players. 
"This year it will be a little different," said Ara last September. "They're not mentally tight. They're more relaxed this year. They're having more fun with it. For a change, they don't feel that heavy burden of being picked No. 1 before the season. They know it's not going to be the end of the world if they lose a football game. \Ve've had the same problems with individuals who got so much publicity that there wasn't room for them to have a bad game. Same with the team, they just weren't per­mitted to have a bad performance. But this year we don't have an established 'star' and the pressure won't be there." 
GOLDEN ARl\1 and Silver Paws were gone; in fact, the entire backfield, both ends and a pair of linemen had departed. As Notre Dame opened its 1969 season versus Northwestern, Parseghian turned around to find this much playing-time at the offensive skilled positions: 
SE Tom Gatewood 0:00 TE Dewey Poskon 36:34 QB Joe Theismann 115:00 HB Andy Huff 0:00 HB Ed Ziegler 51 :06 FB Bill Barz 2:54 
A squap so inexperienced naturally inclines toward the romantic, but this group seemed to cultivate the notion. The sophomore split end had been a runner, not a recei·cer, in high school. The tight end ·was so thin he spent the summer drinking Nutrament. The offensive co-captain was a walk-on. 
. Fittingly, the team's most romantic figure was its quarterback. He _was Joe "Twiggy" Theismann, a fellow 
with the body of a greyhound, or, for that matter, a cer­
tain British model. He was 6-0, 170 pounds; his wrist 
was eight inches, his neck 15½, his chest 40, his bicep 
13½, his calf 15¼-Facially, he looked like that little 
kid third from the left in your church choir. 
"Twiggy" could not do the job in Golden Ann's 
style. So Ara threw out most of those pro-sets and went 
back to the good old college stuff-quarterback options, 
three-back offense, field-position football. 
In their opener, the Irish coughed and gagged for 
three periods until 5-10, 180-pound Brian Lewallen, an­
other walk-on, returned a punt for the game-breaking 
touchdown. 
At Purdue, however, the wizardry of Mike Phipps crushed Notre Dame 28-14. 
The Irish faced a problem, at this point, which is peculiar in all of college football. Parseghian and staff made technical adjustments-most notably, the substitu­tion of two sophomores for a pair of veteran defenders. But the more pressing diffculty was maintaining desire, what with the National Championship an impossibility and, of course, no league title to win. Could the Irish come back? ,vould they want to come back? Could Parseghian motivate them to come back? 
Theismann answers. , "That Purdue 0o-ame was the turning point. The whole team came together mentally and physically. I knew we wouldn't lose again. It just wouldn't have been right." 
Gatewood echoes, "After Purdue, all I heard was 'pride, pride.' \11le couldn't give up then. \,Ve had to come back. We had to do it for our pride. As far as I'm concerned, the season started with Michigan State ( third game) and we went undefeated. \Ve're a team in the true s~nse of ~he word. \,Ve don't have two great guys and nme med10cre guys. We've got 11 adequate players. For that reason, I think we're the best team Notre Dame has had in a long time." 
BowLs, polls, conference championships, All-America teams, etc., are pollutants which have diluted college football's purity through the past 100 years. The game, in its essence, is a young team being defeated early in the season. then. without artificial incentives battlino-un­

Coach Ara Parseghian and his quarterback, Joe "Twiggy" Theismann. 
. . . "Bonded for a Lifetime" 
Following is a letter which coach Tom Pagna distrib­uted to each Notre Dame player on the eve of the season opener. 
HE looks normal -is so humble he rarely thinks him­self good enough. He is dedicated to "try" for all he's worth-with effort-with enthusiasm-with deep emo­tion! Down deep he has a distinct piece of knowledge that he just knows-and it is simply-"J/ you won't be beaten, you can't be beate1i." 
He never thinks loss-he never once holds the idea that he can't overcome any obstacle. His state of mind generates his body into super efforts-beyond what the mediocre can comprehend. 
Notre Dame's champion knows full well that each opponent will be high for Notre Dame. He also knows that men of Notre Dame can never enjoy the luxury of having a "breaking point" ... the point where others suddenly sense the tide against them and relent. The true champion is "relentless." He plays and for as long as the contest or the season never --breaks! 
THE true champion bows his head in prayer-'·To do my best" -"For God" -"For Country" -and "Notre Dame." 
In his mind's eye, football and Notre Dame and win­ning are all a part of a thirst in him-that he welcomes, that he feels deeply about. It is intertwined with his very core of existence. 
Here-in the span of ninety days-champions are being born. They are emerging. The season of 1969 will hold a place and a time in history-to recognize the new faces-the new names-the new champions. They will, I repeat, "look normal"-'"sweat"-"cry"-"pray" -"laugh"-"bleed"-·.,fa11''· ---screan1.. ..-nse. up -and conquer! 
Enter the champion not as individuals-but as a team -one, unified, spirited, enthusiastic, daring,. group of Notre Dame men bonded for a lifetime. 
-Tom Pagna

The close of the article. however, yields to the indestructible strength of a per­jJetzwted myth known as "Irish Horse Pmccr.'" They make us a 24-jJoint favorite. This is incredible.

For The Third Straight Year 
Purdue is a mighty big football team and has the sj1eed and skills to challenge our young squad. If our defense can contain Phij1ps (which will be no small task from his 0J1e11ing showing at TCU), then our offense must get the ball into the end zone. 
Our squad seems to recognize that this game, in Pur­due's back yard, t°'kes 011 a sj1ecial significance. Still I think it would be an error 011 our J1art to get them too emotionally J1itched and J1lay a "tense" game. Rather, zce have attemJ1ted to get a confident feeling across: that u.:e can iet the job done. 
Playing them down there will be tough, but we've ;.corked Izard and Jne /Jared well. 
Football is insignificant to many and, in total view of the world today, very minute. But "Rocky" Bleier, our 1967 caJ1tai11, just wrote a letter to me from his hosj1ital bed in Tokyo. He ZL'as a:ounded in Vietnam action and near to losing his foot. Yet he wrote and asked me to wish the ··guys" good luck ... before we invade Lafayette. Right now football and the J1eoj1le who play it crowd cve1ythi11g back. Unlike nzan)' things in our affiuent ..vorld, a victory must be fully J1aid for with work and sacrifice. At this juncture, I lwj1e we've paid enough. Rocky ... he J1aid too much. But the "guys" will know and care ... and thank him for his remembrance. 
Game 2 Purdue 28, ND 14 
H1s TONES rolled out of the telephone receiver slow and deep, like so many bowling balls, each hooking perfectly into the one-three pocket. 
It was Jimmy ..The Greek" Snyder, America's most famous and most successful sports handicapper, speaking from Las Vegas. 
"\Ve call it eYen," he said of the mid-week line on 

Figure 1: Phipps 15, Brown 22, Bullock 31, Cooper 46, Fenner 80, Ellis 23, Schumacher 24, Zloch 27, Olson 36, Kelly 42, Gasser 46, Neidert 88. 
Notre Dame-Purdue." 
Such words were not to be taken lightly. Last time 

"The Greek" had predicted a deadlock for the Irish, he 
wasn't merely correct. He called the final score, too­
Irish 21. Southern Cal 21 on Nov. 30, 1968. 
Notre Dame was the pollsters' pick, for this game­ranked No. 8 by UPI and No. 9 by AP. After its season­opening 42-35 conquest of Texas Christian, Purdue was 14th, said UPI. No, the Boilermakers rank 16th, said AP. 
Aw, those guys just don't have all their poker chips in order, countered "The Greek." His top ten showed Notre Dame No. 2 behind Ohio State, and Purdue No. 9. 
"I rate a team according to who they play," Jimmy insisted, "and nobody plays a better schedule than the Irish. Let's say Notre Dame lost to Purdue 21-19 or something like that, but still outplayed them. Next week, I'd rate Notre Dame ahead of a team like Penn State, which doesn't play a schedule nearly so difficult. I don't believe in those guys who will rate all the unbeaten teams at the top just because they haven't lost." 
His "Polar Philosophy" established, "The Greek" ex­plained how he and his team of experts had arrived at a dead-heat verdict. 
"\•Ve figured Notre Dame was the better team, but you have to subtract two points for Zimmerman. (Five days before the game, ND's starting fullback, Jeff Zimme1man, had his football career tern1inated by doctors who diagnosed a malfunctioning kidney.) And give Purdue three or four points for the home-field advantage." 
Of course, the boss doesn't always agree with his squad of advisors. \,Vhere Notre Dame football is con­cerned, Jimmy Snyder admits that, well, there is a slight disparity between his personal feelings and what you read in the Las Vegas Sun. 
"Personally, I have a great feeling for Notre Dame and for Parseghian. He's a great coach and a great man," Jimmy said. 
"I look for Notre Dame to beat Purdue by 24-21 or something in that area. It's going to be three touchdowns either way. 
"Actually, I'm one of the few men who had Notre Dame in my preseason top five. I really think your team is going to surprise a lot of people. Purdue? I don't know. I somehow don't think they have much of a team, but I can't exactly put my finger on it. I just don't think they have it this year. I wouldn't be surprised to see the Irish go 10-0 if they beat Purdue. This one could put your team over the hump." 
Q ­

BOILERMAKER QUARTERBACK :Mike Phipps had a few pre-game thoughts of his own. Phipps, however, had one significant advantage over Jimmy Snyder. He didn't have to talk about his pre-game thoughts until after the fact. 
And that fact, that painful fact, is that Mike Phipps 

took the Irish right out there in front of 68,179 spectators it sounded strong, that's the ,...·ay it had to be. 
( largest college football crowd in Indiana history) and beat the living hell out of them. He did everything to the Irish but burp them. 
He read Notre Dame defenses superbly, calling more than 10 audibles. "In fact," said his coach, Jack l\ilollen­kopf, "he even recognized defensive variations as he was dropping back into the pocket and improvised after the snap of the ball!" 
There is no better testimony to Phipps than his thi:-d­down performance chart. Nineteen times on that warm, breezy afternoon, he faced third-down situations. Twelve times he got the first down. Further, Purdue's total offense on those 19 third-down plays was an astounding 183 yards. 
For third straight year, he had vanquished Notre Dame's dream of an undefeated season. He became the only quarterback since 1900 to beat the Irish three con­secutive seasons. \Vhen it was all over, Mike Phipps was a man liberated. Now he could speak freely about Notre Dame without fearing that his comments would hang in the Irish locker room the next year. This time, Phipps was talking no trash. He laid it right down, man, and if 
"There was never a doubt in my mind that we would beat Notre Dame today," Phipps began. "All we had to do was execute the plays. After looking at film all week, we felt their team wasn·t as strong as last year or the year before, either. 
"\Ve thought they were kind of weary of coming down here to Lafayette. They dof1't seem to take the initiative as far as scoring early in the game. \Ve knew momentum would be a big factor, so we wanted to score first. \Ve knew that if we got out in front early, they ,rnuldn't be able to come back. And they didn't. 
"Beating Notre Dame three straight years is something I'll probably remember when I'm older and done playing football. But right now, it's just another game, just another victory." 
As PHIPPS had wished, his Boilermakers stmck for 
the game's initial points. The touchdown play came on 
third-and-14 from the Irish 37. 
Notre Dame decided to blitz its inside linebackers­Bob Olson and Lan-y Schumacher. Phipps sav.· the blitz

coming and audibilized at the line. In the huddle, he had 
called for a formation with end Greg Fenner split right, 
Stan Brown flanked left and Randy Cooper at tailback, 
behind fullback John Bullock. 

When Phipps checked off! he moved Cooper up into 
a slot position inside Fenner (Fig. 1). Since Irish de­
fensive halfbacks Chuck Zloch and John Gasser already 
were busy with Fenner and Brown, outside linebacker 
Tim Kelly had to go it alone against Cooper. 
Purdue picked up the Irish blitz very well, permitting 
Cooper enough time to shake loose. He went downfield 
10 yards, froze Kelly with a brilliant move, then broke 
deep. :Meanwhile, Notre Dame safety Clarence Ellis, 
whose priority responsibility was to check tight end Ashley 
Bell, noticed that Cooper had beaten Kelly. Ellis made a 
remarkable effort, but Purdue had executed the play too 
well. Cooper grabbed Phipps' looping pass in the end 
zone and the Boilermakers led 7-0. 
Three times Phipps made the third-down play during 
Purdue's second scoring drive: 
-On third-and-13 at the Purdue 34, Phipps drilled it 
21 yards over the middle to Cooper. 
-On third-and-eight at the ND 43, Phipps threw in 
the left flat to Brown, who undressed Zloch with a mag­
nificent feint and raced 27 yards to the Irish 16. 
-On third-and-two at the l\T]) 8, Phipps pitched to 
Cooper and threw a key block as Randy picked up the 
first down. 
It was a 63-yard march in 11 plays. The Boilers led 
14-0 midway through the second period. 

NOTRE DAME, 
which had gained only 52 yards to this point, put itself back into the ball game with a reciprocal drive. The Irish covered 79 yards in 12 plays, aided no little by a pass interference penalty on fourth­and-nine at the Purdue 19. The touchdown came three plays later as Joe Theismann fired a 10-yard pass to Ed Ziegler who made a sparkling grab at the left flag. 
Notre Dame retained its momentum in the third period, forcing Purdue to punt twice in the first five minutes. Now the Irish had good field position at their 45 yardline. This was the opportunity they had to seize. Desperately, Notre Dame needed a touchdown. 
Ziegler got three yards at left tackle before Allan took a pitchout around left end for 17. First down at the Purdue 35. Irish left tackle Jim Reilly continued to· dominate Boilermaker right tackle Jim Kleidon. Ziegler followed Reilly for three yards, then six more. Third-and­one at the 26. 
The next three plays were fatal to ND. First, the Irish were charged with backfield in motion. Ara's re­action to that penalty: "Now you look at the film and see if you can find any motion there. It was clearly an incorrect call." 
Nevertheless, the Irish now had third-and-six at the 31. Theismann got nothing at right end. Make it fourth-and­six at the 31-the gan1e's biggest play. 
Ara dispatched the call in with flanker Jim deArrieta. Theismann was to roll left and hit deArrieta who would be crossing over the middle. Purdue came with a six-man rush. Senior Billy McKoy bolted in from Theismann's right; Irish center Mike Oriard saw him too late. McKoy smacked Theismann for a 17-yard loss. And, sadly, deArrieta was open. 
Said Ara, "That was the turning point." Said Mol­
lenkopf, "I know he (McKoy) was Oriard's responsibility, 
but don't blame him. McKay's got good speed on the 
pass 1ush." 
Three plays earlier, Notre Dame was threatening to 
make it 14-14. Now Purdue had first down at its 48; 
Phipps sensed the shift in momentum. 
HE immediately gunned a 13-yard strike to Fenner. First down at the Irish 39. Then followed another pair of third-down spectaculars by Phipps. 
On third-and-five at the 34, Purdue came out in a 
double wing. "I saw their inside linebacker was moving 
out to help cover Stan (Brown), so I knew that John 
(Bullock) would be open if he could slip through the line 
into that vacated space," Phipps explained. "'Ve call that 

a 'hot receiver' when one of the backs gets into the -secondary and there's nobody to pick him up." 
Bullock lugged Phipps' pass to the l\T]) 15 for another 
first down. But three plays hence, the Boilers confronted 
a big third-and-14 situation at the 19. This time, Fenner 
was the primary receiver on a hook pattern, but Phipps 
spotted Brown, who was doing a quick post. Stan took 
Phipps' perfect throw for a 16-yard gain and Mike com­
pleted the masterpiece with two quarterback sneaks. Pur­
due 21-7. 
Notre Dame went nowhere with the ensuing kickoff, then punted the ball back to '"ronder Boy and his 10 side­kicks. From his 42 Phipps moved in for the death-knell touchdown. 
The critical play this time was a 42-yard toss to Bell which planted Purdue on the Irish 15 yardline. It was a fairly simple pattern, based on Phipps' contention that "their linebackers don't have great speed and we figured our tight end and our backs could outrun them." Split end Fenner took defensive back Zloch into the middle with a down-and-in pattern. Tight end Bell, going one­on-one with Irish outside linebacker Bob Neidert, crossed behind Fenner, made it look like a sideline pattern, then turned upfield. Phipps' pass was oh, about two inches off target, but Bell made the adjustment and soon it was 28-7. 

There was 13: 39 remaining, but the game was over. Statistics to that point showed Purdue's dominance: The Boilers' total offense was 366 yards, compared to l\T])'s 
140. Phipps had completed 12 of 20 throws for 213 yards. Theismann was 4 of 12 for 7 yards.

Theismann: Getting It In Gear 
Against Purdue, we did not play as well as we are capable. Losing to Purdue in the early season has a "special'' sting. Our pla'yers must fight off the emotional adversit)1 of a loss, and as much as we might like to dwell on it-we have not the time. There'll be other times for Purdue and things have a way of ironing out. 
On the eve before playing Michigan State and follow­ing a hard week of preparation, the Irish path is clouded. Injuries to Mike kfartin, Chuck Kennedy and .1.\1ike Kadish have wounded our depth securit,y. Earlier in the week we lost a soplwmore fullback who I thought was ready to come into his own. Jolzn Cieszkowski is gone for the season with a shoulder separation. This really hurt our offensive backfield in terms of speed and overall depth. We may be forced to employ Andy Huff both at fullback and half back. 
Already some "fair weather" anon'ymous notes appear in the mail, giving us helpful coaching hints as seen through their great insights to the game. Whenever we lose, which has been rare, comments of not winning the "big one" fiow from the mouths of the pseudo-loyal. Whenever )IOU lose it is a big one. To Ara and the staff every game is a big one! 
Michigan State has great speed and a powerful run­ning attack. Their defense, however, has always been their strongest suit. When coupled together, they are a formidable opponent. 
At this time, a win over kfichigan State would be a tonic to our squad. We do have good morale, and fine leadership in Olson and Oriard. 
Strategically we have planned to employ a defense that will stress shutting off their ground attack first. Offensively, we hope to throw more on them. Their style of defense and the front we anticipate ( a 4-4 front) call for this maneuver. Whether or not our sophomore­studded team can execute will be the key to our success. 
On the surface this may appear to be just another game to others, but to us it must be another super­charged effort to repel a team that gets ''highest'' for Notre Dame. That seems to be a weekly affair anymore. Emotionally, this draws a group of young men. Ara has, however, set the stage for our squad to comprehend this and regard it as more favorable than being a doormat whom nobody fears. 
Sage old Duffy will crack a few well chosen anec­

dotes and rely on his speed and depth.

Game 3 

ND 42, Michigan State 28 

H1s paunch had receded considerably and the face was a bit more aged this time. But, rhetorically, it was still the same Duffy Daugherty. 
"Gentlemen, this is my third news conference since the game ended and, by God, I still haven't had a shower," he said, feigning anger. 
"Listen, Duffy," said one writer, "you're doin' a helluva job. Just one more thing-Did you really e:,-.-pect Ara to come out throwing that much today?" 
Daugherty's green eyes twinkled; he tugged at his plaid boxer shorts. Another "Duffyism" was taking shape_ 
"vVell, I'll tell you," he said, looking vacantly toward the showers. "I really didn't see Ara throwing many passes today. Theismann looked pretty good, but I didn't see much of Ara." 
On another. day, Duffy might haye been humorous, indeed. But today, he was a loser. He was Pagliaci­laughing outside, dying inside. 
DUFFY's assessment of Joe Theismann was strictly superficial. Sure, he had "looked pretty good." But the big difference benveen Theismann vs. Purdue and Theis­mann vs. Michigan State was in the mind, not the arm. Ara explained: . 
"Sunday after the Purdue game we just watched films. 
I didn't say anything to Joe. Monday at practice, he was 
very flat; in fact, everybody was. I didn't say too much to 
him. 
"On Tuesday we had a very long talk out on the practice field. Joe's a great kid. I told him how I'd played with Otto Graham and even he had had off days. We talked abut his capabilities, what he can do and ,vhat he can't do. I said, 'Forget that Purdue game.' Joe re­sponded with a great week of practice and it carried o\·er today." 
Theismann claims he monopolized the conversation. 
"I started off by telling him I didn't think my per­formance in the first two games was up to par. The guys I'm playing with are the greatest in the world. But I hadn't done anything to show I was worthy of playing with them. 
"Against Purdue, I wasn't tight. I kept fighting tension all week, telling myself it was just another game. A Jot of people were saying our offense didn't have it. I was trying to forget that. 
"But in the game I wasn't accurate with my passing at all. So when I talked to coach on Tuesday, I just told him I thought it was about time I got my ass in gear and started playing some ball." 
Make that a power shift into high gear. Against

Figure 3: Theismann 7, Allan 22, Ziegler 32, Barz 33, Gatewood 44, Hogan 66. 
Michigan State, Theismann completed 20 of 33 throws for 294 yards and three touchdowns, plus 51 yards rush­ing in 10 carries. 
IT WAS supposed to be a low-scoring game-two tough defenses clashing with a pair of ball-control offenses. Typical of most Notre Dame-Michigan State battles, there was plenty of hatchet action expected in the "pits," that no man's land more politely termed the line of scrimmage. 
But Ara, consistent with the Ford philosophy, had a better idea. And so did Duffy. 

"',Ve went in throwing,'' said Parseghian. (First time the Irish had the ball, they passed five· times, then punted.) "It's very tough to run inside against a ball club as big as Michigan State. ,ve had to establish the passing attack first. We figured that would open them up for the run." 
Michigan State, meanwhile, was showing the same combination of fear and respect for the Notre Dame defense. In victories over Washington and Southern Methodist, the Spartans had relied on a veer offense which unleashed three quick, powerful running backs out of a tight "Y'' fommtion. Against the Irish, however, Duffy decided to use the three-back veer only when his team reached scoring territory. Outside the ND 20 yard­line, he replaced sophomore halfback Eric Allen with flanker Gordon Bowdell. 
"You can't run power stuff at a team as big as Notre Dame;: Duffy said, echoing Ara. "Vie had to spread 'em out a little bit." 
Those tactical maneuvers combined to make it an offensive show and, perhaps coincidentally, delay the "pit work" until fourth quarter, after the issue had been decided. 
FOR the first time in three games, Notre Dame beat its opponent to the scoreboard. On their second series of downs, the Irish drove 41 yards to the MSU 11. Now they faced third-and-six. 
Fullback Bill Barz slid unmolested into the right flat, but Theismann, under pressure, overthrew him slightly. Barz "just stuck my left hand up to tip the ball. That way I figured I might get another chance at it." Notre Dame's 25th consecutive capacity home crowd delighted in Barz' one-man volleyball game as the Irish took a 7-0 lead. 
"That's a play we put in specifically for this game," Parseghian revealed later. Michigan State's 4-4-3 defense places responsibility for short-zone pass coverage on the linebackers. Operating out of the "I," flanker Denny Allan and tailback Ed Ziegler attracted the linebackers, leaving Barz free in the flat (Fig. 2). 
After the opening touchdown, State adjusted some­what, though Barz caught five more flat passes for 46 yards. Four of those five receptions netted first downs. 
NOTRE DAME drew bad field position near the end of the first period as MSU's Gary Boyce deftly dropped a punt at the Irish 5 yardline. 
On first down, Ed Ziegler went through left guard for four yards as the period ended. Now defending the north goal, Notre Dame had a 13 m.p.h. wind at its back; 
The Scholastic 

Ara took advantage. He rushed flanker-punter Jim 
deArrieta into the game with these orders: Go for the 
bomb. If that fails, quick kick on third down. 
Theismann's second-down pass to deArrieta fell in­complete at the MSU 40. On third-and-six at the Irish 9, deArrieta lined up at tailback in the "I." He took a pitchout from Theismann, but his quick kick was low, hitting a surprised Ron Curl, MSU linebacker, flush in the chest. 
Two plays later, it was 7-7. 
"I hit it bad," sighed deArrieta, "too low on my foot." 
"About that time," said Ara, "I was thinking this 
might be another one of those days. We had gone over that quick kick every day since practice began and never had any trouble. Now we try it in a game and we get a break like that. But we bounced back. It's very de­moralizing to give up a cheap score, but these kids over­came it." 
THE !RISH took State's kickoff and bolted 85 yards in 17 plays. ND 14, MSU 7. Michigan State returned the favor immediately-71 yards in 12 plays. Make it 14-14. 
Re-enter Duffy for a brief analysis: "When we came back to tie it, 14-14, I thought we were in good shape. But Notre Dame came back with a great drive after our kickoff put them deep. They went the length of the field, and I believe their score in such a short time to go ahead was the turning point of the game." 
Notre Dame started from its 2 7 with 2 : 09 remaining before intermission. Barz up the middle for two, Theis­mann around right end for 13, Theismann to Barz in the flat for 16, Theismann to Tom Gatewood for 13. Now there was Jess than a minute remaining. First-and-10 at the State 29. 
The Spartans went into a prevent-type defense with four linemen up front, four linebackers facing Irish re­ceivers head-to-head, one rover playing the ball and two safeties cushioning in deep zone coverage. 
Notre Dame countered with a spread formation (Fig. 3), hoping to isolate a linebacker and a receiver. Theis­mann faked to Barz and rolled right. Gatewood went down 10 yards and turned in, taking with him a line­backer and safety. Ziegler crossed behind Gatewood a:p.d outraced Michigan State linebacker Mike Hogan to the left flag. Theismann delivered and ND assumed the lead agam. 

Notre Dame controlled the second half and ~fichigan State never drew even. The Irish put it away at 11 :25 of the fourth quarter by driving to their sixth touchdown and a 42-21 margin. 
TURNING serious for a moment, just before his shower, Duffy provided an objective judgement on this game and, without mentioning it, a very lucid commentary on the Irish loss to Purdue: 
"This was the highest point total ever scored on us since I became head coach (15 years ago) . I never thought they'd stick it in our ear like they did. There was nothing flukey about it. 
"I thought Theismann had a great day. I don't know how many times he came up with the big third-down play. His style of play is very effective when Notre Dame is even with you or leading. If you need the ball, you have to come up and play his fakes on those roll-outs and options. If Notre Dame is behind, though, you can Jay back and just wait for him to throw the ball. But we weren't in that position today."

D (as Ill Defense)-Day 
Going to pZ-ay Army in Yankee Stadium is a game that is another in a long series of Notre Dame tradition and football histor'y. John 1\1urjJh')', our scout, has reJJeatedl)' said that Army is small, quick and will never quit. The')' are a typical academy-oriented team: well discijJlined, superbly conditioned and fundamentally very sound. Our big task is not to allow our team the luxur')1 of relaxing against them. They obvious!')' will be "sky high'' against us, but our size should overwhelm them if we are funda­mentally sound and play up to our cajJabilities. The threat here is not to look to the Southern California game next week, remembering Ara's chant: «No game zs as important as the one ')'OU are going to jJlay." 
Game 4 

ND 45, Army 0 
LEss than one minute remained on the Yankee Sta­
dimn scoreboard clock as Notre Dame's second offensive 
unit drove toward yet another score. 

Along the Irish bench, defensive co-captain Bob Olson, 
a most 0 fellow time. noticed assistant
deliohted by this , 
coach Joe Yonto. 

"Hey coach, hey coach," screamed Bobo, faking a 
state of utter panic. "\Vhat are you doin' down here, 
coach? You're supposed to be up in the press box 
spotting their defense." 

"\'\7hat do you mean, Bobo?" replied Yonto, not quite 
understanding. "There's only 16 seconds left." 
Olson shook his head. "I don't know, coach," he dead­
panned. "Sixteen seconds left, anything can happen." 
At the final gun, Olson raced toward the third-base 
dugout, slicing his way through a maze of subway alumni, 
pickpockets and derelicts who invariably break past New 
York's finest and onto the field. 

Inside the locker room, Bobo found halfback Ed 
Ziegler hunched over on the training table. He pranced

across the room, wrapped Ziegler in a playful head-lock 
and chortled, "\,Vake up, wake up, you sleepy head. Get 
up, get up, get out of bed." 

Ziegler pointed to a small cut above his left knee. 
"Aw, what's-a-matter, Ziggy?" Olson laughed in mock 
sympathy. "You know, every time this Ziegler plays a 
good game, he gets hurt. I just can't understand him." 

Now to the shower room where Bobo found his boys 
huddled together, struggling to get a few drops from one 
of the three faucets. (No, surely they didn't make l\1ickey 
Mantle wash like this.) Olson surveyed his troops. After 
14 games of defensive captaincy, Bobo finally had led his 
unit to a shutout; he was going to relish the moment 
thoroughly. Olson called a halt to lathering and an­
nounced the next number. It was a raucous, soapy, slosh­
ing rendition, but the lyrics ~vere unmistakable: "I've 

been workin' on a railroad, all the livelong day; I've been 
working' ..." 
ACTUALLY, the events of the_ day, in descending order of excitement, ranked this way: 
1. Bobo Olson's debut as a chorale director. 
2. 
A gallop by Irish cheerleader Ann Stringer on the Army mule. 

3. 
The Corps of Cadets booing a peace symbol formed at halftime by the Notre Dame band. 


4. Notre Dame's 45-0 thrashing of Army. 
For most of the 63,786 fans who clawed their way up to 168th Street, the only significant man in Yankee Sta­dium was Lindsay Nelson. It was fine to see these nice college boys playing football, but it was still baseball season. ,,v11at the hell was all this about Alex ,,vebster coaching Fran the Man and Broadway Joe screaming "cheap shot" at AFL referees? Those guys were just trying to get a few lines in the Daily News with a lot of off-season jive. Everybody knew the 1vfets were opening the World Series in Baltimore that day. The place to be was Anywhere, just so you had Lindsay on your transistor. 
For the benefit of those 56 people at Yankee Stadium who weren't tuned in to vVJRZ, the public address an­nouncer, former Irish QB Frank Tripucka, tossed in Series scores periodically. 
Tripucka's enthusiasm for the Mets and the Irish was suspended, however, as Baltimore took a 4-0 lead and ND floundered at the outset. 
"I was a little bit nervous in the beginning," said current Irish QB Joe Theismann, referring to a mild form of cardiac arrest known as "Yankee Stadium Shakes." 

For the second straight week, Notre Dame was facing a tight 4-4-3 defense which often looked like 8-0-3. "When they jam the line like that and just refuse to back off, you don't have any alternative but to pass,". explained assistant coach Tom Pagna. Thus, Theismann's degree of ne!Vousness was inversely proportional to Notre Dame's degree of success. . . . 
The Schol,astic 


Army's Byron Price (89), foe Neuman (62) and Dave Smith (60) fail to prevent a Theismann-to-Allan completion. 
THE IRISH got only a field goal in their first three series of downs. Then a Larry Schumacher interception gave ND fine field position at its 45; Theismann caused a few transistors to drop on the next play. 
Scrimmaging from the left hash mark, Joe split Dewey Poskon left and flanked Denny Allan right. Tom Gate­wood was tight on the right side; Bill Barz and Ed Ziegler were stacked in the "I" (Fig. 4). 
Army was in a double free safety defense, favoring the wide or right side of the field. 
Poskon ran a 10-yard hook, drawing the right half­back and safety. Gatewood's was a "read pattern." He was to run straight at his man, "read" the opponent's move, then roll for an opening. 
Army's halfback and safety both played Gatewood to the open field, but Tom broke for the left corner and Theismann's throw was as good as a Tom Seaver fastball. Gatewood's description: "W'hen he (Cadet defensive back Danton Steele) turned the wrong way, there was day­light and I was gone." Notre Dame led 10-0. 
Between quarters, Tripucka said, "At the end of six innings, the Mets nothing, Baltimore ( very softly) four." 
Twice in the early second period, Notre Dame pene­trated Army's 10 yardline without scoring. 
At 10:04 of the second quarter: "(with excitement) After 6½ innings, it's Mets one, Baltimore (softly) four." 
John Gasser set up Notre Dame's second TD with an interception at the enemy 44. Theismann got the iast four yards on a big fourth-and-goal thmst. 
At 4:33 of the second quarter: "At the end of seven, 1\1ets one, Baltimore {not softly this time) four." 
The Irish marched 65 yards to make it 24-0 as Theis­mann hit Gatewood with a seven-yard flip. At :57 of the second quarter: ••(evenly) After 7½ innings, the score remains 1\1ets one, Baltimore four/' At :18 of the second quarter: "'( evenly again) At the end of eight, Baltimore iour, 1\1els one. 
Notre Dame's second offensive unit appeared at 6:29 of the third period and got the final pair of scores. Army, meanwhile, waited until 4:04 of the third period before crossing into ~TJ) territory. 
Oh yes, and the Mets-Orioles final score never was announced.

By· the Width of the Crossbar 
We beat Army the best wa)' possible. We moved the 
ball and scored on offense; the defense got a shutout and 
the entire bench played at least two quarters. Now, 
Southern Cal! 
We are one Saturday away from finishing up the first 
half of our season. We have weathered some serious in­
juries and have still shown continuous progress. Southern 
California is perhaps the best skilled, fastest, and overall­
sized team we have thus far faced. 
As Notre Dame, we cannot ever play a fiat game and 
it also follows that we cannot forever play "skJ' high" 
games. But this one ... just this one, will call for that 
kind of thing. Our players know it and sense it. The feel­
ing has permeated our entire week of practice. It has 
not been a loud, bustling, electric week, but one of quiet 
resolve ... a more sophisticated control of emotions lest 
any should escaj1e at the wrong time. The time for emo­
tion is Saturday on the field for the 60 minutes of ''in­
fiamed effort we must give to win this one.'' 
_ There. ~s _L?.!l ageless line that I recall that says, "The 
heart knows a reason that reason knoweth not." 
Reason would favor Southern Cal for individual J1laJ'­
ers' size, for their sj1eed, for their skills and record. In 
11l)' heart and in the hearts of our players, there seems a 
growing awareness that none of this counts when the 
whistle blows. It will have to be that kind of attitude .. . 
that kind of suj1erbly oriented will, that kind of team . .. . 
22 in number . . . but one in mind and desire to beat 
Southern Cal. 
We respect S.C. ... we do not fear them. Our players, whatever the outcome of this game, will give an account of themselves that will swell man)' Notre Dame hearts with Jnide. I know this before the fact. If we pull it off it will be Ara's finest work of art . . . and there have been manJ'· He's naturallJ' engineered our strategy; he's built a sense of urgency in the staff and plaJ,ers and, lastl)', he has led us to the point where we are of one mind: Beating Southern Cal. 
Game 5 

ND 14, Southern Cal 14 
NOTRE DAME Stadium can keep a secret with the best of them. For three hours on a Saturday afternoon, she plays host to violent drama. But 30 minutes after the final curtain, she is nearly mute, nearly empty-revealing nothing, awaiting the next performance. 
The turf is slightly scarred. There is the scooping skid mark of a halfback who missed his cut; there is the lush divot of a split end who struggled to keep both feet in bounds. Did the halfback regain his balance; did the split end have full possession before he crossed the sideline? 
Half an hour after the last whistle, Notre Dame Stadium 
will not tell. 
There is music to accompany this post-game tour. It 
is the eerie tintinabulation of empty beverage cans, drop­
ping and rolling, dropping and rolling-from row 4 7 to 
row 46 to row 45 ... Were their contents drunk joyously 
by an elated fan? Or were the contents employed by a 
spectator who wished to numb his despondent feelings? 
Television cables lie in a heap, partially covered by 
a canvas tarpaulin. vVhat pictures did they transmit ? 
Through the glass facade of the press box, intent little 
faces are visible. ,vhat words do these men write? 
Notre Dame Stadium was her usual clandestine 
self at 4:57 p.m. on October 18. Well, almost. She was 
showing all the expected half-clues ... and one more. 

The north goalpost was whispering a critical secret to the scrutinizing observer. All over, the steel frame was glazed with a fine layer of clinging dust. All over, except for one spot. On the crossbar, about one yard to the right of center, the orange paint was wiped clean. But not completely. There were small marks, dimple marks, marks which suggested that someone had attempted a long placekick of, say, 48 yards and the ball had actually struck the crossbar. 
IT rs 
A curious psychological study, the way coaches and their athletes react to a tie football game. 
Ara Parseghian sat in front of his locker, head down, drained limp. He snatched a towel from his shoulder and thrust it to the floor. Then, moments later, he rose from the stool and conceded, "I'm really not too disappointed." 
Mike McCoy, the moving mountain who had set up Notre Dame's tying score ,,.rith a blocked punt, answered in terse sentence fragments. He wiped, spasmodically, at his red eyes. He wanted fiercely to escape the ques­tioners, to reach the shower and let it all wash off. 
Dewey Poskon talked-freely; Joe Theismann said little, dressed quickly and disappeared. Scott Hempel spoke quietly, yet completely, of his 48-yard, near-miss field goal effort. 
Southern Cal coach John McKay hid his emotions well. His powder-blue was almost unwrinkled, his gray hair groomed and in place. He drew lazily on a panatella cigar and stated, very calmly, that he was not satisfied \\rith the deadlock. McKay nearly lost his cool, though, on a slip of the tongue. "Jimmy Jones (SC quarterback) seemed to be bothered by Notre Dame's defense, but it wasn't his fault we lost." What? Lost? His interviewers demanded an explanation. McKay took a Iona-drao-this
• t:> t:> 

time, blew it all back out and said , "When we t:>rret on the practice field Monday, these players will think it was a Joss." 
The Trojans felt more or less similarly. Defensive en? Jim Gunn offered limited praise for the Irish, re­ceiver Sam Dickerson cursed South Bend's weather and Tyrone Hudson, who made a vital interception in the 
The Scholastic 

fourth period, said, "I don't feel like talking." 
To Parseghian fell the task of an accurate summary. He used just seven words: "It was a hell of a game." 
SOUTHERN CAL threatened to score on each of its first two series. SC accepted the opening kickoff and moved 69 yards in 15 plays to the Irish 8 yardline. There, on first-and-10, Trojan fullback Charlie Evans slanted toward a huge vacancy off right tackle. Jones' handoff was short, however, meeting Evans on his hip, rather than in his stomach. The ball bounced free and ND linebacker Larry Schumacher recovered at the 7. 
Minutes hence, Southern Cal had returned and, on third-and-seven from the Irish 15, tailback Clarence Davis ran left end for a touchdown. But Trojan center Bill Redding was detected holding linebacker Tim Kelly, nullifying the TD and pushing Southern Cal out of field-goal range. (Monday after the game, McKay com­mented, "Our film shows no holding. Redding was flat on his back throughout the entire play.") 
Southern Cal had much the best of first-half field position, but couldn't capitalize. The Trojans entered Irish territory five different times during the first 30 minutes; Notre Dame's deepest penetration was the SC 
49. ND started seven of its nine series inside the 25 yard­line. First half total offense was 35 yards for Notre Dame. 
"I said nothing to them (his team) at halftime," :McKay noted. "v\That was there to say?" Meanwhile, across the tunnel, Irish coaches Jerry vVampfler and Tom Pagna were adjusting blocking assignments. Imme­diately, their work returned a seven-point dividend. 
Notre Dame opened the third quarter by blasting out 74 yards in 11 plays. Touchdown. But Southern Cal reciprocated with a 10-play, 75-yard journey. 7-7. 
As the final period opened, ND needed eight yards on third down from its 29. Theismann called a sideline­comeback to Ed Ziegler, who flanked left. Ziegler ran the sideline part okay, but he failed to come back toward Theismann. vVorse, Joe's throw was late. Hudson, the unspeaking defensive back, stepped inside Ziegler at the 40, made an easy reception and returned to the Irish 15. 
Two plays later, Dickerson, who voiced a distaste for the damp, 53-degree weather, took a Jones aerial in the left corner of the end zone. 14-7. 
Now the Irish attack reappeared, scrimmaging at its 22 after the kickoff, then streaking 61 yards in five plays. First-and-goal at the SC 7. But Southern Cal repulsed two rushes and reacted well to the flat pass. Fourth-and­goal at the 3. 
Theismann called time and got a play from the side­line. Communication broke somewhere, however, because the line blocked right while Joe was rolling left. Gunn sacked Theismann for a 15-yard loss. 
Unable to regain their offensive continuity, the Tro­jans punted on fourth down at their 33. Notre Dame had granted itself a good chance of spearing an SC kick because John Young is a rather slow, three-step punter. Desperate now, the Irish put on their first punt-block of the afternoon. 
Frankly, :McCoy was not supposed to get the ball. Mike aligned himself in the gap between center Redding and right guard Steve Lehmer (Fig. 5). Head-on was halfback Mike Berry and, behind him, fullback Evans. The blackboard diagram ,rnuld show :McCoy bursting through the line and flattening Berry. All of which creates a fine opening for linebacker Kelly, who would accost Evans, hopefully, with help from the other side. Kelly certainly would have made the block, except for one unanticipated factor-:McCoy beat him to the ball! 
Mike caught it on his face mask. The pigskin hopped crazily to the Trojan 7, where Notre Dame too~ posses­sion on downs. Southern Cal's defense did not succumb easily. But, on fourth-and-goal from six inches, Larry DiNardo, Jim Reilly and Tom Gatewood sealed off the left side as halfback Denny Allan plunged across. 
Clearly, momentum had shifted to the Irish. Again. SC could not sustain a drive and Young, hurrying this time, punted only 22 yards to the ND 44. 
Notre Dame scrapped to the enemy 14 yardline before a clipping penalty (see pages 18-19) returned it to the 
40. From there, Theismann hit split end Gate\vood

;... 

The climactic moment of Notre Dame's 1969 football sea­~on came with approximately three minutes left to play m the Southern California game. Struggling to break a 14-14 tie, the Irish had third-and-four at the Trojan 30 yardline. A first down at this point may have led to six points. At least, it would have given Scott Hempel /\I a solid shot at a game-winning field goal. Quarterback Joe Theismann (7) ordered a flat pass to fullback Bill Barz (33). Theismann rolled right, but both Barz and 
\ I 

split end Tom Gatewood (44) were covered well. Tight end Dewey Poskon ( 80) , however, was open over the 
\

middle; Theismann failed to spot him. Joe saw hims~lf contained and circled to the left side. Simultaneouslv. \ Poskon cut back, hoping to throw a peel-block. Southe1:n \ \ Cal defensive end Jim Gunn ( 83) had not penetrated \ \

the line of scrimmage. At the snap of the ball, Gunn saw Theismann roll to the opposite side and he clrifLc.,cI into the secondary. Gunn. like Poskon, reacted to Jo::'s scramble. Dewey met Jimmy at the 25 yardline and head linesman William :Makepeac:: charged Poskon \\~th clipping. Theismann hustled to the 14, but I\TJ) was penalized back to the 40. At left are photos printed from the Notre Dame game film. Judge them, then notice. below, the participants' comments. 

Ara Parseghian 


"It was a legal block, not a clip. It came from a lateral angle. Gunn slipped just as Dewey went to block him. Dewey landed on top, but that doesn't make it illegal." 
Dewey Poskon 


"I hit him a good clean shot. When the play was over, I looked up and saw flags lying all over the ground. I couldn't be­lieve it! I'll tell you what I think hap­pened: He buckled just before I hit him, so I landed on top. The referee probably didn't see the contact, but when he saw Gunn underneath me, he called it a clip.:' 
Dec. 5, 1969 
John wicKay 
"After viewing our films, it appears to me that Gunn turned to follow the play and was hit squarely in the back. It ·was a good call." 

Jim 
Gunn 
"Theismann was running around in the backfield and I was just trying to prevent him from getting the sideline on my end. He cut inside and somebody hit me from behind. No, I wasn't surprised when flags went down. I never saw Poskon cor,ning. Of course, he'll say it was a good block. He made a bad play and it cost his team a lot." 

for nine vards. resulting in fourth-and-five at the Trojan 
31. Slightly ~ore tha~-two minutes remained. Kicker Scott Hempel picks up the tale: 
"All during the driw: guys were coming O\·er to me saying: 'Relax, take it easy, keep your head down.' \\'hen the time came, Coach Parseghian turned to me and said: 'Let's try it.' Forty-eight yards is the longest field goal I\·e e\·er tried in a !!ame. I don:t think we would 
~ ~ 

have gone for it if the wind weren:t behind us. 
"~fy first thought \\·as the wind. I aimed for the right pole and the \\·ind brought it back into the middle. Joe (Theismann, jumped up and grabbed me around the neck. He said. 'We got it. I think we got it.' 
. ...... ...,, 
·'Then it dropped, like a rock. ~faybe it got into an air pocket or something." 
When the ball rebounded from the crossbar, Hempel slumped to his knees and clasped his helmet with both hands. Theismann took three steps toward the bench, 
· then kicked disgustedly at the ground. Scott, who had been booed from the XD student section as he jogged onfield, departed to soaring applause. At the sideline, Pagna was first to greet him. Hempel shrugged and ges­tured with open palms. \\"hat had he said? "He didn't say anything:" Pagna related. "I told him it ·was a hell of an effort. If there's any justice for last year ( ,•,hen Hempel missed a 38-yard field goal to beat SC), this \\·as it." 
I:---THE ultimate analysis, it was superb coaching \\·hich made Xotre Dame equal to America's No. 3 college football team. Pagna and \\"ampfler had altered block­ing assignments at halftime, Joe Yonto had spotted Young's punting tardiness on film and Paul Shoults had prevented a Trojan bmnb with one brilliant, daring mon. 
In 1968, Southern Cal's Steve Sogge completed 17 of 28 passes for 187 yards and tied the game 21-21 with a 40-yard strike to Dickerson in the final quarter. 
This year, Sogge was gone, but all the receivers were back. Not to be burned again, Shoults surprised the Trojans by moving speedy soph Clarence Ellis from safety to halfback. Ellis drew Southern Cal's best wide receiver on each play. Ralph Stepaniak manned the opposite corner and John Gasser, formerly a halfback, became the safety. 
Shoults' concoction worked beautifully. Jones was limited to 11 completions in 34 tries (the longest only 18 yards) for 116 yards. Shoults was sufficiently convinced to retain the new system for the rest of 1969. 
"That was a good move/' McKay frowned. "Not to be derogatory, but we thought we could take advantage of 46 (Gasser) on the corner. He sure learned his new position fast, thougr.. That long pass to Chandler ( a bomb from Jones to flanker Bob Chandlermidv-:ay through the last period) was corning right at me and I thought sure he had it, but 46 made a great play.'' 
McKay leaned back, flicked off a cigar ash and cocked his head pensively. "There \\'ere a lot of !!feat plavs

Surfing a Green WaVe 
Tomorrow we will be fiying down to New Orleans to play our first night game against Tulane's Green Wave. 
I don't know whether I am more worried about us or Tulane. They are a quick, light team but similar to Arm11. They overcame a 22-point deficit to pull out a 26-22 win over Pittsburgh. Prior to that, Tulane played Florida to a 17-18 game which was decided on a last­minute bomb. They have several advantageous factors going for them. ·while we practice in mid-30-degree tem­perature, Tulane has the warm, humid air they are accustomed to. It is a night game, which takes a little adjusting, and they are in their back yards. In the South, .:oe are more apt to encozi.nter a hostile crowd. 
All of these things are surf ace items that don't con­cern the coaching staff as much as other factors. Our players, naturally enough, feel an emotional letdown as a result of a really tremendous output versus Southern Cal. 
Our offense did not perform up to our expectations. Ara sensed the doldrums and gave a ".1\1onday off" order at the beginning of this week. But Tuesday found the offense again stiff, tired and more lethargic. As much as he fears injuries, Ara called for contact on Tuesday and Wednesday just to shake them up from their apathetic state. Wednesday was much improved. Tulane will at­tempt to make their season at our expense. J,Ve must not falter. At this point, we must forego the luxury of relaxa­tion for winning ways are not lukewarm or cold ... the1

are for ever on fire. 
Game 6 

ND 37, Tulane 0 
IN the aftermath of Southern California, team frustra­tion was so intense that, on :Monday, one ND player sighed, "'·\Tell, you might as well say the season's over now·." 
Two days later, South Bend had its first snowfall. Not more than a few flakes, but some saw it as an omen. Notre Dame had known last spring that its 1969 cam­paign was split in two. The Irish who tied Southern Cal were not the same guys who were crushed by Purdue. But they could not prove it against five remaining foes whose combined record at this point was 8-17. On Wednesday of Tulane week, precisely at mid-season, autumn turned to winter at Notre Dame. 
Saturday night in the Sugar Bowl, though, it was summer again-partly cloudy, 70 degrees, warm breeze. 
FOR NEARLY the entire first period, ND squirmed and struggled to untrack itself. Twice, Notre Dame punted to Tulane. On their third series, the Irish faced a third­and-six dilemma at the ND 31. Quarterback Joe Theis­mann called a flat pass to fullback Bill Barz, a play they had worked with spectacular success to date. 
Theismann faked to halfback Ed Ziegler and rolled right as Barz slipped into the flat. But Green Wave 
Dec. 5, 1969 
linebacker Rick Kingrea had Barz locked up tight. Theis­mann continued to scramble, but there were not.six yards to be made at the right sideline. 
Meanwhile, on the opposite side of the field, tight end Dewey Poskon was lying flat on his back. Poskon had thrown a block on 'Wave defensive end Bryan Duck. Now, as the entire Tulane defense pursued Theismann, Dewey got off the turf, hitched up his pants and floated downfield-unaccompanied. Theismann spotted Poskon's flailing arms and zipped it across field. Result: A 27­yard gain to the enemy 32. 
The ·wave broke. From there. it was Barz for 13, Denny Allan for eight, Bar.t: for t~vo, Ziegler for seven, Ziegler for two and a touchdown. 
Period No. 2 was more of same. ~fike McCoy forced a Tulane fumble and Bob Olson, his partner-in-destruc­tion, recovered 28 yards from paydirt. Five rushing plays later, it was 14-0. Notre Dame traveled 69 yards for its third score. Clarence Ellis intercepted a Tulane aerial, putting Scott Hempel in shape for a 33-yard field goal just before halftime. 24-0. 
E,\RLY 
in the final period, there came the season's most curious play. It was second-and-six at the Tulane 27. ·wave fullback Jack Laborde hit left tackle where he was stopped for no gain by ND's Mike Zikas. The play had been whistled dead a full two seconds when quarter­back Dave Abercrombie unloaded a vicious block on Irish linebacker John Raterman, who was standing ,..-ith hands on hips, watching Laborde and Zikas 1inpile. 
Co-captain Olson walked over toward Raterman, who still hadn't made a move against Abercrombie. Then, inexplicably, Tulane center Chip DevVitt jumped on Olson's back and wrapped a right forearm around Bobo's neck. Flags went down. The officials saw it. B-B-B-But ... but, but wh-wh-what's this? They're marching off 15 yards against Notre Dame! 
Referee Donald Orr jogged over to the Irish bench. ostensibly to clarify his call. Orr arrived at the sideline and a Notre Dame assistant immediately opined that he (Orr) had made an improper judgment. vVhereupon, Orr blew the sixth personal foul of the night and awarded Tulane another 15 yards. 
That was only preliminary action, however. After the game, Ara decreed no curfew and turned his team loose on poor, defenseless New Orleans. How did they respond? vVell, suffice it to say that some of the boys weren't back to the hotel in time for breakfast Sunday mornmg.

Yards~ Yeah, Yards 

With the sojJhisticated intelligence of ,,oung men to­day, there is only one avenue of approach that Ara has ever used. It is a straightf01ward, truthful, "tell it like it is'' type of situation. Tulane was not on a par with other teams such as Southern Cal, 1\1ichigan State, etc. Still, they played a fiery contest. The disturbing part of the Tulane game is that we were penalized 85 'yards ... almost the equivalent of our total in the first five games. T11e honestlJ' felt there were some very /Joor calls and that, in fact, many tactics were overlooked and not called at all. All of that being what it is, we did. win, although 
we dislike ever to be branded with high-penalt)' frequency. 
Ara has said of our next opponent that they have not been winning, they are having a down ,,ear, but they did upset and shut out Virginia 10-0 last week. The11 again come to South Bend with high sJJirits, expectations and plans. I seriously doubt if we will be able to get really up for this one. J,Ve really don't exjJect to. This is not out of disrespect for an opponent. It is because, as much as we dislike the atab/' this is a game that we should be able to win. !'o tell our young men otherwise is to deal in clzeaj, tactics. They understand that we are favored, but that this only means we must perform capabl)' .. . not relaxed ... not up in the clouds ... just work .. . defend ... score ... and win it. Somehow the word "bowl'' fills the rumor circles. We must fight off looking beyond one game at a time and take each team in its tum. 
We really feel we have steadily progressed and our players are aware of ·this solid feeling. Bring on Navy!

Game 6 
ND 47, Navy 0 
THIS Naval psychology was beginning to follow a pattern. 
In 1967, prior to the Irish-Middie game in ND Sta­dium, Navy coach Bill Elias proclaimed his signal-caller, John Cartwright, "the best college quarterback in the country." 
Ara Parseghian quoted Elias at Friday's pep rally and the faithful r~sponded with "Terry, Terry, Terry, Terry, Terry. Coley, Coley, Coley, Coley, Coley. Belden, Belden, Belden, Belden, Belden." 
Sixty-minute comparisons are unfair because Han­ratty played the first two quarters, O'Brien handled most of the second half and Belden quarterbacked only one series of downs. 
FIRST HALF 
Att. Comp. Yards Int. TD Tot.Off. 
Hanratty 14 8 149 0 1 153 
Cartwright 12 4 34 1 0 61 
SECOND HALF Cartwright 14 6 75 0 0 108 O'Brien .J n 1 47 0 0 87 Belden 0 0 0 0 0 17 
GAME Cartwright 26 10 109 1 0 169 Irish QBs 17 9 196 0 1 257 
In 1969, the new Navy coach was Rick Forzano, a more respectful fellow than Elias. His pre-game appraisal: "I've been watching the Notre Dame-Southern California film and that's the greatest collection of talent I've ever seen on a college football field. We'd have to play five to 10 times above our capabilities and Notre Dame would have to be sub-par for us to win:' 

There was a brazen statr:sman on the '69 squad, though. He was Karl Schwelm, a tight end whose big moment had come two weeks earlier when he dropped a game-winning TD pass against Rutgers. 
Perhaps to atone for that debacle, Schwelm announced that teammate Mike McNallen "is one of the five best quarterbacks in college football." 
It was a prodigious statement-ranking right up there with George \.Yallace's "I will be your next president," Hitler's "\i\7hy can't we invade Russia?" and Sonny Liston's "I'll kill that kid Clay." 
Again this year, Notre Dame divided the quarter­backing among three players. Post-game stats looked strangely familiar: 
Att. Comp. Yards Int. TD Tot.Off. 
Theismann 7 3 123 0 1 192 Etter 1 0 0 0 0 140 Gores 0 0 0 0 0 0 Irish QBs 8 J n 123 0 1 332 McNallen 31 11 74 3 0 66 
In other phases of the game, the contrast was about as vivid. Notre Dame stacked up 720 yards in total offense (an all-time ND record), to Navy's 93. 
NAVY's deepest penetration came four plays after the opening kickoff as Middie tackle Mike Simpson fell on a Denny Allan fumble at the Irish 19. McNallen moved his team one yard in three downs, then spotted the ball as kicker Jack Detweiler missed a 33-yard field goal. Notre Dame got its first score on a "lope-and-go" pass pattern installed especially for this game. On second and six from the enemy 35, ND split Tom Gatewood left and kept three backs in. Gatewood got single cov­erage from Navy cornerback Dave \•Valla. Theismann made a fine play-action fake to Ed Ziegler who rammed left tackle, running directly at ·walla. Gatewood loped into the secondary, pretending to be out of the play. Walla came up a step to defense the run. But, suddenly, 
Theismann had the ball and Gatewood ,vas nmmng a deep post. 7-0. The other six Irish scores were slightly less spectacular_ Three were notable: 
-Reserve quarterback Bill Etter ripped off ?\TD's. longest play of the year, a well-blocked 79-yard jaunL -Theismann dived theatrically into the end zone to 
complete a 46-yard rollout. 
-Theismann rambled 18 yards on a broken play, fumbled on the goal line and watched Allan recover in the end zone. · 
Otherwise, there was nothing more than brutal foot­ball to entertain Homecoming fans. ND's offensive line, averaging 247 pounds from tackle to tight end, easily· manipulated a Navy defensive front which went only 196 pounds per man. 
Forzano summarized it well: "If we had to prepare for this game all over again, the only thing we could do is give our kids sp~ed pills and power pills. It could have been worse than it was out there today. They had women and children ip. there the fourth quarter; Par­seghian's a class guy. Notre Dame, Texas and Penn State are all No. 2 in the country, right behind Ohio State.'~ 
University of Pittsburgh coach Bob Timmons, scout­ing the game, said, "I;d say Notre Dame is three times as strong as Syracuse. Notre Dame's second team kicked the pants off Navy, and it wasn't even a ball game until they put in their third team." 
One Irish player said flatly, "They ( the Middies) aren't even a good high school team." 
As for Karl Schweim, well, Karl still wasn't convinced_ Slumped in front of his locker, peeling tape off his calves,. Karl vowed, "I really meant it when I said :Mci'fallen is one of the best five quarterbacks in the country. No:, I don't think Theismann and Etter are in the same class with him." 
If that statement be true, then Karl Schweim is the top tight end in America. 
Poskon, Poskon, Poskon, Poskon, Poskon. Lawson, Lawson, Lawson, Lawson, Lawson. "Williams, ·Williams, Williams, Williams, ·williams. 
A sideline vantage point is always interesting. "Touchdown Jesus'' peers through Stadium's north gate.

Hello, This 1S Tokyo Joe 
If there is any truth to the adage that ''you never 
have to worry about a worrier/' we should win over Pitt. 
Frankl)\ they worry me. The)' have equal size and, in 
some places, more speed; they have picked up momentum 
and have echoed high feelings to a large Pitt crowd of 
an upset. None o.f this is any different than our weekly 
agenda, except we are now receiving the late-season 
''nicks" of injury that riddle football teams. . 
Larry DiNardo, who has been a tremendous offensive 
guard, has suffered muscle tear in his lower right leg; 
Terr')' Brennan at offensive right tackle is bruised and 
sore from his shoulder region. Dewey Poskon has a more 
serious case of this malad)' usually prevalent in offensive 
linemen. Poskon might miss the last three games and is 
definitely out for Pitt. On defense, Tim Kell)' is ques­
tionable with a bruised shoulder. 
J,Ve must play Pitt without the fumbles of our Navy game and our near-com/1/acent first-quarter performance. 
The defense has two shutouts in a row and will be 
trying hard for its third. But Pitt's offense has consid­
erable balance and will surely test them. 
Offensively, it will not be a game in which we can bowl J1eoj1le over. Their size and st),le do not allow it. Carl DePasqua, Pitt's new coach, has engineered a gam­bling-tyj1e defense. You can look pretty bad on most J;lays because of their continual blitzing, but, by the same strategy, you allow yourself to get "burned" on a big play. I hojJe we can get enough of that kind. 
Pitt, having just beaten Syracuse, will not be easy. Winning the game will be imJ1ortant as all games are, but more imJ1ortant is that we have struggled hard to imJ1rove since our early-season loss to Purdue and tie with Southern Cal. All o.f the progress drains away unless we continue to win. 
Game 8 

ND 49, Pittsburgh 7 
Through the cardboard-thin wall of Pitt Stadium's press box boomed a large voice, speaking the words of a combination radio broadcaster-irate fan. 
The voice belonged to Notre Dame assistant coach Joe Yonto, known to his players as "Tokyo Joe." Yonto is as much a football specialist as the barefoot kicker or the punt returner. Each Saturday, he and fell ow-coach "\-\7ally Moore "spot" the opponent for Ara Parseghian and staff. 
Yonto's task, specifically, is to tell the bench: 
1. 
Just what the hell's going on. (A sideline view 1s that bad.) 

2. 
Offensive plays which might beat the opponent and defensive variations which might confuse him. 


But Yonto does a little more. He spices the com­mentary with laughter, exhortations, mild profanities, criticism, etc. Here is a sample of "Yonto-ese" during Notre Dame's 49-7 romp over Pittsburgh.. 
FIRST QUARTER 
(As ND drives to its first touchdown, Yonto tries to establish the position of Pitt rover back Geoff Brown, number 47.) "47's not sure where he's going, but he's the guy to watch. Our fom1ations have him screwed up. He doesn't know where to go. . . . (On first-and-goal for ND at the Pitt 8 yardline.) Anything outside is going to go, 'cause they're just pinching like hell on short yard­age.... Okay, okay, four-yard gain. "\-\7e're on the 4, second down. Anything outside." (Denny Allan sweeps left end to give the Irish a 7 -0 lead.) 
(Panther Dave Garnett returns the kickoff 16 yards to the 28.) "Okay, let's go gang. Get him, get him, get him. Oooo, he almost got away. . . . (Freidl rolls right and hits wingback Steve Moyer.) Oh Patulski, my God. Patulski got cut down with a roll block and the quarter­back just rolled to his side.... (Tight end Bill Pilconis takes a seven-yard flip from Freid!.) Check that delay to the tight end. They're sending the halfback out to tie up our linebacker and then the tight end is delaying over the middle. They're going with the short outs and they're picking us up. And our ends are getting chopped like nothin'.... (Notre Dame holds Pitt on the Irish 5 yardline.) Okay, okay, but we gotta pick 'em up in the front line. Both ends are just sittin' there. They're terrible, just walking through the motions." 

(Pitt moves into a six-man defensive line on first-and­10 for the Irish at their 5.) "Blitz is comin'. Yeah, you could really see it. Anything outside is gonna go. Looks like they're in free safety. . . . Okay, third-and-one. (Denny Allan gets the first down.) He got it. Okay. ... It's a five-man front now. Oklahoma defense. (Bill Barz bursts through right tackle for 13 yards.) Oh, one more guy and he'd have been gone. Is 47 in there? I can't find him.... (Theismann keeps for no gain.) Run it, Joe. Oh, he had a man wide open down there.... (Tom Gatewood takes a Theismann pass 29 yards for Notre Dame's second score.) Go, Tom, go. He's in, he's in. Great job, great job.... 
"Are they alert for the return? Do they know which side? (Once again, Pitt's Garnett nearly breaks a kickoff return.) Get him, get him. Oh. Look out. God bless it. Looked like he was going to go again.... (Fe1Tis gets five yards at left tackle.) Oh, gees. Just a simple dive play and they get five yards. Kadish was knocked down and Swede overran him. Damn it. They're asleep, George. They're going through the motions.... (Pitt nearly com­pletes another tight end-delay pass.) There's the same thing again. You see that 22 goin' down? Okay, then the tight end is comin' across behind him. (Pitt con­tinues to drive and Y onto suggests a change in defense.) What's the matter with triple-free zone? Huh? 1-Vhy don't we go to triple-free? They know we're in man. They're gonna pick us apart all day. (Pitt split end George Medich takes a 35-yard pass from Freid!.) He (Medich) just went straight upfield. Put in a substitute for Stepaniak.... Second-and-five.... Just a fullback toss. We gotta wake up.... Same thing outside. '\,Ve better wake up or we're gonna be defeated. Sure. We're 
The Scholastic 

gidn' them momentum. vVe think all we gotta do is walk on the field. No, they're just walkin' out there.... (Pitt scores to make it 14-7.) \,Ye gotta get awake. We come off that field with our heads hangin'. \,Ye don't have any fire at all. Somebody get 'em together down there. Paul (Coach Paul Shoults) or somebody. They look like stray sheep. Patulski looks like a weak sister over there. ·what the hell's the matter? Our defense just psyched them into a helluva game. \Ve caused all this momentum for them." 
SECOND QUARTER (Notre Dame marches again.) "Six-one defense, but nobody's catching the middle backer.... (Theismann finds Huff with a 10-yard pass on fourth-and-five from the Pitt 18.) Oh, what a throw. All you have to do is roll with them." (Huff's next reception makes it 21-7). Beautiful, beautiful. (On the ensuing kickoff, Irish linebacker Eric Patton narrowly misses a sensational tackle.) "Come on, come on. Oh, hotshot Patton missed him at the 15...." (On first down, Freidl's pass is intercepted by ND linebacker John Raterman.) "Good catch by Raterman. That was a waggle to northern side and they tried to throw to the second receiver. ·waggle-throw back is what it was. (\•Vaggle means roll-out. Northern is the far side of the .field, as seen from ND's bench; southern is the near side.) \Ve got that waggle covered? It looked like their back might have been open, but the ball was underthrown. Tell Stepaniak." (Notre Dame returns to the attack as Allan circles right end for eight yards.) "Looks like anything outside is going to get yards for us. You notice how they're cover­ing Gatewood? Yeah, awful close. I think he could have 

been gone that time.... (Ziegler hits right end for seven yards.) If what's his name, 56, DiNardo-if he'd have gotten a block down.field, Ziegler would have been in. . . . ( Allan slants over left tackle and barely crosses the plane of the goal line to make it 28-7.) He's over. Yeah, he's over. Come on, let's bust their back. And watch that return, George (speaking to coach George Kelly). NO\v there's 3:29 to halftime. Tell them to be alert for the bomb and watch for screens.... (Chuck Zloch misses a tackle on the kickoff return.) Oh Zloch, my God. Zloch should have had him at the 12 and missed him." 
(Pitt shows a spread formation on first down.) "Double wing. He's gonna go double wing and bomb, George. V{e better go to triple-free. Triple-free zone. ... Rollin' right, rollin' right. That's it. Oh, he lost him. Swede lost him. Kick him in the fanny. That's ridicu­lous.... (Pitt lines up in punt fom1ation on fourth down. but kicker Da\·e McGrath throws a pass. Irish linebacker Jim ·wright has a clear shot at an interception at the Panther 45, but drops the ball. Thus, ~TJ) takes over on downs at the enemy 26.) Smart play. Attaboy. That's the smartest play I've seen all year. Hey George, you got everything? I'm comin' down." 
THIRD QUARTER (Pitt continues to hm·e success with trap plays.) "Trap. Right over :McCoy. Tell :Mike they're splitting the guard and then they're going with the trap. Tell him to shut that trap off.... (Now the defense responds as Clarence Ellis drops Ferris for a three-yard loss.) Good job of turning it in by Ellis. Very well played. (On third-and-10, Bobo Olson sacks Pitt QB Frank Gus­tine for a six-yard deficit.) Olson. Set up by Patulski. Patulski flushed him. But when they come off, kick Swendsen in the fanny and kick Patulski in the fanny." 
FOURTH QUARTER (The victory assured, Yonto lights a cigar and be­seeches a fan.) "Hey buddy, hey buddy. ·would you go. over and get us four hot dogs? Here. Thanks.

(Yonto addresses himself to Pitt return specialist Charlie Hall.) Go ahead, pick it up and fumble it, buddy." (Yonto and :Moore are less talkati\·e as Notre Dame runs out the clock. Late in the final period, wfoore is heard to say, "vVhat? I don't know. I can't see. This cigar smoke is killin' me.")

Southern DisComfort 
We will be pla,ying Georgia Tech late Saturday night: 
9:30 011 national television. Some of our players have minor colds: are visibly tired from the long haul and are playing at weights nearly 10 to 15 pounds lighter than at the season's start. 
H1e are two games away from having a reall'y standout Jear. J,Ve definitelJ' have improved, but dare not let up now. 
The recruiting season and tons of correspondence are starting to mount up. Each coach is receiving names from interested people who obviously know talent when they see it. Some of the descriptions used are actually fmm,,: "This boy is a must"; "this one is more powerful than--"; "He:s 6-6, 220 J1ou11ds and an honor student who wants to become a J1riest ... but he's really mean on the field . .. and he's my 11ej1hew ... and I lie a little when Tm excited.'' 
Still, we try to hold off those things of tomorrow until today's chorns are finished. 
Game 9 


ND 38, Georgia Tech 20 
GEORGIA TECH week was replete with action -both in South Bend and in Atlanta. Bowl-fever was cresting and Irish players began to suspect that Ara knew something. Said one, "He ( Parseghian) was laughing and telling jokes on 1fonday. Then on Tuesday, he kept us out there ( with snow on the ground) over two hours for a 'live' scrimmage. Nobody else in the country goes two hours or scrimmages this time of year. There must be a reason for it. I think there's a 60 to 70 per cent chance 
. we'll go to a bowl. Ara said we'll know one way or the other by Monday." 
Somewhere, the sun was shining, but certainly not in Tech-ville. The Yellowjackets' proud football heritage had been tarnished in the two years since Bud Carson became head coach. Now, ignominy of ignominies-a week before the ND invasion, Tech bowed 14-7 to Tulane. That decision set Carson's record at 11-17 and infuriated the student body. However, athletic director Bobby Dodd 
(who compiled a 165-64-8 mark in the 22 years preceding Carson's reign) dismissed the Tulane defeat and extended Bud's contract through 1970. 
NOTRE DAM:E's defense took command very early, re­covering two fumbles and intercepting four passes in the first half. Three of the pass thefts turned into big gainers -Clarence Ellis went 70 yards for a touchdown, John Gasser set up a field goal with his 57-yard return and Ralph Stepaniak sailed 51 yards after his second swipe of the game. Teeh countered with a 100-yard, interception­return touchdown by Bill Ford. ND led 31-6 at halftime. 
The Irish relaxed after intermission, but Tech fans 

were just gaining momentum. Notre Dame's bench was 
directly in front of the Tech students. They hurled un­
opened cans of Coke, whisky bottles, cardboard squares> 
dead fish and tightly packed cups of ice. 

Moments after the game ended, Parseghian was con­fronted by Tash Van Dora; a senior ·wrecker back who has played little this year after lettering in both his sophomore and junior seasons. "I had just shaken Ara's hand and we weren't five yards onto the field when this kid came running over," coach George Kelly recalls. "I didn't know if he was going to hit Ara or not, but I grabbed his shoulder and spun him around." Parseghian continued to walk away as Van Dora cut loose a streak of "the dirtiest language I've ever heard on a football field," in Ara's words. 
"Tash has apologized to Coach Carson and offered to write a letter to Coach Parseghian, if necessary," said Dodd. As in most cases of this type, there are two sides to the story. We have fairly good evidence from our players that the Notre Dame coaches were making a few speeches of their own to our boys. ( Shoults and Kelly vigorously deny this statement.) But I'm not making any accusa­tions. I think it's in very bad taste to come back and say, 'Notre Dame was guilty; too.' ,ve know we're wrong and we apologize.'' 
Dodd said Van Dora and his classmates may have been irritated by Parseghian's strategy late in the contest. Leading 38-20, the Irish kept their first unit in, attempted to pass on seven of the game's final nine plays and twice called time out during that last drive. 
"I must say I resented it," Dodd revealed. "The man (Parseghian) obviously had us beat to a pulp. I know I never did such a thing in my 22 years as a head coach. But that's his business. I know he wanted a bowl bid, he was on national television, he has a jillion alumni to please in Atlanta and he wanted to be impressive in his victory over Georgia Tech." 
At Notre Dame, Dodd's letters were received and filed away. Kelly said, "We hurt them most with our class. They thought we'd come back with their type of tactics, but our guys showed great class under pressure. I do have one regret, though. Unfortunately, Van Dora is a senior and we will not have a chance to face him next year."

A Falcon Grounded 
Is A Thing Of Beauty 


QB Bob Parker searches ... . .. with Falcon-like calm. 
The bowl now being an actuality lends a psychological 
jJossibility of overlooking our next and last opponent, 
Air Force Academy. They are very skilled in the pass 
game and have the third-best record of any opponent we 
have played. As tired and drained as everyone gets at 
this stage of any season, we must rally for a last-ditch 
1;•ffort to maintain our winning ways. 
Ed Ziegler's knee probably will not allow play any 
more this year. Terry Brennan had knee surgery only 
•yesterday and Jim Reilly is questionable with a pinched shoulder nerve. Andy Huff is suffering from a similar bruise to his shoulder and may not see much action. And Dewey Poskon is still sidelined. 
Neither Ara nor the rest of the staff even dares men­tion the Cotton Bowl game. It is too far rem.oved and too dangerous to dwell on. fVe must, somehow-with "ingenuity," "player effort and morale"-put one last ef­fart together for the job we must get done against Air Force. 
If we can accomplish this task, our season will have great meaning. Our group of Notre Dame men will have overcome nmch adversity, an early loss, fantastic injuries, mounting pressure and inexperience. Regardless of what happens, we as a staff are truly proud of the rare and raw courage ... the sacrifice ... the heartwarming man­hood of each member of this Notre Dame team. And it is that . . . a true Notre Dame team! 
Game 10 

ND 13, Air Force 6 
"WITHOUT that one play, it could have been a dif­ferent ball game," suggested Air Force coach Ben Martin. 
"That one play" came early and lasted throughout the game-a 39-yard touchdown burst by Denny Allan at 12:57 of the first period. Credit Irish right guard Gary Kos and right tackle Chuck Kennedy with fine blocking at the point of attack, and split end Tom Gatewood with good interference downfield. Falcon linebackers Phil Bauman and Glen Leimbach had taken themselves out of the play by stunting outside. Once Allan popped the hole, he was into the secondary. "vVe never used that stunt the rest of the day," said :Martin. "They simply caught us in a technical error." 
From there, Notre Dame's badly crippled offense mustered only two fields goals, but the defense was plenty clutch. Irish turnovers gave the Falcons field position in I\TJ) territory five times. But Air Force, for the first time in two years, failed to score a touchdown. 
Premiere among Notre Dame's defensive e,fforts was a series late in the third period. Trailing 13-3, Air Force fell on an Ed Gulyas fumble at the l\TJ) 18 and moved to the 9 yardline on two downs. First Tim Kelly, on third­and-one, then Bob Neidert, on fourth-and-eight: slammed Falcon quarterback Bob Parker for losses back to the 24. 
SEASON-END relief had struck Joe Theismann as he slipped into a pair of blue bell-bottoms and related a no-no he had done to coach 1-Vally :Moore immediately after the game. 
"He was standing over there by the showers, talking to some friends. So I sneaked up from behind and poured Coke on his head. You should have seen him." 
Even as Theismann talked, Moore approached. 
"Hey, thanks, Joe," he said, patting his head. c'Thanks a lot." 
"Sorry, coach," Theismann laughed. 
''We better not go down to Dallas and play like _we did today. You proud of that?" "No sir, coach." "I'll tell you what I am proud of: 8-1-1. You proud of that?" 
"Yes, sir," said Joe Theismann. "Yes, sir. You bet."

Parseghian 
In the past six years, no coach has won more regular season college football games than Ara Parseghian. His record is an incredible 48-8-4. On pages 32 and 33, Mrs. Kathleen Parseghian talks about those six years in a story by Greg Stidham. On pages 29 and 30, Ara, himself, drops back a few yards to survey college football ... and suggests a few changes for Year No. 101. 
The Scholastic 
''A True Measurement 
I HAVE been paz·ticularly pleased with a number of rules which the NCAA has adopted in recent years. When the free substitution rule finally came, it gave us an opportunity to play platoon football. Now we can give more youngsters the chance to play a skill for which they're best suited. Free substitution has opened up the game. "\-Ve have higher scoring today than we've ever had. 
A more recent change, which re­
quires the clock to be stopped after 
each first clown, is another excellent 
rule because it has added immeasur­
ably to the time of the game as well 
as the number of plays. In 1968, we 
averaged more than 90 plays per 
game; we averaged almost 87 this 
year with a young, inexperienced of­
fensive football team. 
There are a couple things in foot­ball which I think bear consideration. One of them is what I tenn the "cheapest 20 yards in football." For example, Team A can drive from its own 20 yardline and move into Team B's four-down territory (inside the opponent's 40 yardline). In the event that Team A is stopped on the 35 yardline, the only way to score is by kicking a long field goal of ap­proximately 52 yards. Team A's other choice is to try what we call a "bunt punt"-pinning the opponent deep in its own territory by kicking within the 10 yardline and downing the ball. 
However, if this punt carries into the end zone, Team B benefits from what I call the "cheapest 20 yards in football." The ball moves out to the 20 yardline, first-and-10 for Team B. Statistics will reveal that Team A put together a 45-yard drive, but Team A's dominance is not reflected on the scoreboard. I would like to see the NCAA adopt a rule similar to the rouge which is employed in Canadian professional football. If Team A could punt the ball into the endzone, Team B would have to run it out without being tackled in the end zone, or else Team A would be given one point. This would add scoring to the game

and, possibly, serve as a tie-breaker in 
close games. 
I've also been concerned with the relative cheapness of a field goal. Many teams today have a boy with the particular skill to kick the ball as far as 55 or 60 yards for a field goal. Team A might work like the devil driving down the field for six points, while Team B can get three points merely by kicking the ball 50 yards over the heads of Team A's defenders. That is not really a tme measurement of the game. 
Challenge Bowl 
I HAVE tried to take a very realistic view on the possibility of determin­ing a tme National Champion in 
. ', ~ --. 
-~. 
;,,; .­
~ ~ v..."-·~ 
college football. A championship play­off is a very idealistic way of deter­mining which is the best team. Every conference would demand representa­tion· for its champion· and, very likely, there would be at least five major independents seeking spots in a cham­pionship playoff field. 
I am interested in l\vo innovations. First, I'd like to see a Challenge Bowl. This would pit the No. 1 and No. 2. teams in the country. It could be played in mid-December, two weeks after the concusion of the sea­son. Thus, it would not interfere with the traditional New Year's Day bowl games. 
Determining the teams to play in such a game could be done by poll or by computer. Say there were four or five unbeaten teams in a given year; computers could decide which two teams had the most difficult schedules. which team had the best offense ;md defense, etc. 

Secondly, I doubt very much that we'll ever han: a championship play­off in college football. The likelihood is remote. Tims. we could take our next-best measurements of college football superiority-the polls-and upgrade them with the ~ophisticated computers we han: today. \\'e could gfre the computer a complete analysis of each te:im-y:irdagc g:iined. de­f ensi\·e competence, difficulty of sched­ule, scores. won-loss 1ecord. Right now. our polb are based almost en­tirely on ,\·hether a tearn ,\·ins of loses. There is a small degree of schedule consideration. but not in the true sense that it could be c.Taluated by a computer. rd like to see a group of mathematicians sit down and analvze the problem. I think we·cl come up with a more accurate Top 20 than we ha,·e today. 
Xevertheless. I believe n-ry firmly in the polls. I think tlwy·re a great way to stimulate interest in college football. Anything that gives the fans something to talk about is most helpful to the game. 
Eliminating Ties 
AFTER you've played 60 minutes, 
I'd like to see a winner and a loser. But does another five minutes or an­other quarter necessarily mean that the superior team will win? This is a very difficult question. I really don't have the answer. 
\\ie have been greatly concerned at ~otre Dame about the general reac­tion to tic games. Some newspaper­men have unjustly criticized strate­gical decisions we have made. They hm·e distorted the facts on a number of occasions. Our most recent tie, with Southern California, doesn·t even merit second-guessing in my opinion. There were nearly seven minutes left to play in the ball game when \\·e got our second touchdown and that is ample time to score again. We kicked the extra point and elimi­nated the burden of being behind. That made it a ne,\· ball game and gave us a psychological advantage that people can·t measure. \Ve had a 20 mile-per-hour wind at our back and .momentum on our side. Ifs amazing to me that people sit back and second guess a decision that 98 to 99 percent of the coaches in this country would have made. 
Notre Dame ~nd yours truly have always played to win football games. If you look at my record, you'll find only six ties, which is far under the average for coaches completing their 19th year. We\·e been saddled with this criticism that is so unjust to our coaches and players. \Ve make de­cisions in the best interest of our foot­ball team. \Ve go out to \VIN, not tie. 
Officiating 
I THINK we have a dedicated group of people who do the officiating, but they have the same problems coaches have. \Ve start a season hoping to be 10-0, a perfect record, the best a team can be. An official, too, can't be any better than 100%. Unfortunately, the officials do not have to account for their lack of perfection. The coaches are subject to criticism and second­guessing. \Ve have to meet the press and meet the alumni to explain all the strategical reasoning which went into a ball game. Yet, an official, if he makes a mistake, has to answer to no 
one outside the commissioner's office. I don't see anv reason whv; the
, 
officials shouldn·1 have a press con­(erence just like the coaches do. Cur­rently, there is an NCAA rule which prohibits officials from commenting on game decisions. But why shouldn"t the press be allowed to ask them how and why critical decisions were made. lf they're going to assume the re­sponsibility of officiating a game, there isn't any reason why they shouldn't have to face the same people we ha\·e to face. 
This is our livelihood, our job. Our future often hangs in the balance of a good or poor decision by an official. I\·e never frlt that we have dishonest officials. \,Ve may have incompetent officials with extremely poor judge­ment and improper knowledge of the rules. I've seen this type of official, as well as some excellent ones who could handle a game under pressure from fans and coaches. 
I understand that they can't be any better than perfect and I sympa­thize with their problems. But I also feel that they should be available to the writers, especially when one offi­cial's call is instrumental in the out­come of a game. 

.Ara Parseghian: 48-8-4 
{it~itL 
. , 

The Lady of the House at 1326 E. Washington 
To his team~ he is at once a merciless taskmaster and a leader. To the students he is a god and a scapegoat. To his f amilJ' ... ? SCHOLASTIC tries to answer this ques­tion about Ara Parseghian, one o.f Notre Dame's most familiar and most intriguing individuals through an inter­view with one who should know -his wife. 
THE WALK leading up to the modern house on East \Vashington Avenue is neat. W'ell trimmed. The powder­blue Thunderbird perches at the top of the drive; the newer LTD is frequently gone. 
The Parseghian home is large, obviously upper middle class, and yet unpretentious. Ringing the doorbell evokes a noisy response from the three dogs-Muffin, Brigette, and Jezebel. The first two are poodles ("At first Ara didn't like them-too feminine.") ; Jezebel is of indeter­minable origin, given to the family by Bob Olson. 
But these seemingly typical walls conceal a life that is often anything but typical. On football Saturdays the home is swelled by visiting relatives and friends as the family tries to maintain its daily routine. The closest the day approaches to nonnalcy, however, is the juice-and­rolls breakfast and a lunch of chili and hot dogs. The chaos which ensues reflects the atmosphere of haste which has characterized the Parseghians' relationship since they first met. 
Football has always been an integral part of their lives. Mrs. Parseghian was an avid fan of her high school team in Greenfield, Ohio, a small town of 5,000, just east of Martinsville and north of Wilmington. When her edu­cational pursuits shifted from high school to college, so did her football loyalties-to the Redskins of Miami, Ohio. And it was here that she met a member of those Redskins-Ara Parseghian, her future husband. 
Football took on a different aura when she began going with one of the players. There were moments of anxiety and fear. Times of despair and triumph. And these were but a preview of the feelings she was to ex­perience as the wife of a Cleveland Brown, a Brown whose career was, unfortunately, cut short by a hip injury before it even began. 
It was the year of this injury that Ara Parseghian was offered a position as freshman football coach at Miami U., a position he accepted, despite his earlier pro­testations that "he never wanted anything to do with coaching." Thus was launched the career of Ara Par­seghian. Subsequent promotions to head coach at Miami and Northwestern blazed the trail to the home of the Fighting Irish. 

·PARSEGHIAN · accepted his challenge after four of the worst drought years in Irish football history. The new ·coach's .immediate·-~roblems -were to rnstore. confidence· and to rebuild a winner amid the ruins of rare Irish defeat. His potential was recognized, but little was ex­pected of his teams-for a while, at any rate. But Ara pulled his first of several surprises in 1964, compiling an amazing 9-0 record and a No. 1 rating, only to drop the finale with less than two minutes to play, a 20-17 heart­
breaker to Southern Cal. 
Nevertheless, Ara had begun a triumphant career at 
Notre Dame and completed a season ·which Mrs. Par­
seghian calls, in retrospect, the highlight of her football 
experiences. And so she looks back on the tears and the 
smiles shared with her husband, on a life in which foot­
ball has had, admittedly or not, indeterminable influence. 
As a family whose head is in the national limelight, 
the Parseghians find themselves sharing a large portion 
of the publicity, be it press conferences and dinner ban­
quets or crank phone calls. Mrs. Parseghian tells of many 
long-distance collect calls, including one from a "Jack 
Snow," who turned out to be no one more than another 
avid fan. Only recently the family "has made a new 
friend who calls up at least twice a day, only to hang up." 
Then there are the letters, many of them not so pleasant, 
which often prompt the otherwise gracious lady to scribble 
an angry reply. 
Probably the most taxing part of the football life is 
the demanding hours. Ara has yet to see his son Mike 
play freshman ball at Adams High School in South 
Bend. And the demanding hours continue from August 
through the winter and spring months, till June, when 
finally he can take up his putter during the day and 
spend the evenings with his family. 
But the Parseghian home is not all confusion, nor 
is it an all man's world. Karen, a sophomore at Miami, 
and Chris, a senior at Adams High, add their touches of 
femininity to that of Mrs. Parseghian. In fact, the females 

One of many Parseghian mementos is this game ball. 
Dec. 5, 1969 
outnumber the· males, and they are much less afraid of the coach than his players are. 
And. so Ara .P~rseghian's dual life as husband/father and as football coach remains inextricably interwoven, one always influencing the other. Yet he must keep the two roles distinct, and for this reason the Parseghian house­hold must be one of the most unusual anyw·here.

The Man's Name Is Townsend 
STROLL down to your neighborhood 
bar over Christmas vacation (if they 
let you in) and you may overhear a 
conversation not unlike this one: 

"Sure they're going to the Cotton 
Bowl, but what about next year? ·with 
what's-their-names, you know, grad­
uating, they're gonna be hurting at a 
few key spots." 

"Yeah, and I hear they may be 
developing a new passing attack, you 
know, with maybe a split end and a 
flanker or something." 

"But where are they gonna get the 
material for those positions? They 
better have a dynamite frosh squad." 
It may not have been a "dynamite" 
squad (in fact, the freshmen dropped 
two games while winning only one) , 
but the potential was all there. As 
frosh coach Mike Stock put it, "We've 
got twenty or thirty kids who were 
all MVP's at their respective high 
schools. Our problem is to make them 
jell and work as a unit so that they 
will be capable of team play on the 
varsity squad." 

Ask anybody on the Notre Dame campus who the best freshman pros­pect is. "Willie Townsend," they'll . tell you, and for good reason. Willie has all the tools for becoming an ex­cellent wide receiver. Coach Stock cites the "size and sureness" of his hands and his ability to run the de­ceptive patterns. He dashes 40 yards in a mere 4.5 seconds and with his 6-3, 192-pound frame he'll pose as a formidable foe for the opposing 
secondaries. 

Asked if Willie's transition from de­
fensing passes (he was a defensive 
halfback in high school at Hamilton, 
Ohio) to catching them was a difficult 
one, Coach Stock said, "He plays the 
position as though he were always 
an end." 

With the emergence of Townsend 
as a potentially capable end, the ques­
tion arises: What offense suits two 
receivers of Townsend's and Gate­
wood's abilities. Surely, neither 
should ride the bench for the '70-'71 
season, but neither of them has the 
makings of an effective halfback, Put Gatewood in the slot as a flanker and flip-flop Townsend at the split­end position. Stock feels this is a defi­nite possibility, but to insure its suc­cess, he sees the need for the Irish to "establish a successful ground at­tack on the inside, otherwise oppo­nents will merely have to shift men from the middle to bottle up Tom and ,villie." 
THE 

frosh squad provides an abundant amount of backs, all typi­cally buliish in the Notre Dame tradi­tion. Denny Gutowski, Larry Parker and Bob Miller, just to name a few, are sure to press Huff and Co. for their jobs next season. Quarterbacks Jim Bulger and Jim Brady "should give Joe Theismann a run for his money when practice opens next spring," according to Stock. 
Bulger, who at 6-5, 192 pounds could be one of the tallest QBs in No­tre Dame's history, reminds one of Roman Gabriel; he's quick, uses his size to advantage and has great strength in his throwing arm. Brady is also a good passer, but needs confi­dence in his capabilities. Don't be surprised, however, if No. 7 isn't on the field when ND opens with North­western next year. 
The Irish may still be in trouble when the opposition puts the ball in the air next year. The freshmen offer no real solution to a mediocre sec­ondary. Defensive backs Ken Schlezee and Terry Garner were "adequate" for the frosh squad, says Stock, but may be unable to contain the likes of Ashley Bell, Sam Dickerson and Barry Pearson. 
Theismann isn't the only vet who'll be worrying about his status next year. Mike Creany, a lanky lad from Towson, Md., appears to have been born with . a "golden toe." In the freshman finale against Michigan, playing with a badly bruised foot, no less, Creany just missed a 47-yard at­tempt (it had the distance, but was wide to the right). Just to prove it was no fluke, he split the uprights with a 42-yarder into a 20-mile per hour gale. Also of note was the fact that not one of his kickoffs was shorter than the Wolverines' 5 yardline. 
The Irish will be weakest at tight end next year. With both Poskon and Lawson graduating, the search for a replacement has already begun, but so far no acceptable substitute has been

so . . . ? The answer is quite simple. Tom Gatewood: One of two wide receivers in 1970? 
The Scholastic 

found. Freshman tight end Tom Knight just doesn't have the blocking capabilities that will be essential to the Irish running game next year. 
Come next April, when spring prac­tice and the annual Blue-Gold game roll around, all freshmen will get their shots at breaking into the varsity line­up. But predicting who'll make it is always a touchy subject. Who, for example, expected the likes of Mike Kadish to be out there alongside Mc­Coy and Olson. There's always the possibility for some unknown to sur­face by the time the Indiana snows have melted. As Coach Stock puts it: "We've got ten capable men on the coaching staff and they're trying every combination possible to come up with the best possible team for the '70-'71 campaign . . . we'll have a wmner. you can be sure of that."

1970 Varsity Schedule 
At NORTH,.YESTERN -·wild­cats return their most experienced squad in many years for 1970. Coach Alex Agase loses only six of 22 start­ers. Quarterback Maury Daigneau and halfback Mike Adamle, Big Ten's top rusher in '69, spearhead the of­fense. Lettermen flanker Barry Pear­son and fullback Al Robinson will re­place departing seniors. On defense, a pair of Irish nemeses, Jack Deming and Joel Hall, are back for one more try. 
PURDUE -After three superb years, quarterback Mike Phipps is gone. His replacement will be either sophomore Gary Danielson ( 6-2, 183 pounds) or junior Steve Murphy (6-4, 186 pounds). In '69, Danielson quarterbacked the Boiler freshmen to a 1-1 record. Murphy was a third­team varsity signal-caller; he did not win a monogram. Purdue graduates only one other player from its '69 offense-center Walt Whitehead. On defense, four of five linemen are gone, along with secondary stalwarts Tim Foley and Don Webster. 
At MICHIGAN STATE-Duffy Daugherty's principal off-season a5­signment is to develop an offense. He began 1969 with a Texas-style veer, then switched to a pro-set at mid­season. Only center Tom Beard re­mains to anchor the offensive line. 
Dec. 5, 1969 
Dan ,,Verner, a late-season choice at QB, and fleet halfback Eric Allen also return. 
ARMY-The Cadets lose just seven of 22 starters. The pas:;ing game will be Am1y's strong point with quarter­back Bernie ,vall, flanker Bill Roden and split end Joe Albano-all expe­rienced. 
MISSOURI at St. Louis-Tailback Joe Moore returns in 1970, presum­ably to battle for the Reisman Tro­phy. He is the only offensive back­field holdover from this year's 9-1 Orange Bowl outfit. Mizzu will be without 12 of its '69 starters, includ­ing some key personnel in the de­fensive secondary. 
NAVY at Philadelphia-The Mid­dies of 1969 were exceedingly young. On the 55-man traveling squad which came to Notre Dame, 12 were seniors ... and only two of those 12 were starters. Fullback Dan Pike and of­fensive right guard Harry Landau have departed, but the remainder of Navy's starting lineup is intact. 
PITTSBURGH-Coach Carl De­Pasqua did the impossible in leading this year's Panthers to a 4-6 record. Ten first-stringers leave Pitt next spring, but most of the good ones are back-tackle Lloyd Weston and line­
.· backer Ralph Cindrich on defense.:­tailback Denny Ferris, fullback Tony 
Esposito and wingback Steve Moyer 
on offense. 
GEORGIA TECH -Tech is an­
other Irish foe which may be reaching 
maturity in 1970. Only two losses are 
significant for the young '69 Yellow­
jackets. Halfbacks Gene Spiotta and 
Kenny Bounds depart, but Brent Cun­
ningham and Lloyd Snow (brother of 
'67 All-America Lenny Snow) are 
capable substitutes. . 
LOUISIANA STATE-Tigers will be without 17 players who started at one time or another in 1969. Tail­back Alan Shorey, an alternate starter, returns on offense, along with two linemen. Six def enders -including the entire secondary-have enough e:x-perience to give LSU fans the hope of another 9-1 season. 
At SOUTHER!~ CALIFORJ.'UA­On offense, the Trojans are loaded again at skilled positions. Quarter­back Jimmy Jones, tailback Clarence Davis, fullback Charlie Evans and that gang of receivers-Sam Dicker­son, Terry DeKraii and Bob Chandler -command the attack. In the line, only tight end Gerry Mullins and tackle John Vella have another year. Defensively, SC loses six big "names" -tackle Al · Cowlings, middle guard Willard Scott, end Jim Gunn, line­backer Bob Jensen" halfback Sandy Durko and safety Gerry Shm..-. 

Concentration) Pursuit) Meanness 
BIG 1'1IKE says he always was con­fident that he would be an All-Amer­ica defensive tackle. But some frus­tration was involved in reaching his goal. 1'1ike :McCoy, 6-5, 2i8-pound Notre Dame lineman, tells the story of a trying sophomore season. 
"Bobo (Irish linebacker and cap­

tain Bob Olson) and I were the only 
sophomores on the defensive unit. He 
fit right in with the linebackers, but 
I didn't fit in with the linemen right 
away. Most of the season, I didn't 
really feel a part of the defensive 
team." McCoy says he knew that quite 
a Jot was expected of him that sea­
son, but he got the feeling people 
were looking for another Kevin Hardy 
right away. 
High school football was not easy, either. Mike wasn't able to play against kids his own age in grade school because he was over the weight limits. In junior high, "I was just a big fat kid," who was picked on by older boys. "I was always in fights," Mike recalls. 
Not until sophomore year at Cathe­dral Prep in Erie, Pa., did McCoy face players his own age. He says he "paid back" several opponents for previous beatings off the field. 
Mike admits that his early perform­ances for Notre Dame did not include enough "meanness." He says, "Coach Yonto still has to remind me to be mean, sometimes." Joe Yonto, de­fensive line coach of the Irish, is the main reason he has learned to put it all together, according to Mike. Yonto stresses pursuit on every play. Good pursuit means a lineman will be in­volved in more contact and contact brings out "n1eanness." 
CONSISTENT greatness for a de­fensive tackle demands concentration, Mike believes. Concentration pre­paring for and during the gam~ enab:e 
one. "That means hard work, day after day, both on the practice field and in the game," says McCoy. "I would rather play a Northwestern, :Michigan State, Purdue or Southern California every week than a Tulane, Pitt or Georgia Tech." Playing a good team makes his concentration on each play that much easier. McCoy has been at his best against Notre Dame's toughest opponents. "The worst feeling I ever had in a football game was at Pittsburgh this season. Only four or five plays were even near me." Mike likes to be where the action is. 
Pro football's player draft does not appeal to :McCoy. "It's like we're slaves and they're bidding for us. But there's nothing we can do," he says. Mike played only defense as a sopho­more in high school, but went both ways in his last two seasons. He feels he can be either a good offensive or defensive player in the pros. "J can be blocked out/' he sa'ys, "but nobod')' is going to 'physical' me." 
McCoy's football model is Dick Butkus, the All-Pro middle linebacker of the Chicago Bears. 1'1ike has met Butkus. "There is a guy who is a great player because • he constantly gives 100% on every play to go along with his great ability. On the field he is very aggressive, but off the field, you couldn't meet a nicer person­well educated, humble, soft-spoken and a family man." 
Mike McCoy has followed his model very well. He is truly another All-America Notre Dame can be proud of. 

a defender to make every play a big Mike McCoy has a word for Northwestern's Dave Shelbourne.
