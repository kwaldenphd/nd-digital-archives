LAST OF BARRYMORES AT WASHINGT'N HALL
•
When the houselights dim on the Washington Hall stage next Thursday evening at 8 o’clock one of the most famous names of the American theater—Miss Ethel Barrymore Colt — will lead the Jitney Players through a rollicking performance of “Dear Old Alma Mater,” which is fast becoming the classic comedy of American college life.
Right behind Miss Colt in the Jitney lineup are such Broadway juvenile stars as Douglas Rowland, Bettina Cerf, Pendleton Harrison, and Harry Gresham. Notre Dame is just another one night stand for the Jitney’s whose current 12 week tour will take them into 20 states and over some 8,000 mile of countryside before they land back in their headquarters at 114 East 40th Street, New York City.
The Jitney Players are the result of a young actor Bushnell Choney, a player in John Barrymore’s “Hamlet” company. Choney was building a folding portable stage for a tour of New England when an enterprising reporter saw him and wrote a lead back to his paper about actors that traveled around in “jitneys.” The name stuck — through the lean days that followed—and held on even after the Jitneys were an established road company with more than 260,000 miles of bus, truck, and automobile travel behind them.
Today fifteen professional Broadway players compose the Jitneys, playing a repertoire which includes everything from Moliere and Sheridan through Gilbert and Sullivan up to the modern dramatists like O’Neill. and S. N. Bohrman.
Once they traveled in old Fords with homemade stages trailing behind. Thursday evening they come to Notre Dame, a cavalcade of new ’38 trucks and station wagons. However, the original purpose of the Jitney players has not wavered—they still intend to present the finest plays anywhere, anytime. Just bring on an audience!

FOUNDER'S DAY MASS WILL HONOR SAINT
•
Founder’s Day will be celebrated by the University on Thursday, Oct. 13, with solemn religious ceremonies and a holiday from all classes. This holiday does not mark the founding of the University by the Very Rev. Edward Sorin, C.S.C., in November, 1842, but rather the feast day of his patron saint, St. Edward King and Confessor.
The Mass of the feast will be celebrated in the Sacred Heart Church at 8:30 in the morning. Rev. John F. O’Hara, C.S.C., president of the University, will be the celebrant of the Mass, with Rev. J. Hugh O’Donnell, C.S.C., vice-president, assisting as deacon, and Rev. J. Leonard Carrico, C.S.C., as sub-deacon. Rev. Francis J. Wenninger, C.S.C., will serve as master of ceremonies.
The 40 - unit Moreau Seminary Choir under the direction of Rev. James Young, C.S.C., will sing the liturgical Gregorian chant. A sermon on the significance of Founder’s Day is to be delivered by Rev. Charles C. Miltner, Dean of the College of Arts and Letters.
Cardinal Hayes' Mass
The Month’s Mind requiem mass for Cardinal Hayes was celebrated in Sacred Heart Church Tuesday morning. His Eminence died Sept. 4.
Notre Dame cherishes the memory of the Cardinal’s close interest and many gracious acts in her regard. He dedicated the Law Building in 1930 and on several occasions was host to the football team the Sunday mornings after the Army game.
The Rev. John F. O’Hara, C.S.C., president of the University, celebrated the mass. The Rev. Leo Heiser, C.S.C., was deacon, and the Rev. Raymond Murray, C.S.C. was subdeacon. .

Seniors! Seniors! Do you want a job when you graduate next year? Here’s how!
The Notre Dame Alumni Office has inaugurated a Placement Bureau the purpose of which is to aid Notre Dame students to secure employment after graduation. Contacts will be kept with various business concerns throughout the country, with alumni, parents and friends of the students in an attempt to find out available positions. An effort will be made to place the student in the line of work he desires.

which is located in room 124 of the Main Building, next to the Alumni Office.
First steps toward organizing a bureau of this type were taken last May. At this time graduates of the different colleges met with officials of the University and a preliminary outline of the placement program was made. Last year’s graduates were interviewed and asked to fill out questionnaires.
Organization work of the bureau was carried on during the summer under Mr. Dooley’s guidance in an effort to make job contacts and discover job possibilities for the June graduates. Describing the present development of the placement work Mr. Dooley said:	’

THE WEEK
By Bill Donnelly
Cross-eyed Cupid II
The little fellow whose clothes are all a quiver (very subtle pun) was so tickled with the blow we gave him last week that he crossed up a few more of his arrows for us. This time we think he outdid himself. In his own subtle ways he manipulated two letters from one fellow into two envelopes each addressed to the girl to whom the letter wasn’t, and not only was each letter signed “Love” but each bore a most urgent invitation to the Sophomore Cotillion. (The fact that the letters were addressed to such far-off females as Mandy in Montreal and Jane in Baltimore adequately explains that double invitation.) Our two - faced friend felt pretty proud for a few days at his cleverness in asking for two Cotillion dates at the same time, but he was soon jolted into a state of intense anguish by a telegram from Jane signed Mandy demanding the score.
After he had grown tired of banging his head against the wall, the penitent batted off the two most humble and apologetic letters he has ever written. Recent reports from the southern sector sound particularly favorable, for Jane writes that she was laughing so hard when she sent the telegram that she had to call up the agent ten minutes later to tell him he had read the wording correctly. The opening sentence of the dispatch from the Canadian stronghold sounds ominous however, for it reads —“What an awful sap you turned out to be!” But the letter warms up after awhile and offers hope for a satisfactory treaty of peace. The only trouble now is that each of the girls demands the letter originally intended for her — an utter impossibility because of that Cotillion business.

The Pawlowski Ballet.
Celtic Gall
We have been informed that matters are advancing at such a rapid pace in Father Murray’s Sociology classes that they have completed the perennial discussion of the pretty-negress-versus-goonlike-white-girl-on-desert-island controversy already. Of course the “fascinating” personality, the “ravishing” beauty, and the “profound” intelligence of the chocolate nymph are so set up against the physical and spiritual ugliness and damp mind of the correctly-colored lady that the choice of the former is peremptory. For this reason we are left dumfounded by the nerve of a
certain Irishman named O’Connell who flatly admitted he was too prejudiced to marry the negress under any circumstances and boldly told the professor and his shocked classmates that before he sat down he would like to order “a large phooey for all classroom idealism.”

The Roughnecks
Class distinction is attempting to erect its ugly head. Beat it down! It seems that the girls of St. Joe’s Academy gave a tea dance for Notre Dame freshmen last week to which they deliberately neglected to invite the boys from Brownson Hall. How come, we ask? What is the reason for this “You’re a bunch of roughnecks and we won’t play with you” attitude? Because a fellow sleeps in one place, dresses in another, and washes in a third, why should he be less eligible for the South Bend social register than one who does all these things in a two-by-four, one-room flat. Then too the boys from Brownson have the privilege of sleeping under the golden dome and all sorts of traditions the others haven’t got. Evidently the girls didn’t take that into consideration. If we wanted to be mean we could say something about South Bend girls and what right have they got to be so choosey anyhow, but of course we don’t want to be mean. .

Stand Up and Cheer
At the Thursday night freshman rehearsal for Friday night’s Kansas pep meeting, a lad named Tom Kirby of Brooklyn suggested what turned out to be the final version of our new Irish chant. Acclaimed as a hero by his classmates he was given a chance to get up on the platform and lead the cheer. He made much of the opportunity and went into so many convulsions that the regular cheer leaders just stood there and watched in amazement while he performed.
This new cheer is unique in that Notre Dame is one of the few colleges that have attempted to filch the Army chant and whip up something of their own out of it. But in spite of its novelty we feel that if we were a football player (that “we” is particularly appropriate here because it would take a couple of us to make a Beinor or a Simonich anyhow) we would like to lie down on the nice green grass and go to sleep whenever we heard that dirge-like sound.
We have always known that by his own admission Mr. James M. Costin of the South Bend News-Times is “a

HAMP WILL GIVE BEAT TO COTILLION FEET
The "Boiler Kid" Comes Bock to View Tribute of Alma Mater; Eyes Irish March Through Mirror
By Thomas C. Ferneding
By William C. McGowan
Johnny Hamp, long known as one of the country’s most personable maestros, will bring his orchestra to play a one-night stay for the Sophomore Cotillion on Oct. 14, at the Palais Royale ballroom.
The itinerary of the Hamp aggregation is something of note to dance devotees in the line of entertainment. While on tour with his talented and versatile dance band, they enjoyed a sensational stay at the Rainbow Grille in Rockefeller Center. The famed Cocoanut Grove, the Troca-dero, and the Mark Hopkins hotel on the West Coast have featured his scintillating music with tremendous success. New Yorkers remember the catchy rhythms from engagements at the Hotel New Yorker, whereas in Chicago his many friends recall his stay at the Edgewater Beach Hotel, Congress Casino, and the Black Hawk Cafe. A bit of local interest shows that St. Mary's of the Woods, Terre Haute, Ind., enjoyed Johnny Hamp last year for their Junior Prom.
Boasting of a dance band that is famous for its specialty numbers and also for its unique impersonations of leading dance bands of today, Johnny Hamp’s rhythms are sweet and his double rhythms are swing. He features a number of vocal solos and glee club specialties, with the main spotlight focused on Miss Jayne Whitney, stunning brunette songstress. Before joining Johnny Hamp, Miss Whitney was the girl vocalist with Buddy Rogers and his orchestra during their stay at the Roney Plaza in Miami, Florida.
According to Frank McGroder, chairman of the decorations committee, a very unique souvenir dance program will be presented to each couple attending the dance which will last from 9:00 to 1:00 a.m.
Cotillion tickets are to be sold on Wednesday and Thursday before the dance in the lower lobby of the Dining Hall for $3.00 a couple. In order to acquire tickets in the reserved section of the stadium for the Notre Dame-Hlinois .game on Saturday, one must present his Cotillion ticket and also his student ticket at the athletic ticket office in the Main Building and he will receive this two Illinois tickets. (Note — the student has to get his usual student ticket on his appointed day, and when the time comes, turn that and the dance ticket in for seats in the reserved Cotillion section.)
While Notre Dame was whipping Kansas, Fred Snite lay in an iron-lung and cheered with his eyes. I watched those eyes reflect the success of the team—if Notre Dame gained ground they smiled; if Kansas showed spark the smile would fade. Thus Fred smiled most of the afternoon and punctuated each touchdown with a bright grin. He’d been lying paralyzed for two and one-half years, yet his eyes danced like a freshman’s with every Irish score. It was rare spirit and I asked him about it.
“It’s a great’ privilege to see this game,” said Fred, “and I can see it all—very well.”
“Do you mean that you can see the whole game in that small mirror, Fred?”
“Why, yes; I can even see the out-of-bound plays.”
“I don’t have to ask you whether you enjoy the game because you’ve been smiling constantly.”
Fred grinned at that. “I guess I do show it. But you must realize this is the first time I’ve been back to Notre Dame in three years—since I left on that world-cruise, in fact.”
“You mean the cruise that took

you to China where you were stricken?”
“Yes; I was stricken in Peping. But since then I’ve improved a great deal.”
I noticed that most of Fred’s sentences were short and spoken in what might almost be called a drawl. Joe Murray, ’33, who was his roommate in St. Edward’s Hall, explained that Fred spoke well only on the exhale of the iron-lung — every 2 seconds, that is — and had long since fashioned his sentences accordingly.
“I had heard of your improvement, Fred.”
“Yes. When I first became sick I couldn’t breathe without the machine at all. Recently, though, I went 38 minutes without the iron-lung.”
“How about your diet, Fred? Have you some special foods that you stick to?”
“Well, I can’t eat everything—of course. But I probably eat nearly the same things you do;” and this with a smile, “and nearly as much!” “What do you like to drink? Coffee? Milk? Tea? Just what do you usually drink?”
“Probably coffee! But a little of (Continued on Page 22)

Liturgy
The Liturgical Year is appropriately called the Year of the Lord. The Church calendar sets forth in points of time the timelessness of Christ and his teaching. To follow the calendar intimately is to live constantly in the presence of God. It is to make one’s life Christ-centered. The Proper of the Seasons and the feasts of our-Lord vividly impress this truth upon the mind. The feasts of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the saints confirm it. The opening words of this Sunday’s mass, “Give peace, 0 Lord, to them that patiently wait for Thee,” express the longings, these past few weeks, of that part of the world that is still Christian. Peace means fellowship. It is only in union with Christ that men can be permanently at peace with themselves and with one another. To live the Liturgy is to effect in oneself, and contribute towards this end.
Mass Calendar: October 9 to 15

An economics professor, who makes his board and room and other miscellaneous expenses at the University of Alabama, recently told his class that the national debt now is $37,558,369,963. (Note to the linotype operator: that’s the last time we’ll ever try to keep up with the national debt.) While the W.P.A. was thinking of ways to spend more, one of the professor’s students stayed up until dawn to get the following secrets: if one-dollar bills to represent the national debt were placed end to end, they would encircle the earth at the equator 145 times—which is an expensive belt in any man’s land. If the same number of greenbacks were piled 16 to the 16th of an inch, the stack would measure 1,181 feet high which is higher than the Chrysler Building.

I Theatre
By Gerald Hogan
The dramatists of Holy Cross College, Worcester, Mass., are going to visit several New England cities with their production, “The First Legion.” The actors have been memorizing their parts during the summer months and they will be ready to take to the road within a few weeks; the theatres that have been chosen are so close to school that they can be reached, played, and deserted within two days; hence no classroom time (oh precious hours!) will be lost. It seems to me that a group like that from Notre Dame would be welcome in a great many cities in the mid-west.
For the first time in too many years, young ladies will tread the boards of Washington Hall. The city has actresses and the city will provide. Mr. Mills will probably use at least one girl in his first play; he is scouting for one now. The choice of plays is no longer restricted to those - few which are exclusively male; he can at last try his hand at something of current interest. It is further expected that the introduction of this influence will provide a welcome delicacy and refinement to both sides of the footlights.
There are plenty of good actors at Notre Dame; the try-outs proved that. November will probably find many of them making their debut in this year’s first attempt, (it has not yet been chosen). It is likely that the old-timers will be given a back seat in preference to these new-comers; this assumes, of course, that the coach can find the proper types among this group. It takes a hectic six weeks to shape up new members, but when the work is done the coach has a tidy group salted away; their next play develops more quickly and with less sweating on both sides. Those who worked together last year will probably be called for the Christmas play which will have only three weeks for rehearsal. According to this plan, the new year will find the club with a possible 20 to 30 trained and experienced actors.
Notes on the stars (local): Mac Sadlier is modelling at Max Adler’s. The pun is verbally quite obvious, but it doesn’t take to paper very well. A southern try-outer was given this line to emote: “Come here, Mary, and sit on your brother’s knee.” He gave it back, “Come heah, baby, and sit on yo poppa’s knee.” You can’t beat those southerners. They know a flat line when they hear it, and they know what must be done to liven it up.

Man About the Campus
By Graham Starr
Born in Hackensack, N. J. on Aug. 13, a son, to Mr. and Mrs. Lacroix. That’s the way the news story lead was written in 1918. But in 1938 it goes something like this:
“Lucien John Lacroix, associate manager of football in charge of the
Notre Dame stadium personnel, today ordered 750 ushers to . . .” The now 6-foot, 170-pounder with the “crew” haircut was too light and small for football in high school, so he joined the soccer team. Among other things he was on the student council of H.H.S.
Today “Luke’ ’is majoring in politics as an A.B. pre-law student. He contemplates attending Fordham after graduation. Is active in the New Jersey club and the Academy of Politics. Also an active jitterbug, he stomped around in his fourth floor Howard room so much last year, that Tom Foye, who tried to live beneath him, had .to register a complaint.
The most joy that the T-shirt addict (he seldom wears a tie) gets on the campus is derived from his kidding of Louis J. newsboy) Essey. It was climaxed last year when Essey on a dare mounted a barebacked steed in a field adjoining Dixie highway. The horse remained still, turned its head, took one look at Essey, and started an undulating motion that left Lou on the marshy ground. The scene ended with Essey running straight for the pasture fence followed by the nag with an evil gleam in its-eye. Luke and his companion, Neal Kvatsak, rolled' on the-"ground with laughter. -	- ’ . r .

Radio
By Bernard J. Feeney
The Campus Radio Studio will be the scene of great activity next Wednesday night. When that “on the air” signal flashes through the minds of those participating, the Inaugural Program will move on out into the ether and on to the kilocycles of your receiver. Originally scheduled, for Founder’s Day, October 13th, this broadcast, has been moved ahead 24 hours because of program conflicts. It is hoped that some prominent member of the University will say a few words to start this fifth season correctly. Of course, the Modernaires, led by Maestro Carl Hunn, will be in attendance and they intend to preview their new half-hour dance series scheduled to start soon. Other previews of future staff programs are expected to be forthcoming. Of interest to all listeners will be the new Linnet organization which will be making its debut under Mr. Orville Foster. Then, too, Announcer Norb Aleksis will have the pleasure of interviewing Jackson Chung, former Chinese soldier and now a student at the University. Mr. Chung, it is believed, will tell of the narrow escape he experienced while fighting recently in China. With this nicely selected variety, Campus Radio should get off to a good start.
Last Wednesday night’s meeting proved very worth while. Rev. Eugene Burke, C.S.C., director of the studio, introduced three men whose talks highlighted the evening’s schedule. The first, Norb Aleksis, new president of the club, outlined this, year’s plans; the second, Mr. Orville Foster, signified his desire to cooperate with the studio and hoped the Linnets would be of help; the third, Mr. Thomas Mills, expressed confidence in the Staff and looked forward to the cooperation of the studio with the University Theatre. Some auditions were held, but many more are expected at future meetings.
This reporter has heard that his old friend of “On Down the Line” fame is staging somewhat of an inaugural himself, come opening whistle time next Thursday nfght at 7:00 o’clock. Yes sir, the “Haig” is back with more interesting comments on sports, so be sure to listen in. Always glib, he packs plenty of punch and pep into 15 minutes.

ACADEMY OF SCIENCE ELECTS OFFICERS
By Edward Huston
The rabbits and guinea pigs finally got a night off last Tuesday when Academy of Science members stacked their test tubes and adjourned to room 101 of the Biology Building to organize for the coming year and elect officers.
Bill Hambley—who gets his mail across the road but goes to school under the Dome—came home in front in the Presidential sweepstakes. Right behind him on the winning ticket were Harry Reinhart, vice-president, and Bob Fish, secretary. Thomas Armel, Byron Casey, and Jim Doyle were elected to the executive committee.
The Reverend Francis J. Wenninger, C.S.C., moderator of the Academy ended the first meeting by sketching the campus history of the Academy of Science, and acquainted the new members with club projects for the coming year.
The successful “darkhorse” nominee, Mr. Hambley, was too surprised by his landslide victory to give anything but an incoherent rush of plans for the coming year. However, there will be semi-monthly meetings, and President Hambley intends to have his political machine functioning smoothly before the next meeting.
Symphonic Group Work For Balance
Concert enthusiasts are welcoming -news of the progress made by the Notre Dame Symphony Orchestra. The organization boasts several additions in string, woodwind and brass sections and a larger personnel for the entire group. Professor Daniel H. Pedtke, director, notes that a better balance has been obtained this year through the admittance of more members and particularly through a better distribution of instruments. Professor Pedtke’s efforts were rewarded in particular by the finding of an oboe player. The orchestra now lacks only a basoonist to have complete instrumentation, and there are possibilities of adding one before the first concert.
Last week the members of the orchestra elected three officers for the current year. Lawrence Sutton was chosen president, with Frank Miltner as vice-president, and Robert Finch as librarian.
The orchestra hopes to present a concert in Washington Hall early in November. Rehearsals -have been held since the second week of school, and Prof. Pedtke feels that by concert time his program will be polished for
MONOGRAM MEN TOY WITH MAYHEM
The Monogram Men ran through some secret practice last Monday night — not under the arc lights of Cartier—but behind carefully drawn blinds in the north basement of the Library. Bigger, better, more excruciating methods of painfully inducting last year lettermen into the Monogram club were carefully considered

Paul Kell, who is reputed to be the power man and occupies the clean-up position in the paddle gauntlet, has scouts out combing Michiana .brush for stalwart young elms which soon will be converted into convenient applicators of bend - over - massage. Further, Mr. Kell has appointed Bill Mahoney, John Donnelly, and Bill Condon, as a sort of auxiliary “Pain-Trust”—officially the initiation committee.
Big Ed Simonich is now filling the presidential niche in the club since the resignation of Bill Faymonville. He conducted the first meeting and told the 25 holdover members of last year to “get in shape” for the strenuous initiation period ahead.
COLLEGE OF SCIENCE

Professor Pedtke has made it possible for any musicians who have been hiding out to volunteer their talents and receive a try-out. Applicants are invited to see Prof. Pedtke at rehearsal time, 6:30 p.m. each Monday and Wednesday.
K. C. APPOINTMENTS MADE BY MURPHY
By Joseph J. Miller
Under the supervision of the newly-installed officers, the Notre Dame Council of the Knights of Columbus held their second official meeting of the year. Acting for the first time under the intricate laws of the order, Grand Knight John Murphy led the Knights in the formalities of meeting last Tuesday evening.
In conjunction with the year program as established by the supreme board, Grand Knight Murphy announced the chairmen of the permanent committees. James Rocap is chairman of the important membership committee, assisted by members living in the various halls. Eugene Bernard is in charge of the sick committee. Other - appointments were publicity, John Seigal; Catholic Action, George McMorrow; ushers committee, Bernard Murray; insurance committee, George Morris; and house committee, Bernard Piel and Edward Richards.
Chairman George McMorrow gave a short talk on the program of the Catholic Action committee for the coming year. He promised the establishment of a number of discussion clubs which feature the oustanding questions facing Catholic college students of to-day. Brother McMorrow showed the need of correct reasoning and an understanding of the problems of Catholic students. He also emphasized the duty of the college graduate interested in Columbianism in combating the immediate menaces to Catholicism.
Singing by John Collins accompanied by William Mooney at the piano opened the Lecturer’s hour. Following this Professor Paul Bartholomew addressed the council on the present Czechoslovakian situation and its bearing on the future of Europe.
Any student desirous of entering the Knights of Columbus is requested to visit members in their halls or Financial Secretary George Morris.

Music Notes
By William Mooney
Two weeks ago Ignace Paderewski returned to the attention of the world. Once more his piano was heard—this time by his largest audience. It was the occasion of the great pianist’s first American broadcast, an event which was heard around the world. The broadcast came to us by short wave from Switzerland, and it was estimated that more people heard this program than have heard the great master in his fifty years on the concert stage. Once more, perhaps for the last time, the world acclaimed the greatest pianist who ever lived.
His life contains enough greatness for two immortal men. He attained a supremacy which has never been equalled. He is the only man who has ever filled Madison Square Garden.
But Paderewski has been more than a great pianist. The world will always refer to his as a statesman, orator, pianist and composer. His biography has been written by a former professor of English here at Notre Dame, the late Dr. Charles Phillips.
During the World War his native country of Poland was badly in need of a leader. The government had collapsed, and the people were threatened with subjection. Paderewski was their savior. He represented Poland in the Paris Peace Conference. It was his clear logical thinking and his powerful oratory that gained for Poland her demands for independence and recognition. His work there made him the idol of his people.
After finishing his work at the Paris Peace Conference, he returned to Warsaw, and as Prime Minister welded together the new Poland. When this had been successfully accomplished, he returned to that kingdom of which he had been so long master. He was again genius of the keyboard. He had transposed himself from greatness in one field to greatness in another—and back again.
Paderewski is a Catholic. While he served as a statesman, his religious depth and devotion gave rise to many slurs and insults. Today he lives quietly in his villa near Lake Lucerne in Switzerland. He will not leave his piano while he is physically able to play. In his latest concert he played with amazing clearness and power in spite of his eighty years.	.
In the introduction to his biography is found this passage: “It is difficult to write of Paderewski without emotion. Statesman, orator, pianist and composer, he is a superlative man, and his genius transcends that of anyone I have ever known.
"VILLAGERS" BEGIN FIFTEENTH YEAR
The first meeting of the 15th year of the organization was held by the Notre Dame Villagers last Monday evening at the Columbia Club. Organized in 1923 by a group of Notre Dame students living in South Bend and Mishawaka, it has since been one of the most active of the extracurricular activities on the campus.
President Robert Rodibaugh presided at the initial monthly banquet and business meeting. Assisting him were Richard Alberts, vice president;
Robert Rodibaugh
Villagers Plan Dance.
William Prekowitz, treasurer; Joseph Hartzer, secretary, and Benedict Murdock, sergeant at arms.
Mr. Robert McAuliffe, director of off-campus, addressed the club and commended them for the fine work which they have performed. Mr. McAuliffe emphasized the traditions of the Villagers which can be compared favorably with any of the campus organizations. This unified group can boast of one of their members as having done more for Notre Dame than most of her sons. Rev. Julius Nieuw-land, C.S.C., the inventor of synthetic rubber, internationally known, came to Notre Dame as a representative of South Bend. Mr. McAuliffe stated that the present members of this club have many ideals and traditions for which to strive.
President Rodibaugh announced the members of the committee to handle the Victory Dance. They are cochairmen, Charles Reddy and Gene Kochanowski; decroations, Alexis Tsiolis; tickets, Bernard Hiss; publicity, William Rieke; music, James Jodon; and arrangements, Robert Carpenter.
The dance will be the evening of the Illinois game, Oct. 15. Tickets will be sold in conjunction with the bids to the Sophomore Cotillion, or may be purchases from any member of the Villagers. The Progress Club has been selected for the dance with dancing from 9:30 to 11:30.
Mr. Rodibaugh in a final address asked the Villagers for their entire cooperation during the coming year. As this support would be necessary for the success of the organization in maintaining those ideals and glories.

This year commemorates the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Department of Architecture at Notre Dame.
In 1898 Mr. Henry Sclacks, a Chicago architect, initiated architectural instruction at Notre Dame with weekly visits to the University in order to supervise the work of students interested in architecture. He was assisted in this instruction by Professor Francis X. Ackermann, now head of the Department of Mechanical Drawing. Since that time the Department of Architecture has expanded gradually until today it occupies what was originally a hall for the Department of Chemistry and later the quarters of the University Law School. It is singularly appropriate that this building, in the opinion of visiting architects, is one of the finest structures, from the standpoint of srchitecture, on the campus.
To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Department of Architecture at Notre Dame, an architectural review has been published. This review under the title of “Architecture at Notre Dame” treats of the development of the University from the time of the construction of Father Badin’s Log Chapel on St. Mary’s Lake to the appearance of the very latest structures on the campus. The first college building, known as Old College, is still standing. Old College is the square brick structure beside St. Mary’s lake. It was here that Notre Dame, as a university, had its beginning.
In an historical way “Architecture at Notre Dame” tells of the growth of the University under the demand of a constantly increasing student body. It treats of the plan followed ki the architectural construction of Notre Dame, and of those architects,, priests, and brothers who played leading roles in the development of the University. A series of pictures of . campus buildings with the names of their respective architects mentioned below adds an illustrative touch to the review. Another series of pictures shows the work that Notre Dame architects have been doing throughout the United States and in Cuba where Eugenio P. Rayneri of the class of 1904 designed the Federal Capitol. The last few pages are devoted to an alumni record of the achievements of each member of the graduating classes from 1904 to 1937.
The entire brochure with its quiet good taste reflects the careful work of Professor Frank W. Kervick, head of the Department of Architecture.

You're Just os Good
ONE NOTRE DAME tradition which dumbfounds most college students when they discover it is the complete absence of social fraternities of any sort from our campus. Collegians are amazed that such an allegedly vital and traditional element of higher education should find no place in the program of an institution that represents itself as a full-fledged American university. The Notre Dame man does not really discover the reason until he has lived here for a while; often he does not grasp the whole purport of the thing until he has graduated into professional life.
A recent issue of Life carried an article dealing with the opening of the fall semester at a large Pacific Coast university. Of course, one of the big events was the annual fraternity and sorority “rushing.” And Life has this to say: “When bids went out, 330 nishees hove happily into the haven of the Greek alphabet while nearly 400
were turned disconsolately adrift for four years on the sea of ‘social inferiority’.” Therein lies the key to our vindication. One of the fundamental Christian principles in which Notre Dame profoundly believes is that of social democracy. She will not tolerate any class distinction among her students because some are more fortunate than others in a pecuniary sense or because one was class president at Freshwater Prep, while another was “just another guy” at Public High School 3. It is just such tenets as these that have made Notre Dame a leader in national and world education. All she asks is that you live by those rules of common sense and common decency, the observance of which is expected of any Christian gentleman.—Donald A. Foskett.
Prayer and Peace
EVENTS of the past few days carrying deep significance have dominated news stories. The world has suddenly gotten back on its knees and acknowledged God —now that Hitler has startled the world with his escapades in and around Germany.
In this era which has been noted for its abandonment of the teachings of Christ and the Church, the possibility of war in Europe and subsequently another of world-wide proportions, has awakened many men who guide the destinies of world affairs to serious thought.
The major change has come about in stately Westminster Abbey. The famed London church, dedicated to Christ by Saint Edward, — former King of England whose feast we celebrate this month, — has again become the meeting place for prayer.	.
During the Reformation era, Westminster Abbey was changed from the House of the Lord to a mausoleum. Last week Londoners gathered in the Abbey for prayer when Hitler’s actions made war more of a reality.
In addition, Mayor La Guardia of New York City proclaimed five minutes of prayer shortly after noon for all the people of his city during the conferences at Munich.
President Franklin Roosevelt, in a statement to Judge John P. McGoorty, co-chairman of the National Committee for Religion and Welfare Recovery, asked for the national observance of the Loyalty days in all churches throughout the United States.
“Perhaps never in the history of our nation have we needed to seek Divine guidance and to unite our forces seeking spiritual recovery which is so deeply needed in our contemporary world as we do today,” Mr. Roosevelt stated in his letter to Judge McGoorty.
The response of leaders in the United States and England comes at the same time that His Holiness, Pope Pius presented a world-wide address petitioning for prayers and peace.
With such world-wide evidence of return to prayer, a new ray of hope appears. We in free America can well afford to offer an additional prayer in thanksgiving for the acknowledgements of world powers—and add another that those powers retain their beliefs and continue to encourage others to do so.—Bill Scanlan.

A GRIM FAIRY TALE
By Henry Leader
ONE DAY in the future two dictators met and told each other how they had tamed the Lion and the Bear. They joked for hours and congratulated each other in their native tongue. Suddenly they realized that they had tamed everything in this world, and there was no one of whom they were afraid. They were puzzled. What could they do for entertainment? So they sat and thought until one of them jumped up and clapped his bloody hands together in glee and said that he knew-what they could do now. He said they would get together and tame God. Then the other one sat and looked at his friend jealously for he wished that he had thought of such a good idea first. But the brainier one said that it was nothing at all and that he had been thinking of it all along; in fact, he had done a little experimenting on it but on a small scale of course. He laughed when he told his friend that he had stepped on some people called Jews. He wouldn’t let them sit down in his country except on certain benches, and they could only sleep and eat where he told them to, and they were pretty well scared of him now. He only did little things like that just for experimental purposes but he got fun out of it and besides, it showed him what he could do on a larger scale if he wished. There were other people in his country called Catholics and he fooled around with them once in a while too. He was building up to them though and this is where his scheme came in. Then they whispered and the one that had been doing all the thinking and talking said that he had been a paper hanger once and although this was a little out of his line he still thought that he could hang Him again. At this they both laughed and slapped their knees and the fatter one kissed the smaller and felt his moustache tickle.
The square jawed one, who lived south of his neighbor, said that he thought that he could carry on a pretty good campaign against Him for he lived right next door to one of His very good friends. And since he had worked on a newspaper at one time he could write a lot of stuff against Him and have it printed. But all this would have to be done very subtly. Then they sneaked home for it was dark.
Now there was no such word as Charity in their language. There might have been at one time but when they became dictators they had all the people take scissors and cut it out of the dictionaries and out of their hearts at the same time. They couldn’t love their neighbors for they had none. Yes, they did have neighbors at one time, but they had taken all their neighbors to live with them in one big unhappy family; they didn’t do this because they were kind but for the same reason that some person might ask a rich ninety-year-old uncle to live with him.
Each of them sat and thought what he would do when they had licked Him and had taken his place. It was just about this time that they were inviting the last of their neighbors to come and live with them. All the people in the countries across the water from where they lived were becoming very afraid, for this neighbor proved very testy and decided that they would rather go over the hill than live with that man with the funny moustache. The ones that lived across the water .watched and waited, but one day they all got wind of the plan of these two people who were deciding what they would do when they took His place. So these people looked at each other and smiled and told all the young men in the land to put their guns back in the arsenal, and told all the bands in the country that they didn’t have to play martial music anymore, and the mothers smiled at the baby boys in the cradles and didn’t have any more visions of bayonets sticking in their round pink little beliies and they wiped the tears from the young girls’ eyes and told them that they could all live happily ever after. And they did, too, for it seems that one day when these people took the paper and the milk off the doorstep in the morning they saw that these two bad men wouldn’t have much longer to live, for no one has ever won a war against God.

Oil Field Workers
By James Graham
Every oil field worker has an exciting job. The young ‘roustabout’ who may be found doing odd jobs in . any part of the field is thrilled because he has something to do that doesn’t keep him indoors all the time —something to do that has great variety. And even the experienced ‘driller’ finds thrills and excitement every day in the dangers that he and his men meet. When the pipes and tools that weigh tons are swinging overhead, there may be trouble any time. The “tool dresser’ who takes care of the tools for the drilling crew is in a more dangerous spot, for he must work with the swinging tools. The ‘roustabout’ who has just been promoted to ‘rough neck’ with the drilling crew is more liable to get hurt than the others, for he has had less experience on the rigs. The ‘rough neck’ gets all the little insignificant jobs on the rig. His most important one is to climb up the rig and to sit on a tiny platform that swings from cables and to handle and guide the tools and pipes as they go up and down. But the most thrilling and dangerous job of all is that of ‘shooter.’ The shooter drives his truck over the rough section roads at a great speed, although he carries barrels of nitroglycerine. The ‘shooter’ is also the last to leave the rig after the ‘load’ of shot has been dropped down the ‘hole.’ He never gets a chance to make a mistake twice.
The first crew to work on a new
well is the ‘rigging’ crew. They construct the rig, setting its base in concrete. Then carpenters build a platform or ‘flooring’ for the ‘drilling’ crew to work on. They also build a shed for the rotary motors which do the actual drilling of the well. When the ‘drilling’ crew gets to work, there is no rest until the well is either ‘drilled in’ or is found to be a ‘dry hole.’ The crews work in three shifts of eight hours each. They start at midnight, eight in the morning, and four in the afternoon. In the winter the daylight shift is the best, but in the summer time it is too hot, for the temperature in the oil field often reaches 105 degrees and more. When the temperature is high, the afternoon shift is the best, for cool winds usually arise early in the evening.
Every time the crew drills sixty feet it is necessary to add another piece of pipe to the sometimes mile-long line. The new piece is suspended from the top of the rig by the pulley and is fastened carefully to the top of the ‘string’ which reaches the level of the rig floor. Once in a while the pipe slips and breaks a connection several hundred feet below the surface. The pipe then has to be pulled out piece by piece and laid aside until the bottom of the line is located and pulled up. This ‘fishing’ job often lasts a month, for during the fishing many other tools may be dropped. After the drilling is finished, whether successfully or not, the pipe is all pulled out just as in the preparation
for a fishing job. When the top pipe is loosened, the cable pulls it up a few feet momentarily and then drops it. This is when the crew must be especially careful of their feet, for the heavy pipe makes a clean cut on anything it hits.
When the pipe has been removed the crew puts in a smaller line and the oil is guided through the pipe to reserve tanks or to refineries, if there are any near the well. For a while the oil flows by its own pressure, but later it must be pumped. The ‘pumper’ has charge of many wells, for a single well is not much trouble to watch. The derrick is removed by the ‘riggers’ and is put up some other place. Later when the well begins to drop in its ‘flow’ the ‘shooter’ is called to drop ‘loads’ of nitroglycerine down the ‘hole’ to clear away anything that may have accumulated. The shooting results in an increase in ‘flow’ or ‘production.’
The good part of the whole oil business is the chance for advancement. The ‘roustabout’ starts with a salary of over $100 a month and, when promoted to ‘rough neck,’ he gets at least another $50 a month. Within a few years he may become a head-driller and from there step into minor executive positions in oil companies. Many of the oil executives of today started out as oil field workers and gathered up great knowledge of the oil business that has enabled them to go as far as they have.
Cafeteria Capers
By Charles S. Reddy
I feel like a shark in a goldfish bowl. In my quest for lofty expression I flounder like the store teeth of Uncle Hiram searching for the elusive sweetbread. I sigh for the depth of Kilmer, the conciseness of Guy de Maupassant, the eloquence of Webster. But what do I get? Why, the superlative style of C. Sheridan Reddy! All right, dear reader, jump on the band wagon of words.
This is the story of three mighty men, Gaylord the Gourmand, Marvin the Moocher, and Billy the Bore. These three bulwarks of campus “joie de vivre” traipse over each morning, noon and night to the Home of the Lead Dumpling, Grass Greens, and Dead Sea Coffee as voluble testimony for the homespun truth, “Paradise was Lost with Adam.”
Ensconced near the blaring ten tuber, and working myself into a mood of meditation and serious consideration of world problems, I see the three threats to student sanity roll in.
Gaylord the Gourmand leads the field by three lengths, his porky cheeks drawn, his eyes two question marks, his gait a frenzied half-lope. G the G grabs a tray, the implements for the conquest of the delicious edible, and away he goes on his campaign. Soup, steaks, potatoes au gratin, lima beans, pear salad, stewed tomatoes, rye bread, hard rolls, coffee, ice cream, cake, and banana pie fall in line to march on hunger.
Marvin the Moocher now raises his -flag of warning. “I’m a little short,
fellows. Make it thirty-five cents more, old boy.”
Billy the Bore waits until he and his cohorts sit down. Then he makes up for his two minute’s silence.
“I heard from Sally today. Boy, is she nuts about me! I guess the babes can’t resist me. What? Why don’t I eat and shut up? You fellows are just jealous. Well, Sally said she can’t hardly wait till I get home. Wotta babe! Wotta babe! Wotta lucky girl!”
Gaylord the Gourmand munches on like Bossy in clover. Marvin the Moocher borrows another “rock.” Billy the Bore extols his might, and grins like the delicatessen cat. And so until another meal.

THE WEEK IN SPORTS
FROSH LOOK STRONG IN HALL LEAGUE
•
Interhall activity commenced the past week with Freshmen monopoliz ing the pass football games and serving notice to upperclassmen that the coming season will be anything but a pushover for the old timers.
The Brownson blue team looked good in downing the blue boys from Freshmen Hall, 24 to 0 in the initial game. Zahm’s gold team had some difficulty in defeating the Brownson golds, 14 to 0, and in the third game of the week Cavanaugh triumphed over the Zahm blue team, 17 to 7.
In the Soccer league the Freshman Hall squad dropped their opener to a team of Juniors, 5 to 3. Although they lost, Father DuPuis’ boys looked very good and will undoubtedly give the other soccer teams trouble before the year is over.
Indications are at this time that all Freshman halls will be represented by two teams in the football league. The Freshman Halls are all using two full teams for practice in the soccer league.
It was announced that schedules of all the coming games in both football and soccer will be posted soon.

GEORGIA TECH. UNDERDOGS. MAY PLAY ROLE OF GIANT KILLERS IN ATLANTA TUSSLE
By Pete Sheehan
Down Dixie way the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets are known as “Giant Killers.” They putter along with their mediocre opponents but rise to the heights when they stack up against a team which is gazing hopefully at the national championship. Tomorrow afternoon in the Grant Arena, Atlanta, the stage is set for the kill with 40,000

Williams' Kick Puts Bees Over, 13 -12
Notre Dame’s “B” team started its season successfully, with a well-earned 13-12 triumph over Jordan College, at Menominee, Mich. The game was featured by Jordan’s whirlwind passing attack, and brilliant line-plunging by Lee and Williams, of Notre Dame.
The starting lineup for Notre Dame had Berta and P. Sheridan at ends; Papa and McDonough at tackles; Korth and Heath at guards; Maloney at center; Koch at quarterback; Williams at left-half; Cassidy at right-half; and Lee at fullback. The second team had Blake and Liston at ends; Kerwin and Bums at tackles; Schrenker and Essick at guards; Bond at center; Archer at quarterback; Saffa at left-half; Kuhlman at right half; and Dahar at fullback.
The game started out as a real (Continued on Page 21)
football enthusiasts in the role of spectators and Georgia Tech and Notre Dame taking the parts of David and Goliath, respectively.
Last Saturday Coach Bill Alexander’s squad won easily from Mercer College, 19 to 0, while Coach Elmer Layden and his 81 men—no more, no less—romped over the Jayhawkers of Kansas, 52 to 0. The Irish, supposedly a weak aggregation last Friday, are now rated as one of the greatest offensive units in the country and are given an excellent chance of finishing the arduous schedule which confronts them with a clean slate.
The Southerners have many new faces in their lineup this year. It is difficult to replace such backfield men as Konemann, Collins, Appleby, and Fletcher Sims. Last year Sims’ name was found on many All-America selections because of his ability as a passer, kicker, runner, and above all as an expert field general. Joe Bartlett, sophomore, and Bill Gibson, 156 pound junior, will alternate at the signal calling position Saturday and will be aided by Ector and Page at the halves, and Murphy at the tailback spot.
All the ends who saw service last year have departed but the rest of the line remains intact. Cushing and Wood, tackles; Wilcox and Brooks, guards; and Jack Chivington, candidate for All-America pivot honors, should give the Irish forwards plenty of trouble. Smith and Robison are expected to start at the wings. Although these boys are green they showed plenty of promise in the opener and are expected to develop into very dependable wingmen.
The visitors will probably line up with Brown and Kelly at the ends; Beinor and Kell, tackles; Capt. McGoldrick and Bossu at the guards; and Ed Longhi at the pivot post. Sit-ko will call signals with Stevenson, Zontini, and Tonelli filling out the backfield.
The second team, which was so successful against Kansas, will probably (Continued on Page 21)

CANALE ELIMINATES FAY AND SIMON FROM TENNIS TOURNEY AS FINALS NEAR
Upsetting both the defending champion and varsity team captain, Don
Canale, sensational freshman from Memphis, Tenn., provided the major evi-
dence of a rise in tennis fortunes here in the annual University singles championships. Canale, finalist in the Southern Junior Tourney and semi-finalist
in the Eastern Juniors, eleminated heavily-favored Larry Dee in the National Juniors at Culver, Ind. earlier this year.
The Memphis flash toppled Bill Fay, defending champion from Pittsburgh, in a well-played semi-final battle. Leading two sets to one, Canale took a 5-3 lead in the final set. With the score 30-love in favor of Canale in the ninth game, Fay staged a brilliant rally to deuce the count, win the game and eventually take a 6-5 lead. A pair of masterful passing shots won the 12th game for Canale before he went on to victory.
In a quarter-finals tilt, Canale won over Varsity Captain Fred Simon in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3. Fay had previously topped Heckler, 6-3, 7-5.
In the other bracket, Olin Parks, another freshman, from South Bend, blanked Joe Bogiackas, 6-0, 6-0 to reach the semifinals against Whit Gregory, second ranking varsity player who beat John Walsh, in a three-set encounter, 4-6, 7-5, 6-4.
Because of their outstanding performances in tournaments this past summer, Pedro de Landero, varsity tennis coach and director of the tournament, allowed three freshmen to play in the upperclass event—Canale, Parks and Ed Moore.
Prep for Handicaps
With nearly three weeks of conditioning behind them a large Freshman track squad is rounding into shape for some earnest running, now that Coach Nicholson has announced the Annual Fall Handicap Meet for the week of the 16th, if weather permits. (Nick speaks from experience; last year’s meet finally being held in the gym.)
The Handicap Meet is a yearly affair held as a climax to the autumn training season. It is in this that the freshman gets a chance to prove his worth and match strides with varsity stars in handicap races. Handicaps give the frosh an equal chance with the upperclassmen for one of the three medals given in each event.
The meet will be run in two days; trials will be held Monday and after a day’s rest the finals will be run off. Another feature of this meet will be the first test from scratch for the sophomores, this year’s varsity hope. Such runners as Joe Obrys, Jim Tracy, Al McMeehan and Jack Wilkenson will do their best to show Nick they are ready to run for the varsity.
Coach De Landero Freshmen came through.
Barry Leads Field -
Jack Barry, ambidextrous Boston net star, won his first three matches to take an early lead in the opening rounds of the Freshman singles tennis tournament.
Barry, who was No. 2 and No. 4 in the Junior rankings at the Longwood Cricket club at Boston, scene of the annual National Doubles Championships, serves right - handed and plays other strokes as a southpaw.
He set the pace in the tournament by besting Phil Richards, in a close three-set battle, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1. He also won over Joe Spohn, 6-4, 2-6, 6-3, and beat Bill Scanlan, 6-2, 6-4.
Another outstanding contender for Frosh honors is Jim Murphy who won top laurels at Detroit. Murphy mastered Ray Eichenlaub, 6-1, 6-3. Other early round results of the tournament: Bill Fallon won over Martin McGaveran, 6-8, 7-5, 6-2; Don Gundice topped Bob Kehoe, 6-1, 6-2; Fallon mastered Ed Miller, 6-3, 6-4; Bob Sibilsky beat Jim Egan, 6-1, 6-2; Dave Oden bested Charles MacMahon, 7-5, 6-4, 6-0 before losing to Phil Richards, 6-0, 6-2, 6-0.
Joe Rorich beat Gene O’Brien, 6-1, 6-1; Jim Asmuth won over Joe Palmer, 6-0, 6-2; Jack Donovan tipped Tom Dugnan, 6-0, 6-2, 6-1; Francis Platt eliminated John Rielly, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3; and won by default over T. Teamey. Santo Belli beat Bob Finneran, 6-0, 6-0.
The aggregate national absence from school due to accident is estimated at 2,365,700 school days. Unorganized and unsupervised activities on athletic fields and playgrounds account for 44 per cent of all the accidents.
SO THEY SAY
“Kansas never had a chance against Notre Dame today and the 52 to 0 score doesn’t show the wide margin of difference between the two elevens. It shows plenty no doubt but not nearly enough.
The Irish had everything, the Jayhawkers had nothing, as a reference to the score by quarters indicates. Notre Dame warmed up with a touchdown in the first period, got two in the second for a 20 to 0 lead at the half, came back for three in the third and two in the fourth.”—C. E. McBride—Kansas City Star.
“Notre Dame swept into the second half-century of its glorious football history here this afternoon, and those 1938 Irish set to work as though they’re out to make folks forget all about the other 50 years.
“They trampled over the University of Kansas, 52 to 0, before a record opening day attendance of 45,000 that included 25,000 Boy Scouts and the courageous ‘Iron Lung Kid,’ Fred Snite, who is a Notre Dame grad of 1933.”—By Edgar Munzel, Chicago Herald and Examiner.
“Eighty - eight eager young men ganged upon a sturdy but weary little band from the University of Kansas today to start Notre Dame off on its 51st football season with a 52-0 victory. A record opening day crowd of 45,000 sat enthralled under a beaming autumn sun as green-shirted warriors trooped in and out of the lineup to pile up eight touchdowns and four extra points.”—By George Strickler, Chicago Tribune.

ENTIRE SQUAD USED IN KANSAS ROUT
•
Eighty-one Irish gridders, playing mid-season ball, romped over a willing but weary University of Kansas eleven here last Saturday to mark the inaugural of their 51st campaign by piling up eight touchdowns and four extra points for a 52 to 0 victory. A record opening day crowd of 45,000 sat amazed as team after team gave fine exhibitions of both offensive and defensive play. As Tom Gallagher, sophomore tackle, said shortly after the game: “Boy, everything clicked today.”
Kansas, using a 6-2-2-1 defense, could not stop the Irish from gaining 456 yards from scrimmage, principally with reverses, and- end runs. Not until the last few minutes of play when the last of the Notre Dame reserves were in action did the Jayhawkers threaten to score. Mario Tonelli fumbled on his own 46 yard line. But the drive was checked when Steve Sitko intercepted a Kansas pass on the.34.
After six minutes of play, Notre Dame started the scoring when Tonelli skirted around end for six yards. In the second quarter, Paul Morrison started the scoring drive with a 48-yard sprint on a reverse, followed by a 36-yard run for the second by Ben Sheridan, the sensational left half back on the “second team.”
Toward the end of the period, Ed Simonich cut through the Kansas right guard for the third touchdown. Sophomore Bob Saggau drop kicked the extra point to make the score 20 to 0 at the half.
Soon after the start of the third period, Lou Zontini went over the Kansas’ right tackle for 20 yards and the fourth touchdown. Then a forward pass by Harry Stevenson to Earl Brown, who made a spectacular catch on the goal line, netted 30 yards and another touchdown. The second team returned to the game and Notre Dame returned the kick to the 17 yard line. Two plays later, Sheridan cut back through left tackle, going 13 yards to a touchdown.
On the third play of the fourth quarter Saggau swept the Kansas left end behind perfect interference to rim 51 yards for the seventh touchdown. Again, Saggau was the principal factor in the 54 yard march with which the third team finished the scoring, carrying the ball to the 6 yard line with a 23 yard run. Milton Piepul scored on the next play.
The 52-point total was the highest scored since Drake and Haskell were overwhelmed in 1932.
Introducing
By Eddie Huff
Mario George Tonelli has been “Motts” since his prep school days at De Paul Academy in Chicago, and
he doesn’t know why. “Motts” cannot be fooled twice, however, in a “nominal” way because when he is quizzed about “Mario” he explains that it is the Italian masculine for Mary.
“Motts” came to Notre Dame first as an interscholastic broad jumper and pole vaulter. For three years Mario ruled the competition in the pole vault event at Notre Dame’s annual interscholastic track and field meet, and not until the 1938 renewal was his record of 11 feet, three inches broken. He captured two titles on Cartier Field in the running broad jump, and his record of some 21-odd feet held top position until last summer. Only a busy study schedule keeps Tonelli from varsity track competition.
A senior in the physical education school, Mario bears a man’s love for sports. At DePaul Academy he was awarded monograms in football, basketball, and track. Tom Haggerty, now varsity basketball coach at DePaul Academy in- Chicago, tutored Tonelli at prep school and saw his protege receive “All” honors on the Catholic, City, and State mythical teams.
Ben Connors and Dan Hanley, Notre Dame alumni, taught Tonelli his football at DePaul, and Mario responded with an effort that won him all-State selection as a junior, and all-City and all-Catholic as a senior halfback.
GEORGIA-N.D. SERIES FULL OF STARS
Fighting the Yellow Jackets from Georgia Tech was an annual pastime during the Rockne regime. For eight straight years Notre Dame ran into a Tornado with a golden hue, but only once did the Irish get the worst of it. Beginning back in 1922, a year otherwise famous as the sophomore year of the Four Horsemen, Tech appeared on Cartier Field and Notre Dame began to “roll.” Georgia was dropped for a 13-3 count in ’22, but only after they had demonstrated the versatility of southern football with a finely-paced running and passing attack.
Don Miller chose the 1923 game on which to have one of his best days. With Elmer Layden and Jimmy Crowley blocking for him he dashed 88, 36, 21, and 59 yards for scores. The final was 35-7.
A homecoming crowd saw the “Golden Tornado” slashed to ribbons in 1924. With Layden, Crowley, Miller, and Stuhldreher riding high, wide and handsome, and the famous Seven Mules dodging Tech from whistle to gun, the Irish couldn’t be stopped, winning 34-3.
On a soggy Grant Stadium turf Christie Flanagan smashed through for two scores to beat Tech in ’25, 13-0. Roach, Reilly, Niemiec and Company repeated for Notre Dame in 1926.
Georgia suffered its sixth straight defeat at the hands of the Irish in 1927, 26-7. Evidently this was only leading to better things for the southerners, for the following fall Tech came up with a team that was ranked as National Champions. Midway through their undefeated campaign the Engineers beat Notre Dame in Atlanta, 13-0. They took advantage of the breaks and scored early. Then after some futile Notre Dame marches, “Father” Lumpkin scored from the Irish 3 yard line after running back an intercepted pass.
Rock’s hand held a royal flush in 1929 and he was unbeatable. The 1928 National Champs from Atlanta were tossed in the dust to the tune of 26-6. Fleet-footed Jack -Elder scampered 53 yards to open the barrage on the visiting foemen. Frank Carideo, attempting the same stunt, snatched a punt on his own 27, sidestepped three Georgians, saw four more slapped to the turf, and outran the remaining four men to the goal line. Notre Dame later went- on to the National Championship.

SPLINTERS FROM THE PRESS BOX
By Andy Wilson
It is amazing the way that the average opinion concerning Notre Dame’s current football prospects has changed from unwarranted pessimism to an almost unwarranted optimism because of one game. The 52-0 score certainly shows that this is the finest offensive team Coach Layden has yet turned out. And it does also show that Notre Dame has the power to trim any team in the country. But this one game, remarkable as it was from our point of view, does not allow us to expect a long victory string, nor does it enable us to say confidently, Notre Dame will beat this team and this team, and that team and that team.

The general team - powei* exposed against Kansas was really something to marvel at. The backs could do everything — block, pass, punt, plunge, run in the open field, choose plays wisely. The linemen, with untried Johnny O’Brien and John Gu-banich at right end and right guard showing considerable skill, all looked good. Most satisfying of all was the work of the tackles. All-American Beinoi' was the most spectacular, as usual; but Frank Brew, and Tom Gallagher, fighting for his job on the left side of the line, lacked only his flash. On the right side, Senior Paul Kell, Junior Tad Harvey, and Sophomore Joe Bechtold had nothing dis-

Things will not click so perfectly week-end after week-end. Every competitor in every sport has “off” days and “on” days. Notre Dame had an “on” day October 1st; the “off” days are yet to come. Excessive heat at Grant Field in Atlanta tomorrow, a fumbling fit, rain and mud, snow, a slip of the foot and a bad punt, a missed block, a penalty—almost any one of these things could spoil a game, upset this team of ours. I believe the true test of Irish ability and versatility will not come till October 15 th, when the Orange and Blue Illini, sturdy and powerful, visit the Notre Dame stadium.

In our opinion, there is no team on the Irish schedule, with the exception of Minnesota, that can match Notre Dame’s man-power. Such an evenly balanced squad as ours, with three full teams of almost equal strength, is hardly reproducible at any other school in the country. Against the Jays seven different men on three different teams scored the eight touchdowns, and one bunch—the second team—was never forced to punt.
Notre Dame piled up such a big score against Kansas because everything clicked. The Jayhawkers were

light enough to be bullied around by the bigger Irish linemen, and without much in the way of reserves simply had not the physical strength to stand up against the charge of the Irish backs. Where a solid, clean block would be necessary to clear a hole against a heavy squad like Illinois or Minnesota, a sideswiping, sloppy block was sufficient against the featherweight men from the plains. Even our 165-pound watchcharm guards, DeFranco and Gubanich, had no trouble leading the plays against men

Ed Beinor had sideswiped some of the best ball-carriers in the country off their feet before he made his first clean downfield tackle on Lansdell of U.S.C. last November. Lansdell survived, but there will be a stretcher close at hand during all the games this season on the chance that someone less hardy will meet Beinor head-on. . . . Ben Binkowski has been showing up all during practice as the best defensive fullback on the squad; he can spot a hole opening a mile off, and- when the play comes through, he’s already in the middle of it. . . . Something like 1,000 pounds of flesh disappeared here September 10th; the combination of the heat, heavy uniforms and two workouts took an average of ten pounds off the 100 squadmen who were out the first day of fall practice. Men like Kell and Theisen, Simonich and Tad Harvey, who melted from about 220 to 207, were the biggest losers. . . .

GLEE, CHORAL CLUBS PREP FOR CONCERTS
For longer than students on the campus can remember Notre Dame has always had a distinguished vocal group and this year will be no exception. In fact, this year, Notre Dame’s vocal attack will come from two separate and distinct organizations—the Notre Dame Glee Club, and the Notre Dame Choral Club.
The Glee Club this year will be under the direction of Professor Daniel H. Pedtke. A completely new program has been outlined for the coming year. A strenuous practice program of five rehearsals a week has been instituted. The tenors rehearse at 12:30 on Mondays and Wednesdays, and the basses at 12:30 Tuesdays and Thursdays, and on Fridays at the same time both divisions as the full organization. Forty voices comprise the group, some of which are veterans of last year’s club and the remainder of which are experienced new members. Professor Pedtke believes this year’s organization will be a worthy successor to the Notre Dame Glee clubs which have won applause throughout the country. Many of the upperclassmen will remember with pleasure the fine solo voices of past glee clubs, such as that of John Ryan, and they will be interested to know that several excellent voices will be featured in this season’s concerts. Professor Pedtke refuses to divulge his program as yet preferring to let it come as a surprise at the first concert.
The other vocal organization, the Choral Club, is also definitely organized and, like the Glee Club, consists of 40 voices. Mr. Cletus Schommer is in charge of this group and has been conducting rehearsals at 6:30 p.m. on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. He advises us that he has a fine second tenor section and a strong baritone section with the other sections progressing rapidly. The Choral Club will go on the radio some time around Thanksgiving, and is contemplating other concerts after this initial appearance. Mr. Schommer has revealed that the Club is working on a choral adaptation of part of Sibelius* famous tone poem, “Finlandia.” Robert Louis Stevenson’s “Pirate Song” and the “Largo” from the New World Symphony will be other selections. Students will still be accepted for try-outs in the Choral Club and are advised to appear at rehearsal time.
We are indeed fortunate to have two such organizations on the campus. For one thing, it gives more men a chance to sing in a vocal ensemble, and makes possible a broader concert program for the student body.

POLITICAL SCIENCE ACADEMY TO MEET
•
Come a running all you Junior and Senior Political Science majors. Come with your vocal cords well oiled, your wits sharpened, and your powers of concentration in top-notch form. Why? Because the Academy of Political Science holds its inaugural meeting next Tuesday.
This brain child of the Department of Politics is now getting set for its fourth year of existence. During the past week the Academy has been receiving the applications of prospective members. Last night the final weeding out took place as the membership committee interviewed all the applicants and selected those whom it thought possessed the best qualifications to become members.
The Academy meets bi-monthly, and the meetings are devoted to student and faculty discussion of current topics in the field of Political Science.
This year Fred Sisk is chairman of the Academy, while the other student officer, a treasurer, will be selected at the next meeting. Representing the faculty are Mr. Paul Bartholomew, Reverend Francis Boland, C.S.C. and Mr. Maurice Pettit of the Department of Politics.
Tentative plans this year have the Academy branching out into the field of radio. The members hope to have a program over the campus radio station, in which they will discuss various political topics of current interest.

About the game tomorrow: Georgia Tech had a fairly soft game last week, and unlike Kansas, should be fresh and ready for the Irish. The engineers are decided under-dogs, but are highly sparked up for the game. And again) unlike the Jayhawkers, who were extremely vulnerable around the. ends, the engineers have no obvious and outstanding defensive weaknesses. They have a well-balanced team, and one of the finest centers in the South in Captain Jack Chivington. They are playing on their home field, in a climate to which they are accustomed, and they are pointing so seriously for the Irish that they held their strongest running back, a 190-pound sophomore triplethreat named Bartlett, out of all but a few minutes of the Mercer game. They lost their veteran ends and backs from last year’s first eleven, but they have four experienced tackles and four experienced guards.

(Continued from Page k) rabid Notre Dame fan,” but we never realized quite how rabid he was until we read in his column the following comment: “The first cheer from the Notre Dame student body was a hoarse ‘Welcome, Kansas’ that must have been heard on the Jayhawker campus.” Personally we thought all of the cheering was unusually spiritless, and in regard to that cheer in particular, we’re inclined to regard it as the basic cause of the ineffectuality of the Kansas team. When they came out on the field and heard that thunderous whisper from the collective voices of the six cheerleaders and one or two of their friends, of course they figured they didn’t rate at all and got such an inferiority complex about it that they gave up then and there.

Oh Officer!
The other day we saw an irate Bill (you know—the cop at the cab stand) in hot pursuit of four matronly ladies who were strolling straight across the scrupulously - protected University lawn in the direction of the Main Building. When Bill came up to them they very deftly appeased his wrath before the words were out of his mouth by asking him to snap their picture please. Bill fell for it—if only there had been a motorcycle, a reckless chase, several years off the characters involved, and a particularappealing bit of beauty in one of the ladies, wTe wrould have had a perfect “boy meets girl” for a Class B movie —and took the camera. The ladies lined up smilingly and Bill fiddled with the machine for awhile before he finally admitted that he was stumped by its intricacies. However, after one of the ladies had shown him the correct doo jigger, he snapped the picture, and the ladies continued destructively in their own matronly-merry way across the University lawn.

BEES WIN
(Continued from Page 13) battle, with neither team having any particular advantage. Jordan drew first blood, however, by shooting a short pass into the flat, which was good for a touchdown. The try for the extra point was no good. The first quarter ended with Jordan leading, 6-0.
Late in the second period Notre Dame intercepted a pass and started a touchdown march. With Williams and Lee smashing the center of the Jordan line, the ball was soon carried to the goal line, where Lee plunged over for six points. Williams then stepped back and planted the ball squarely between the goalposts for the point that proved to be the margin of victory. This score was made with only ten seconds of play remaining in the half.
The second half opened with the score 7-6 in favor of the Notre Dame “B” team. This narrow margin was maintained until Dahar, playing in the fullback position, stepped in front of a Jordan pass, and ran 50 yards before he was downed near the goalline. Taking advantage of this break, Saffa plunged through the center for another touchdown. The conversion failed, and the score was 13-6.
With only fifty seconds of play remaining in the last quarter, Jordan again completed a flat pass for a touchdown. Jordan’s attempt to tie the score by means of the extra point failed, and the score stood 13-12, in favor of the visitors. Jordan tried a short kick in a desperate attempt to get control of the ball, but a Notre Dame player fell on it, and the game ended before a play could be called.
The team plays Northwestern at Evanston on Saturday, Oct. 8. This game promises to be close, as last year’s game was won by Notre Dame’s “B” team by the narrow margin of one touchdown.
VARSITY VS. GEORGIA TECH (Continued from Page 15) see plenty of action under the Southern sunshine from the rugged forward wall of which the Georgians boast. The line from left to right will be: Kerr, Brew, De Franco, Mooney, Gubanich, Harvey, and O’Brien. Hofer, Simonich, Morrison and Sheridan will form the shock troop backfield. The latter will be closely watched by the Engineers who no doubt have read of his exploits in the Atlanta newspapers. Joe The-sing, regular shock troop fullback, is not expected to see action because of the injuries which he sustained last week.
This will be Mr. Layden’s first engagement with Georgia Tech since 1924 when he was a star performer on the National Championship eleven which overwhelmed the Engineers,
34 to 3.

constant improvement, I’m happy to tell you. Each day he takes a breathing exercise independent of the machine, and, as you know, he recently breathed 38 minutes without it. Daily massages keep his muscles soft.”
“But there must be more to it than even that, Mr. Snite. How does he occupy himself during the day.”
“Well, since he gets quite a bit of mail he spends his mornings dictating the replies. In the afternoon he plays chess or checkers — or even bridge, Fred’s quite a good bridge player, you know. Someone holds the hand and he calls the play. At night he goes to bed at eleven and wakes at six.”
“Has this trailer helped to divert him?”
“It has indeed! We bought it in July and he’s gone 1500 miles already, which means a great deal when you know how difficult it was to get him about before. Of course we travel moderately, about 30 miles per hour—but it’s enjoyable to sit with him and play bridge on the way.”
“But there’s another thing,” Mr. Snite continued. “The spark that keeps Fred going is the spark of Faith. Without the comfort his religion gives him this trailer and everything else would be worthless!”
“You mean he never has a day when things look a little gray, or at least a little less bright than they do today, for instance?” -
“I mean just that. He told me that in the past year he had had only one day when he felt a little downcast, and would like to know how many people can match that record. Only a paltry few, I’ll bet.”
“I think you’re right, Mr. Snite; it’s a rare record. And I want to thank you sincerely for your kindness this afternoon.”
“You’re entirely welcome. Come around and say goodbye to Fred before you leave.”
With that we walked around to the rear of the trailer where Fred was watching Notre Dame batter that poor Kansas line.
“Fred, I’d like to thank you for the interview, and I hope you’ll be back for the rest of the home-games.”
“Perhaps I will be back. But I’m not sure. It depends on the weather, of course . . . and I’m leaving for Florida in three weeks.”
“Will you stay in Florida all winter?”
“Just about, I guess — and come home in the spring. But here, before you go, will you put a special word in your interview for me?” He looked in earnest, so I got out my pencil.
“You see, I’ve been treated royally all day, and I want to thank Elmer Layden for making the arrangements; and also Father O’Hara for his kindnesses . . . and oh! just about everybody, I guess. They’ve all been grand!”

PLACEMENT BUREAU
(Continued from Page 4) will continue to intensify our work in the whole placement field.”
A completed program is being arranged to assist present seniors to secure positions when they graduate next June. Mr. Dooley said:
“Definite plans are going forward to enlarge the scope of the Placement Bureau work that the Alumni Office started last May. Details of this
larger program are being worked out and will be announced later to the student body through The Scholastic.”
Mr. Dooley received his A.B. degree from Notre Dame in 1926. He became Assistant Alumni Secretary and managing editor of the Notre Dame Alumnus in Jan. 1934 and will continue in these positions. He had been business manager of the University student publications since 1935.
In addition to his new position in the placement bureau Mr. Dooley has been named manager of the Rockne Memorial Fund office.

Even the Finest Fountain Pen
Performs Far Better
When Filled with this Modern Ink ... A Marvelous Creation!
Created by Parker to guard pens from pen-dogging inks . . . Ends 69% of the fountain pen troubles
There is not—and never has been—any other pen designed to handle all kinds of inks—good and bad —as well as the revolutionary Parker Vacumatic. One reason is that this modern invention has no rubber ink sac, no lever filler, no piston pump. It is filled by a simple diaphragm, sealed in the top, where ink can never touch or decompose its working parts.
And its patented Television barrel lets you SEB the level of ink at all times—see when to refill.
This pedigreed Beauty of laminated Pearl and Jet is everywhere acknowledged to be the grandest pen ever created. Yet even this Guaranteed Mechanically Perfect pen can be plugged up by the grit and gum in ordinary writing inks.
Hence to guard the celebrated Parker Pens from pen-clogging inks, Parker experts developed this utterly new kind of writing ink—called Quink— an ink that actually cleanses any pen as it writes.
This is done by a secret ingredient, wholly harmless. It dissolves the gum and other troublesome particles left in your pen by ordinary inks. It makes your pen a self-cleaner—cleans as it writes.
Parker Quink is full-bodied, rich, and brilliant.
Never watery or gummy. And it dries on PAPER 31% quicker than average, due to stepped-up penetration. Yet Quink costs no more than ordinary inks—small bottles, 15c and 25c.
If you use an ordinary pen, you need Quink even more than does a Parker Pen owner to keep it in writing condition. If you use a Parker Pen, you’ll be thrilled and surprised by the way it performs when filled with Quink. For until we created Quink and the Parker Vacumatic Pen, there never was a really scientific writing combination.
