The first production of The Cruci­ble occurred ·in 1953 at the height of Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti­communist crusade.· The Wiscon­sin senator •was praised by some as a dedicated patriot. Others saw him as a ruthless persecutor whose ac_.

He· was still. awake when the 

alarm went off. Lying motionless. in 
the gray light, he· listened to the 
sound as it stuttered jaggedly · throughout the room, 'reeling,. 
waverirg, finally hovering mechani­
cally about the clock. He silenced 
it abruptly with a deliberate mov-e:-· 
rrient of his hand. ·· · · · . The floor was cold where t~ere was a draft from the window all night. He stood on the cold part, stooping over the sink to wash his face and hands thoroughly with a new bar of soap.. He hesitated a moment after hanging up the towel, examining the face, his face, in the mirror. Then reaching behind it he opened the medicine cabinet, and inserted a new blade into his razor. Looking . once more _into the glass he began to shave himself carefully. "Dear Mom-· I'm sorry . . .''. 
He liftedthe stiff-pressed shir.t 

from the top drawer of the• bureau. 
He fastened it painstakingly, one 
button at a time, cuffs last. From 
the wardrobe he selected the dark 
blue suit. Removing. the cleaner's 
plastic, he lay the cl(!thing on the 
bed and finished dressing slowly 
and with scrupulous attention to 
detail. With a rag he softly dusted 
the already buffed and polished . 
shoes. Returning to the mirror _he 
knotted the·silkeri tie snugly around 
his throat.

way .. .''

The tables were arranged row on . r6w with only a few people at each of the. ones closest: to the milk' . machines.. He. knew some of them; not many this early in the morning, sitting where they usually .sat, altogether·in ol'le place.. Some ·of them had finished and were busing their trays. Others were prolonging a· final cup of coffee. ·He sat close to them, lowering his·avocado-· colored tray to a nearby table, within the crowd but not a part of it.

Agitation subsisted ~nd the noise 
declined to the drone.of a sing!~ . voice, th~ scratch of many pens and , the murmuring hopes of a hundred worried scribes. He. sat quietly, rubbing. the side of his periagainst the palm of his hand. ­
"Dear Mom-You pays your dime and you takes yo_ur chances." 
He stood against the bar with a beer, alone at the edge·of the crowd. He stood silently, looking casually · across the shadowed hall to the draperied~window darkness of the room beyond. The women glided like moths throughJhe off-light; the men talked thickly behind clouds of smoke .. They ~ere all lost, each in 

·his own way,: because for .them there 
were only the winners and losers

that though, there was only the 
winning and the losing. 
He drank slowly, observing all of 
the small comings and goings that 
created for him the illusion of felt 
life. But if he. thought about it 
much, or felt.about it, then he knew, 
that he was bleeding: Not that could 

be seen and not that anyone would _be able to notice.or do anything 'about:But he was bleeding all the · , same, inside; where the only really 
good part of him had ever been. 
The part that did the good things, 
said the right things and believed 
only the best; the part that saw 
without looking, felt without fear­
ing and loved without questioning. 
It bled from cuts in everything that 
gave it life, and he was unable to 
produce the plasma of life as fast as 
need' was carrying it away. 
·, Outside, ·the flow of voices spread 
around him in the breathless cold. 
He lifted his collar around his neck 
and lifting a pack of, cigarettes from 
his pocket, he lit one and· dropped· 
.the: match!into the sno_w. Taking 
a long puff, he disappeared down . 
the sidewalk into the silent darkness

In the boxing room of the ACC, an energetic. whit~haired man is · giving . iristructions to the 75 or so young men in sweats, headgear and boxing gloves. Dominick Napolitano is preparing .the 1976 contenders for · the 45th annualBengai Bouts, which wilfbe)ieid on February 24, 26 and 
29. Since 1931-the Bouts have been dedicated to the cause. of Bangla­desh, a situation which was Nappy'~ concern long before the world hun·­ger crisis: gained .its: current Jnter­national attention.

. th'e team. The_understanding among Indiana players tha(day was, "If we can stop Farley, we've got a chance." Despite an injury toward the end of the first half that left him bruised and with· blood trickling . down his forehead,_ Farley . played the entire game and created a sensation among both schools, despite. the 6-0 loss. In another game that same year, Farley -recovered, -a fumble and dashed 78 yards. for a touchdown and his longest. known run. 
Apparently; Father Farley's run­ning ability,·served him weU later, when he was.rector of ·corby, Walsh and' Sorin ha.lls. According to one report, an old football ian once ap:. 
was displayed in its own bowling alley located in the basement. _· Bowl­. ing, like all the other sports, was adored by Father Farley.. As an article in a1902,Scholastic recounts, 
-"_There is one .striking . cha.~acter­-istic about Father Fa~ley's athletic . teams -. and that is, they . invariably . win~" 
In 1937 Father Farley suffered a paralytic stroke which -necessitated the amputation ofhis right leg. But , he never lost. his . zea.l . for _sports. Former students can remember him pushing his wheelch0air dear across campus to watch the football prac­tices. Then, as before, he never passed a student without calling out -llis leg~ndary:','Hi; boy." Upon enter­
ing the football stadium, the whole crowd rose to salute the "King." 
Father Farley died on January 15, 1939. As a .final ~tribute, _3000 stu­dents lined the rout,e \vhich the cas­. ket. passed from the .Main Building, then_ to Sac'red 'Iieart Church and finally to the cqminunity_ cemetery.

Collective Bargaining at Notre Darne 
Tenure, the subject of the first 

. article in this series, is part of the traditi_onal structure of higher e_du­cation.. Collective bargaining cannot claim such a tradition, but it is none­theless seeking its . own position within:the structures of·higher edu­cation. • 
-, It may sound better, for_ a· faculty to. speak.·._ of., collective bargaining than to, talk about unioni~ation,, but the two are_ one and the:.saine.Jlnio_,:i is i.the common: man's term, ,which some .feel does ,~ot belong in the realm .of higher education.._Unions may _have : a · place ;in .• pz:imary • and secc;mdary edu~ation, , but. university faculties. ~re felt to -~-e on_,a p_rofes­sional level. above these.

tution. . . '• .. 
The .distinction between the two terms is . obviously . one .of_ opinion, and . neither -is consistent nor ade~ qua.te. Collectiv~ bargaining, 'fa~ui'ty unionization -whatever term you choose -are not" easily evaluated. Collective_ . bargaining·. offers ..·con~ structive possibilities for higher edu­cation as well as_ dangers and. diffi-. ctilties: .

Each of the speakers at ~he Facul~ 
ty Senat~~~ponsored discussion spoke_ of th_e improvements in faculty sal­aries and c::ompe_ns_ation whic~ • were brought about . through, c_ollective. bargaining. George· Horton, of, Rut­gers University, pointed out ,that one of the major:· accompHshme11ts ofcollec;tive bargaining at -Rutgers . was the change. in the structu.re of faculty, salaries; This point, was also made,,by ,Frederick_ Hueppe.,of St. John's University, but he· focused more attention on what collective bargaining ~ad . accompHshed, in th~, 
area of governance. 
St. John's was one of the first .pri­
vate; institutions .to .enter: into col­
lective ., bargaining. The· decision to 
begin -the bargaining, process· grew 
out.of attempts,at St. John's to're-· 
coup after a .1966 censure by .the 
AAUP,: which was the result of the 
dismi~sal of faculty members with­
out cause. 
' Through collective bargaining the 
faculty of St. John's sought a more 
formal' role in determining the: pri­
orities of th'e university. They also 
wished fo have recourse to a clear­
cut ,grievance. procedure .with •the. 
possibility of·: outside ·arbitration.

iriJ:hat they ~e~e ~orking against the censure o'f'the AAUP. They were attempting to imp.lenient any and all improvements which·. would lead to the lifting 6fthat censure. Both the administration and the faculty_ had the mutual goal of overcoming the negative effects of censure,· arid. the success 6f collective bargaining_ 'i's in. some way attributable to this mutual'conce~n. Ideally, this mutual cori~ern for the good. of the· institu­tion should exist regardlesi;'_of the circumstances but this. is not. neces­sarily the case .. The smooth opera­tion of collective bargaining· depends upon the attitude of the' individual faculties and institutions involved. 
-' The-· amount of time and effort· in­volved in collective bargaining '.was also discussed by:the speakers. Fred­erick Hueppe · emphasized the fact­that faculty · members had to be willing to put in a -largeamoimt of time and effort'if they expected the bargaining proce~ure' to :attain: de­sired ·goals. If a faculty ·is looking for 
a: greater involvement in the. •gov­ernance of' an''insUtution, people must be wiliing to assume the new roles that will be opened up to them. · Keith Kleckner· of' Oakland· Uni-. versity· spoke of the_ time_ and 'effort' demanded by the bargaining process. in' more negative terms. The hours· spent at the bargaining table cari be long and frtistratirig. There is also the possibility that faculty members· will be drawn more 'and more into· institutional' politics and away from their concerns as educators.. ~ · .. ·.· 
Collective• bargaining ·can·. ·prove to be costly. This is· true both while the faculty is being '. organized and. the' contractnegotiated arid later as the · contract is· being: administered. especially if frequent arbitration of grievances ', is ·· necessary. •.. Thes_e costs are· borne by the dues •that· a::. faculty pays to its collective bar-: gaining agency. :Collective· bargain:. ing offers all sorts of avenues ·of legal action, the· cost ,of _which :the faculty must be willirig to bear.'The amount which these costs may reach is dependent upon the· individual sit:. uation; the, relative ':difficulties in negotiating the contract,' and how if is' administered.. . . . . . 
The legal considerations of coUec~ tive bargaining: reveal the,exterit ·'of third-party involvement; There : is; the dange:r' that the administration of the institution· may. end ·up iri the hands of 'lawyers arid outside'arbi-· trators. This was one of the con­cerns .which, Keith .. Kleckner , ex-then a bargaining· agent must be pressed in speaking of Oakland_ Uni~ . chosen; The agency ·mostlikely to be versity's experience _with . collective . chosen is the A.A.UP. ·once a bar~ bargaining. gaining agent has been selected and.

ence to revive the traditions of radi-· cal America and to inspire a hope for the future." 
The conference does not officially fall under Notre Dame's celebration of the bicentennial . because it ap­plied for support too late. Adrienne Coffin,: an organizer . of the ·. sym-· · posium, emphasized, "We're not try­ing to .denigrate or compete with the official Bicentennial celebration; but rather to deepen it. We're con-. cerned with the elements of our radical past, .such as the establish-. ment of a democracy,_and with how_ to bring that to our future.". · 
The' symposium i~ ·committed ·10. · the view that the radical tradition in •, America is a preciousheritage re­curring throughout the past 200 . years. Although often obscured by . the establishment and institutional-· ization of privileges and practice, it is deepiy ·rooted in many of the as­pirations expressed in···· 1776:C The. revolution which firmly established ideals of representative. government_ has required purification and rededi­

by J. Robert Baker 
in ·the early part of the 20th cen­tury, provides a further example of this radical tradition. Seeking to encourage a, thoroughly democratic 
. form of American socialism, Nor­man Thomas became its major spokesman. One of his central themes was to continually remind America that the short-term, ad hoc responses of the New Deal were in­adequate. -· Thomas and others felt Roosevelt's economic and social policies were merely the patching up of an old exploitative system. 
When Mart_in .Luther King re­ceived the Nobel Peace Priz'e in 1964, he remembere_d .the ·• influence,. of Thomas and his urging of radical reformation: "I can think of no man who has done more to inspire the vision of a society ; free of injustice and exploitation. While some would adjust to the status quo, you urged struggle. While some would, corrupt struggle withviol~nce· or. 'undemo­cratic perversions, you have stood firmly for the integrity of ends and means. Your example has ennobled and dignified the fight for freedom, and all that we hear of the Great Society seems only an echo of your · prophetic eloquence. Your pursuit ·. of racial and economic democracy at home, and of sanity· and peace in 
·the · world, ·has been awesome in scope. You have proved that there is something• truly glorious in being forever engaged in the pursuit of justice and equality." 
· Peter Walshe, an associate pro­fessor of ·gov~rnment and inter­national studies at Notre Dame and a. conference organizer, · noted that . the official Bicentennial, which fol­lows later in the semester, has not emphasized this tradition. "Yet it is precisely this perspective.· of radical and prophetic criticism, with the hope that follows, that should be at the core of a Christian university." 
For Walshe, · America's . radical tradition . must be reactivated to question . existing . economic struc-. tures. "Today this heritage involves

a number of problems have arisen over the senior values seminar. 
A main voice of contention about the seminar comes from the faculty. The problem stems from. the fact that the recommendation to have the values seminar was.not allowed to be discussed before approval and that it did not go through discussion in the college councils. As Dr.·Hauei:-­~as judged, "This· whole thing ju~t

Logistics is another problem by which the senior values seminar is plagued. As Dr. Fiore noted, it will be quite a scheduling feat to place . approximately 1600 s en i o rs in . classes of 10 to 15 students. The pro­fessor also. noted that scheduling . speakers' programs which a number ,of classes. would. attend would be very difficult. "It will he the logistics t~at .kiH !he._senior .yalues, semin~r,

sort of·.· slipped right ·through· the academic council." Dr. Gleason noted that. "the faculty's reaction to :the Academic Council's .. passage of the values seminar' is skeptical. . They ·don't like to have a thing like this sprung upon them. They_ need to be 
· convinced, by, discussion and experi­mentation that the values seminar will be practical and useful."· · · Another problem is . that some faculty members do;not feel ·capable of teaching a . values· course. (All teachers at some ..time · will . be re­quired to· teach· a· ·values course.) This objection is ·strongly resisted though. "Just because a teacher is not an ·expert is no excuse: The ;fac­ulty should all be· intelligent people with informed opinions,'' Dr.' Hauer-._ was commented: Fr:' Hes burgh also disagrees with the faculty's objec­tions,• as is reported in Change, The Magazine -of· Higher· Leaning: -"How can anyone be a university professor if.he does not have values and ifhe is not able to express and . defend not the.professors: or the students,',' judged Dr. Fiore. 
"One major problem of the values seminar. is that each college conducts its·own ·seminar. There's no crossing of the _college lines," Dr. Hauerwas :said;, (The Colleges of Science and Business will begin their own: semi­nars next fall.) The theologian sug­gested that ·the students of · each 
. college· should mix ·for the seminar 
. to ·•work• well, preferably through the development of seminars con­ducted in the dormitory. , · , -.. ·Ariother major .problem the semi­nar faces is .that it is mandatory. While Dr. Hauerwas feels there will 
·. be no .problem if the seminar is· done well, -there are •contrasting views. Dr. Walton stated that "my_ class, as well as myself, are totally opposed to the seminar being compulsory.'' As orie . sophomore stated, "I'll be damned if I'll participate in a course they make me_ go to and spill out my views on all . types .of things. .That's the ·kind, of stuff I do with 
"They're going to ask peoplelike .me 
who are already teaching a full load 
to prepare and te_ach another course. 
This really upsets a lot of teachers." 
Though the problems are many, 
grand expectations for ·the: course 
are few. The faculty is reaHstic 
in their hopes .. for-the.. course. 
As Dr. Gleason haid, --'-'We. don't 
want _to -give values, , but:, rather 
to provide; :an occasion where stu­
dents can relate what they have 
~:~e!:;o~~~~tra~~:n:al~e\~:i~ 
lives.". _Dr. Hauerwas has a similar 
view· of .the seminar, "It .is an in­
formal attempt to rais_e and.:discuss 
values one. shall be. concerned with :for the.rest of hisHfe.'!: 
-The belief that the values seminar is · needed stems from ·problems _in contemporary higher education, as Fr. Hesburgh riotes. in Change: "We :have managed to. become so frag­mented and so. overspecializ'ed as to pe completely dissipated>We'. don't have the great questions: elucidated in the., youngsters', minds today, about love and hate, peace and war, · violence and nonviolence, questions of humanity and inhurnanity, beauty ·and ,.ugliness, the.· kind of great sweeping global ·cosmic questions 
that used· to . always be a part of 
humanistic. e~ucation, that. involved 
an approach tci history and· litera­
ture; art, music, mathematics,· sci­
ence, philosophy and theology, that 
is to,say, a total unified mix.''.: 
.The degree . to which .the values 
seminar can .spur students on· to the 
consciousness: Fr. Hesburgh desires 
is questionable. In fact, it's question­
able if students will•. attend reg­
ularly,: much less deaL,with·',,the

consciousness lies in. the ,very: spe­

the University, .in ,which cas·e the 
:values seminar would , be:, a small
