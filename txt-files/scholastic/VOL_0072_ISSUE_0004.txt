Tonight with Johnny Hamp’s scintillating rhythms setting the musical tempo at the Palais Royale ballroom, approximately 400 couples will usher into the the Notre Dame social spotlight the annual Sophomore Cotillion.
Cotillion chairman Jack Hennessy, together with his guest, Miss Helen Keith Ransdall, Queen of the Ball from Louisville, Kentucky, will lead the grand march. As guest of honor, Miss Bernice Gorman, of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, will be escorted by Joseph Mulligan, Sophomore class president, also of Cleveland Heights.
Climaxing many weeks of preparation and waiting for the big event, members of the sophomore class and upperclassmen will hold full sway as the initial dance of the season gets under way. Each couple will be presented with a very unique dance program, as a souvenir of the evening’s entertainment. Dancing will be from 9:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m.
Saturday afternoon Cotillion patrons and their guests will witness the Notre Dame-Illinois game in a special section of the stadium reserved for their use. A Victory football dance will be held Saturday evening following the game, under the auspices of the Villagers Club, at the Progress Club in South Bend.

LINNETS SCHEDULE FIRST CONCERT
By Edmund Butler
The hard work and cooperative spirit which has characterized the Linnet organization since its formation a few weeks ago has culminated in the announcement of Father James Trahey, C.S.C., an interested supporter of this freshman group, that the first Linnet concert will take place in Washington Hail, Wednesday evening, October 26.
The remarkable speed with which this group has worked may be attributed to the persistence of Orville Foster and his proteges to make this organization one of the finest on the campus. The admirable performance of the Linnet Glee Club on the Founder’s Day program last Wednesday evening can be considered a successful accomplishment of such an aim.
Steady rehearsals are now being observed by both the Glee Club and orchestral unit in preparation for this initial' stage performance. Unique costuming and stage effects with genuine musicale style have been arranged. In order to accommodate (Continued on Page 22)

presented to the student body each year.
The guest of the University Monday evening will be Mr. Thomas B. Morgan, chief correspondent for the United Press in Italy, the Vatican, Albania, and North Africa.
The subject of Mr. Morgan’s lecture is “Assigned to the Papal Court” in which the organization of the Vatican City, the family life of the Pope’s subjects, and a day in the papal household are discussed. The lecture will also include an intimate picture of the remarkable career of Pope Pius XI, who, ascending the throne of St. Peter in 1922, showed the world that “life can begin at 65 and continue beyond 80.”
Mr. Morgan’s association with Pope Pius XI enables him to give a true verbal picture of the life and activities of the Supreme Pontiff.
Mr. Morgan is known as the only newspaper man ever to obtain an exclusive interview fith His Holiness, Pope Pius XI. Since that time he has been honored by 12 audiences with the Holy Father.
His recent book, “A Reporter at the Papal Court,” has received wide acclaim.
From the days of his reporting for the old Tri-State News Bureau, Mr. Morgan has advanced to the position of Staff Correspondent for the Associated Press in Italy and France, and also Chief Correspondent for the

“In the Lake”
We have been canvassing freshman halls for weeks in an attempt to make certain that no lake throwings would get by us. And now the first soaking of the year (as far as we knew) occurs not in a freshman hall at all, but directly across the corridor from us on the fourth floor of Walsh. “Stoop” Ortale was the very deserving recipient of the honor. With the telegraphic reports of the game coming through an hour or so late in Lee Douglas’ own inimitable way (taking us down to the field to hear the band music and all that sort of rot), Stoop spread the ugly rumor that he had hear the final score announced over the radio as 9-7 in favor of Tech. The news spread so rapidly that it convinced all of Walsh in a few minutes and even leaked out to other parts of the campus. All of its victims (we were one of them) spent an agonized 15 minutes until some smart suspicious person got the brain storm of calling up the Chicago Tribune for the final score. Then the seniors stormed Stoop’s room like a Nazi mob, dragged him down to the lake, and kicked him for the field goal that they had been waiting for so long.

Date Bureau
The assistant prefects of religion are aiding the spiritual needs of the the students by developing their libraries of good Catholic books in all three offices instead of Dillon alone. But we hear that one of the likeable young priests also has been aiding the students’ social needs. Not only did he get a sophomore a date at St. Mary's but he also procured a full dress suit and all the trimmings for him when that same sophomore was invited to the Inaugural Ball. However we don’t think you’ll have much success in getting fixed up that way any more because when we suggested that we would squelch this story if he got us a date, Father told us that he was definitely going out of the date-bureau line. And yet if you offer a book to the new library, we think that Father could be tempted. With an average book, for instance, you probably could get .the usual blind date; for a Maritain or a Dawson you would receive some one best described as “a honey”; and if you have a spare set of Summa Theologica around— well, words fail us.
Odd Ends
A double feature combination at the Palace theatre last week was appropriately arranged to read—“Three
Loves Has Nancy”—“Safety in Numbers.”.... Overheard while returning from Saint. Mary’s at 5:00 p.m. last Sunday: “My date was pretty nice. What did you say her name was?” . — The full moon was so bright last Saturday night that the boys who frequent Badin bog couldn’t resist the temptation to get out there for a moonlight game of touchball. Oh well, of course you’ve just got to use a moon like that for something. .... Of course we have no ulterior motive for saying this (just want to give credit where credit is due, etc., etc.) but we think that the present members of the Monogram club, especially the big ones with all the muscles in their arms, are really a dandy big-hearted bunch of fellows, very kind to dumb animals and all helpless creatures, and possessing no trace of any sadistic tendencies....

Odds and Ends	-
John Lynaugh came in after rollcall to a philosophy class last week, and when the professor asked his name, he actually had to think for several long seconds before he could answer— “Uhhhhh — Lynaugh.” Of course it might have been just a momentary mental lapse but just the same we’re suspicious of that type of person. It always sounds to us though he’s gotten into the habit of having to think up aliases._An anonymous informer suggested to us the fact that at the St. Mary’s Inaugural Ball which was, according to the statistics of this unknown correspondent, 75% blind date, the most requested piece of the evening was “Change Partners.” Unfortunately he fails to tell us whether it was the boys or the girls who were using this symbolic hint for new faces.... One of our English professors has been having his usual first-month troubles getting his freshmen to banish the trite phrases from their writing. When one of the first-year men wrote that the snow lay on the ground like a blanket, the exasperated professor wrote on the paper that when he read that simile, he felt like crawling under the blanket to hide.... We expected our roommate, “Splinters”- Wilson, to return from Atlanta loaded down with spoils of victory. But instead of following in the footsteps of General Sherman, he returned with the sum total of one small and very dried - out peanut plant. Nuts!....

The following men will coach the various halls: Alumni, Bob Weaver; Sorin, Bill Mahoney; Walsh, George Morris; Dillon, Jerry O’Dowd; Howard, Vince DeCoursey; St. Edwards-Old Infirmary, Jerry Flynn; Morrissey, Frank Fitch; Lyons, Milton Williams; Badin, Bill McVey; Zahm, Frank Parks; Cavanaugh, Bob Haywood; Freshman, John O’Dea, and Brownson-Carroll, Ralph Gerra.
The tournament will be rim off the same way as last year with Juniors and Seniors in one bracket and Freshmen and Sophomores in the other. Two defeats are necessary to eliminate a team in the first round, but in the final rounds one defeat sends a team to the sidelines. The winners of the two brackets will meet to decide the interhall champion. Wranglers will judge the first round of the debate, and after that faculty members will serve as judges. The first debates will be held about Oct. 19.
Oh! yes, we pretty near forg&t the question for discussion. It is: Resolved: That the United States Should Cease Using Public Funds to’ Aid Private Enterprise. This question was chosen by Phi Beta Kappa, national honorary fraternity, and will be used in all intercollegiate debates this year.

Shortall Rides Again
With six-shooters blasting and lassos twirling, the Texas boys had their first meeting in room 118 of the Main building last week. Since the last roundup held in 1936, the gang had been roaming until “Trigger” Short-all polished his boots and kicked around the campus posting warrants.
The boys wahooed for a leader, and the platform that set the guns smoking again was “Short Gun” Shortall’s howling cry; “Let’s make Notre Dame a Dude Ranch.” “Short Gun” soon selected his assitants with the approval of the whole gang. Fleming, Foley, and Fritter were chosen in order.
All lone rangers from Texas are welcome in the gang, and will be notified of the next roundup.
VILLAGERS PROMOTE ILLINOIS DANCE
By Joseph J. Miller
The Sophomore Cotillion is measured in terms of the week-end, not one evening. To fill in the lacking portion of this coming occasion, the Notre Dame Villagers are presenting their Victory Dance on the evening of Oct. 15. The Victory Dance is a custom which has prevailed for several years. However, the dance given during the Cotillion week-end is the most important. It effectively solves the entertainment for the evening after the game.
The Villagers sincerely hope that this Victory Dance will satisfy the Sophomores who anticipate an enjoyable week-end. With the Cotillion and the Illinois game to establish the standard, the members of this organization are striving earnestly to continue the spirit of the occasion.
The Progress Club, located at Taylor and Colfax streets, has been selected for the Dance. Dancing is scheduled from 8:30 to 11:30.
An active committee, selected by President Robert Rodibaugh, promises to present one of the finest social activities of the year. The Committee includes co-chairman Charles Reddy and Gene Kochanowski, assisted by Alexis Tsiolis, Bernard Hiss, William Rieke, James Jodon, and Robert Carpenter.
President Rodibaugh announced that tickets will be sold in- conjunction with the bids to the Sophomore Cotillion, or may be purchased from any member of the Villagers.
Too Many Cooks...
Two leaders in the field of the culinary arts had a chance to talk things over last week. Miss Elizabeth W. Hayward, Food Service Director at Dartmouth College, paid Mr. Connolly and Notre Dame a visit Friday afternoon. She stayed only long enough to have Mr. Connolly show her the inner workings of the University’s food preparation facilities.
Miss Hayward is the first woman director ever to be employed at Dartmouth. She has a delightful personality, a fine sense of humor, and a marked New England accent. Her first year was rather strenuous. As she expressed it to Mr. Connolly, “I had a great kicking around from everyone including the students.” To her, student publications are the bane of every food director’s life.
On her way east, after attending the National Restaurant Convention in Chicago, she stopped to see Notre Dame. She seemed impressed by the orderly manner in which meals were served and by the size of the kitchen and dining halls.

FOUNDER'S DAY TALK RECALLS THE PAST
GRID RALLY TONIGHT IN FIELD HOUSE
Liturgy	'
The calendar of feasts for October is a striking example of the teaching character of the prayer of the Church. The month begins with the feast of the Holy Guardian Angels, those invisible, and somewhat forgotten, ministers of mankind. Saint Raphael, Archangel, meaning “God Heals” receives special veneration because of his having chained the power of the devil. The Blessed Virgin Mary is honored by the feast of the Holy Rosary which unites the whole human family with the Sovereign Pontiff in humble petition to the Queen of Heaven; and the feast of her Dime Motherhood, the favorite point of attack of every heretic. The immediate entourage of our Lord on earth is represented by St. Luke, the Evangelist, and Sts. Simon and Jude, Apostles. The usual company of confessors, virgins, and martyrs fills up the lesser places, witnesses to the allembracing nature of the Liturgy. The month fittingly closes with the Feast of Christ the King, to impress once more upon the world that only to live with Christ is to reign truly.
Mass Calendar: October 16-22
First Class, Double, Semi-double etc., indicates the quality of the feast. V. R. means that a votive or a requiem mass may be celebrated, easily recognizable by the color of the vestments. Ordinarily the requiem mass, except at a funeral, will be the one designated in the missal as the Daily Mass for the Departed.
Sunday 16—Nineteenth Sunday after Pentecost. Semi-double. Second Collect, St. Hedwig, Widow, 3rd Intercession of the Saints (A cunctis).
Monday 17—St. Margaret Mary, Virgin. Double. Three times Our Lord appeared to her and revealed the mysteries of His Sacred Heart. Died 1690.
Tuesday 18—St. Luke, Evangelist. Double 2d class. Credo. Author of the third gospel and the Acts of the Apostles. Died about the year 83.
Wednesday 19—St. Peter of Alcantara, Confessor. Double. Model of penitential life. Died 1562.
Thursday 20—St. John Kenty. Confessor. Double. Apostle of Charity. Specially invoked in cases of consumption. Died 1473.

impoitance of Father Edward Sorin as the founder of the University. ’
Father Miltner discussed the power of inspiration which Father Sorin has been to the Holy Cross congregation, and recalled the early history of the Holy Cross missionaries in this country, saying:
“It is now nearly 100 years since they arrived here from cultured homes in France to take up their work in what was then a bleak wintry wilderness on the banks of these lakes. Their material possessions barely filled a single ox-cart, and their financial assets totaled slightly over $300. And yet here they were, these seven men, calmly announcing their intention of establishing an educational institution while at the same time ministering to the spiritual needs of the Indians and the white settlers in the territory.”
Father Miltner pointed out that the mainspring of human achievement is its motive; that is, that the secret source of strength to do great deeds is found in visions and in dreams.
“The founders of Notre Dame, though in outward appearance ordinary men, were possessed of an extraordinary motive, and of a vision, a dream, whose realization they believed was possible because of the motive. Another Founder had said to His disciples: “All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth. Going therefore teach ye all nations . . . whatsoever I have commanded you,

In tense anticipation of tomorrow’s football game between the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame and Bob Zupp-ke’s elusive Illini from Urbana, Ill., the entire student body of Notre Dame will throng the field house tonight for the second pep rally of the year. Student Activities Council officials announced this morning that the students will march behind the Notre Dame band immediately after supper in a torchlight parade to the gymnasium.
On the speaking card tonight will be Elmer Layden, head coach and director of athletics; Rev. Thomas J. Brennan of the University’s philosophy school; Bill Stem, NBC announcer; and Warren Brown sports editor of the Chicago Herald and Examiner.
Father Brennan makes his first appearance this evening as a speaker at a pep rally. Being the outstanding logician on the campus, he should impart sufficient knowledge to Layden’s quarterbacks on the manner of diagnosing Zuppke’s trick offense and outsmarting the Illini charges.
A frequent visitor at most of the Irish athletic contests, Warren Brown returns to Notre Dame for the first time this year. Rumors have it that he probably will explain why the Cubs folded up in the World Series, although he will finally get back to football matters.
Cheer leaders Johnny Celia, Frankie Farrell and Jerry Flynn, are on deck for the yells. And, of course, that Notre Dame band under the direction of Professor Joe Casasanta will be in full action with the victory songs.
Cigarettes! Cigarettes!
Certain flamboyant posters tacked hither and yon about the campus give details of a football contest to end all football contests. Probable interest is centered around the large numbers (1000, 500, 100 etc. cigarettes) and the fact that it costs none of what we write home for. Two game scores are to be predicted on the nose, which dims the hope of the inexact, but in case no one gets the right numbers someone wins anyway. And a thousand cigarettes, fifty packages, seven dollars and a half! Oh, boy!
Boxes wherein ballots are to be dropped are located at strategic points about the campus. Entries are collected before game time on Saturday, so this week you predictors have only a day to pick a couple of scores out of the hat.

On to Manhattan! The student special for the Army game, Oct. 29, will soon be roaring eastward, bearing a big student delegation accompanied by Professor Joseph Casasan-ta‘s Shamrock-chapeaued band. Advance notices indicate a banner sale of tickets, as S.A.C. chairman, Bob Huether, reaffirms that accommodations for this year’s excursion will be even better than last year’s Minnesota jaunt.
Additional train fare for those wishing to return to school Wednesday morning will total §6.65. Further expenses have not been determined.
Students are reminded that tickets go on sale, Thursday, Oct. 20, and Friday, Oct. 21. Official bulletins from the Prefect of Discipline’s office will be posted in the near future, disclosing at what hours tickets will be on sale.
Those out - of - towners wishing to spend Sunday, Monday and Tuesday at home following the game may do so by utilizing the “stop-over” privileges offered them through the courtesy of the Grand Trunk railroad.
de Landero Anniversary
Professor and Mrs. Pedro A. de Landero celebrated their silver wedding anniversary yesterday in Mexico City. Professor de Landero had left Notre Dame last Saturday afternoon to rejoin his wife and two sons who are spending the fall in Mexico.
Professor de Landero was graduated from Notre Dame in 1911 and returned to join the faculty in 1926. In the interim he had been engineer in charge of the research bureau of construction materials of the Institute Geologico de Mexico, and chief engineer and general inspector of the federal highways and bridges in the Mexican department of public works.
In his last 12 years at Notre Dame Professor de Landero more than anyone else has been the prime mover and constant supporter of minor sports. He organized, and coached Notre Dame’s first fencing team to two unbeaten seasons and eventually had fencing recognized as a minor sport.
His patience and enthusiasm have furnished the springboard which is throwing varsity tennis towards the front. Mrs. de Landero has been a constant spectator at fencing and tennis meets the past two years. Speaking for the students and for the minor sportsmen the Scholastic extends best wishes and congratulations to Notre Dame’s “first family.”
f Man About the I Campus
By Graham Starr
Andrew Frederic Wilson, of SCHOLASTIC fame is what you might justly call a “highbrow,” not used in the derogatory sense, but in the sense that he is an homo multarum literar-um. It is indeed a rare thing to catch this Kew Gardens, N. Y., lad with a word he doesn’t know. One reason: he is an English major under the ever watchful eye of Professor Francis O’Malley.
His room looks like a portion of the Notre Dame library, for books of
every description and size can be found strewn around the “joint,” and strewn is the right word. His scholastic average—well, you can guess it from the above facts — is in the magna cum laude brackets.
Constantly referred to as the style setter on the campus, Andy has a collection of bright clothing which is enough to dazzle any eye. Almost every color can be seen in his wardrobe, and to top that he has enough bow ties to equip a battalion of Notre Dame freshmen.
When he was in grammar school, the now associate manager of football in charge of equipment, won several prizes in spelling contests, the most valuable being a free trip to Washington, D. C.
At present Andy is putting his encyclopedic knowledge to good use in writing the weekly Scholastic column, “Splinters from the Press Box.” He made the trip to Georgia Tech, and, no doubt, bagged several splinters for his column today, unless he was too busy taking care of equipment. A veteran on the Scholastic, he has also contributed articles to Scrip, campus literary publication.
CHAMBERLAIN STAND PRAISED BY LUNN
By William C. McGowan
In Europe there is a mad dog who can be treated by England in one of two ways, according to Mr. Arnold Lunn, prominent English apologist, in his Washington Hall talk on Tuesday night. One way, Mr. Anthony Eden’s way, would be to put on a shining armor and grab for his throat in a sudden death-grip. The second way, Mr. Neville Chamberlain’s way, is to toss him an occasional bone and pray that in a fit of distemper he’ll burst a blood-vessel.
Whether Anthony Eden’s “sock him and get it over with” method is worth trying at present is a moot question, because Mr. Chamberlain bristled his moustache at a cabinet meeting last March, asked for Mr. Eden’s resignation and got it. At the same time that Mr. Eden walked out of the meeting room, Adolf Hitler walked into Austria and took over, sneering the while at the slow trial-and-error method of democracies.
Arnold Lunn sticks by Mr. Chamberlain and gives him the full credit for preventing a war early this month. “Why should England fight to preserve the Czecho-Slovak boundary?” he asks, “Russia has fought a dozen wars since 1918 and conquered far more worthy peoples than the Czechs; yet during that time no one protested that England should declare war on Russia and help the Georgians, the Ukranians and the others keep their autonomy!”
Scores Distant Critics
“I’ve heard it said—by those who read the New York Times and huddle by their radios 6,000 miles from the dispute!—that Mr. Chamberlain gave in to Hitler, when a show of force by England and France would have made him change his mind.”
“That is not true at all! Chamber-lain talked to Hitler and was convinced that he would fight if it came to a show-down.” Mr. Lunn told of this meeting and of Hitler’s annoying habit of receiving dramatic telegrams of petty last-minute news and ejaculating to Mr. Chamberlain “See that, now! Two more of my Sudetens killed by those brutal Czechs! Do you still think I have no cause to fight!” Hitler was parading police-court cases as world - shaking events and believing his own story. Yet he got his way, finally.
Next week Mr. Lunn will speak about the Oxford Group and their work under the leadership’of Doctor Buchman.

Vincentians
By Richard Fallon
Frederic Ozanam led his group to a double victory. Not only did the professors of the Sorbonne restrain - their rash statements, but at least on one occasion the professor apologized for what he had said. The effect on the audience was very encouraging. The people were being taught to think; perhaps in this we can see a turn of the tide back to a serious contemplation of God and things spiritual. Frederic went away to Italy, and came back fired with the love of Faith inspired by his visit to sacred Rome. He saw that his Catholic friends at Paris needed a meeting place. Accordingly, he proposed his plan to M. Bailly who owned a newspaper. This man allowed the Catholic party to use his offices, and he lectured to them. Soon other than Catholics came to the meetings, and it was necessary for M. Bailly to hire a larger gathering place. At these meetings heated debates were carried on. It occurred to Ozanam that these gatherings would not mean much to the St. Simonians. They had asked for a display of action; the young lawyer felt that the best way for the Catholic party to show it was Christian would be to have it Christlike, a worker in charity. Ozanam recognized himself as only one of eight founders of this new group, the St. Vincent de Paul Society. These “eight poor young fellows” increased to two thousand in Paris in less than 25 years, and the St. Simonians passed out of the picture. As good as the work was that the young Society did, still there were those whom it did not reach to instruct them on the doctrine of the Church. With this in mind, Ozanam was fortunate in hearing the Abbe Lacordaire deliver a sermon. Here was the man that could lead Paris back to Christianity. After a trying delay, Frederic’s request that the Abbe deliver a series of sermons in the Cathedral of Notre Dame was granted by the Archbishop. The effect of these sermons was amazing! Men and women from all walks of life went to hear Lacordaire, and the little band of St. Vincent de Paul was grouped about the pulpit, it has been said, like the vanguard of a victorious army.
Anthony Donadio, a Cavanaugh Hall boy " and member of the Linnet Glee Club, may be heard as soloist on the “Mother of Perpetual Help Novena” program on . WFAM every afternoon at 4:45. Donadio, and Martin Weideman, another Linnet Glee man, have been added to the choir of St. Joseph’s Church in South Bend.

Mr. L. H. Eells, faculty advisor for the Forum, gave a short talk in which he thanked the members for being chosen counsellor. He offered his personal services in an advisory capacity to anyone wishing to visit his office. He stressed the fact that his advice was available not only to the Commerce Forum as a group but to the members individually.
Dean James E. McCarthy, guest speaker of the evening, was introduced by the president who complimented him for coming to the opening meeting after only a few reminders. The Dean urged all Commerce men to be active and not passive in their political news and activities, bringing out the fact that political organizations play an important part in the program of a" government.
Tom Reardon, Chairman of the Board of Directors, has scheduled a meeting of the board which will immediately precede the general meeting.
The next meeting of the Forum will take place in the auditorium of the Cushing Hall of Engineering Wednesday evening, Oct. 19, at 7:45 p.m. At this meeting the new faculty members of the College of Commerce will be guests of the Forum. They will include: Professors Raymond P. Kent and H. F. Klingman. Mr. James Dincolo, instructor in finance, will introduce the new faculty members to the students. Refreshments will be served, and cigarettes will be complimentary to members and guests.

____________Radio________________j
By Bernard J. Feeney
At this writing the new Fall season is in full swing. Old programs, after the usual summer vacation, have reappeared once more. Other broadcasts are bowing in for the first time. Yet with this new start there remains the very significant fact that commercialism hag taken over experimentation. This is exemplified by the expensive hours bought by advertisers. Most of these productions hinge around the variety type, the formula of which is now trite to the intelligent listener — namely full orchestra, vocalist, one movie star at $2,000 for a “hello public,” and a comedian with a repertoire of humor of the 1900 variety — this last with due apologies to the very few better comedians.
The search for big names on these shows has usually ended with the selection of a Hollywood celebrity. While this has often proved good entertainment value, it has lessened the chance for the development of new radio talent. The sponsors, almost universally, appear afraid to take the time to allow a new personality to achieve national popularity. We can understand the sponsor’s side of this particular phase, yet it is hard to see why such a standardized formula for their variety shows should be forthcoming all the time. Initiative in the construction of program make-up has been greatly destroyed by this seemingly satisfactory viewpoint. Thus Mr. and Mrs. Listener will have to be content with last year’s glamor shined up for this season. .
There are two exceptions to this satisfactory feeling, and both of them deserve recognition for their pioneering efforts. We are referring to the Columbia Workshop presented on Thursday evenings from 9:00 to 9:30, and the Mercury Theater on Sunday nights from 7:00 to 8:00. These two have made the only attempts to experiment with radio drama. Preceding their time, radio drama production had lagged in material, transitional music, and exploitation of the microphone’s ability to transmit delicate voice tones. They have changed all this, and as a result C.B.S. deserves great commendation for its work. More new ideas such as these two programs have shown would greatly increase radio’s entertainment value.
Lest we overlook local radio doings' completely, it • should be stated that auditions are still being heard. There is a special demand for persons who would like to write scripts. Everyone interested should come to the next meeting to be held at 8:00 o’clock Wednesday night in the campus studio, located on the top floor of Cushing Hall.

I Music Notes \________________________________
By William Mooney
This is a story of Arturo Toscanini, the most widely acclaimed of all the modern maestros. It is not our purpose to review his life or to praise his genius. We mention him here, because he is the index to the subject of which we are about to write — the subject of music and nationalism.
Music, it often has been said, is universal, transcending all political and geographical boundaries. This is music as it should be, but not always as it is.
The political, economic, and social life of Europe is suffering in confusion and turmoil. We read of this on all sides. But less conspicuous in the the news is the cultural aspect of European life — music, art, and the sciences. Less conspicuous, perhaps, but equally as essential to the complete life of the people.
Toscanini is a great individualist, and he is inclined to speak unfavorably, at times, of conditions in Italy. Such freedom of speech does not meet with the approval of Mussolini. Consequently, the two have never been friends. Toscanini has been vacationing in Italy, but when he applied for passports to return to America, he was forbidden to leave. Mussolini included the realm of music in his determination to command. Every concert, he decreed, must begin with a certain national hymn. But Toscanini refused, insisting that music must be allowed freedom both of creation and presentation. The matter of passport was settled according to Toscanini’s wishes. Only a man of his greatness could demand such independence.
Nationalism and music takes on a grimmer aspect in Germany. There musicians are told how they may compose and what they may play. Jewish music in all forms is outlawed. The attitude of the government is hard to understand. Why should the enjoyment of music be restricted because of political and religious differences ?
Music in Russia also has suffered from time to time because of political agitation. The works of Rachmaninoff were once banned and the great pianist-composer exiled, because his opinions were at variance with the existing government’s.
Only here in the United States do men and women maintain a reasonable viewpoint on music. We love music for its own sake. A typical American concert will present compositions by Tschaikowsky, a Russian; Wagner, a German; Mendelssohn, a Jew; Debussy, a Frenchman; and Deems Taylor, an American. In 33

Backstage “rumors” had it that a play had already been selected for the opening presentation, but we found out that you can’t believe “rumors.” Several excellent plays are under consideration, and we expect the next week or so to unfold the story. Possibly we’ll find the Players “goin’ Broadway!” Gadzooks! The ghosts of Bernhardt and Booth will

be entering into competition with our “pet” ghosts of Washington Hall. For many years, we have heard that there’s really a ghost over there, but, try as we might, we were never able to make him come out of hiding. Come to think of it, though, it is possible that the sound effects of “Journey’s End” drove him — or it — out of his peaceful domain last year and he has fled to more quiet parts. Ghosts are sensitive things!
At the last meeting of the Players the most important business on hand was the election of officers. Vin Doyle, of “Captain Hardy” fame, (Journey’s End) received the coveted office of president by an almost unanimous vote. The other officers are Vern Witkowski, vice-president, Bob Blake, secretary, and Bill Cotter, treasurer. By way of reference to the office of treasurer, Mr. Mills said that the duties exacted would be very slight—and no pun is intended there, stage whispers to the contrary.
All members of the Players have heartily endorsed a proposal that everyone taking part in the presentation of this season’s vehicles sign the Little Theatre pledge. This involves the memorizing of roles and actions in as little time as possible, prompt (Continued on Page 23)

The current exhibition in the Library consists of 24 paintings—the work of Carl Hoerman, Rudolph F. Ingerle, and Tunis Ponsen.
Carl Hoerman’s finest canvas is his “Taxco Cathedral.” As the name suggests the cathedral of the town of Taxco is the main object of the painting. Rising among green hills the cathedral is surrounded by the small Spanish dwellings of Taxco. But it is the play of light and shade, of sunlight and shadow on the various structures that delights the observer. The effect is one of the bright vigor and strength, the immediate impression that a Carl Hoerman canvas invariably gives. And those clouds floating over the cathedral—ah, they bespeak a masterly touch!
Following Hoerman who has six or seven other paintings on exhibition of almost equal merit, we have Rudolf F. Ingerle. The difference in their style is immediately noticeable. Ingerle is more delicate, more refined; he is firm yet light of touch. His most valued work is “Aunt Winchester” which is listed at §850.00. Yet to this observer his “Tranquillity” is the more impressive work. This 1938 Prize Winner has completely captured one of the most fleeting of nature’s moods—the light of the moon as it plays upon broken cloud banks lending a silver tone to the lake below. In “Tranquillity” Ingerle has fixed intangible beauty for our enjoyment.
The third artist on exhibition is Tunis Ponsen. Somehow his work carries a more somber note than that of the other men. Perhaps this is because of his use of solid color in large areas; and because of his frequent use of greens and blues and browns giving an effect of oneness to his color range. His leading canvas “Shipyard,” valued at §300.00, is typical of his other works. Despite its touches of pure color it retains that distinguishing gray quality that is so characteristic of his painting.
A new exhibition of contemporary work will replace the current display next week.
Foster Programs
Mr. Orville Foster, assistant director of the campus radio studio, is presenting a series of programs on the organ in Sacred Heart Church Sundays at 5 p.m. These informal recitals offer a fine visitation period, both for meditation and classic ap-precTation.

spoken to anyone else other than their immediate companions. A situation such as this, which exists in most of the larger clubs, not only discourages club attendance but does nothing positive in the way of having the men from their own neighborhood or city meet each other.
To receive the familiar “Hi ’ from a friend is fine. It is certainly welcome when it comes from the Rector, and better still, from one’s corrector. However, this practice of acknowledging another man is a poor substitute for real friendship.
Notre Dame is proud of the spirit that is found on the campus. It is everyon’e business, then, to meet the men they live with. Prove to yourself that the ancients were correct in saying that “a friend is another himself.” —John J. Kohn.

Magna Civitas Magna Solitude
THE ANCIENT Latin adage, Magna civitas, magna solitudo, was aptly used by Bacon to show that a great place, no matter where it is, is lifeless and miserable without friendship. This same adage might well be applied to our own campus.
One of the reasons why students do not bother to speak or associate with more members of their own residence hall is the single excuse that they have not been introduced. Yet, if his neighbor’s sister came to visit him on a Saturday afternoon, she would have a number of his “stranger” friends calling in to borrow a dictionary— or even the Aeneid—if necessary.
Another sore spot in the social relations about the campus exists in the state club meetings. Many of these meetings are conducted with all the stress and strain of a semester examination. Too often the gro'ips of two’s who attended the meeting come and go without having
Truth and the State
AST Saturday an angry mob broke into the archepiscopal palace of Cardinal Innitzer in Vienna, seriously damaging the building and its contents, wounding the person of the Cardinal himself. Newspaper accounts report that numerous persons in the crowd wore Nazi uniforms.
These events have significance for us as Americans, special signficance for Catholics. Whatever may have been the Viennese Cardinal’s personal political convictions, the fact remains that as a private citizen he was forced to undergo inexcusable indignity.
This is not a “pointing-with-pride” attempt to say that such a thing could never happen in “free America.” It is rather a reiteration of repeated warnings that this thing could happen here. Were circumstances to remain static, of course we would be relatively safe. But we can never know what next year or even tomorrow may bring, and it is necessary when thinking of the future, to ponder the unpleasant possibilities along with the pleasant ones.
It is clear that if we are to prevent such atrocities here, we must look to the cause, to communism and dictatorship and the totalitarian state. And it is equally clear that under no circumstances should we as Americans and Catholics support in any way a government or faction based on false principles—no matter what it stands for, nor whom against.
Therefore, it behooves us always to maintain at least a personal policy of isolation from what is contrary to objective truth.—Mark J. Mitchell.

The Great Lover
BY Q. V. MANLEY
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, — JUMP. One, two, three, four. . . . Seven squares of sidewalk and then a driveway.' The eighth square looked just like all the others, but it was a trap door, and if you landed on it you went down, down, down, into a black pit where an ugly monster would laugh at you before he ate you up. Ha, ha, ha, and his ugly fangs were showing. His breath was hot.
Turn the corner, — stick our your hand, move your arms like on a steering wheel, straighten her out and walk for four blocks, then across the street, the third house, ring the bell, and pop! — there she is. She would look prettier than ever. He had known her three months last Tuesday and to-day he was definitely going to kiss her for the first time. If he didn’t get scared. Gee, she was a swell kid! He was learning those dance steps pretty well, but he didn’t want to learn them too fast. They were too good an excuse for dates. She was fourteen for two months, and he was still thirteen until next month. She didn’t look any older than he did though. He wondered if it-would make any difference. Three months. But love could overlook a lot of things.
He was still surprised at himself and those notes in Latin class today. He took the wrinkled paper out of his pocket and looked at it. “I wrote a poem about you.” “I’d like to see it.” “I’ll recite it for an appropriate reward this afternoon.” “Reward depends on whether it’s good or not.” Gosh, that was a hint all right. He guessed she must have really meant it when she said she liked him a lot after the movies last Saturday afternoon. He had held her hand. It was a good poem all right, though.
I know a young lady named Terry. Wherever she is she is merry.
She always is neat,
And always is sweet, And besides, she is beautiful, — very.
He bet she’s like that. Funny how they all called her Terry. Short for Theresa, but it sounded like a boy’s name. Bill Terry was a dope. Didn’t know how to manage at all. The papers all said so, and they ought to know. The Yankees could beat the .
Giants any day of the week. He liked the Yankees, — they were all right.
As soon as he got her in the right mood he’d recite that poem for her and then he’d collect his reward all right. Gosh, he was a regular Clark Gable. Love ’em and leave ’em, that’s what his motto was. He could make up poems like that for any girl, — just change the rhyme a little. Helen was always using perfume; he could say somethin’ about smellin’. Then there was Eileen, that ought to be easy, Bene, cene, dene, fene, gene, grene, green, — no, that wouldn’t fit. Lene, mene, — mean, ... I know a nice girl named Eileen, And she is anything but mean, — nah, not so hot, nope, nope, oh, there — that’s' it! And she’s nice if you know what I mean. . . . And then — let’s see, pene, quene, yep, — queen. She is always neat, And always is sweet, And she’s better than any Movie Queen. Wasn’t quite smooth enough yet but he could make it fit in all right if he worked on it.
Two hedges right in a row. He was a hurdler and he leaped over them and stuck his chest out to break the tape. He turned around to congratulate his opponent for getting so close to him just like his cousin Bob did in the college meets. Gosh, Bob was the one who told him all about the big line you have to sling them. “The women love it,” he had said. “You’ve got to show ’em what’s what.” Ha, ha. Once Bob had taken him to a football game, and he had been riding in the back seat with Bob up front with one of his steadies. He couldn’t help listening in a little and he had caught some of Bob’s line. Nuts! If that was a sample of it that he had heard, he could beat that any day. Now this poetry idea was really subtle. His line really had it all over Bob’s, and Bob thought he was such a great lover. Ha, ha.
One more block now. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, — JUMP. Gosh, he’d been stepping on the trap doors all along and he hadn’t even known it. It’s a good thing they had been locked. But there might be an open one any minute now. One, two, three, . . . Wonder what he could talk about? The dancing and the new steps, of course. Bu he’d better get something in reserve. He could tell her how he was going to play shortstop with the Maple Street Boys’
Club. And then there was always school. Gee, Terry, was I embarrassed today in Bio! I was sitting there dreamin’ sort of, — I’d tell you who I was dreaming of but it might make you conceited (a squeeze of the hand)—and all of a sudden Mr. Horner called on me. I didn’t hear the question, but George, the louse, whispered “feathers” to me. So I very innocently said “Feathers.” Then they all laughed, and I found it was cats they were talking about. Gee, did I feel dopey! She’d get a kick out of that.
Across the street now. One, the brown house, two, the white, and three, the green. He was glad she lived in a green house because, green was his favorite color anyway. Up the front steps and ring the bell. Well, here goes nothing! He brushed his hair back—it had become mussed from the hurdling, but it had been worth it because that race had been the turning point in the meet and he had won it.
“Well, young man, I’ve been waiting for you. Do you realize that you’re two minutes late?”
“Oh gee, I’m sorry, our .clock. .. .” But she was laughing—he had never heard a priettier laugh in his life than hers—and he knew now she hadn’t really been mad at him.
He went in and said hello to her mother and hoped she was well, and wasn’t it nice weather they’d been having. And then after a little while her mother left and they began dancing. He was even clumsier than the last time at first, but he got better, and soon he was really improving-Terry said he was better than most of the fellows she knew who thought they were good dancers. Boy, she really knew her stuff about dancing too. He told her all about being short-stop (she said she was proud of him) and all about the feathers. He didn’t mind her laughing at him because her laugh was so pretty, and he thought it was a good joke,— though not at the time he didn’t. Anyhow he said that if she had been there she probably would have felt so sorry, for him she would have burst right out crying, and that made him feel good. The only thing was he got scared a little and didn’t mention anything about it being her he was dreaming about. Oh well, she probably guessed that anyhow.
]2_________________________________
After a while he ran out of things to talk about, and then she brought up the poem. He said he thought maybe it would be better to wait until next time, but she reminded him that he had promised. He just kept on dancing and asked how he was doing now, but she took his hand and led him over to the sofa. They sat down, and she looked up at him and said, “Please.” He sure was in a spot now.
“Well, I don’t know if I remember it so well,” he said. “Maybe I’d better wait until I know it better.”
She shook her head and he guessed he’d have to go through with it. His throat felt very thick and dry, and his stomach was funny. His breathing was hard, and then suddenly it began coming out.
“I know a young lady named Terry.
Wh-whereever she is she is merry. . .”
He paused and wiped the water off -his forehead. Gee, she looked serious with her eyes so intent on him. “Go on.” She tightened her hand on his as she said it. Then it began coming again. ■
“She always is neat,
And always is sweet, Andbesidessheisbeautifulvery.”
He finished up that last line with a terrific rush and wiped his forehead again. At first she didn’t say anything, just looked at him as if she were very happy. Finally she spoke, and she looked right at him as she said it.
“I think that was very, very nice, and it was certainly very sweet of you.”

Her eyes were shining like she really meant it too. He said he was glad, and then she said she supposed he wanted his reward, of course. He asked her if maybe she didn’t think her mother might not be around or something, but she said her mother was busy in the kitchen and wouldn’t mind anyhow. Then she pouted her lips up towards him to be kissed. He noticed the front door was shut, and it was silly to think of running out anyhow. He squeezed" his handkerchief into a tighter ball in his hand.
All in one moment the world was whirling about, and the room was spinning around like the “Soupbowl” at Coney Island, and the flickering and shaking of light was exceeded only by the shaking of his own knees. Andthen suddenly his face was swaying towards her, and he pecked out a kiss on her lips.
Have a Heart
By B. A. Sport
Recently I heard a student say that he thought it would be conservative to estimate that approximately twenty per cent of the student-body use electric razors. At first I was so horror-stricken that I blurted out (in a very ungracious manner) that such an estimate was based wholly on fancy, and unsupported by any of our more rational thinking colleagues. It was the vigor of my denial that put down the “heresy,” but only for the time, for a little later I was quickly overwhelmed by an enumeration of various members of our own group (a rather representative group) who were victims of this craze for electricity. Not without bitterness, I was forced to admit that the evidence all pointed to the fact that I was the schismatic, and they, the orthodox thinkers. >
If I was horror-stricken at the estimate you can well imagine that I was thunder-struck with the facts! The necessary consequences of so radical a change will be felt for generations in these parts of Indiana. Can you imagine the day when shaving will become so easy here that an unshaven face on the Notre Dame campus will be just something read about in old files of The Scholastic? These newfangled ideas are destroying all the tradition of the old place, and I think
it is high time that something was done about it. Perhaps the “old order changeth, giving place to the new,” but there is a point where we must draw the line, so let us not weaken at this point. Rather, — let us resolve to settle this thing by a fight to the finish! May I suggest that all who are confronted by these facts take unto themselves the personal responsibility of winning back those perverts who, in their own class, have become shave addicts.
I understand that a few years back, another of our traditions was jeopardized by the advent of the sport-back sack coat, which was practically irresistible to the majority of our men. But just as the reformers were about to give up their struggle to restore the sweater to its former place of high standing, some ingenious manager of an Eastern knit mill brought out quite a knatty looking sport sweater and thus saved the day for Notre Dame. The present crisis, though, is different and we must not count on any outside twist of fate to win us ground: the crusade will have to be conducted entirely within the bounds of the campus.
Since my purpose is simply to expose the situation, I deem a'lengthy discourse on method of reform quite
out of place. Perhaps if a committee could be formed to present the case to the Main Office in an attempt to remove the ban on something else, say, from automobiles or airplanes to electric razors, we could carry on the work with a certain semblance of constitutionality. Another good approach to reform is through the conversion of stray sheep; appeal to his sense of justice (if you think he has any) pointing out that in behalf of his fellow-hallmen, a great number of whom are ardent radio-fans, he should drop that infernal beard stinting machine, if not for tradition’s sake, at least because of the ungodly racket it makes on the radios. With “Buck” Benny coming up, and the football season on, what nerves can stand the blurring out of that last stale joke or goal to go?
Be, therefore, on your guard, reformers, missing not a single opportunity to fight for a tradition that Is . so dear! Let us then adopt the slogan of the International Correspondence School of Stenography: “Now is the time for all able bodied men to come to the aid of their campus traditions” (the slogan seems to have suffered somewhat a change, but anyhow, it is apt!). Fight now while success is not ■ exactly out of our grasp! REMEMBER, WE ARE AT THE CRISIS!

EIGHT TEAMS OPEN INTERNAL!. PLAY
Sparked by the most exciting play of the new year the Interhall League inaugurated its regular season Monday afternoon. Eight teams, six of them freshman aggregations, participated.
Badin Hall, opening the soccer rivalry, fell in the last minute of play to a Junior team that was pressed to the limit to snatch a 2-1 win. Undoubtedly the best played game of the year, and, considering the early date, one of the swiftest ever played at Notre Dame, the contest stood deadlocked at the half, 0-0. Both clubs tallied early in the second half to establish the tie that remained until Norv Hunthausen free-kicked the clinching goal into the Badin nets.
In the Touch Football League the boys from Zahm Hall registered a double win over the Freshman Hall representatives, the Blues exhausting the Freshman Blues, 6-0, in the first encounter, and the Golds overwhelming the Freshman Golds, 13-7. The other engagement of the afternoon found the boys from Brownson Hall easily submerging the Cavanaugh eleven, 7-0.
Frosh Tourney Goes Into Semi - Finals
Jim Murphy of Detroit and Jack Barry of Boston were the first entrants to reach the semi-finals in the fall Freshmen singles tennis tournament. Murphy eliminated Bob Sibil-sky, 6-0, 8-6 to gain the round of eight.
Barry reached the favored round by mastering Joe Rorick, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4. Sibilsky landed in the quarter-finals by toppling ;T- Rourke, 6-0, 6-0.
In other matches, Don Peterson downed Bill Fallon, 6-4, 0-6, 7-5; Frank Platt defeated Jack Donavan, 6-3, 7-5. Left in the upper bracket were: Joe Doyle, Peterson, Jack Welsh, Murphy and Joe Lewis.
The lower bracket had Platt, Barry, Tom Mills, Santo Belli and Ed Moore still in the running early this week.
Illinois Team, Band Here For Battle
By Robert B. Voelker
That massive “IRISH” spread across the top of this page will become a marching field of orange and blue and brass tomorrow afternoon as the famous University of Illinois “a capella” Band, 180 strong, leads Bob Zuppke’s Illini gridders into battle at Notre Dame Stadium. And Zuppke’s football team bears just as famous a reputation as Professor Harding’s band.
Most interesting change at Urbana this year is the switch from light to heavy tactics. The Illinois forward wall averages 200 pounds, but the backfield remains about the same. Jay Wardly, a mere 180-pounder, will be at quarter, with Ralph Ehni, a smart, swift sophomore, ready to do relief duty. Wardly is the boy who ran 40 yards to a touchdown in the DePaul game. Ehni is the squad’s best punter and an excellent passer.
Ralph Bennett will be at fullback to do most of the passing and kicking with James Phillips and Wilson Schwenk as his understudies. Bennett is a good blocking back, Schwenk can punt, and the versatile Phillips can play equally well at end, center, or fullback.
Tony Mazeika, the 155-pound pony who led the wild charge against Northwestern last November, is top man for the lefthalf post. Zuppke says Tony is “the most finished back” on the squad. Charlie Purvis, distant kinsman to the Purdue Purvises, should get the call at righthalf.
The end positions have caused the Illini the most trouble this year. Previously injured, Bob Castelo, who has glue-tipped fingers for snagging passes, should start, though he is not physically fit for a tough grind. Bob Zuppke, nephew of the coach, will take over when Castelo needs a rest. George Bernhardt, a hard tackle and blocker who loves football, and Bob O’Neill should be able to hold out at the other terminal post.
The Illini have a seasoned line from tackle to tackle. Captain Jim McDonald will play center and will be supported by a potent array on both sides.
CANALE WINS FALL NET TOURNAMENT
Displaying a sensational comeback after losing the first set, Don Canale, diminutive Memphis freshman, defeated husky Olin Parks for the fall ' University singles tennis championship. Scores were 1-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-4.
Both Canale and Parks are freshmen. Because of their outstanding performances in tournaments during the past summer, Pedro de Landero, varsity tennis coach, allowed the first year men to compete in the upper-class event.
Canale’s high ranking in the Southern, Eastern and National Junior championships is likely to give him a rating among the first six junior players in the nation. Parks reached the quarter-finals at the National tournament.
Parks, who hails from nearby Mishawaka, lost but one game as he captured the first set. Canale discovered the game which provided victories over Defending Champion Bill Fay and Varsity Captain Fred Simon to beat Parks and clinch the University title.
Varsity Netmen Win
Bill Fay, upset by Freshman Don Canale in the fall University tennis championship, defeated the Memphis youngster in a three-set match Sunday as the Varsity netters downed a Freshman aggregation, 4 to 3. Fay’s win over Canale provided the margin of triumph in a hard-fought match. Scores were: 3-6, 6-4, 7-5.
Olin Parks, Freshman, defeated Whit Gregory, 6-2, 7-5 and Varsity Capt. Fred Simon lost to Ed Moore, Frosh, in three sets. John Walsh Varsity, mastered Jack Barry as Heckler, Varsity, downed Santo Belli, Frosh, in straight-sets.
In the doubles, Canale and Parks toppled Gregory and Simon, 6-4, 7-5. Walsh and Heckler won the final match of the day, beating Moore and Belli.

CHAMPAIGN, Ill., Oct. 14.—(Special to Notre Dame Scholastic)—There is a new spirit in the Illinois football camp as Coach Bob Zuppke and his Fighting Illini approach the hour when they will meet Notre Dame at South

peaks of the 1938 Illini gridiron schedule.
ing that Zuppke and his charges will be out to win this game. But a loss will not make the Illini feel their year is a failure. They have the idea that they can go on in later games against Northwestern, Michigan, Ohio State, and Chicago to fashion a splendid season average.
Zuppke, frankly, is afraid of Notre Dame. “They’re smart over there,” he has said. “Elmer Layden puts on his pessimism act and makes everyone think Notre Dame’ll be lucky to win a game and then they come along and bowl over everything in sight. Here, we get one or two men of average Big Ten ability and they start talking about a championship team. It just makes it all the harder.”
Illinois’ chances of upsetting the Irish will be greatly enhanced if the players again demonstrate the Fighting Illini spirit that was apparent in last week’s 12 to 2 win over Indiana and in the 0 to 0 Notre Dame game last year. This spirit is perhaps the Illini’s biggest asset. In pure ability they are inferior to many teams they beat.
Zuppke’s chief worry this year— pass defense—has been so tremendous he has barely had a chance to fully develop some of his outstanding linemen and backs. Ohio University beat the Illini on passes to open the season and DePaul scored its touchdown here by passes. Last week Indiana totaled 209 yards through the air but could-not connect in scoring territory.
Intensive drills in this phase haven’t given him much time to work with the offensive potentialities of Sophomores Cliff Peterson and George Rettinger in the backfield. Considered excellent prospects, neither has measured up to expectations as yet.
The best phase of Illinois’ game is its line which in three games has held the combined opposition to a net loss of four yards. This forward wall is composed of four lettermen and three sophomores. Ken Zimmerman and Bob Castelo, ends; Jim Reeder, tackle, and Capt. Jim McDonald, center, are the lettermen whereas Guards George Bernhardt and Wes Martin and Tackle Tom Riggs are sophomores.
In the backfield, Jay Warley, senior, and Mel Brewer, junior blocking quarterback, team up with Peterson and Rettinger. Replacements are excellent in the line, but not so in the backfield. -

THIS WEEK:
ILLINOIS plays Notre Dame.
CARNEGIE TECH plays Holy Cross.
Notre Dame’s southern invasion met with unexpectedly potent opposition from the Georgia Tech Yellowjackets down in sun-baked Atlanta, but by staving off two last half Tech drives, the Irish eked out a 14 to 6 win. The score doesn’t tell the true story of the inspired fight put up by Tech led by Capt. Jack Chivington at center. Until Zontini intercepted Gibson’s pass late in the first quarter and ran it back to the Tech 42 yard line from where Notre Dame scored in three plays, Chivington was up and down the line making tackles everywhere to stop the Irish backs cold.
Tonelli’s twisting run off left tackle to the Tech 18 yard line set up the first score. After an offside by Tech and a short buck, Tonelli again took the ball—this time to his right, and drove nine yards for the touchdown.
Seconds before the first quarter ended the Irish shock troops came in en masse. Hofer called for a quickkick on first down from his own 30, and the punt went only 20 yards against the strong wind, — an unfortunate break, because on the next play the teams changed goals and immediately Georgia found itself. An end-around play, Beers to Thrash, gained 30 yards and a first down on the Irish 17. Al Mooney stopped thrust after thrust, but on fourth down with a foot to go, Ector hurtled over the goal. Hart raced in to kick the goal, but missed.
A 70-yard boot by Cavette put Notre Dame back on its own 5, starting the last quarter. On an exchange of punts Tech reached the .Irish 27, but three plays netted a 5 yard loss. Gibson attempted to kick out of bounds, but the kick was blocked. In a wild scramble Notre Dame recovered back on Tech’s 43. Sheridan gained 20 yards by skirting the Tech left end, Peipul bashed through guard to the 20 yard line, and Morrison added an 11 yard power dive to the 5. Piepul took the ball over in one quick lunge. Morrison’s placekick seemed to remove Tech’s last chance, but the Georgians came right back with the next kick-off and drove 66 yards to the Notre Dame 2 yard line in a beautifully executed series of passes, end-arounds, double reverses, and one lateral to Chivington. There, with first down, two to go, Tech fumbled, and Augie Bossu fell on it, ending the Tech threat.

GAME RECALLS FEAT OF HERING'S TEAM
•
In the autumn of 1898 Notre Dame met Illinois on the latter’s gridiron. This marked the first football meeting between these schools, which today are ranked close to the top in midWestern football circles. The Irish were the victors in the ’98 contest, and 39 seasons passed before the mini attempted to gain revenge. While they failed to win last fall they provided the pigskin patrons with one of the major upsets of the year when they held a highly touted Blue and Gold eleven to a scoreless tie. Tomorrow afternoon the Illini will make their first appearance in the local stadium and they will be anxious to square the count with their first victory over the Irish.
The gentlemen who made up the Notre Dame schedule in 1898 were severely criticized for drawing such a tough opener. University of Illinois had too much, the Irish supporters thought. Even in those days Notre Dame played “suicide schedules.” Coach Hering made the journey to Champaign, nevertheless, accompanied by a squad of Irish who were determined to make the schedulemakers look good. At half time there was no score. After play was resumed, Eggeman blocked an Illinois punt and Rev. John F. Farley, C.S.C., then a student, recovered for Notre Dame on the 38 yard line of the home team. The Irish then drove to the 10 yard line where they were stopped by a fighting Illini forward wall. Capt. Mullen called for a field goal and held the ball while “Chuck” Fleming kicked. The ball split the uprights, and Notre Dame took the lead, 5 to 0. (Field goals counted five). This was of particular significance because it was the first successful field goal ever’ witnessed in the Middle West.
In the last quarter the Illini came back strong, and on three occasions were able to go beyond the Irish seven yard line but they lacked that extra punch needed against a fighting, charging forward wall. As a result the Irish came back to the campus on the long end of a 5 to 0 score.
Last year, while the result was different, the pre-game dope was somewhat similar. The Irish had trounced Drake while Coach Zuppke’s men had shown little against Ohio University and DePaul. The Irish made more first downs, more yardage both from scrimmage and in the air, but when they went deep into Illinois territory a fumble, a penalty, or a fighting Zuppke team prevented them from entering touchdown land.
Introducing
By Eddie Huff
This is the story of Paul Ernest Kell, varsity right tackle of Notre Dame football, and one of the three squad men who have won the “N.D.” twice with a third award coming up.
Paul intends to work for the Continental Canning Company when he is awarded his B.S. in Physical Education at the June commencement. Al-
ready he is fixing for his future work by “canning” the opponents’ left guards.
Paul is the gran’pappy of the right side of the Irish line this year. There is not an experienced man to the right of Ed Longhi in the front line, and Kell must produce both strength and acumen as Elmer Layden’s right bower.
Kell, secretary and treasurer of the Monogram Club, is an only child of German - Irish parentage, but the neighbors in Niles, Michigan, insist that Mom ’n Pop Kell have “plenty” of children—six-feet-two, 210 pounds worth.
Paul is remembered as “Killer” Kell, campus wrestling title holder, who threw Joe “One Horse” Race in the sudden death match at the Bengal Bouts last spring.
Princeton, 200 miles downstate in Indiana, claimed Paul at birth, but at present he makes his home in Niles, Michigan, ten miles north. Paul won letters in basketball and football at Princeton High, but when his family moved to Niles, he reached greater heights to become All-State tackle in ’34.
While playing for Niles High, Paul was pitted against Earl Brown, present varsity left’ end and basketball captain-elect, who was “winging” it for Benton Harbor High.
Paul says, “Earl induced me to come to Notre Dame; after one game against him I decided we should be wearing the same colors.”
"B" SQUAD IN DRAW WITH WILDCATS
•
Notre Dame’s “B” squad maintained its undefeated record, although held to a 6-6 tie by a heavier, more experienced Northwestern team last Saturday, Oct. 8.
The starting lineup had: Ends, P. Sheridan and McDonough; tackles, Hollendoner and Ames; guards, Albert and Ziiendel; center, Rogenski; quarterback, Kelleher; left-halfback, McGannon; right - halfback, Dcody; and Leonard at fullback.
The game was a see-saw battle from the beginning and neither team came close to scoring in the first half until, with only a few seconds left to play, Bob Koch intercepted a Northwestern pass and almost broke away for a touchdown. He was brought down from behind by a desperate tackle, though, and the half ended with the score 0-0.
Halfway through the third quarter Bill McGannon made a sensational run of almost forty yards. He was knocked out of bounds on the two yard line. From there Bob Leonard plunged over for the first touchdown of the game. Kelleher’s attempt for the extra point was wide. Notre Dame led 6-0 as the third quarter ended.
Trailing 6-0 in the last quarter, and with their running game bottled up by an immovable Notre Dame line, Northwestern took the only alternative, and resorted to passes. Not all of the passes were complete, but with only five minutes remaining in the game a forward pass off a reverse was good for the touchdown which tied the score. With the score tied 6-6 Al “Whitey” Lee rushed in to block Northwestern’s try for the extra point. Notre Dame was again marching down the field when the final gun went off.
One of the most pleasing aspects of the game was the hospitality which Northwestern campus showed the visitors. The squad was taken to the North Shore Hotel for dinner after the game, and was then treated to the Northwestern-Drake game.
Next Saturday, Oct. 15, the “B” team journeys down to the home grounds of the University of Hlinois in an effort to better the 6-6 tie which was the final score last year.
Cross Country
Notre Dame’s unofficial cross country team has a weekly time trial every Saturday afternoon, after the football game. On the Saturday of the Georgia Tech game, results from the battle line didn’t stop pouring in till five o’clock, so Coach John P. Nicholson’s boys had to run in semidarkness.

SPLINTERS FROM THE PRESS BOX
By Andy Wilson
Thanks to the brawn and bulk of the Irish, their first trip to the Deep South in ten years was a success. Tech, light but rangy, exceptionally speedy, and highly inspired, showed most of the fight, and most of the daring, but the Irish, with their timing and play-execution ’way off after a smart exhibition against Kansas the week before, finally won on sheer physical strength.
Our statistics, borrowed from Publicity’- Man Joe Petritz, show that Notre Dame had only 11 first downs to Georgia’s 10, but that the Irish outgained the Yellowjackets from scrimmage, 253 yards to 179 yards. Georgia Tech’s biggest statistical margin over the Irish was in punting, with an average of 44 yards in nine kicks, to 37 yards in ten kicks. The best ball carriers for Georgia were the ends, Thrash making 29 yards in one run, Ison averaging 7 % yards for two runs. None of the Georgia backs could average better than 3 yards from scrimmage, but the Irish had four men, Sheridan, Simonich, Tonelli and Saggau, averaging better than five yards each time they carried the ball.
The sluggishness of the Irish against Tech was another instance of the “second-game psychosis” that has been afflicting Notre Dame teams for the last couple of years. The second game in 1936 was an unimpressive 14-6 win over Washington of St. Louis; in 1937 it was a spiritless 0-0 tie with Illinois, and this year it was the 14-6 victory over Tech. The Engineers were smooth and deceptive and hard-fighting, but the Irish were definitely not the team they were against Kansas. The one aggravating thing about Notre Dame’s play was the mental lapse of the whole team on the run that set up Tech’s touchdown —the end-around by Thrash. For it was noted in advance by the Irish coaches that end-around plays were Thrash’s specialty, and he was to be particularly watched when he went in the game.

Mourn Meier Death
Richard Meier was quiet, devout, friendly, modest and withal a brilliant mind. He loved argument, formal or informal, and offered to debate anyone at any time, on any subject and on either side. As president of the Wranglers he found a vent for this urge to debate, yet much of his time was spent arguing on campus walks with a half-dozen students at a time. He enjoyed that most of all. Richard Meier was graduated as valedictorian of his class in 1937; and for his outstanding place in extracurricular activities he was given one of the Dome awards.
After graduation he was taken to St. Mary’s hospital in Minneapolis where he died last Sunday night. The Scholastic joins his family and friends in their sorrow at his death.
Former Irish grid stars who will face each other as collegiate coaches this week are: Jimmy Crowley and Mal Edward (Fordham vs. Purdue); “Slip” Madigan and Matty Matthews (St. Mary’s vs. Portland).

SO THEY SAY
Overcoming unexpected stubborn resistance, Notre Dame unloosed two offensive thrusts today to conquer an inspired “rambling wreck” of Georgia Tech, 14 to 6, in renewing an intersectional rivalry before an overflow crowd of close to 30,000. Elmer Layden’s smoothly - functioning gridders drove for touchdowns in the opening and closing periods. Otherwise, the offensive penetrated no farther than the 29-yard line. The Irish backs, Lou Zontini, Mario Tonelli, Bob Saggau and one Edward Francis Simonich, spearheaded an attack that humbled the gallant efforts of the southerners. —By Kenneth Gregory, Associated Press.
Notre Dame’s green horde met a southern sun and a Georgia Tech team at the boiling point today and were happy to escape both with a 14 to 6 victory and no sunstrokes. The Engineers played the Irish on even terms, and instead of offering merely perfunctory resistance carried the fight to the ancient foe from South Bend by land and by air to the great delight of 30,000 people here for Tech’s fiftieth anniversary.—The Chicago Herald and Examiner.

CAGERS PREP FOR TOUGH SEASON
•
Head Coach George Keogan sounded reveille two weeks ago Tuesday, and 22 contenders initiated the rivalry that will culminate in the basketball team of 1939 at Notre Dame.
The new squad includes 11 returning varsity men, and 11 sophomores. Only Eddie Sadowski represented last year’s starting five, Moir, Nowak and Wukovits having been lost by graduation, and Earl Brown, captainelect, being busy with varsity football.
Several players who saw action in ’38 are returning to fight for first team berths. They are DuCharme, Ellis, Klier, Ertel, Gaglione, Sitko, Wagner, Walker and Smith. The new names, seevral promising ones among them, are Smith, Zigenhorn, Gillespie, Riska, Del Zoppo, Ryan, Yezerski, Rehme, McInerney, Schoo and Fitzgerald.
The Irish open their season in the first week of December, and play 21 games, instead of the usual 24. Highlights of the year are expected to be the contests with New York University, which will visit Notre Dame for the first time, and with Michigan, which comes here for the first time in many years. The Keoganmen will not meet Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania or Colgate this season. Instead they play Syracuse, and John Carroll of Cleveland.
With wild cries and excited eyes, one bright night not long ago, rampant freshmen ran wild over the lawn near Sorin, seeking to dunk one of their members who had been convicted of something heinous, just what no one seemed to know.

METROPOLITAN MEN INITIATE SEASON
•
The Metropolitan club, one of Notre Dame’s outstanding geographic organizations composed solely of residents within a radius of 50 miles of New York City, inaugurated its 1938-39 season with a Communion Breakfast last Sunday morning, according to a statement from President George O’Neil.
Over 60 members w’ere present for the meeting at which Rev. John J. Reynolds, C.S.C., was the principal speaker.
The club, boasting a membership of 220 students, one of the largest in its history, already has conducted two semi-monthly meetings, installing new officers and planning a program for the year.
An orientation meeting for freshmen was held several weeks ago, and to date, more than fifty 1942 men have been admitted to the group.
A new feature in the club’s program, a golfing and tennis tourney for members, is already under way. John Celia, chairman of the sports committee, will present gold cups as trophies to the winners in each division.
It is rumored in high authoritative circles, that the alumni in New York are planning a ball in honor of the active members during the Army-Notre Dame football excursion, although no official statement has reached the campus.
The officers are George O’Neil, president; Vincent Turriano, vice-president; Tommy Philpott, treasurer; and Bill Clark, secretary.
The Board of Trustees: Bill Mullini, Westchester; Frank Baumert, Long Island; Joe Mangano, Brooklyn; and Tom Maker, Manhattan.
Meetings are held every other Wednesday, and all members including freshmen are urged to attend the next, scheduled for Wednesday.

NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC
FOUNDER'S DAY SERMON
(Continued from Page 6)
and behold I am with you all days even to the consummation of the world.” Inasmuch as they were successors in this world-wide apostolate of those first disciples to whom Christ spoke, they rightly believed that His words were addressed also to themselves. What else could they conclude but that He also would be with them in their work?”
Father Miltner later on brought out by means of an analogy the similarity between living things and a society or institution, in that living things retain something of their beginnings, while an institution is organized for a definite end or purpose.
“If therefore Notre Dame is to be true to the end for which it was founded, observant of the laws of the present, and to face the future with unruffled hope, then she, too, must be continuously animated with the spirit of the founders, the spirit of Divine Faith.”
In concluding his sermon Father Miltner pointed out that no persecution of the Church was ever more wide-spread or more violent than the one being carried on today. And he went on to say:
“If we, like our founders, but realize that we, too, are marching to the command of oui' Blessed Lord to go and teach all nations and that He is with us teaching and preaching, teaching and praying, then we shall not fear, nor shall we fail. We shall simply say: God wills it. Who shall prevail against us?”
Slide Rules Can't Win
Reaffirming the old adage that engineers can’t think without slide rules, Carl Doozan’s doughty Lawyers soundly trounced Frank Fransioli’s Engineers, 36 to 6, in a touch football game Sunday on Brownson field. ' And the victory was won without the aid of technicality.
It was, however, a costly victory for the Lawyers who will be without the further services of Edward (FBI) Boyle for the remainder of the season. The speed merchant limped off the field of battle with a pulled muscle.
Chemists to Hear Talk
Dr. Carl S. Miner, director of the Miner Laboratories in Chicago, will address members of the St. Joseph Valley, American Chemical Society, at their monthly meeting, in Chemistry Hall on Wednesday night, Oct. 19.

LINNETS FIRST START
(Continued from Page 3) the entire student body, two performances will be given.
Some time during the year the Linnets will offer two compositions written by local composers. One of them is the work of the Rev. Eugene P. Burke, C.S.C., director of the radio station. Father Burke is an adept arranger and composer, having contributed one of the hit songs for a student show last year. The number, entitled, “St. Mary’s on a Sunday Afternoon,” was rendered in the Monogram’s production of “Absurdities.” Mr. Norbert Engels, professor of English, will offer his composition, “The Visions.”
The Linnets is comprised of a choral group of 85 voices and a 25-piece orchestra, distinguishing them as the second largest campus music organization.

THEATRE
(Continued from Page 23) attendance at all rehearsals, and a willingness to cooperate with the Director in every way possible. Members of all Little Theatres throughout the country have discovered that this pledge has been directly responsible for existing harmony among companies and for the development of well-knit theatrical organizations. When we consider that it takes, on the average, from five to six weeks to prepare a show for the “openingnight,” we can readily understand how discord and delayed rehearsals will hamper production. To delay a rehearsal means that the rehearsal will not click smoothly. It tends to make the other members of the cast jumpy and irritable. Over a period of weeks, lost minutes can add up to quite a few hours, and, at a university, where men are sacrificing their time to partake in theatrical work, those lost hours can mean a great deal—possibly an 80 instead of a 90. After all, we’re all scholars under the skin. N’est-ce pas?
Note on the stars! Vern “Moonshine” Witkowski — who’ll ever forget the hill-billy role he played in “Moonshine” last year? — spent his summer with the Wayne University theatre group. The boy is really good! Bob Blake served with the Marine Corps at San Diego, California. He has his eye on a commission after he’s graduated from N. D.
"Boy's Town" at Colfax
The picture “Boys Town” starring Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney, which opens Saturday, Oct. 15, at the' Colfax Theatre, is considered by numerous movie critics as a new high in screen entertainment. The drama, based upon the Boys Town established 25 years ago by Father Edward J. Flanagan just 12 miles outside of Omaha, has everything that makes for a great screen production.
In the first place there is Spencer Tracy who tops his previous performances, impossible as this may seem, with a characterization destined to live forever in the minds of all who see him. As the idealistic priest who stakes his all on the theory that “there is no such thing as a bad boy,” he turns in a performance which once again makes him a candidate for the Academy Award.
Starring with Tracy in one of the most dramatic roles of his entire career is little Mickey Rooney. Mickey “gives everything” as the tough, nonconforming little brother of a gangster, turned over to the custody of Tracy. Heading the supporting cast is Henry Hull.
“Boys Town,” as brought to the screen, is the true narrative of the town that now exists and is still headed by Father Flanagan, who traveled to Hollywood as technical adviser on the picture.
