The Obscurer April 1, 1989 


Boy, I love writing Inside Jokes about myself 
I too am not a bit tamed .... I too am untranslatable, I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world. 
-Walt Whitman, "Song of Myself' 
I love myself. It's not just because of the fact that I am great enough to attend Neuter Dream, even though that should be enough for me, but because I get to write this Inside Joke in the Obscurer. 
The greatness within me extends far beyond my own ravishing good looks and stunning personality, but the added (albeit unneces­sary) confidence given to me by this reassurance ofmy popularity via the Obscurer. Thousands ofstudents are getting to read about me over their lunches, but that doesn't flatter me -I feel that I had it coming to me. 
Not only do I love myself, but my friends love me. My friends take time out oftheir weekends, as well they should, to nurse me back to health after I get bombed out of my mind on Friday nights. After the Friday before the Super Bowl, I remember that I didn't need any 3-D glasses to watch the halftime show on Sunday, believe me! But my friends served me faithfully that weekend, even though I have never been one to ask for a lot when I am sick, physically orotherwise. Or at least I think they helped me. 
I'm getting ahead of myself. Did I ever tell you about the time that three football players came up to me during a party and compli­mented me? Maybe it wasn't a compliment, but like my friends, they paid homage to me. I find the football players' humility after winning the national championship for me to be really touching, and kind of cute. I like that. 
I graced ofone ofthe players' rooms with my presence during his hall'sS.Y.R. and took a photo ofhim as supplication totheideaofme. I stuffed it in my clothes for the rest of the evening as a demonstration of my gratitude. I think he loves me, but to be honest, I'm not as interested in him as I am in myself. 
I only wish that the rest of the world could be as truly wonderful as lam. But things, being things, bug me. Bugs bug me. My evil twin, who has been seen by me in some ofmy drunken s_tupors at that local drinking hole, the Collectives, is responsible for bugging the hell out ofeverybody, including me. Advice like "Don't Worry, Be Happy," makes me mad, especially when I'm not happy. Poor dining hall food bugs me, because Iain so much better than the substandard fare that is served to me. After all, I should be catered to -and no one else. Unless, of course, I say so. 
I find that South Bend is utterly abhorrent to me. I could write a better jingle about this area provided, ofcourse, that I could include references to myself. 
Incompetents run South Bend, particularly in the airport, where 
pathetic cheerleaders are allowed to get in front of me in line. I'm 
better than almost all people, but especially cheerleaders. Anyhow, 

Jane Zarathustra 
Significant Nothing

just because I lost my car (an honest mistake, I swear), it was no • excuse to be rude to me when I got to the airport ten minutes before take0 off. Can you imagine a plane taking off without me in it? 
Once_ I had an interesting conversation with a freshman of , comparatively little worth to myself. Her ideas were so unbelievably • quaint and inferior that I had no other choice than to pull out my album of my Obscurer Inside Jokes -which I compile for my forthcoming sure-to-be-bestseller autobiography -to demonstrate how far above, her I was when I was her age. After talking to me, she reconciled herself to my greatness. 
GREATNESS. GREATNESS. GREATNESS. I can't stress this word enough. Even my clothes are great. My Keds, for instance, have a primal quality of downright greatness that suits me fine. Check that -they suit me great. 
Even if I were a world-class swimmer, I would probably have Lo talk about that at that detestable tradition, Junior Parents Weekend. I won't have to worry about that next year, because I am so great I was selected to the London Program, and unlike all of you sorry people who were worthless enough to get rejected from that.program, I'll be getting plastered in the pubs of that fair city. 
Sure, people may be better athletes than me, or better scholars, or get better grades, but I firmly believe that no one can match the boundless quantity of my quality. After all, I've made the big time·

Notre Dame's Annual Scandal Sheet 

Think you have all the answers? Got an inflated opinion of yourself? Regret the day you ever set foot in South Bend? 
Then join us! 

Sarcastic is now looking for angry young men and women to berate the admini­stration for everything it does during the next year. Sound like fun? You bet it is? 
Any Notre Dame or Saint Mary's student who got a 11 D11 or better in his or her freshman writing course and gets a kick out of seeing his or her name in print is eligible. 

Help us carry our EGOS! 
Sarcastic won't be one of them. If the Duke were alive he'd slap your collective faces. Patriotically, Klearly Slanted 
Nostra Daumus "just like home" for freshman 
Dear Editor, 
As my Nostra Damus comes to a close, I must stop and reflect upon the joys and sorrows that constituted it. I will admit to feeling, many times, lost in the shuffle; a ; multitude of new challenges in the first month alone left me feeling lonely and unim­portant-I just felt so far away from home and those whom I would see everyday, those who loved me. 
It happened one night as I was, as usual, closing out the library. It being a Thu~day

night, I was met along the way back to the donn by many upperclassmen beginning an early weekend. Seeing and hearing these fellow Daumers stumble about, talk obnox­iously, and violently experience reverse peri­stalsis into the numerous waste receptacles placed strategically in the light of the all so sacred gilded Dome, made me long for home no longer. Seeing them in such a decrepid state, I realized that Nostra Daumus had everything I had at home. I longed no more for the city streets and the whinos in the train station, the students have taken their place. 
In such a time of many trials and tribula­tions as freshmen year can be, it is nice to find thatone can look up and smell the ethanol and realize -"Nostra Daumus is home." 
Thank you Sarcastic, thank you Nostra Daumus, 
B. Willard Freshman 
Joel: please let me play 

Dear Editor, 
Will you please let me come perform for you guys again? I promise not to sing that Catholic song. Honest injun. I'm getting pretty bored of playing at the Ivy Leagues and bar mitzvahs. Won't you please, please in­vite me? Heck, I'll open up for Krokus or Whitesnake! Anything! I'll even have Christie sing backup in a fishnet bikini! Religiously, Billy Joel 
Thanks for the sweater 

Dear Editor, 
Well, thank you very much for the neat sweater. I can't tell you what it means to me to have p~ple in the street say "Hey! Aren't you that guy who portrayed the famous Uni­versity of Nothin Doin football player George the Ripper?" Gosh, it really makes me tingle inside. Boy, this sweater is swell! Do you suppose you could send a pair of George's underwear for Nancy? She'd be ecstatic. Ex-presidential!y, Ronald Beggin 
I'm not Fred, O.K.? 

Dear Editor, Get this straight, once and for all. My name is not Fred, okay? That's some guy 
from Bedrock. 
In the flesh, Ted Bolclear Nothin' Doin' linebacker extraordinaire 
P.S. I swear I was injured for a whole season! I swear it's true! Well, it is.

'Quiche-O-Rama' to Wow Neuter Fame 
Year ofSexual Adversity feast to be dining hall party ofthe year 
University Comestibles Czar Still Icky has announced a new dining hall theme night to honor "The Year of Sexual Adversity." This new gastronomical jamboree, entitled "ItAlso Means Happy!!!" has been described by Icky as"a veritable Quiche-0-Rama." Noting that "pink, pink, pink will be the color of our deserts," Icky has also considered putting chocolate-covered bananas ~n the menu. To add an additional festive air to the proceedings, Village People album covers will decorate the salad bars, as well as illustrations from the popular children's coloring book Which Bathroom Should Johnny Use? lcky's pride shone bright as he concluded, "No interior design major will be eating cereal this night!" 
The Office ofStudent Frivolities has announced that the Brady Bunch will now act as the official mascots for the upcoming"Year of the Family". "They're white, they're straight, they're rich and they have no sex drive," said Joe Kissamee, directorof student frivolities. "Who better to represent Neuter Fame family values?" Neuter Fame students greeted the decision with glee. "That Greg sure is dreamy!" said an anonymous female freshman. 
Chanting, "Demand call-waiting! Give us the basic services 
we deserve!" 2,000 angry students stormed the Administration Building and threatened to "be really unchristian" if their demands were not met. Insecurity Director Tex Lockjaw , who stated that he hadn't seen anything like the riot since the Captain Crunch brouhaha of 1984, blamed outside AT&T agitatators for the ruckus. Luckily, tragedy was avoided when rumors ofa surprise 8 a.m. marketing quiz were disseminated among the protesters, leading to their immediate retreat to the library. "I think they had a good point," wrote Heave McGarglelee, noted controversy expert. "They just went about it the wrong way." Sturgis Coca-Cola, Obscurer news editor, summarised the event best when he said, "Protest? What protest?" 
Journalistic history was made yesterday as the Obscurer final­ized its plans to merge with the Dartmouth Review. "It was a marriage made in heaven!" said Obscurer propagandist in chief Crass Smurphy. "We belong together like prayer and school," agreed Review columnist Adolph Mussolini. The new paper, called Heil Mary! will, according to Mussolini, "feature as much student input as the recent alcohol policy committee." Added Smurphy: "That's nothing new for Utter Shame." 
Neuter Dream Minister ofLove Father Rave Bison announced that standard-length couches and traditionally upholstered sofas in MisFortune Student Center and dorm 24-hour lounges will be re­placed by shorter, narrower and firmer casual furniture in a press conference for "The Year of Sexual Diversity." "The old couches were too traditional, and offered no incentive to innovate," said Bison. "They just perpetuated complacency through the stereotypi­cal roles and positions that the students used." 
The new couches, two feet shorter than the normal six to seven. foot couch length and narrower, offer bold new oppotunities for Gomer couples. "I think it's afaaabulous length, and one that pushes the hormonal relationship between male and female toward sexual equality," said Bison. "Now the taller partner has to do all the work to accomodate his or her partner. Think about that. Gosh, the possibilities are endless." The couches' innovative hard wooden annrests should also add to Neuter Dream amorous associations. "Hey, we've all seen that kitchen sink scene in Fatal Attraction, right? Neuter Dream is just keeping up with the times," he said. "It is time for the long, comfortable couch to go the way of Lucy and Desi's twin beds. This is a dramatic progression ofcouch technology, and Neuter Dream sits poised on the threshold. We have to press on." 
The University of Neuter Lame announced today that it had pared down its list of potential graduation speakers to four. The candidates include South African President P. W. Botha, Penthouse columnist Xavieria "Call Me Madam" Hollander, "Cheers" star George Wendt, and noted television talk-show host Sally Jesse Raphael. "Rumors that President George Bush will speak are greatly exaggerated," clarified Neuter Lame President "Lead" Alloy. "We feel all the candidates have exhibited qualities which merit confer­ring upon them an honorary doctorate." Hollander, who writes a sexual advice column, admitted she was suprised at the news, but also noted, "If any school needs my advice, it's Neuter Lame." Wendt wanted to know if open containers of alcohol were allowed on campus before he would speak. Raphael said she would feature the school on her show if she were selected. President Botha offered, • "It would be good to see some of my old friends again." 
Major changes are in order at the University ofNothin' Doin' after the institution was purchased by mega-money magnate Donald Trump. In what was referred to by Trump as "the purchase of a podunk school from a bunch of putzes for a paltry $3.65 billion," Nothin' Doin' officials are bracing themselves for sweeping modi­fications of epic proportions. Tuition will be increased over three hundred percent to $50,000 per year to compensate for mandatory pinstripe suits, nightly meals offilet mignon, and the new solid gold statue ofTrump to be placed on top of the Dome. In addition, more business classes in arbitrage, money market fund investment and insider trading will be offered. Also, the University ofNothin' Doin' will now be known as The Revered University of Money and Power (TRUMP). Asked if he thought that the move would be met by student opposition, Trump said, "Ifyou don't like it, then get the hell out! Who wants you zipperheads anyhow? I've got a huge building in New York City, and you don't! Ha!" · II

Like a Brick Through an Embassy Window 
An obscure release.by Lou ·Read and the latest by the Squires -as well as a stunning local live performance -show what rock'n'roll is all about 
Lou Read: South Bend 
RAC Records 
It's a little known fact that the latest vinyl suicide note by America's favorite. depressed ex-glam ex-junkie, Lou Read, does not mark his first exploration into the seedy underside of a major American city. 
Two months before the release of New York , Read presented RAC records with the even more depressingSouth Bend , a field guide to despair in the greater Mishawaka area. RAC marketing expert Hugh Moonan 
was less than enthusiastic: "Lighten up Lou," he reportedly said. "If you're off the heroin now, act like it for Crissakes!" Thus, Read was forced to lighten the tone of his album and attack a more cheery locale. 
But South Bend is still available on bootleg, and for the leather-clad, self-de­structive set, we have decided to reprint some of its classic lyrics. 
In "O.C. Deathtrap," Read paints a frightening picture of South Bend law en­forcement: "I was dancin' at the party when the dogs burst in/teeth marks on alumni-a tattoo that spells sin/They say a keg's worth a lot of doughnuts down on Corby Street/ when you put tape over your badge, the kids all look like meat." 
Even the University of Neuter Dream is not impervious to Read's sting, as can be heard in the haunting "Catholic Wasteland": "Brian stapled his transcript to his face dur­ing his Arthur Anderson interview /He blamed the whale at the Commons, but we know that just ain't true/Leprechauns on Oprah shooting shamrocks in their veins/ Cheerleaders lifting weights claim there's steroids in the rain." 
This theme is captured once again in "Easter Parade." Watching all the brightly­clad Neuter Dream students filing out of Easter mass, Read ponders where they will be in 10 years: "Bridget never heard of South Africa, so she went in to Animal Rights/ Sean swallowed Drain-O when he discov-

Cover of the Squires' Form True House 
ered urban blight/Mary has six kids, reads them Phyllis Schafly before bed/Warren's president of AT&T but his wife still won't give him... the time of day." 
Clearly, this is vintage Lou, and the instructions on the cover should be printed in big, brash, bold letters: Run, don't walk to your local seedy guy loitering on the comer and ask for the bootleg with the Read on· the cover injecting green beer. Then, grab a bottle of cheap gin, a picture of the girl._ who broke your heart, a razor blade, and \this record, head on down to the laundromal on Christmas Eve and enjoy South Bend in _its proper setting.

Poor Notto Blame. Ifits students had to rely on the idiotic saps who write music reviews in the Obscurer, they would miss out on a lot ofgood music. A LOT of good music. 
Take the Squires new album.Form True House , for example. Ifyou were to believe the hack who reviewed it in the Obscurer on March 21, you would•think that this album might be a good buy if you were feeling experimental, stoned, rich -or all three al 

once. This guy must be joking. I 
The simple truth ofthe matter is this: The ! s·quires are the hottest, the hippest, and best ' new band that has hit the college scene in years. Imagine the Replacements, R.E.M. in 
their pre-sellout days, the Del Fuegos, Los I · Lobos, and the Sex Pistols all wrapped up •m ' I one musical package and headed by a cerc· ; bral, writerly guru somewhere in the middle i of Lou Reed, Elvis Costello and David I Byrne. 
Meet the Squires. 

As if their debut album, The Hairball Oracle, weren't enough, the Squires have i crushed the sophomore jinx witharecordthal leaves Oracle in the dust. 
From the successful neo-psychedelia of its opener, "Clowns," to the hard-driving, Ramone-like "Fantastic Disaster," Squires lead vocalist John Ferroni switches styles with masterful precision. 
It is clear that Ferroni, who co-writes the Squires songs with the enigmatic lead guitar· ist, Dr. Mike, is the spiritual force oftheband. Both he and Dr. Mike specialize in writing about the existentialist dilemma of .the 


postmodern fragmentary experience. They blend not only art, but philosophy and litera­ture as well (the oest examples being the tingly juxtaposition of Shakespeare and Nietzsche in "Fantastic Disaster" and refer­ences to Beckett in the post-apocalyptic set­ting of "Snowmen Glow") into a cohensive whole of immense dimension. 
To suggest that Form True House is merely another piece of groovy vinyl is wrong. Their instrumentals, "Forever Never" and ''.Schizophrenic Tuesdays," are seamless, so remarkable for such a young band. 
Their music transcends the simplejuxta­positions ofPicasso and Gertrude Stein: they have added noise -an essential clement of urban angst. Long live the anxiety of dis­chord. 
Alan Far-Out and the McKrishnas 
Live at Ted's Place, March 31 
Last night, campus tie-dye band Alan Far­Out and the McKhrishnascrashed into Ted's Place like a rock through an embassy window topromotetheirnewalbumPeace,Like,Now Man. Lead vocalists Marianne Abroad and Misty Amsterdam lost no time launching into the opening lines of the title cut Why must we all kill each other? Why oh why can't we be brothers? Peace Peace Peace Mass destruction by the hour Killing bees, Killing flowers Peace Peace Peace 
Other highlights included Maria Braque, after a prosaic tribute to liberation theology, dr,ving her point home with a heart-felt ren­dition of the "Chico and the Man" theme song. 
Perhaps the boldest political statement, however, was is~ued by bassist Miguel Lee­vis. After a ripping version of his pro­Palastinian "Commune ofPeace" he made a desperate plea for harmony in the Mid­dleEast by immediately firing up the Jerry Garcia dance mix of Havah Naguila. "Wow!" noted one audience member. "It reminds me so much of-um-what was that decade again?" 
Administration officials were less enthusi­astic. "Just who do these young upstarts think they are?" asked Emperor emeritus Theodud Hapsburgh. "I was in the civil rights movement before they were even born! I was in Latin America while they were still sharpening their crayons! Why, I was just telling my good friend Nappy Duarte the other day ..."

So says N ostra Damus housing officer Ambivalent Lightbolt -but like everything else at N.D ., there's a method to the madness 
P 
erhaps the fondest memory an undergraduate will carry with him from the University of Nostra Da­mus will be the time spent in one of the university's numerous residence halls. It is indeed a disgrace that the nerve center of habitation on campus -the housing office ­has not received more press. These unsung heros committed to the happy, comfortable and, most of all, shackled ex­istence of students on campus has undergone some changes through­out the years, but it will always stand as a testa­ment to the abundant care with which admini­stration officials suffo­cate students.

third floor under the infamous gilded Dome, reveals the well-oiled workings ofthis office. Cards confirming reservations for the fall of '89 tumble in from every conceivable comer ofthe civilized world, and all receive the full, thoughtful,attentionofthehousingofficials. 
Housing Director AmbivalentLightbolt wholly agrees with that fine assessment: "Incoming fresh people had their choice of dorms for years, but university higher-ups saw this as giving them a false sense of believing that they actually had some imput into how their life here should be. We teach them early now to understand that their piti­ful little opinions mean nothing in the big picture of Nostra Dam us. We at housing, of course, loved that idea. In fact, we came up out the intervention ofthe counseling center. Still, a few friends are seen to come from freshmen rooms; friends who even decide to live together again for one or two more years. 
"Whatcan we do?" Lightbolt sighs, "We can't predict that some of the herd might actually be so diverse as to be compatible. We do all that we can to supplant disillusion­ment and submission, but it goes awry some­times." 
But the housing office's duty goes far beyond preparing the student for four years of submission. From the framework of con­trol and subordination to the strict enforce­ment ofpedantic decorating rules, the Hous­ing Office sets into motion the code to which everyonemustadhere. The 1988-89rulesfor 
the construction of lofts read like a Frank Lloyd Wright/Buckminster Fuller textbook. Student complaints that these rules arc too rigid and not applicable to all situations regularly receive careful consideration by the office and then are tightened further with one explaination: students simply do not 
understand the philoso­phy behind such rules. Any student who bothers to visit the office is laughed at, patted on the back, given a big Havana cigar, and escorted out of the Bolden Drome by campus security. 
"Can't the students understand that we are trying to teach them to read instructions?" asks Lightbolt. "Or maybe you don't understand. Here, let me do it, you 
She then explains the housing office credo as her eyes roll mysti­cally around in their sockets. "Therules serve a three-fold purpose for all students. First, for business majors, when they spend all that money they will make on expensive toys for their children, wouldn't it be nice to know how to read the assembly instructions? "Second, for Arts and Letters majors, by further complicating the construction poli­cies, we make absolutely certain that they cannot possibly build any space-saving structure whatsoever.

"The rabble on this campus simply don't know what the facists up there in housing are trying to do to us," Goshdaminy cries. "I have gone almost four years having to walk-yes I said WALK -to the shower every morning. The phones have no call waiting options. I ask, 'Where are my rights as a human being?' No call waiting! I've been living like an animalforthepastthreeyears! I mean, I can't miss a phone caH! I am in student govern­ment for Goshdaminy sakes, I'm too impor­tant." 
Despite all the criticism and finger­pointing, the housing office has been imper­vious to it, and should remain so for a long, long time, according to its director. 
"What students should realize," Lightbolt chuckles, "is that the housing of­fice simply doesn't care. Why should we? We have them eating out of the palm of our hand. We could put them in a study lounge in Pangborn if we so desire. 
"Can we do that, you ask? Ofcourse we can. We are the housing office and they are nothing but lowly students. Only when they become rich alumni and donate huge sums of money -preferably over $3,000 per year ­will they get any respect from this place. And ifthey give enough money for anew dorm for us to rule over, then, well, they get the red­carpet treatment. If only we could have alumni with.out students. Hey, now there's an idea ...Here kid, have a cigar." ll 

only the price they pay for being able to get through four years with the ability of never having to take a challenging class -the pov­erty thing is especially applicable to PLS majors. 
"Third, scientists, architects and engi­neers should be happy for that chance to brush that summer dust off of their protractor before classes begin and get your drafting urges satisfied.They'll need to plan to get all that technical stuff into their dorms anyway, and shouldn't rely on computers to do it all the time." 
Lightbolt, puffing a big Havana cigar by now, took out a red pen and started marking dorm transfer cards with boldly written "No"s. After a few cards and some sinister cackles, she went on. 
"The philosophy of housing is a simple one. Why should we help the students have . any fun when they are going to be on their own anyway? This goes against the long standing scholastic tradition upon which Nostra Dam us was built. Education must be 
propagated in the manner of Aquinas, the dull barren room." 
There have been those who have at­tempted to fight the system, although unsuc­essfully. One visionary, Bob Goshdaminy, thought he could make life better for all and saw a vision of how Nostra Damus might move into the future. Goshdamnity, now a pathetic babbling idiot living in the basement of Holy Crass Hell, explains what he did as a

Unexpectedly, Utter Shame got greedy, ac­cording to some underworld figures who had moved in on the action and were in cahm.1ts with the ticket office. They demanded 70 ·percent of the action from the criminals, but the criminals didn't like it and walked. The ticket office, desperate for substi­,tute thugs, went looking on the Utter Shame campus. They found replacements in Utter Shame student government officials. Be­tween the end of 1988 and the beginning of March 1989, high-ranking student govern­ment officials were contracted by the ticket office to con tine the illegal wave ofcrime on their unwitting constituency -on the ticket office's terms. Most of the conspirators were happy with the new arrangement, although reve­nues were down from before. Blatant incom­petency on the part of the student leaders caused a massive downturn in ticket office funds, and on top of that, some students on the inside were uneasy with the deal.

decided to act. Unknown even to his own vice-president, White Paste, Boyle contacted Obscurer news editor Sturgis Coca-Cola about what was going on. But Coca-Cola, after a quick check ofthe Disassociated Press news wire, found no such story on the wires and told the despondent Boyle that there was no hope of it appearing in the campus news­letter. 
Angered by rumors that Boyle was get­ting scared, ticket manager Tyke "The Wea­sel" Popcornski sent a few of his trustworthy goons to pay a little visit to Boyle's room. They ransacked his room and rearranged the furniture, paying close attention not to knock over any ofBoy le' s num berous house p !ants. Not finding Boyle, the goons went into Mis­Fortune Student Center. Dragged kicking and screaming from the Huddle with the tacit approval of campus security, Boyle was stuffed in the trunk ofa '68 Impala and driven out to an unknown location in northern Indi­ana. 
Since returning to campus, Boyle has not said a word to any one. "It's a dam shame," said Coca-Cola. "He was real nerv­ous about something. But I've been check­ing, and the Disassociated Press hasn't done anything yet. It sounded more like a sports story anyway, what with the tickets and all. And he never mentioned that place in Yugo­slavia, Medupouring." 
In the meantime, off-campus crime goes unchecked. Just a coincidence? "Not hardly!" says John, stuck for life in his new, padded home in the correction facility. "And by the way, now that you're done with this interview, get that damned camera out ofmy face." II

Cincinnati Reds Manager BEAT HOSE was banned for life from Major League Baseball yesterday following re­ports that he welched on a Neuter Dame fencing wager. Commissioner A.

Administrative officials sadly announced-Friday that, due to a severe outbreak of scurvy and beri-beri on the team, Neuter Dame will have to play its entire 1989 schedule in an empty stadium. So as to prevent a large-scale epidemic, only those members of the press corps who show proof of immunity will be al­lowed to attend the Eyewash games. Coincidentally, similar outbreaks of these diseases have been reported in Arkansas and Minnesota. 
Eyewash freshman fullback ROD­NEY GULLIVER scored for the first time last week at Southern California. On a dive play up the middle, Gulliver eluded FRANCOIS LA FLEUR, that outstanding French tackler, and burst through the Trojan defense for the home run-er, touchdown.

Tired ofstagnation, Neuter Lame administators call for massive changes, prompting massive student free thought and expression 
Impromptu concerts broke out all over campus after the announcement of the huge changes in school 'policy. J. Jonah Jameson 
Extra-special to Sarcastic 
T 
he Neuter Lame administration, with the full support ofthe Bored of Untrustworthies, has decided to implement sweeping changes at Neuter Lame beginning with the 1989-90 school year. "It's high time we began listening to student input on this campus and stop acting like stuffy, old, authoritarian wind bags," an­nounced Neuter Lame President the Most HoliestReverended "Lead" Alloy. "For too long we've ignored the mostimportantgroup on this campus: the students." 
Chairbeing cif the Bored of Un­trustworthies Daffy Keyhole was in com­plete agreement. Keyhole, while sipping on a Pepsi, said, "I'm tired of being portrayed as the bad guy. If the students are paying so much money, they should have a University they can be proud of." Keyhole added that as a first step, the University would divest from companies with holdings in South Africa. "We are a Catholic university and it's high time we began acting like one," he exhorted. "And by golly, these students on the steps of the Sad Building every Friday afternoon are so right that I'm going to recommend that Coca-Cola divest, too." 
Anti-Broadside Network student leader Jim-Bob Checkmate, when learning of the decision exclaimed, "Oh boy! Now I can have my Friday afternoons free." 
But Neuter Lame student government officials were quick to react. "This is far too progressive and hip for our own good," said student buddy senator Rat Beerman. ''Hey, I'm inconstant con tact with my constituency via my dorm representatives and monthly newsletters, so I oughtta know. We don't want all this freedom stuff." 
Following Keyhole's announcement of divestment, Alloy introduced Neuter Lame Vice President of Student Despair Fr. Ike Tiesun to outline some of the other changes. 
"Beginning in the fall of 1989," Tiesun 

. began, "we will offer co-educational housing to our students. For too long we have turned a deaf ear to the student support for co-ed housing. Virtually every other top university in the nation has co-ed housing. If we want to compete with other high-caliber schools, we must offer the same high-caliber social and academic atmosphere." 
Tiesun added that the University will step up its plan to admit more women than 
men in the following years in order to bring 
the male-female ratio to an equal level. "We 
will make a great effort to accomodate every 
student. We think the plan is effective and 
logical. It just makes sense." 
Next Tiesun introduced Vice-President ofResident Strife Don Moldpicker to present the changes in Doo Wop, Neuter Lame's book of rules and regulations. Moldpicker said the all-hall social events, previously limited to one per semester, will now only be limited to one per weekend. The University would not provide the alcohol, but alcohol will now be provided free in designated areas ·of the dorms ( or so-called party rooms) dur­
ing the events. · 
"Until now, we have driven drinking 
behind closed doors and indirectly supported 
anti-social drinking," said Moldpicker. "We 
want to support a healthy, social relationship 
with alcohol in our students and we believe 
this plan does just that. And to top it off, 
we're paying." 
Student buddy presider Lance Boyle 
was less than optimistic. "Now we're getting 
yanked backtheotherway. Why can't things 
just stay the same around here? After all, 
that's what we built our platform on." 


Moldpicker also noted the University 1 will end its age-old policy of punishing stu­
• dents caught engaging in pre-marital sexual union. "We now realize it is incorrect to impose our Catholic morals upon those who do not share our beliefs. It is a decision to be made between consenting adults and, we want to treat our students as such. The rule · was as outdated and inane as today's edition of the Obscurer, eliminating -it just made sense." Also, Neuter Lame will begin to offer , contraceptives to the students. "We realize this goes against Catholic teaching but we feel we must offer these options to our stu­dents. We are concerned about their health , and safety. In conclusion, Moldpicker an­nounced his resignation, claiming the rule changes, "take all the fun out of the job." 
"I am sorry to see Don go," said Neuter Lame president emeritus Theodud Cheese­burger. "I remember coming back from China back in '72 after a meeting with Mao 
and someone coming up to me and saying, guy. ltoldhimsomeofmyNixonjokes. That Moldpicker, after a tearful farewell, then 'Ted, this is Don Moldpicker.' He was a nice was the last time I really talked to him." called upon Head of Security Tex Tinstar to rr=;:;::::::::===:,:::;:;==~======;:::==========::;;:;;;====:;;;;;;;:====il announce that MisFortune Student Center 
will now beopen 24 hours a day. "Regardless of the money involved, the students need this type of facility. We are looking at it as a service operation rather than a money-mak­ing one." 
Some students, shocked by the administration's sudden moves, openly shed tears ofjoy on the quad. Two thousand more rallied against the change on the Lame Quad. Students not seen on campus for weeks flooded out of the library to celebrate, amazed to find the snow melted with the arrival of spring. P.L.S. and R.O.T.C. stu­dents were seen dancing together around the War and Pieces Memorial Water Bubbler. It was truly a day offree expression on campus, and it was respected byall regardless ofpoint of view. 
"Some of these ideas may seem far­fetched, but after what we have accom­plished today, I'd say any_!hing is possible," said Alloy. "The key is listening to the students. Neuter Lame should be a school its students can be proud of. These minor im­provements should go a long way to strengthen the University. From now on, stu­dents at Neuter Lame will be treated as first class members of our community, not as insignificant proles who should be seen and not heard." ¦

Gospel 

ip it, buddy: 
We love N.D. big time . 
It always surprises us when people think bad things about Notre Dame. Like that poor pathetic soul who said that she wouldn't wish N.D. on her worst enemy. There really are some people here who don't like the place. And that's a shame. As any thinking person knows, everything that goes on here has been divinely inspired. You know that bumper sticker"GodmadeNotre Dame#l." Well, it's true. Not only isN.D. the greatest Catholic institution in the world, but it's the greatest institution, period. We shouldn't worry about trying to be like Harvard-Harvard should try to be like us. Unlike Harvard, we have a moral direction and our undergraduates are confident in their sexual orientations. Plus we don't have anybody who would spoil the pristine beauty ofour campus by building those unsightly shanty town,shacks. Respect for shrubbery is just one of the details that makes us stand up and shout, ".We ARE N.D.!" 
I 

Here are some more wonderful things about this place! Just shout, "We ARE N.D.!" after each one, and you'll feel just as good about yoi.Jrselves as we do! 
First off, the housing policy. The new policy lends an atmosphere ofcompetition among on-campus students, because now we have to try to be thebestDomers we can beorelsewe'll get kicked off-campus. We can finally start to get rid of the deadbeats who don't go to the goofball games and never have anything good to say about this place. And, in addition, the administration is showing great insight in realizing that we, as students, cannot control our raging heterosexual hormones and would, if given the opportunity ,jump on anything of the opposite sex. We don't have co-ed dorms and we're proud. We ARE N.D.! 
Second, the goofball team. We really like their new rough-and-tumble style as opposed to their former preoccupation with sportsmanship. Not only are they first in our hearts on the field, but through their escapades with the law, we students can further live vicariously. No other good Domer would do anything as appalling as our proud athletes; heck, we even work up a sweat taking more than onepieceoffruit from the dining hall. And third-year head coach Screw Bolts symbolizes the school by proving that any schlepp can become number one. Just like N.D. We ARE N.D.! 
Third, political conformity. At N.D., we're not wishy-washy enough to let commie liberals ofprobable dubious sexual orientation disgrace our vicepresident. In fact, we know how to keep them away simply and effectively: change the ticket distribution times! After all, they only would have distracted the vice president's lecture,and probably interfered with the marching band's pre:lecture overture. Who the hell do they think they are, anyway? Well, we know who we are. We ARE N.D.! 
Likeeverybody on this campus, Sarcastic loves N .D. big time. But Sarcastic is troubled by people who, for some reason, don't love this school as much as we do. Like other students who don't fit in here, Sarcastic thinks that these students should get counseling. And if that doesn't work, Sarcastic feels that there is only one option left to these poor, confused souls: shut up and transfer.
