A New Departure.
An Intensely Interesting Letter from Professor Blahah.
THE ATHLETIC FIELD. •
It is now officially announced that we are to have an enclosed field for athletics in the near future. Old students as well as those that are to be here for the benefit of such afield will rejoice at this news. We have a splendid field as far as ground and location is concerned, and with the same enclosed we can boast of the best field in the West. This news is particularly welcome to the managers of the teams who have the arduous and by no means pleasant task of trying, to make both ends meet financially. A great many of our patrons have always been of the Freq. Trade party, and, although they gave nothing in return, were never ashamed to sit and watch game after game without even a thought ■ of giving the association any assistance; With the enclosed field we shall have all that is necessary to put our athletics on a firm basis. It will be welcome also to the captains of football teams who wish to give their men' secret practice. Just keep - your horoscope turned this way for a season or two, and you will see championship banners floating from all corners of the campus.
Dear Mr. Editor:	■
I know you have long since mourned me as dead, but, bless me, I am very much alive and well, and representing the interests of the Scholastic as I always have,—earnestly, though unfortunately, not at all times satisfactorily. .
Since my rapid journey from Alaska to Cuba, and my narrow escape from the latter place, at which time you gladly lost track of me, I have seen many strange lands and many strange peoples. But wherever I went I was always given a most welcome reception, and I had bur to mention the name “Notre Dame,” and the town was mine.
At a reception I attended in Ghent, Belgium, last fall given by King Leopold in honor of Clarence V. Schermerhorn, a young lady, becoming interested in me, asked me what part of America I was from,—the United States or Chicago.
“Neither, good madam,” said I; “I am from Notre Dame.”
“Notre Dame!!” cried she, hitting me enthusiastically on the radius with her fan (my arm then being supine), “then you know Arthur Van Hee! ”	'
“ Know Art Van Hee ? ” I said, “ well I should say I do.”	•
In an instant she had run to. the other side of the room, and then came back with a crowd of girls—sweet, lovely girls, with oh! such deep blue inquiring eyes and soft golden hair. .	_
'“Look here, girls,” said my fair friend, when she had regained my side, “Professor Blahah knows .Arthur Van Hee.”
“Tell us all about Artie,” said they all;
And thus I sat telling of the wonderful things that Art had done, and had not done, at Notre Dame: how he had learned to ride the bicycle, pole vault, smoke cigarettes, etc. .	.	-	.
“And does- he part his hair in the middle? ” they- inquired.	-
“Aye, verily," quoth-I... .
“Oh! shoot,” put in a sweet feminine voice, “I always doted on his beautiful
. pompadour.-”. <	'	-	..

Wireless telegraphy, Corcoran.; arid other discoveries are much, discussed in Europe just now, and a number'of-scientific men wanted to know if it were not Nash and Baab, assisted by the Professor, that had made some very-successful experiments’ with the Marconi system at Notre Dame. But I fear I am making this letter too long. I simply, wanted to inform the Iowa students that the war with Spain is ended, and that L heard on the streets to-day that Yockey-will be graduated.	..
Recall me to all my friends, arid believe me, Yours truly,	,
Blahah.

Art Department Open Tomorrow
Visitors to our Commencement will not have seen Notre Dame unless they inspect the work done by the members of the art class. The doors of. the studio will be thrown open tomorrow afternoon, and all are invited to visit the department and look over the drawings and sketch work that, have been done during the past year.
