We have always been vigorously opposed to daily quizzes in any form or for any reason, and have vowed to do anything we could to hasten their abolishment. In keeping with this vow, we reprint a notice which we saw hanging on a door in the Commerce Building. “There will be a daily quiz until Annals of American Academy of Political Science, Sept. 1936, has been returned to the library.”
Guests
Among the 55,363 men, women and children here for the Pitt game were two furloughed coal miners from Pennsylvania who had walked from Scranton to watch their Alma Mater beat Notre Dame. They knew a student here so they asked him to put them up for the week-end. In true Notre Dame style, the student fixed a bed on the floor and saw to it that they had seats numbers one and seven at a table in the dining hall. They liked the climate, the food, the bed, and the company, so they decided to stick around after the week-end was over. They amused themselves by working out in the gym, attending a class every so often, going to Saint Mary’s affairs, standing in front of Walgreen’s with the nickel coke boys, and having a good time in general. There is the story that they were campussed by an unsuspecting rector because they did not make morning prayer, but we do not believe this.
The two guests left unexpectedly last Monday when ten hungry fellows at their table in the dining hall complained to somebody or other that the two furloughed coal miners were eating all the food and monopolizing the conversation. They were two very disappointed boys when they walked off the campus because they had been looking forward to the basketball season.
Rumor
This is our fourth year out here and this is the fourth time we have heard it. We mean the extra Christmas vacation rumor. Every year just about this time the word starts slipping around that the faculty committee, or whatever committee it is, has met in solemn conclave and, among many other important things, decided that the hoys should have a few extra days for Christmas. The rumor is always the same, always appears at the same time, and always turns out to be just a rumor. We think that by this time everybody but Freshmen would ignore it, but no. There are always all those credulous fellows (Continued on Page, 8)

BISHOP NOLL TO SPEAK ON "CHURCH OF AIR" PROGRAM OVER CAMPUS STATION SUNDAY
By Robert A. Sheppard
The “The Church of the Air,” regular Sunday feature program of the
Columbia Broadcasting System, will originate in the campus studio this Sunday. The Most Rev. John F. Noll, D.D., Bishop of Fort Wayne, will deliver the address. Bishop Noll has recently sponsored a vigorous nationwide cam-

Sorin Gets New Rector During Farley Illness
While the Rev. John F. Farley, C.S.C., rector of Sorin Hall, is recuperating from his recent illness at St. Joseph’s hospital, South Bend, the Rev. James Joseph Stack, C.S.C., professor of history, has assumed his duties in caring for the senior hall.
A familiar figure to campus students and alumni, Father Farley was stricken several weeks ago, but has shown marked improvement ever since. However, he was very much disappointed in not being able to see the Southern California game.
In his student days Father Farley was one of Notre Dame’s finest football players, and is well remembered for having taken part in the first football game with Illinois which was played in 1905.	.
The Rev. William McNamara, C.S.C., has replaced the Rev. Charles L. Doremus, C.S.C., as prefect on the second floor of Sorin hall.
paign against Communism through Our Sunday Visitor. His talk Sunday will be a continuation of this campaign. The subject of Bishop Noll’s address will be “The Earlier Aspects of Communism.”
Music for the program will be furnished by the Moreau Choir. This choir is no newcomer to radio. For the past several years their Holy Week broadcasts over the Columbia network have given them a wide reputation among both church musicians and the general public.
During the past week a meeting of all students participating in campus radio activities resulted in the formation of a Radio Club. Officers were elected to fill the positions of president, vice - president, and program manager. It will be the latter’s duty to see that all programs go on the air as scheduled.
The only change in the regular log of programs is the substitution of Walter Hagen for Steve Miller on the sports quarter hour. Basketball and track will be in place of football. This program is on the air tonight at 8:00.
Regular programs of the week include: Monday at 4:15, Campus Parade, with student interviews by Norbert Alexsis; 7:15, faculty talk; Tuesday at 4:15, Campus Roundup, with an interview on Irish history by Jerry Hogan; 7:45 the Little Jamboree, with “The Modernairs.”
All student* interested in submitting for publication in the Scholastic short stories, poems, familiar essays, essays in historical or literary criticism, are invited to bring manuscripts to the Scholastic offices in the Ave Maria Building, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday evenings between 7 and 8 o’clock; or to room 328 Main Building, mornings from 9 to 11 or evenings from 8 to 9 o’clock.

COMMERCE FORUM TOLD OF EUROPE'S MONEY SITUATION BY FAMED ECONOMIST
FEAST, DANCE PLANS MADE BY MET CLUB
By Graham Starr
“The recent economic let-down in the United States can be attributed in part to rumors and fear arising from these rumors,” according to Dr. Melchior Palyi, noted German economist, in his lecture on “International Finance and Economics” delivered before the Notre Dame Commerce Forum and visitors in the auditorium of the Law Build- A_______________________________________ ing, Monday, Dec. 6, at 2:30 p.m.

talk about, and fear, of inflation spread through the country, it became the forecast of the future. Since value of present securities is based upon expected future prices, demand, and supply, the value of the securities dropped when the rumors of inflation had reached the forecast stage.
“The study of international finance and economics is comparatively simple at the present time,” the speaker declared, “because many countries are outside the international economic structure.” He then told how Germany, Italy, and Japan are losing their economic ties with the rest of the world. Their governments try to effect a balance of trade under a system that is none other than barter. Money plays no role in a normal transaction. “They don’t get any credit any more, and are outside of the world credit market.” Thus we disregard them in discussing the international system.
Next Dr. Palyi explained that France is not cemented to the world market in a leading sense, because her internal development is largely determined by internal factors.
“The capitalistic countries receive nearly all the gold of the world, and many are flooded by it to such an extent that they have too much for their own good,” the lecturer continued. Capital flows according to fears and speculative chances, and so the largest amount of capital flows to this country, chiefly because it is safe, and also formerly because of the greater chance for speculation.

Oriental Situation
At their regular weekly meeting Monday, Dec. 6, the Round Table was addressed by Prof. William H. Downey, head of the department of economics and faculty advisor of the club. Prof. Downey’s subject was “Possible Attitudes of the United States toward the Japanese War.”
In his talk, Prof. Downey briefly traced the history of international trade from its inception in ancient Egypt to the present era of British supremacy. By elaborating on this theme the speaker’ explained the importance of trade in modem diplomatic relations.
“The satisfying of the need of raw materials by the industrial nations and the need of manufactured materials by agrarian nations is one of the most pressing problems existing today. Unless such needs can be legitimately satisfied by trade, war is often the result,” the speaker stated.
In support of this statement Prof. Downey classified all of. the great world powers into agrarian, industrial, and balanced nations. Among the agrarian nations are all of the countries of Central and South America, and all of Asia with the exception of several Soviet states in Siberia. The great industrial nations consist of England, Japan, France, Germany, and Italy. According to the speaker the only actually balanced nation is the United States. In time of emergency the United States is the only great world power that could be entirely self sufficient. Russia has this ability potentially, but the the present time it is still an agrarian nation.
With this outline of the most important nations as a background, Prof. Downey enumerated the United States’ possible alternative in the present Chinese-Japanese crisis. First, the United States could cooperate with the other world powers in an economic boycott of Japan. Secondly, the United States could maintain a program of strict neutrality. Third, the United States and England, because of their tremendous commercial and naval resources, could form
At the stroke of nine on Monday evening, Dec. 27, the Metropolitan Club, led by President Ed Condon and Dance Chairman Gene Vaslett, will usher in the club’s annual Christmas Formal dance, as the members and their guests swing out to the mellow medolies of Will McCune and his Bossert Hotel Orchestra, in the Hendrick Hudson Room of the Hotel Roosevelt, New York City. In addition to the club members and theii’ guests, countless alumni and friends of Notre Dame in New York have signified their intention of being present to make the evening a social and financial success from the first fox-trot to the last strains of music at 3:00 a.m.

Chairman Gene Vaslett has announced that tickets for the dance were placed on sale on the campus by the committee in charge yesterday, Dec. 9, and that the sale will continue here until Christmas vacation begins. He once more emphasized the desirability of having as many tickets as possible sold by that time. The price is $4.00.
The Met Club’s Communion breakfast held every year at this time, will take place on Sunday, Dec. 12, at 9:00 o’clock in the west dining hall. All members are urged to attend, especially the freshmen, for most of whom this will be a novel affair; The club president, Ed Condon, announced this week that two- distinguished members of the University faculty have been procured as speakers. These are Rev. Thomas J. Brennan, C.S.C., of the department of philosophy, and Rev. John J: Reynolds, C.S.C., of the department of history. Both are familiar to the Met Club as speakers on previous occasions.

MUSIC LOVER WANTS CHANCE TO PLAY
Dear Editor:
The purpose of education is manifold. Millions are expended in erecting buildings of grandeur, in accentuating the verdant glory of the campus, in assembling the finest minds to compose a respectable faculty. Innumerable are the pains taken to develop the minds of the students, to fashion their characters along noble lines, to present and encourage admirable habits, and to advance the student socially. The University is a happy hunting ground for all who rejoice in the charms of a campus replete with picturesque beauty, for all who delight in the indelible imprints of friendship, and for all who yearn for knowledge of the material and spiritual. The body, the mind, the soul must be purified by education.
In universities the soul should draw the first attention of educators. The soul must be nourished carefully as the dietitian nourishes the body. At Notre Dame we are continually reminded of our spiritual advancement and our moral ablutions. Bulletins slide daily beneath our room doors. In church and out of church we are reminded of our soul’s welfare.
At our University, however, there is one soul nutriment which is apparently overlooked. It has been often affirmed that “Music is food for the soul.” In ifiy quest for this nourishment I have faced countless obstacles. True — a symphony orchestra, a glee club, and a jazz band have been organiged to satisfy the musical aspirations of the superior talented trumpet - footers and ivory - ticklers. But what of the fellow who wishes to spend a quiet evening with Bach or Beethoven? . . . The music rooms are heavily locked and sealed. The dejected music lover plods back to his room, signs out, and goes down town for a “two-bit movie” or a drugstore soda.
Perhaps in this protest I am singular, but I have heard the same from mouths and hearts of others. Perhaps noisy tyros would try the patience of the authorities. . . . Perhaps the use of music rooms in the evening would interfere with the class work of some. The potential counter-protests, I feel may be numerous; but I am sure that many thirst, as I do, for the opportunity to satisfy one of the souls’ desires.
One often hears . . . “My boy, your education is being neglected if ... ” To this I might add “Notre Dame, you are neglecting one phase of your students’ development.”

POACHING INCIDENT AND SONNETS SUBJECTS OF COUNTESS' TALKS ON SHAKESPEARE
By F .G. Barreda
Two outstanding lectures on William Shakespeare were delivered in Washington Hall this week by one of the world’s leading Shakespearean scholars, Countess Clara (Longworth) de Chambrun, formerly of Cincinnati and now a resident of Paris. The subject of her topic Sunday night was the celebrated
Buckley and Skoglund “After eating—we dance”
Chicagoans Breakfast Reported Success
The members of the Chicago Club, led by President John Buckley, gathered at the eight o’clock mass last Sunday to receive communion in a body. After mass breakfast was served in the west dining hall. Rev. Thomas Brennan, C.S.C., was guest of honor giving a short talk on the importance of Catholics in the world today. He pointed to the fact that human nature continually imitates or is imitated and Catholics have the responsibility of directing their lives so they may be the imitated, not the imitators.
President Buckley thanked the members for their cooperation and splendid attendance. The number present far exceeded the expectation of Breakfast Chairman Len Skoglund and his committee, who worked diligently to make the breakfast the most successful in the club’s history.
Plans for the Christmas dance Dec. 27 are completely formulated and Chairman William Riley reports that tickets will be on sale before Christmas vacation. He urges club members to obtain bids before leaving the campus and avoid an additional charge at the door.
STUDENT TICKETS FOR NORTHWESTERN BASKETBALL GAME
For the Northwestern Game on December 18th all students must exchange the coupon in their Athletic Book for a special admission ticket. This exchange may he made in the Athletic Office any time Tuesday, Dec. 14th, Wednesday, Dec. 15th, and Thursday, Dec. 16th. No exchanges will be made after Thursday, Dec. 16th.
“Poaching Incident” which for so long has been associated with Shakespeare’s sudden flight from Stratford. Monday afternoon, the Countess spoke on “The Romance of Shakespeare’s Sonnets.”
Tradition and historical references confirm the event of 1585 when Shakespeare got into trouble through poaching on the estates of a Warwickshire magnet, Sir Thomas Lucy of Charlecote, and found it necessary to flee from Stratford. As a means of revenge, he later satirized Lucy as Justice Shallow with the dozen white louses (pikes) on his old family coat-of-arms in the Merry Wives of Windsor.
Some modern scholars refute this incident, ignoring it completely or viewing it merely as a youthful prank. Countess de Chambrun presented the proof of this incident through documentary evidence consisting mainly of a satirical ballad written by Shakespeare to Lucy. The caricature in Henry TV and in the Merry Wives of Windsor and the references to venison and rabbits made by the English Bard in many of his plays further support the argument.
“Many contemporary and modern critics have offended history by altering Shakespeare’s character to suit their personal tastes,” said the Countess. “They have tried to make him appear as they think he should be. In doing so, they have affected his works to the extent that today many of them are attributed to Sir Francis Bacon, the Earl of Oxford, and other writers of the Elizabethan period.”
Speaking Monday afternoon on “The Romance of Shakespeare’s Sonnets,” Madame de Chambrun summarized the English poet’s early career as recorded by Thomas Thorpe who published the sonnets in 1609. The original volume was a lyrical masterpiece containing 154 sonnets and the elegiac poem A Lover’s Complaint. In itself, it was a spiritual autobiography of the author, the hero of the sonnets presenting the aspect of the true Shakespearean portrait.
Although Shakespeare poured his character into the sonnets, two other figures were portrayed in the presentation. These were his “better angel,” his patron, Henry Wriothes-ley, the Earl of Southampton, and the “dark lady,” his patron’s ladylove.

DR. DU BOS REVIEWS EVENTS OF BUSY LIFE IN INTERVIEW WITH "SCHOLASTIC" REPORTER
By Frederick E. Sisk
“My first impression of Notre Dame,” said Dr. Charles DuBos, “was of simplicity and kindness, typified, by a predominating Christian form behind which is something simple and logical. I notice an absence of self-consciousness that is constantly present in the English, and I do not feel that element of pride in the American way of being.”
Continuing our informal interview *
in the cafeteria, Dr. DuBos, the noted French critic and writer and the latest addition to Notre Dame’s faculty, explained that he was born in Paris where he lived before coming to the United States.
Dr. DuBos, his wife, their daughter, Primrose, and secretary — Miss Madge Vaison — sailed from France, Nov. 3 on the Normandie and arrived in New York five days later. The following day they saw Notre Dame for the first time.
The newest member of the University’s faculty received his first education in a religious school—called a “Gersen”—followed by a year spent in a small, private school for further study in philosophy. He next attended Balliol College at Oxford in England, where he intended to remain for four years, but at the end of the first year, he was compelled to go back to France for military service.
After this momentary halt in his pursuit of learning, Dr. DuBos spent two years traveling in Europe, but spending most of his time in Florence and Berlin where he continued his studies. At that time, he was chiefly interested in art and aethetics as a life-long profession.
After studying in Italy and Germany, Dr. DuBos said that it was during these years of his life that he began to realize his sincere love for literature which had been slowly developing and which ultimately gave him his present profession.
The eminent French critic asserted that the keeping of a diary aided him greatly in attaining an esteem of lit-terature. In 1919 he first began writing essays and critical works, which at the present time number eleven volumes. Approximations, a collection of his essays, is in seven volumes, and one other volume is dedicated to extracts from his journal from 1908 to 1928.
The remainder of his works are: Dialogue with Andre Gide, Byron and the Need of Fatality—which has been translated into English — and Francois Maurioc or The Problem of the Catholic Novelist. Last week Dr. DuBos made a gift to the University library of his entire writings, represented by 11 volumes.
In the present semester Dr. DuBos’ courses in the University English curriculum are: Pascal and His Work, The Philosophy of Literature, and Studies in Some English and American Writers.
Gilbert K. Chesterton
Students strive for his medal.
Give Topic, Medal For Chesterton Medal
•
“The Approach to Non-Catholic Youth,” was the assigned topic to students in competing for the Chesterton medal, given to the student excelling in the field of apologetics.
Those competing for this medal had as their choice either a written essay or an examination both based on the apologetic material in the Daily Religious Bulletins for 1936-37, and the Bulletins for this semester, including those on Spanish Communism. The examination was held on Wednesday, Dec. 8.
The award will honor the memory of the late Gilbert K. Chesterton, noted English journalist, poet and controversialist, who was a guest lecturer at Notre Dame during the fall of 1930.
The Chesterton prize will be a gold medal designed by the famous English artist, Eric Gill, with suggestions for design given by Mrs. Chesterton.
Chesterton and Lunn were both converts to Catholicism, and both have contributed to English literature some of the finest controversial writings of the present century. Among Chesterton’s more popular works have been “The Catholic Church and Conversion,” “The Resurrection of Rome,” “St. Thomas Aquinas,” and “St. Francis of Assisi.” Just before he died he finished “The Autobiography of G.K. Chesterton.”
Music Notes J
By Paul R. Locher
The production of Massenet’s popular opera, “Manon,” on last Saturday, marked the beginning of the seventh consecutive year that the National Broadcasting system has transmitted complete performances direct from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House in New York. Richard Crooks, the well-known American tenor, sang opposite Miss Bidu Sayao, a talented Brazilian soprano, who made a brilliant debut at the Metropolitan last season.
The second opera in this Saturday matinee series will be Verdi’s perennial favorite, “La Traviata,” to be broadcast December 11th, beginning at 12:45 p.m. Nino Martini, equally famous as a star of opera, radio, and motion pictures, will sing the role of Alfredo Germont, with Vina Bovy, who also made her Metropolitan debut last season, as Violetta. Supporting roles include John Charles Thomas, Wilfred Engelmann and Thelma Vopitka. In this performance Miss Bovy returns to the role which made her famous on the occasion of her debut in Belgium, when she was but fifteen years of age.
“La Traviata” is based on the famous play by Alexandre Dumas, “La Dame Aux Camelias,” even more familiarly known as “Camille,” a recent motion picture vehicle for Miss Greta Garbo. The opera was meant to be the contemporary musical equivalent of the play, presenting the theme of redemption through love. The music reflects the feverish atmosphere in which Violetta lived, and it requires little imagination to realize how effective this nervous music must ha been to the mid-century audiences that heard it for the first time.
* * *
In November, 1887, a little boy of eleven played the piano at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, and received tremendous applause. Another little boy, sitting in the audience, asked his mother if she thought he could learn to play like that, and watched her shake her head in the negative. . . . Last Sunday, in the same Metropolitan, Josef Hoffman, now sixty-one, played his golden jubilee recital. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the little boy who never did imitate Josef’s accomplishments in music, sent him a congratulatory letter and expressed his regrets at not being able to attend. There were twenty persons in the audience who had heard his first concert, and once more they heard applause as enthusiastic as it was on that memorable occasion so long ago.

APODACA TALKS ON TRADE TREATIES
"Good Old Days" Recalled as Ancient Bulletins Give Valuable News
By Frederick E. Sisk
“Reciprocal Trade Treaties,” was the subject of the talk given by Prof. Joseph Apodaca, of the department of economics, at a meeting of the Notre Dame Propellor club on Thursday evening, Dec. 2. Professor Apodaca emphasized the ever - growing tendency of the leading world powers toward intense nationalism and also the choking of world trade which has

been steadily evolving since the start of the great depression in 1929. He is heartily in accord with the program offered by the United States as a solution to present difficulties occurring in international trade; this program has as its prime point the use of reciprocal trade agreements in world trade.
This American plan is being carried out under the Reciprocity Act of 1934, which permits the President to reciprocally lower tariffs by fifty per cent. In pointing out that there is a very close relation between the foreign policy of the United States and her internal economic well-being, Mr. Apodaca cited the case of agriculture in this country; he demonstrated that the elimination of foreign trade would result in the total abandonment of almost fifty million acres now devoted to major farming projects. Mr. Apodaca concluded his talk by pointing out the inumerable achievements of reciprocal trade agreements of the past. The period after the talk took the form of a general discussion with the members of the club asking questions of Mr. Apodaca concerning his subject.
Another significant event which took place at this meeting was the reading of a letter from the club to Mr. Tode, honorary national president of the Propellor club, in which the Notre Dame club thanked Mr. Tode for the banner he recently sent to it. After the reading of the letter, the new banner was formally presented to the club. The banner is eight feet wide, and is of a deep blue color. In the center is a white pilot’s wheel and a propellor, surmounted by the
Around about this time each year, various transportation companies • report that their supply of time tables and booklets containing rates and fares rapidly diminish and pass into the hands of Notre Dame students. Along with this, each passing day of December is marked off on the student’s calendar, days are subtracted and the number left are chalked up beside the calendar, remaining hours are next counted, and, finally, the enterprising freshman may even compute the number of seconds until the Christmas vacation is under way.
Without the possibility of any contradiction, this procedure has existed since the year Father Sorin first declared a Christmas vacation for the University of Notre Dame; it’s what you might call a “natural tradition” in the sense that it has its basis on the infallible expression, “There is no place like home.”
The means of realizing this aim from the early history of Notre Dame to the present has witnessed an evolution from the trains carrying wooden coaches and pulled by small engines to the present streamlined “iron horse” that gallops over the plains at 80 and 90 miles an hour and the modern air-liners which have narrowed distances even more.
Until the past year or two, the practice of “going home by air” has never seriously threatened the railroad’s business from Notre Dame students. In the late past, however, an increasing number of students booked their passage on the air-ships in preference to the “rail-runners.” Realizing this increased trade, the American Air Lines has recently given the Notre Dame Conference of St. Vincent de Paul the concession for the issuance of airplane tickets to every section of the United States.
Concerning the early history of Notre Dame, the students then came from nearby points and not from the 48 states and numerous foreign countries as is now the case. Yet, in the University Bulletin of 1859, we find that the University had already begun to build up a student body which

had a good geographical representation, for in the enrollment at that time the following states were represented: Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Missouri, Mississippi, New York, Wisconsin, Connecticut, Iowa, California, District of Columbia, New Mexico, and Indiana. In the same year Canada was included, and one year later the geographical distribu-' tion of students was increased by the addition of men from Cuba, Louisiana, and Maryland.
In those same years the student from California, Canada, Connecticut, or other distant points started out on his long journey to Notre Dame with six shirts, six pairs of stockings, six pocket handkerchiefs, six towels, a knife and fork, teaspoon and table-spoon, a hat and cap, two suits of clothes, an overcoat, a pair of shoes and a pair of boots for winter.
The same student was warned, too, that “pocket money is not allowed, except when placed in the hands of the Treasurer, and subject to his discretionary application.”
Though the ride to Notre Dame, Indiana, was a long one in the late 80’s, the “Prospectus” of the 1863 University Bulletin assured the students that, “the extensive forests surrounding the College give the best opportunity to those who are fond of hunting, whilst the two beautiful Lakes, upon whose banks the University stands, afford choice fishing grounds and baths in summer, and almost uninterrupted skating during the winter.”
In the same year the Bulletin also said, “On the first Wednesday of every month, ‘Certificates of Good Conduct,’ and ‘Improvement in Class’ are issued by the Faculty to such Students as deserve them. On either side of the President’s table and conspicuous to every visitor, are the ‘Tables of Honor’, presided over by the Vice-President and Prefect of Discipline. At these are seated twenty-two of the Students whose conduct has been most exemplary during the preceding week. They are elected by the unanimous vote of the Professors and Prefects.”
The use of tobacco was also forbidden, and students were not permitted to visit private rooms. The regulationsof 1868 said, “Bath Rooms, provided with hot and cold water, are fitted up, in which the Students take a bath once a week; in warm weather, however, they bathe twice a week in St. Joseph’s Lake.”

Would-Be Poet Discovers Self to be Second Milton; Modestly Admits it
By Harold E. Graham
REPORT ON DANCE GIVEN BY HOWARD
In the back of my mind I have a hazy remembrance of High School days. Several incidents, as is natural, are still as clear as when they happened. Only one of them has anything to do with the matter at hand, that is, how I was initiated into a poetical career.
During those happy freshman days, our class counted among its belongings such a thing as an English teacher. This professor, whose name I’ll not disclose, was not among the museum pieces that ran the school. He was a very enterprising young fellow still in the prime of old age. In order to communicate his love of poetry to an innocent and unsuspecting class, he drew from us, by means of an assignment, the promise of an original verse or so apiece. As was to be expected, our joy knew no bounds. So limitless was it that we even considered a timely poisoning or the like. We controlled our spirits, however, and decided to humor the poor chap.

The only meeting between now and Christmas will be of a social rather than an intellectual nature. The meeting in question is to be held at the home of Professor T.

This informal meeting will feature a short talk or a paper by one of the members.
This was the time when there was nothing I regarded with less interest than I did a poet. The only exceptions that my prejudiced mind admitted were those few and selected “authors” who wrote for the “Post Script” section of the Saturday Evening Post. Their quaint and humorous ditties always drew my reluctant admiration. But, even my best attempt did not satisfy my ambitions in that direction. Finally, in desperation, I wrote:

"Journey’s End" Cast Picked at Trials
•
“Journey’s End,” a typical war play, is scheduled to make its appearance in the University theatre, immediately following the Christmas vacation. This cast was selected at Tuesday’s meeting in the John F. Cushing Hall of Engineering building, following a series of tryouts over the past weeks. Rehearsals will begin before the Christmas vacation.
“A great deal of enthusiasm has been shown by the members of the Dramatic Club thus far, regarding plans for an active season,” remarked Prof. Thomas E. Mills, director of the organization, when he was confronted with the question concerning his prospects for this year. “The general tryouts for all productions are not only limited to members of the Dramatic Club, but to anyone wishing to participate,” he further remarked.
A vaudeville show has been announced for March 17, and any student who feels that he has dramatic ability and would like a chance to express himself on the stage, is urged to see Mr. Mills as soon as possible.
A University of Washington freshman, listing his activities for the student yearbook, said he belonged to “Flat feet, earache and appendicitis once.” He had mistaken “affiliations” for “afflictions.”
The regular monthly meeting of the Notre Dame Villagers was held Monday evening, Dec. 6. President Paul Howard read the report of the Thanksgiving dance. The report showed that the dance was a success both financially and socially, the net result far exceeding expectations.
President Howard also announced the committee for the formal Christmas dance to be held this year at the Palais Royale on Monday, Dec. 27. Committee chairmen are: Carl Michels, general chairman; Ed Stark, tickets; James Garrell, publicity; Alexis Coquillard, music; Richard Alberts, arrangements; and Bernard Hiss, decorations.
Following the business meeting the Villagers attended one of the downtown theatres in a body.

We just happened to think that this year there might be some truth to the rumor. After writing this, that would be some joke on us. Some joke, yes, but oh would we be happy.
Camera
The other day in a Freshman class the professor had a long list of important instructions to give his charges. On the big blackboard in front of the classroom the professor wrote and wrote and wrote the important instructions. All the Freshmen, as Freshmen do, diligently copied the notes. That is, all except one who merely sat back and yawned and filed his finger nails. When the professor filled the last bit of blackboard space he turned around and found all writing but this one fellow. “Finished already?” asked the professor. “No,” said our hero. “Well,” said the professor, “are you going to copy them?” “No,” yawned our hero. The professor was just beginning to get a wee bit angry, “What are you going to do then?” he shouted. His voice reverbrated on the walls, and all those writing just sat and trembled. Our hero reached into his overcoat'pocket, extracted a candid camera, focused it on the blackboard, snapped the shutter, put the camera in his pocket, and went back to filing his nails.

WRANGLERS INDUCT SIX MEMBERS
•
The Wranglers held their formal banquet last evening at the Rose Marie Tea Room in honor of six newly chosen members.
James Nerney, acting as chairman, introduced Father Norbert Hoff, chaplain of the society, who greeted the new members and spoke briefly regarding the advantages of debating and forensic activities. “The man who can think clearly and speak well is an asset to any community,” remarked Father Hoff, “now more than evei- before, the spoken word carries greater force and influence. One has merely to look at the dictators of Europe to see the effect that it has.” Father Hoff concluded that too often the oratorical outbursts of dictators are not the result of a clear and orderly mind.
The guests of honor at the banquet were the three members of the winning interhall team, Al Hanlon, Albert Schmitz, and Walter Johnson. John Tobin who coached the St. Edward’s trio was congratulated for leading his charges to first place.
The new members of the Wranglers appeared before the membership committee last week and delivered brief talks. Twelve candidates sought membership in the campus speech organization although there were but half that many vacancies.
Those who were approved by the committees were Frank Parks, Vincent DeCoursey, Jerry O’Dowd, Bill McVay, John O’Day, and Albert Funk.
Clubs Hear of Mexico
“Background of State Church Conflict in Mexico,” was the subject of an address by Mr. Walter M. Langford, professor of Spanish, before a combined meeting of the Spanish and French clubs, held last week in Badin Rec.
Professor Langford pointed out various accounts of the Spanish Con-quistadores in Mexico, on the early condition of Catholicism. In addition he commented on the Early Conversion of the Indians, Cortez Conquest of Mexico, The Rise of Anti-Clericalism, and Church Education in Mexico, all books dealing with religion in Mexico, past and present.
An open discussion was held by the members of both clubs, following Professor Langford’s lecture. Paul Anderson, senior in the College of Arts and Letters, and president of Le Circle Francais, acted as general chairman for the evening.
Mr. Langford was introduced by Professor Pedro de Landero, faculty ~d visor of the Spanish Club.

Man About the Campus
If a promoter is needed for a political ticket or for a dance, see Charles Thomas Brosius, III, of Walsh’s fourth floor elite. Guided the Commerce Forum to a record membership and its first football dance to a complete financial success. As secretary of the Forum, promoted himself to the presidency as he swept the entire ticket into office.
Began promoting career in Brunswick, Maryland, on Nov. 20, 1916. Family soon moved to Lime Kiln. After outgrowing Lime Kiln’s one room school house, attended Saint John’s Literary Institute in Freder-
ick, where he won a gold medal for general excellence, as a result of scholastic and basketball success.
Tried to run to success in his freshman year, but Nick soon persuaded him to rest his weary legs. Became president of Maryland-Dis-trict club in his junior year—strangely enough, this year’s president is roommate Jack Lebherz.
Chuck classes as vicious rumors stories to the effect that he ■writes a daily letter to a member of the Maryland school system, and that the Brosius clan are the lone residents of Lime Kiln. Demands his daily 12 hours of sleep as a hangover from his cradle days.
Has found time to major in accounting, to acquire a maxima cum laude average, and to attain a coveted membership in the Wranglers. As an accounting corrector, refuses to divulge the professor’s name for fear of starting a parade of suffering sophomores to his room.
States that the biggest thrill of his life came when the Commerce Forum dance was announced between the halves of the Southern Cal game.
CRUSADERS LEND AID IN CLOTHES DRIVE
•
The Notre Dame Unit of the Catholic Students’ Mission Crusade is cooperating with the St. Vincent de Paul Society in the annual clothes drive which began yesterday and will continue till Saturday. The Vincentians and the Crusaders will make a room-to-room canvas of the residence halls to gather discarded clothes for the needy in South Bend.
Roger Huter, Louisville, Ky., is chairman of the mission committee assisting in the drive.
Rev. Francis E. Gartland, C.S.C., assistant prefect of religion, was the principal speaker at the last meeting of the unit and spoke to the members on: “St. Francis Xavier, Missionary.”.
Harry Murray, freshman in the College of Arts and Letters from Franklin, Pa., delivered a short talk on, “Communism and the Catholic Students’ Mission Crusade.” Charles Morrow, a senior in the College of Commerce from Louisville, Ky., was chosen to fill the vacancy as treasurer.
Jerry Green, president, announced that a Round Table will be formed in which study groups will discuss some topic of current interest and also that a spiritual bouquet will be prepared and sent to the bishop of Bengal, India, for Christmas.
Rimbach Talks to A.S.M.
At their meeting on Wednesday, Dec. 8, members of the Notre Dame chapter of the American Society for Metals heard an address by Mr. Richard Rimbach on “The Selection and Use of Metallurgical Literature.”
Mr. Rimbach, a graduate of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and of Harvard University, is a well-qualified authority on metallurgical subjects. He has had several years of technical experience in various steel companies, including the Illinois Steel Company, and the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation. He was consulting editor of Metals and Alloys, and is now the managing editor of Instruments. He is also the author of several books of metallurgical information.
Discussing the various classified sources of metallurgical information, Mr. Rimbach made special reference to the suitability of different publications to the type of information desired.
Preceding the lecture a motion picture, “Oxy-acetylene Welding,” was shown.
The next meeting of the society will be held on January 12, when Dr. George B. Waterhouse will speak on “Tool Steels.”

'CLASSICS NOT DEAD1 DOODY TELLS CLUB
•
Too many people believe that the classics are dusty literature, Thomas Doody, a senior in the College of Arts and Letters, told the Patricians in their monthly meeting in the Seminar room of the Law Building, Monday.
Attacking the modern thought that the classics are merely histories of
Patrician Tom Doody His hobby: The Classics.
peoples and civilizations long dead, Doody pointed that though time has changed, human nature remains essentially the same.
“For this reason, mainly, are the classics intimately bound to modem life, and what seems so very brightly modern today may be nothing but a commonplace of the fifth century B.C. masquerading under the furbelows and spangles of the 20th,” he said.
Doody drew his material from intimate, everyday things of Roman life and applied them to the life of today.
“Just as students overdraw on their allowances in our universities, so, too, did Cicero’s son write home because of an empty pocketbook,” he illustrated.
From these and other interesting incidents he drew an amusing parallel between life as it was with the ancients and life as it now is with the moderns.
John Turley, club moderator, gave a short criticism and noted that no less an authority than President Hutchins of the University of Chicago is today striving for a revival of the classics on the same ground advocated by Doody.
- In the near future the Patricians will hear Dr. Gurian on the political set-up of the Greek and Roman states, and Professor Turley on the study and influence of Roman law.

About a week from now the first exodus of the thumbers will start from this neck of Indiana. No matter whether you wish to have more spending money for the holidays or have already spent your train fare this advice will not go amiss. Here’s how to conserve energy on the actual waggling of the thumb. Instead of waving at every passing car you hold the arm parallel to the belt line. Then you wait for two cars, one following the other fairly close. Understand now—wait for two cars. When the first car passes with the driver stepping on the gas, and averting his head to ease his conscience, the vacuum created will pull your arm up, into the position approved by the exponents of this great American pastime, and the second car is flagged with no effort on your part.
The second bit of advice is that you temporarily dicard your present name and adopt either “Smith,”
“Brown,” or “Jones.” Then you yell, “Ride down for Jones, sir?” at the motorists. You’ve got at least a 33% chance that his name is the one you’ve adopted. Now, how would you feel if you went past a namesake? You’d stop and come back for him thinking he might be a distant cousin, wouldn’t you I Of course, and that’s just what the motorist will do.

To What Extremes?
WELL-INTENDED but silly college girls of this country have effected a boycott on Japanese silk because of the Far-Eastern struggle now in progress. They have pledged themselves not to wear silk stockings and other articles of silk, just to show those nasty Japanese that they are wrong and shouldn’t hurt poor China that way. Some of them seem pretty determined, too.
We don’t believe the “boycott” will last very long because of the average female’s desire to make a decent showing before the males and other females. A silk stocking is far superior to a cotton affair, in looks. However, no matter how long this lasts a vital industry in this country is being affected. The silk industry is one of the largest industries in this country. They depend mainly on women’s wear. When women go about boycotting silk goods they are not harming the Japanese any more than they are harming a great industry. In fact the industry is being harmed more. Even now reports come in from the silk mills in northern New Jersey that most of the plants are operating on half time and with vastly reduced working forces. The Japanese seem to be going full time in China. Figure out for yourself who is losing in this situation created by the women in the colleges of this country.
A farther extreme is being attained by a woman of
Congress attempting to show her hatred for the Japanese. This prominent woman, apparently intelligent enough to hold a seat in the House of Representatives, has intro. duced a bill to have one of the most beautiful features in the beautiful city of Washington done away with. She wishes to have the Japanese cherry trees along the Tidal Basin cut down, just to show the nasty Japanese. What difference will it make to the Japanese soldiers in China whether cherry trees in Washington are cut down? Does she think the Japs will immediately thrown down their guns and say, “Sorry, we didn’t think the Americans objected so heartily.” Never have we heard of such an acme of hatred being attained by anyone in a neutral country.
We don’t wish to condone Japanese action in China. We do wish to condemn actions of certain Americans who are doing America more harm in a material way than they are harming Japan in an immaterial way.
The "Western" Rivalry Renewed
NOTHING is quite so healing, we believe, as Father Time as he marshals the relentless forward march of his legion of days, weeks, and years. Nothing has more established this truth, we think, than the renewal of athletic relations between the Universities of Notre Dame and Michigan.
Time has managed to salve the sores which had been magnified out of proportion a quarter of a century ago, and has curbed the impetuous temperaments of the men concerned. Both parties were too filled with the contemporaneousness of their problem. One sees further and -with more foresight from the crow’s nest than from the deck.
When one eyes a problem from a perspective viewpoint, things do not look half as bad as those concerned think them to be. One has but to read the acrid and even violent editorials of the Michigan Daily and the Notre Dame Scholastic in those hectic and feverish days of 1910 to see that both parties were too near the controversy. Not many nice things were said about each other. Time, one sees, is a blessing.
Too much credit cannnot be given to the men and the universities which have made this renewal of athletic competition possible. To Fielding Yost and Elmer Layden must go the congratulations of the sports-loving public, student and alumni of the two universities, and their press. No finer Christmas gift could be given. It is a gift which will bear blossoms when the maize and blue and the gold and blue vie again for the Championship of the West.
The public which genuinely regretted the severance of relationship between the schools, which had grown into a keen rivalry through the nearness of the institutions, their proficiency in athletics, and almost hysterical interest of their adherents, will, no doubt, greet the announcement of renewal with genuine joy.
For us of The Scholastic, the story of the year will once more be found in the calendar when it reads: “Saturday, game with Michigan. Excursion to Ann Arbor.” For alumni and old students it was the game of the year. Why should it not be the same for the students of our generation?
Was it not Pope who said: “To err is human, to forgive divine?”

"MONOLOGUING" »
By Robert J. Mullen
The Scholastic once printed a definition of a monologue as a conversation between the fellow who went over to Europe and the fellow who stayed at home. Being the fellow who went over to Europe it did not take long to find out the truth of that statement. By this time a good many of the fellows are accustomed to my “Monologuing,” so the rest of you may as well receive your baptism of fast and furious monologuing.
The look of incredibility on the faces of my intent (?) listeners when I tell them the cost of my expenses for eleven months in Europe is well worth whatever razzing I get for my noble efforts. That no doubts may remain in the minds of any who have heard me (could anyone not have heard me?) here it is in black and white. From the day I landed in Germany — Sept. 12, 1936, till the day I sailed from France — August 6, 1937, a period of eleven months during which I travelled extensively throughout entire Italy, Germany, and Switzerland, besides visiting Vienna and Paris, I had to part with but 550 of Uncle Sam’s greenbacks. Including my passage on the SS. Bremen the entire amount is still less than the tuition we pay here at N. D. for eight months! And what seems even more incredible is that I might have gotten by with $300-$350 had I learned the trick of cheap living in September instead of March — after having been six months in Europe. While ‘a resident in Heidelberg I could have averaged $25.00 a month, and while travelling $35.00 a month. This is the ’’trick” of cheap living: a room in the students’ “Wohnheim” at $3.00 per month, one healthy meal a day in the student restaurant—12 cents—which included all the potatoes and vegetables one could eat. Meat, however, was limited to one piece, while bread, butter, milk, etc., had to be bought separately. Breakfast and supper I made in my room — hard, dark bread, with the kernels of wheat sometimes still whole in it; cheese as butter was too expensive; sausage, marmalade, perhaps a little tea, and occasionally something sweet for dessert. I did all my own laundry except my shirts. For recreation I attended first-rate plays, concerts, and operas. My “student card” reduced admission to all these affairs to 15 cents! Can you imagine anyone in
this country getting even a standing room ticket at an opera or concert for 15 cents? At first I sorely missed many of the little things I had been accustomed to. But who wouldn’t deny himself a few comforts in order to travel through Europe?
It seems a shame, after all my professors have tried to pound the principles of logic into my head, to disregard all their teachings. There will be no logical development of this narrative, whatever incident flashes across my mind will be set down on paper. Since the football season still lingers on I believe the following should be quite interesting. You might believe that Notre Dame has only local and New York publicity. You’re wrong, for Notre Dame’s banner proved to be headlines in Europe! I couldn’t wait till The Scholastic arrived at Heidelberg to inform me of the results of the football games. So every Monday morning I had the Paris edition of the New York Herald-Tribune reserved for me at the railroad station. This, of course, was the Sunday paper, but every week during the football season the thrilling account of Notre Dame’s battles made the Sunday sport sheet headline! There was plenty of excitement in dear old Heidelberg when the seventy-five Americans there read of the magnificent Notre Dame victory over the then-potential national champs, Northwestern. Being the only Notre Dame representative, I was made to feel quite “conspicuous.”
While on the subject of sports I might add that the Germans do not go in for sports the way we do. They have no football, baseball, basketball. The one fairly-popular game seems to be soccer. The crowd at such a game seldom equals the size of one at a small town high school football game. Regimentation has even entered the field of sport. All college students now have to take a course similar to our freshman “phy-ed.” And this “sport” is usually devoted to calesthenics of some sort. Hiking is, of course, the Germans favorite type of exercise. In summer bands of the Hitler Youth may be seen marching everywhere. This past spring at Heidelberg the students often “selected” to go hiking instead of going to class. You see they have absolute academic freedom. In other words you can!t be cut out of a class
for the simple reason there are no cuts!
In Catholic parts of Germany a lovely custom is observed at this time of the year. A holly with four large candles attached to it is hung horizontally about the dining table. On each Sunday of Advent one of the candles is lit for a while. During this time the entire family gathers around the table and sings all the Christmas carols they know. On Christmas Eve after Santa Claus has arranged the tree, strewn the presents, and above all placed the tiny Bethlehem crib underneath the tree all foui* candles are lit and Christmas carols are sung until the candles burn themselves out. Thereafter follows the happy distribution of presents. My Christmas so far away from home would have been quite lonely, but this beautiful, simple custom took much of whatever homesickness I had had at the time away from me.
Let me describe an even more striking custom in which the children play the major role. About two weeks before Christmas all the youngsters from three to seven or eight years of age somehow or other manage to get hold of a burlap sack. This they don like a robe. Mothers make beards and whiskers out of cotton, and the children attach these as well as they can. All is topped off by a peaked hat. They are now, each and every one of them, a “St. Nicholas.” In their colorful attire they go from house to house greeting the occupants with a little verse asking the Child Jesus to bless their home. After this, someone — usually the mother of the house — gives the children some little present if it be nothing less than a cookie or a few pfennigs. No one has the heart to refuse them. Even the storekeepers go out of their way to carry out their part in this lovely custom. These German Catholics prepare for Christmas in a deeply religious manner. I have told you of the custom of singing carols on each Sunday of Advent. Most of Christmas and New Year’s Eve is spent in church. There are no wild New Year parties. At midnight everyone open their windows, greets his neighbor cheerfully and lustily, a few flares and skyrockets are exploded— and the New Year has arrived.

Limelight
Resplendent in new silk panties and immaculate white jerseys the Irish backetball quintet now grabs the spotlight from the football arena and flashes it on their “locus oper-andi” for the next few months—Dan Hanley’s well-polished floor in the gym. It is an experienced, well-balanced team that George Keogan has assembled for the second consecutive year at Notre Dame. Pre-season dope had it that Notre Dame, with a National Championship returning intact from last year’s campaign, was the team to bet this season—if possible. Midwestern sports writers become extremely enthusiastic about their pet winter topic — basketball; and when a Championship team pops up in their locale, the obstreperous shout of “Unbeatable” is the result.
But if their past record or press reports nurtured anything in the way of over-confidence in this year’s five, Ball State Teachers squelched it. The Muncie team came here with the idea that National Champs or no, Notre Dame would know that aggressive basketball is played elsewhere in Indiana. We’ll still take Paul Nowak and Tommy Wukovits, however, for moving the apple around. Nowak has the uncanny ability to enter a game and bring a team around with a scoring punch that inevitably wilts the opposition. Wukovits is again the coolest, most dependable floor man on the squad. Still bothered by an ailing shoulder, Johnny Moir has plenty of time for his annual recordbreaking feat. With the conservatism of a Vermont Senator our comment will be—“They’ll bear watching, this 1938 team.”
Pigskin Panacea
Among other objectives, Captain William Wood, newly appointed head coach of the Army’s football team, has stated that the Army has for its goal for 1938 a defeat over Notre Dame. Lt. Gar Davidson remained five years at the Academy with that objective, but each year his efforts came to nil—the closest approach to a win was a 6-6 tie in 1935. Captain Wood has selected an admirable ideal—and we suggest that he look over the recent contributions of inventors to eliminate the fumblitis attack that prevented his predecessors from beating the Irish. Inventors who have turned out everything for football players from zippered

HANDICAPPED IRISH MEET FIRST BIG TEN FOE; WISCONSIN HERE MONDAY NIGHT
By Bill Donnelly
The Notre Dame basketball team will not be at full strength when it meets
Wisconsin in the field house next Monday night. It is ironic that a picture of
Captain Ray Meyer appeared in last Friday’s Scholastic captioned “Rugged men are we,” for the very next night he received a dislocated elbow that will
Forward Ed Sadowski A ball-stealing snipe is he.
Irish Gridders Honored
For its well - earned win over Southern California ,November 27, Notre Dame’s eleven was named “team of the week” in the Midwest by Grantland Rice and his Huskies Board of prominent sports authorities. The board has been selecting the “team of the nation” and of the various sections of the country each week of the football season.
Official announcement of the selection of the Fighting Irish for that week’s top honors in the Middlewest was made last Saturday on Robert L. Ripley’s “Believe-It-Or-Not” broadcast over the NBC-Red network.
keep him on the sidelines for approximately five weeks. Although his natural ability as an all-around athlete will help him make the shift rather rapidly, Earl Brown, who finished a tough football season at left end less than two weeks ago, will not show the basketball skill of which he is capable until he has had at least a week or two more practice.
Johnny Moir has been handicapped by an injured shoulder, while Paul Nowak, although he shows no signs of injury, has shown very little of the ability which gained him national recognition during the past two years. Thus, cool, smooth-playing Tommy Wukovits is the only one of the first five men who has been able to live up to pre-season expectations, while two second-string forwards, Ed Sadowski and Mike Crowe, have been carrying much of the attack.
Wisconsin, the first Big Ten opponent of the season on the Irish schedule, is coming down from Madison with a fast and rangy all-senior team. The Badgers, always a tough team, play the effective short-passing type of game developed by Meanwell. The starting line-up for Wisconsin probably will be Powell, a former Indiana high school star, and Rooney at forward, Jones, a 212 pounder at center, and Mitchell and Frey at guard. Notre Dame has played Wisconsin twice in basketball; both games were at Madison, one in ’26, the other in ’27, and both times Notre Dame was victorious.
Johnny Moir and Ed Sadowski will probably start at forward for the Irish, Paul Nowak will be at center, while Tommy Wukovits and either Tom Jordan or Earl Brown will take care of the guard positions. Mark Ertel, sophomore reserve center, is out with a foot injury, but Johnny O’Connor or Rex Ellis, a blond sophomore who has shown quite favorably in his few minutes of varsity ball, should prove to be capable replacements. Carson and Crowe, Wagner and Walker will be the reserve for-. wards while Oberbrunner, Ducharme, Gaglione, and Klier are the guards most likely to see action.

FROSH THINLIES OUT FOR FIRST DRILLS
1938 GRID SCHEDULE SHOWS TWO NEW FOES RELATIONS RENEWED WITH MICHIGAN
Three days after the football squad had relinquished the locker rooms, the freshman trackmen made their first appearance. In hopes of continuing the fine record of their predecessors in producing potential championship performers, this year’s squad will be handicapped by a serious loss. During the past year the former freshman track coach, Johnny O’Brien, lost his life in a tragic auto accident. Track star and well-liked fellow that he was, Johnny knew how to get the most out of aspiring young sprinters and fieldmen. The men who make up this year’s frosh team will not miss Johnny in the same sense that the veteran trackmen will, but perhaps it is better to say that the team will lack him, his kindness and thoughtfulness in dealing with each individual.
Fine Prospects on Hand
Of the thirty or more men who are going through calesthenics and grinding out laps around the dirt track in the gym, there appear to be several fine prospects — especially in the running events. Allen McMeen, of Fort Wayne, Ind., steps the quarter in slightly more than 50 seconds. In the half mile there is Joe Olbrys, from Trenton, N. J., who has an easy, effortless stride and hopes to add to his prep school reputation considerably in the next four years. Harry Brown, a Californian, in the freshman meet a week ago, showed class in winning the two-mile event. All three men are very ambitious, to put it mildly—they are looking forward to the Olympics of 1940 with more than speculative or academic interest.
No Meets for Frosh
In the short time that practice has proceeded, numerous other men have undoubtedly been overlooked, but the season does not get under way until after the holidays and more prospects will probably turn up by that time. As in the past the team will not engage in any intercollegiate meets, but will confine its activity to the postal meets staged four or five times a year. These meets, incidentally, are run off exclusively in intrafreshman meets at each school entered in the meet, and the results are then mailed to the other school. There is no prize in winning, except the satisfaction gained from posting good marks and times in the various events. The reporting of the postal meets is handled by the freshman track manager who deserves a great deal of credit for the success of postal meets taking place in the past.

Athletic Director Layden Takes on new foes.
INTERHALLERS START PRACTICING
Now that Coach Norvall Hunthausen’s Sophs have been crowned champions of the Soccer League and the snow has put an end to all outdoor Interhall sports, the devotees of the hall outfits are focusing their attention upon the Gymnasium where the coaches are working nightly in order that their teams will be in shape for the season’s opener. The prospects for a nip and tuck race are very bright in both the heavyweight and lightweight divisions. At this writing the heavyweights from Carroll loom as the ranking team in their division.
As we mentioned above, the league is divided into two divisions, lightweight and heavyweight. The former embraces those weighing up to 150 pounds and the latter includes all those who tip the beam above this mark.
Regarding hall regulations, a man is eligible to play only for the hall in which he was resting when the season began. The lightweight teams holds its practice sessions in the smaller upstairs gym. This floor will also be the site of the lightweight battles.
Kansas University of the Big Six Conference and Georgia Tech will replace Pitt and Drake on the 1938 football schedule released this week. Kansas, it may be recalled, tied “Hunk” Anderson’s 1933 team, 7 to 7, in the Memorial Stadium. Next year Coach Al Lindsey will bring to South Bend the strongest Kansas team in years, a team which was good enough to tie Nebraska during the past season, a commendable feat for any team. At that, Nebraska had to score in the last two minutes in order ti tie. Few men will be lost through graduation, and most of those remaining will be experienced seniors hoping to emulate their predecessors of ’33 in an effort to score another upset. At any rate, an interesting game is promised.
Georgia Tech, an almost yearly foe during the Rockne regime, features a razzle-dazzle offense which, according to Ralph McGill of the Atlanta Constitution, “compares favorably with that of any team in the country.” This year Tech won six games, lost three, and tied one. They hold a victory over Vanderbilt, one of the strongest teams in the South, and lost to Alabama by only one touchdown.
Another bit of news released this week may have a bearing on the construction of the 1940 football schedule. That was the announcement that Michigan' and Notre Dame will resume athletic relations again. The Wolverines and the Irish terminated their gridiron struggles 28 years ago over a dispute concerning eligibility of players. Both schools have full football schedules for 1938 and 1939, but a game may be arranged for 1940. Athletic competition will be resumed this year or next in sports where the schedules allow for an opening. The last time the two institutions met in a sport other than football was at the 1923 Big Ten Conference track meet—then outside competition was permitted—and this resulted in a complete severance of athletic relations when the high hurdles was protested.
Interhall basketball has always been a big feature of the winter sports calendar at Notre Dame and it provides an excellent opportunity for some thrilling games during the winter months.
The following practice games are scheduled for Sunday:
8:30 a.m.—Cavanaugh vs. Lyons.
9:30 a.m.—Brownson vs. Walsh. 10:30 a.m.—Carroll vs. Alumni.
1:30 p.m.—Badin vs. St. Edwards.
2:30 p.m.—Old Infirmary vs. Dillon.
3:30 p.m.—Off-Campus vs. Sorin.
THE NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC
By Mark J. Mitchell
This might very well be an excerpt from some sort of “Cavalcade.” For
this is part of the saga of .Crowe, and to write that story is to write a very large part of the athletic history of Notre Dame. Five Crowe’s have preceded Mike, and Emmett is at present a junior. Clem, Ed, Frank, Norb, and Leo
have come and gone. Each one has added something to the history and tradi-
tion’of the Fighting Irish. Andrew Michael promises to carry on the good work.
It seems that most of the Crowes have attended Jefferson High school in Lafayette, Indiana, though by their own admission they live “in a little Hoosier village called Shadeland, about five minutes driving time from Lafayette.” Anyway Mike followed his brothers from Shadeland to Lafayette for a high school education. But he got something at Jefferson High besides book-learning. There he participated in four varsity sports, and developed the 5 -feet 6% inches and 160 pounds that is the tremendous Crowe stature at present.
High school must have been a lot of fun for Mike. He took part in football, basketball, track, and baseball. He worked on the school paper, and he was president of his graduating class. However, despite the diversity of his activities, basketball was the most important for young Michael. He was all-Conference forward in the North Central his senior year. Some of his teammates were Young, Sines, and Dickinson, all of whom now play for Purdue.
One of those incidents you often hear about but seldom see, happened to Mike in connection with his high school basketball playing. When he was a freshman, he played on the second team. Jefferson was in the county tournament that year,
and Mike got into the lineup for one of the early games. Then—but let hint tell it—“I crashed in for a short shot. Two
men pinned me, and when I rose to shoot my free throws, the seat was out of my pants. But I remained calm, so calm, in fact, that when the coach threw out a pair of sweat pants, I immediately returned them to him.” He must-have been calm, foi- he relates that out of the seven free throw chances he had in that tournament, the only ones he made were those two he attempted when half his pants were gone.
Though Mike played quarterback on his high school football team, he never went out for this sport at Notre Dame. In fact the nearest he ever got to it was handing out equipment for “Mac.”
Notre Dame has been good to Mike. At least Mike thinks so, for he says, “I chose Notre Dame as the University to acquire an education because I always heard it said that Notre Dame made men out of her students. Now that I’ve been here four years, I can appreciate the real value of that boast that a Notre Dame graduate is a real man.”
This latest Crowe letterman earned his monogram last year, yes, even in competition with Meyer, Moir, and Sadowski. Besides that he wrote a column for the Scholastic called “On Down the Line.” He is majoring in journalism, and'hopes some day to be a sports writer on a metropolitan newspaper.
Although Mike has never had any difficulties with ripping basketball garments while playing with the Irish, his college • career has not been without its thrills and disappointments. As a sophomore, he was told to remove his sweat clothes and shoot free throws before the Albion game. Mike was all (Continued on Page 19)
FENCERS PROGRESS SATISFACTORILY
By Andrew F. Wilson
After about a month and a half of steady practice, Coach de Landero, of the fencing team, is still uncertain as to what men he will rely on in the various events in the meets of the coming season. Mercado, Sayia, Leising, and McEnearney seems to be the top four men in foils, according to their records in the intrasquad tournaments held over the last few weeks. Mercado has won 17 bouts and lost 6, Leising has won 26 and lost 8, McEnearney, 21 and 12, and Sayia, 11 out of 33. In the sabre, the “strong” weapon for the Irish this year, in which the most experienced men on the squad are concentrated, Sal Scarlata leads with 14 victories in 16 bouts. Captain Zerbst has won 9 out of 12, while Gavan runs a close third with 10 wins in 16 fights. Zerbst and Scarlata are both letter-winning veterans, and their coming around into form has generally brightened the team’s prospects.
In the epee, Graham is at present far ahead, winning 10, losing one, and splitting one with Colgan. Colgan’s record is 5^ to 5%, and is closely matched by Bill Mahoney’s 4 and 5, and Guerin’s 5 and 7. Mahoney has good form, but has been a little slow in his movements. He won most of his five victorious bouts in recent matches, having begun to concentrate on quickness and speed.
The sauad this year is outstanding in its lack of individual stars, and in the closeness of competition between all its members. In the foils there are any number of men, such as DeLaVergne, Harris, Lenihan, Guerin, Mahoney, Colgan, Crawford, and LaVigne, who could burst into the group of the first four with a sudden spurt of only a few victories in a row. DeLaVergne especially has shown much speed, and should develop well, now that his coaching duties in the Interhall Debating Contest are over. Captain Zerbst has proven himself reasonably expert with the epee, but has devoted most of his practice to perfecting his sabre-work. In the sabre Graham, Donovan and Smalley have fought well against the veterans, and only a lack of experience keeps them below the others.
Internally the squad is evenly-matched with no men extraordinarily superior to others. However, Coach de Landero cautions that the general level of outside competition which the team will encounter beginning in January is still somewhat higher than the average ability of the men in blue and gold, and much improvement by the squad as a whole must be shown before the Irish can hope for a winning season.

FOOTBALL MANAGERS FINISH SEASON
•
The successful 1937 football season has passed. With its passing the active duties of the managers of that sport are completed. Not only did the team have a most successful season, but also did the the hard-working, loyal student managers have a successful smooth - running season. The student managers, under the able leadership of John Donnelly, deserve a great deal of credit for their work.
The official duty of John Donnelly was far-reaching. Unlike James Mulhern, who was in charge of the stadium personnel alone, Donnelly saw to it that the whole staff, including juniors, sophomores, and freshmen, were kept busy.
The duties of Bill Condon were the most numerous. He was in charge of football equipment. It was his duty to see that all the footballs, headgear, tackle dummies, etc., were out on Cartier Field five afternoons of each week since the season began. His “boys” worked foul* Saturday afternoons during the season taking equipment to and from the stadium. Their respective duties were not completed until long after the throngs had left the stadium. They also packed suits, headgear, footballs, towels, water bottles, and first aid equipment for use in the games away from “home.”
So with the passing of football for another year, the senior football managers retire. Their work has been thorough and successful. A great deal of credit is due them. But now, stepping into the limelight of the college sport world is basketball. And basketball teams and equipment as well, need managers. The student leadership goes to Jack Lungren, senior basketball manager. It will be his duty to see that his “boys” are on hand to do their work during the indoor* season which last until the second week in March, making the season longer than that of any sport.
The leadership of the track and fencing managers is in the hands of Tom Kelley and Joe Nigro, respectively. These leaders also have a great many duties to perform and are capable of performing them efficiently.
The student manager department consists of about 40 freshmen, 15 sophomores 8 juniors and 8 seniors. Early in March appointments will be made for the senior managers for the 1938-39 season. These appointments are made according to ability demonstrated during the year’s work.
IRISH CONQUER BALL STATE TEACHERS 43-28; MEYER OUT WITH DISLOCATED ARM
After three hectic periods of the fastest early-season basketball ever staged at Notre Dame, the Irish managed to beat Ball State Teachers last Saturday night, 43 to 28, before 3,500 excited fans. The so-called “warm-up” game proved to be a really heated affair. The trouble started with the first gun, and after ---------------------------------------4
TRACK TEAM SWINGS INTO ROUTINE
Track Coach Nicholson gathered his track men together Monday afternoon in the Gym to warn them about the dangers attached to the problem of getting in shape, and to comment upon the first week of work, completed last Friday afternoon.
Track Coach Nicholson “Make Haste Slowly.”
“All of you are different,” Nick said in advising his tracksters. He then went on to warn the members of the Varsity and Freshmen candidates against going at it too hard at first, adding that muscles are subject to the slightest pulls and strains. “There is only one answer to the problem of getting in shape, that is ‘Make Haste Slowly.’ The Coach told his young men to work a little each day during the vacation-period and concluded by the appeal “For the time being keep on jogging.”
Mr. Nicholson showed pleasure and gratification over the first week’s workouts, and feels confident that his present bunch of boys will develop fast into a very fine team.
To prove his contention Nick pointed to Captain Bill Mahoney, who with Jake Wolf, Bill Clifford, and Sophomores Tom Sheilds, Steve Coughlin, Bob Lawrence and Don Morgan seem to be shaping quickly into very competent sprinters and hurdlers. Pete Sheehan, Mike Micek, Hank Halpin,
the first few seconds the Notre Dame rooters began to ask: “Who’s Rudi-cel?” He happened to be five feet of liquid dynamite that shook the Notre Dame offense for three periods. It took the combined effort of John Moir and Mike Crowe to stop him. Mike more than held his own by staying on the heels of the Ball State boy during the second half.
Eddie Sadowski, the boy from Westfield, Mass., led the scoring with ten points. He subbed for Captain Ray Meyer, who went out with a dislocated elbow in the first half. Ray will probably be inactive for at least two weeks. Paul Nowak and Tom Wukovits tied Rudicel with nine points for second high scoring honors. Both Nowak and Moir played ragged ball, missing shots that ordinarily would have been seasy. Moir particularly showed the effects of the shoulder injury that kept him out of the Columbia game.
In the first half, Rudicel opened with a field goal, but Tom Jordan tied things up. Then Rudicel cut in and scored again, but Moir and Nowak put the Irish ahead with a free toss and a field goal respectively. Ball State then counted five points in a row. Moir sank a free one, but Lackey dropped a field goal and the visitors led, 11-8. Wukovits and Sadowski put the Irish in the lead, but Shook tied the game at 12-12. Notre Dame came back with three more points, but Rudicel’s free throw and Casterline’s basket tied the game again, 15-15. With the help of Wukovits and Crowe the Irish were leading, 21 to 15 at the half.
But, in the first three minutes of the second period, Rudicel, Casterline and Shook deadlocked the game at 21-all. Though Sadowski broke the Irish slump with a field goal, Rudicel and Shook tied the score once more. From this point on, the Irish stole the ball game as the strain began to show on the small Ball State boys. First the Irish ran up 11 consecutive points. Later in the period Ellis alone accounted for the last five Irish points. During those last 25 minutes the Irish scored 20 points, the visitors only five.
Johnny Francis, Curt Hestor, Greg Rice, Bill Donnelly, Red Martin, Steve Szumachowski, and Gene Gormley also give evidence that the Varsity track men are making haste slowly.

Benitz's Engineers End Undefeated Season;
Decline Invitations as Demands are Refused
Frosty winter has arrived and the groundhog and bird alike have sought their havens. The pigskin, which
merrily frolicked bn college gridirons for the past two months, has felt the empty effects of
deflation, while inflated experts argue over A11 -Americans, A11 -Westerns, and others.
True t o tradition the campus critics have assembled again to select their All-Uni-
Frank Kesicke versity touch football squad. The critics from local Walsh, distant Alumni, and adjacent Sorin unanimously agree that the season was marked by the superior play of Prof. Benitz’s Senior Mechanical Engineers, who were undefeated in nine bruising battles against the toughest opposition obtainable. Especially impressive were their seven victories earned on their home gridiron, Engineers’ Emporium. In Badin Badlands, under adverse conditions, they pulled a close one out of the fire with an
heroic last-minute attack. Those of us who witnessed this spectacle have never seen a finer demonstration of such indomitable courage.

Keoganites Swamp Impotent Western State As Moir, Nowak Lead Mates to 60-21 Win
A powerful Irish basketball team, paced by Johnny Moir, celebrated its return to form here last Wednesday night, by crushing an impotent Western State outfit, 60 to 21. Although Moir played only fifteen minutes of the first quarter, he gathered sixteen points to take high schoring honors for the evening.
Notre Dame’s supremacy was apparent from the opening tipoff. Moir opened the scoring in the first two minutes by sinking a free throw after he had been fouled by Garver. He followed this quickly with a hook shot from the right side, making the score 3 to 0. Garver sank his charity shot on Nowak’s foul, and then Moir passed to Wukovits under the basket and the score was 5 to 1.
The score was 26 to 7 in the middle of the first half, and 36 to 9 when Moir went out after the first fifteen
captain, and spiritual adviser. Under Coach Snell’s careful guidance another “unknown quantity” has scaled the heights of stardom—Joie Moore. His name spelled disaster to his foes because of his airtight defensive work and bone-crushing offensive blocking. His “tea”mates—to a man—acknowledged his inspired play by voting him the most valuable player award: one “nickle” coca cola.
It is fitting to mention the noteworthy performances of the unsung heroes of the team. Dick “Tinsley” Carrigan was a stand-in at end. Jack “Gomer” Jehle was Snell’s darkhorse at center. Jack “Buster” Davis teamed with “Powerhouse” Moore at guard. Frank Kesicke, a great passer, and Tom Fitzgerald, the well-known receiver — “carried the mail” with their characteristic finesse. Writers from Alumni and Walsh have been anxiously watching the latters’ play all season—and then some. . .
Coach Snell’s office in Brother Al’s dormitory has been flooded with a barrage of bowl invitations during the past week. Led by their stars, Moore and Kesicke, the players voiced their protests against a bowl game to Coach Snell, unless all their pink-slips be nullified and their profs, apologize. The entire squad will be feted at a banquet to be held at Rosie’s “International” Casino. . . . come Friday night.
minutes. By the time the gun sounded for the half, the Irish had made it 41 to 10.
In the second half, Notre Dame offense slackened its pace, checked to a certain extent by the frantic defensive work of the Kalamazoo lads. Before the game was over, howexer, Western State had become so panicky that the Irish again scored almost at ■wall.
Wukovits followed Moir in the scoring column with eleven points, and Sadowski got himself eight. Credit must be given Forward Wayne Davidson of Western State, not only for leading his team in scoring, with five points, but also for his good floorwork. This blonde lad played his heart out, but could get nowhere against the Irish passing and shooting.
Brushing Up L	-J
By Ed Brennan
A compilation of Notre Dame football statistics for the 1937 season reveals that the Irish gathered 84 first downs to their opponents 62. Notre Dame tried 85 passes and opponents attempted 86. Each completed 25, opponents totaling 432 yards to 317 in this department. There were 43 fumbles, 27 by Notre Dame to 16 by opposing teams. The Irish recovered 286 out of the 43. . . .
Apparently the lateral pass fad, prominent in 1935 and 1936, lost a great deal of its emphasis this year. The only one the Irish tried in 1937 was against Northwestern; and it was in the nature of a forward from Jack McCarthy to Len Skoglund, who in turn lateralled to Andy Puplis. . . .
The Southern Califomia-U.C.L.A. game, last Saturday, was featured by the longest unofficial forward pass in history. In the fourth quarter, Ken Washington, U.C.L.A. right halfback, threw a 73-yard pass that was completed to Hal Hirshon, right half for a touchdown. . . .
The University of Wisconsin meets Notre Dame here Monday night for the third time in history. The first Irish-Badger cage tilt occurred in the 1926-’27 season, the Irish winning 19 to 14. The two schools met again the next year, and Notre Dame repeated its previous performance with a 21 to 14 triumph. . . .
The Badgers were defeated 32 to 21 by Marquette Saturday night. Paul Sokody, Marquette center, played the last 34 minutes with three personal fouls against him. . . .
In spite of Northwestern’s loss of Mike McMichael, who placed second in Big Ten scoring last season, Coach Dutch Lonberg still has a well-balanced squad this year. In their opening game the Wildcats trounced Carleton college of Northfield, Minn., 53 to 23. . . .
In addition to the selection of Chuck Sweeney as right end on the Associated Press All-American team, seven other Notre Dame players were given honorable mention. The linemen include Ed Beinor, Joe Ruetz, Joe Kuharich, Alec Shellogg, and Pat McCarty. Andy Puplis and Joe Thei-sing were the two backfield men chosen. . . .
WISCONSIN GAME _____(Continued from Page U)
Notre Dame should win the game, but basketball is a game in which so much is left to chance, to percentage, that optimistic predictions are always dangerous. At any rate Notre Dame will have to play heads-up basketball with no slackening of pace at any time during the evening.

pepped up, because he took this to mean that he would be starting his first game for Notre Dame. He wasn’t so peppy when he found that all the other reserves were removing their jackets and pants to practice free throws. On the other hand, he got a real kick out of the game he played against Rudicel, the other night. After all when a guy has been called such names as “Shortstride,” “Little Caesar,” “Tiny Tim,” and “One-Man-Gang,” he’s mighty happy to find somebody he can outjump.
And so, with Meyer out and Moir off his game, little Mike has a very large task ahead of him. But you can be sure that when he turns in his number “6” after the Detroit game, the Crowe epic will be richer by another chapter, which might be entitled “The Little Guy Made Good.”

Club to See Net Game
The Cincinnati Club, under President John Cottingham, discussed plans for Christmas vacation activities in their home city at a meeting Tuesday evening.
It was announced that the club is attempting to obtain a block of tickets for the Notre Dame-St. Xavier basketball game scheduled for Dec. 22 in Cincinnati. Clem Crowe, former Notre Dame athlete and head coach of the Xavier quintet, has already been contacted. President Cottingham further indicated that he plans to have club members and their guests attend the game in a body.
Plans for the annual Christmas holiday formal dance were outlined, and the date has been set for Monday, Dec. 27. Other arrangements are being taken care of by the Notre Dame alumni of Cincinnati.
An autographed book containing the photographs of the first twenty-two men on the 1937 varsity team will be given away as door prize. The book will also include a picture of head coach, Elmer Layden, and views of the University campus.
Members of the club are invited to an evening dinner to be held downtown, on December 7.
Cleveland Club Dance
The Rainbow Room of the Hotel Cartel- will be the scene of the Cleveland Club Christmas Dance to be held on New Year’s Eve, it was announced by President Thomas Mulligan at the meeting of the club last week. Also, an informal party by the club is to fake place on Monday night, Dec. 27. Bob Grisanti is in charge of arrangements.
A club handball tournament was begun, and will be played off before the Christmas holidays. So that the members may get to know each other better, a smoker and a banquet are to be featured at the beginning of 1938.
The meeting was concluded with cider, doughnuts and cigarettes. -Peter Sheehan arranged for refreshments.

Now is the time for Steve Miller to give an account of his stewardship in predicting the scores for the past couple of months. We referred to The Scholastic of the past three years and found no record of Jack Robinson’s or Wally Fromhart’s tally sheet of their scorecasting. Comparisons then are out. But we point with pride at Steve’s average for this year. Counting the ties as losses, he emerged with .666. And discounting the deadlocks, he picked 88 games correctly out of 117 for a score of .752.
Scientists Give Talks
Three University scientists, Dr. Arthur Haas, Dr. Eugen Guth, and Dr. George Collins, presented papers at the meeting of the American Physical Society held recently at the University of Chicago.
Dr. Haas’ topic was on the relation between gravitational constant and Hubble’s factor.
Dr. Guth spoke on the deviation from Ohm’s law at high current densities. Ohm’s law is the basis of all electrical engineering.
Dr. Collin’s paper, prepared in collaboration with Mr. Victor G. Reiling of Notre Dame’s Graduate Department of Physics, was on the asymi-metric radiation produced by high velocity electrons.
The next meeting of the American Physical Society is to be held in Indianapolis, in the week between Christmas and New Year’s. For this meeting five members of the faculty have prepared papers which have been accepted for presentation.

WOULD-BE POET MUSES (Continued from Page 8)
I call my poetical career. Such a natural facility and smoothness oi rhythm can not be overlooked by the Impersonal Observer. The facility is what amazes me most—why I just jotted the lines down, juggled them for a couple of hours—and presto— there was the poem. I agree with you when you say that the rhythm is not very much according to rules, but if you read it with the proper inflection of voice and lower the tone on the superfluous syllables it does not sound so bad. Of course, the method recommended by experts is to read the selection over and over until the harsh sounds wear down..
A few years crowded by and found me a senior again confronted with a similar problem in rhythmical engineering. With even less trouble than the first time I soon arrived at the following bit of worldly wisdom and advice:
If thou a ditty
Wouldst improvise Thy brain must be witty And thy senses wise.
Of course this eloquent reprint is not all of the original. I will not tell the rest because I feel that the Impersonal Observer will not appreciate it as much as it deserves. One needs an extraordinary insight and a remarkable amount of the so-called literary appreciation to get at the bottom of all the meanings and allegories to which I so humbly claim authorship. In fact, I am positive in my assertion that I am the only person that has fully grasped and understood the poem.
I think I once wrote on the fly page of a book, that was later stolen from me, the following lines:
Steal not this book
My honest lad, For a dollar ten, It cost my dad.
I must mention, for the sake of completeness, my most recent achievement in accentuated prose. The occasion was the distribution of deficiency reports (better known as pink-slips by those more familiar with them) a week or so ago. The slightly plagiar-istic composition follows:
My heart falls down when I behold A pink-slip in prospect.
So was it tvhen High School began, So is it notv that I’m a college man. But when in college I grow old, I shan’t donate them my respect, ’Cause familiarity breeds contempt.
I again call upon the Impersonal Observer to draw his own conclusions, because, for the sake of modesty, I must remain silent.

Jibes and Jottings
An engineer at the University of Wisconsin became interested in the amount of energy wasted in dancing to swing music and took it upon himself to do a little investigating. Here is his discovery: Students dancing to swing music, 12,000 of them, generate enough heat to warm a two-story
house for two days in ordinary winter weather. . . . And the initiation rules for the footers in the Univerr sity of Minnesota band reveals the following gems: “Always carry—one bag gooey gum drops; one tin legitimate cigarettes; one package good gum; and after dinner mints are darn good.”. . .

PALY! TALKS ON FINANCE
(Continued from Page Ji)
devaluated the pound in 1931, we devaluated our dollar in 1933. The English boom of 1933-37 was brought about chiefly by the wholesale building of houses that took place. The “building and loan” associations had the money, and the people were badly in need of houses. Then the new rearmament policy was started and the boom continued. Plans were made to spend three times as much for armaments as the United States has spent for subsidation. The reckless boom on the London stock exchange was based on the influx of gold.
In America the boom followed an English expansion but was slower. It was based on the 20 million dollars of fresh money spent from taxation receipts, and from the commercial banks. A business expansion resulted by the end of 1936. Inventories were built up because of the rising prices, and even the consumer bought more than he really needed.
That America is particularly sensitive to economic disturbances was brought out clearly by the doctor. One-half of the national debt is owned by our commercial banks, while only one-seventh of England’s is owned by her banks. This means that even a 1 % rise of interest would bring a great number of banks into difficulty because of the loss incurred on bank accounts. This shows the great sensitiveness of our banking structure.
Dr. Palyi ended by answering several questions. Dean James E. McCarthy, introduced the speaker.
X.olks take such things as No Draft Ventilation as a matter of course now that all GM cars have this improvement. But when you add Knee-Action, the Unisteel Body, the Turret Top, improved Hydraulic Brakes and a steady parade of betterments—you see how a great organization moves ahead—using its resources for the benefit of the public — giving greater value as it wins greater sales.

Lawyers Hear Hughes
At their recent monthly meeting the Law Club was addressed by Mr. Arthur J. Hughes on the subject “Reorganization of Insolvent Corporations.” One of the largest gatherings in the history of the Law Club was on hand to hear this fine lecture. The speaker, a former president of the . Notre Dame Alumni Association, was introduced by James W. Myers chairman of the meeting.
Mr. Hughes, an expert lawyer in the field of reorganization, pointed out how important this particular phase of law has-become in the last decade. Great importance was attached by Mr. Hughes to the new clause of the Bankruptcy Law known as 77B. “The depression which caused numerous firms to go into bankruptcy was the principal cause for the enactment of this new legislation,” the speaker said.
According to Mr. Hughes, before the passage of this law, corporations could not reorganize without the consent of all of their creditors. With the passage of this new law only two-thirds of the creditors consent is necessary for a firm to reorganize. In the remainder of his talk Mr. Hughes enumerated the benefits that would result from the new law and the methods employed in reorganizations before its adoption.
