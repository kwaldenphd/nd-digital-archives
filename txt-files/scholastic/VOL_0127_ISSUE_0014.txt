editorial--------------------. 
Oneof the great selling points of this University is its faculty. Many of us can remember being told, as potential students and as incoming freshmen, that the professors here "really cared about the undergraduates" and "were wil­ling to spend time with students". And surely these were no lies. 
The faculty at Notre Dame is a highly dedicated group of people who are more than willing to extend the process of education beyond both their class­
. room and their scheduled office hours. Perhaps more than anything else, Notre Dame owes its reputation as an excellent undergraduate school to the devotion of its faculty. 
However, it seems that the Administration may be putting that devotion to the test. Administrators, eager to label this University the "Harvard of the Midwest" have stepped up pressure to publish, using the carrot and stick process of tenure and renewal. Professors already quite busy with their class-loads are feeling the pinch. In essence, the very real fear of unemployment may be forc­ing many faculty members to cut back on the time they spend with students in favor of increased research efforts. 
The goal of making Notre Dame a top notch graduate research center is quite laudable. However, if the ultimate cost of that goal is sacrificing our sta­ture as an undergraduate teaching university, it simply isn't worth the effort. 
This isn't to say that the Administration should disregard the important role of research at the University. However, options such as the possibility of a two­tiered faculty, with some professors hired primarily as teachers, others as researchers, should be examined. 
But more than anything else, the Administration should exercise caution and prudence before it implements ariy course of action which might undermine the qua11ty of the undergraduate experience, both inside and outside of the the classroom, at Notre Dame.

The Writing On The Walls 
CAMPUS GRAFFITI REFLECTS STUDENT OPINION 
by Michael Hainey 

With Spring's arrival on campus; many of you will be turning your attention to outdoor activities. While it might feel good to get outside and catch some sun, you shouldn't let your grey matter turn to complete mush. You can still be learning, even if you're not squir­reled away in the 'Brar. 
The Notre Dame campus, in fact, provides numerous cultural and intellectual enrichment oppor­tunities which are often over­looked. Take, for example, Notre Dame's reno.wned Graffiti collec­tion. 
Begun in 1842, Notre Dame's Graffiti Archives have grown so extensive they have spread to branch galleries and exhibition halls located in virtually every campus building. Happily, this provides students with easy access to enjoyable works. 
Yet for all the enjoyment the collection provides the university community, it has drawn some cri­ticism. Some critics charge the vast and valuable collection is higll.ly disorganized. Dr. Hy Rogliphics, curator of the collection since April 15, 1986 disagrees. In an exclusive Scholastic interview Dr.

and Gerry Faust. Of course, the Faust collection is closing soon." 
Dr. Rogliphics added that there was a special collection which holds works of a questionable nature. That is, pieces which either contain "radical artistic content," as defined by the Vatican's Council on Morality and Censorship, or "undefinable" pieces which fall into neither the Permanen-t Holdings nor the Con­temporary Holdings. 
Included in this section is the Women in Notre Dame collection. As Dr. Rogliphics explained, "I suppose this collection really belongs in the Permanent Hold­ings, but I guess I'm still hoping the Administration will come tci its senses, admit the whole idea is a failure, some sort of perverted oxymoron, and change Notre Dame back to all male." 
Obviously the Notre Dame Archives are both educational and controversial. To help you enjoy the best graffiti on campus, Scho­lastic asked Dr. Rogliphics to prepare a list of his favorite exhi­bition halls and comment upon some of the works. 
The Administration Building: Located in Room 218, just next door to the Office of University Relations, this collection· is quite small, but impressive nonetheless. It has a strong theological and reli­gious orientation. Collection not­ables include: 
* 
"Do embryos party?" 

* 
"Good GOD Almighty which way do I steer for a cheeseburger in Paradise?" 

* 
"I failed at my own worst fear, man has to be his own saviour." 



The Memorial Library: Located on the second floor are works which are quite scholarly and intellectual, again a reflection

of the exhibit environment. Prized works include: 
* 
"Gerry Faust is Willy Loman." 

* 
"Graffiti sucks." 


Hayes-Healy: This is one of the smallest galleries on campus, located in room 109. But we have tried to compensate bv making a popular. It has a wealth of works, many of them reflecting the collection based on word associa­tion. For example: 

* 
"Wait, I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?" 

* 
"I only want to see you, Baby, in the Purple Rain." 

* 
"A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall."

"Angels Fall like rain and love is only heaven."

Message In A Bottle 
CONTEMPLATIONS AT THE COMMONS 
The greatest ride in my Ii/e was about to come up ... 
--Jack Kerouac 

The Commons: a Thursday night. I look down into my glass of Old Milwaukee and think of how close I am, how close all seniors arc, to shutting the door on the last four years, years I 8 through 22, 1982 through 1986. How quick, but what a long haul. 
I feel like I'm on the last page of The Brothers Karamozov -I stop to flip back through the countless pages it took me to reach the end. I can't help but pat myself on the back a little. And so it goes. The end is in sight. 
But this is not a reflection arti­cle. I promise you, you who are on the verge of turning the page, I promise not to drift into whimper­ing sentimentality about the past £our years. I am here at The Com­mons to drink cheap beer and look to the future, and to talk to other unsuspecting seniors about their futures. For if there is one thing which is on every senior's mind, it is this: What, if anything, will next year bring? 
I am at this bar tonight to hear the stories of other seniors, to listen to their hopes for next year. 
APRIL 30, 1986 
Bv Mike English 

I was staring at the bubbles rising from the ·murky depths of my beer, and while a glass of Old Milwaukee is certainly no crystal ball, it dawned on me that whatever I do next yeai, wherever I go from here, there are going to be new things going on. 
Undoubtedly, some will have jobs,. some will be going to school (again), and some will be at The Compions to drink and forget the fact that they have absolutely no idea where they are going or what they will do. But none of that really matters. What I want to get at are their hopes for the future. Whether employed or not, every­one has hopes. So let's hear them. 
***** 
You gotta tell your story boy, before it's time to go.

I was staring at the bubbles ris­ing from the murky depths .of my beer, and while a glass of Old Milwaukee is certainly no crystal ball, it dawned on me th.at what­ever I do next year, wherever I go from here, there are going to be 
new things going on. 
That's what my hopes for 'the future are, excitement and new­ness. No more of the same old routine, no more S.B. blues. And so I'm kind of happy these days. But enough of me; I've got to get on with this journalism thing and interview some of my classmates. 
It's early yet, just a few scat­tered groups of people about the bar. I see a couple seated in one of the booths. I know the guy's a senior because he's in one of my classes, so I approach him. 
"Excuse me, you're a· senior are,n't you?0 
"Yes." 
"Sorry, I forget your name." 
"Dave." 
"Well Dave, I'm writing an arti­cle about seniors for Scholastic, and I was wondering -what are your hopes for the future?" 
·"Well, uh ... " 
"Nothing too elaborate, you know, just your basic hopes." 
"I got a job in Chicago, if that's what you mean."

their jobs, and to go from there. 
There are a couple of girls seated at the end of the bar. They look like seniors. As I walk towards them at this moment they are trying to ignore my approach, probably suspicious of what I may ask. 
"Excuse me, are you two seniors?" "What?" 
"Are you seniors?" 
"Yeah. Why?" 

"Well I'm writing about seniors and I wanted to know about your hopes for next year." 
"Hopes." 

"You know, what you hope for from the future." 
"I hope to find a job that pays well." She smiles. 
"Okay. How about you?" 

"I just hope I end up far away from South Bend, whatever I end up doing."

"Pat, I'm writing about seniors and their feelings about next year. Do you have any h0pes for the future?" The two juniors laugh (laugh now, you poor suckers). 
I'm not sure." 

Anything at all, anything you hope for." 
'"Weh, I hope that I find a career that I can be happy at. I don't want to feel like I wasted my time here." 
A good answer from Pat. How will we get along in the outside, the real world? Did we make the right choices in the last four years? Or did we blow it, becoming a business major for the money when we would have been happier as an anthropologist? Questions, questions.

I think these two girls show some common senior traits -a desire to put the N.D. diploma into action and make it pay a little and an intense longing to leave South Bend. They seem somewhat cynical about school at this stage, maybe even a little bitter. But they're nice enough. They just need to graduate.

The Scenes Gone By and the Scenes To Come flow blending together ... So don't sweat it. For focus simply move a few inches back or forward. And once more, look. 
--Ken Kesey 

It's an hour later, and I've been thinking: I still can't believe the last four years are almost over. Graduation. The word gives me the shivers. But anyway ...

There are more people now here at The Commons, and I've decided to change my approach.

conversat10ns, and then ask about hopes. Hopefully (no pun) I'll get better answers this way. And rather than giving you t11e whole conversation, I'll give just their 
hopes. That's all we want to know anyway, right? · 
Tom says: "I have a lot of hopes for .next year, but I guess the big­gest one is that I make new friends and stay in touch with my friends from here." Good hope. 
Mike: "Hopes? Jesus, I've been. so caught up in everything this year that I haven't thought much about it." 
Tim: "I hope the football team wins a few games." 
Mary: "I'm going to law school, and I hope it's not too hard. I want to have fun and be happy." Fun and happiness -I'm sure that Mary speaks for all seniors. 
Stacey: "Talk to me in a couple weeks. I still have to graduate." The Big Fear. 
Karen: "I hope that things work out for me and my boyfriend next year. We're engaged." 
And then there's Steve: "I hope I don't get swamped by the real world." 
***** 
1:30 AM... I really have to go. My ride's leaving. Some common themes seem to have come up this evening, some common senior hopes from The Commons -a career, happiness, excitement, sta­bility. Despite the underlying ten­sions, every senior I talked to seemed to be happy about the approach of graduation..A whole new stage is waiting. As Kerouac says, the greatest ride in our lives is about to come. •

Sullivan graduated from Notre Dame in 1978 with a degree in biology. She then studied marine biology at the University of California-San Diego's Scripts Institution of Oceanography, earning her doctorate in 1982. Since then she has been a member of four university faculties, and has been appointed a Notre Dame trustee. 
Currently, Sullivan is the director of the under­graduate marine science program at the University of Miami-Coral Gables. Her position involves student advising and direction of senior projects for biology majors. She also teaches a field oceanography class during the summer. 
When Sullivan attended Notre Dame, women were still a new addition to the campus. That experience has repeated itself, she says. 
"When I took organic chemistry at ND I was the only woman in the lab," she recalls. "When I started at Miami I ·was the only woman in the biology department Some things change, and some things 
stay the same." · 
Sullivan's wide experience in the academic world has convinced her that women are usually regarded as equals. "Women are treated well at the college level," she says. "The further and the more serious you get in your career, the more distinct the barriers 
get." 

Sullivan remembers being encouraged by her pro­fessors at Notre Dame. One professor told her the only difference between her and an expert biologist was the amount of time needed for study and 
research. 

Such a positive attitude about one's pursuits tends to be characteristic of Notre Dame alumni, Sullivan says. "The process of going to Notre Dame may be painful or turbulent," she says. "But I think most graduates end up at the heart of what they enjoy doing. They know what they want to do."

"It's one thing to theorize about that, and quite another to go and try to do some of the things that you say "the Church' ought to be doing." 
When he graduated from Notre Dame hist May, Jim Greene volunteered a year of service with the Glen­mary Farm in Appalachian Kentucky. For Greene, this decision was a way to address some issues he faced as a senior in college. 
"I dealt with the question of how to live out my Christian beliefs in the world today," Greene says. "It's one thing to theorize about that, and quite another thing to go and try to do some of the things . that you say 'the Church' and 'the People of God' 
.. ought to be doing." · 
APRIL SO, 1986 
Glenmary Farm is located ten miles outside of ,.~ I Vanceburg, in rural Kentucky. The farm's staff is I kept busy by running a series of one-week education -~ and service programs that are much like Notre ·I Dame's Urban Plunge, Greene says. ~ 
"We're part caretakers of the farm, and part directors of the program," Greene says. "When we don't have groups, we do a variety of things at the local Catholic parish, like unload rummage trucks, or make home visits." 
In addition to his work on the farm, Greene visits 
~ a local nursing home regularly. He says his work there makes the universal need for service more vivid for him. "Sometimes people have a romantic notion about doing volunteer work in Appalachia," he says. "There are needs there, but there are needs r, 
-~

in the nursing home, too." ~ ~
Aside from the service nature of his work, Greene 
~ 

finds life in Appalachia rewarding. "The beauty of 
~ 

the land and the simplicity of the people have made ~ it a very meaningful year for me," he says. ~ 
~ Greene's first experience of service work was on ~ 
~

the Glenmary Farm seven years ago. That experience 
~ 

influenced his choice of Notre Dame. "Because I had l an experience of service among the poor in high 
+~ 

school, I was looking for a college at which I could ~ 
l 

further my interest and my experiences along those ~ ~
lines," Greene says. "It seemed to me then that Notre 
~ 

Dame, being a Catholic university, might be such a 
~ 

place, and it was such a place for me. I hope ND will ~ continue to nurture a vision of service for others." ~

"Sometimes people have a romantic notion about doing volunteer work in.~ ~ Appalachia .... There are needs there, but,

Greene intends to pursue graduate study English or ethics this fall, but he doesn't think of his time at the Glenmary Farm as a 'year off/ "I hope that my life will continue to be about the same kinds of things in 15 or 40 years," he says. "I don't want this year of service to become something I did once when I was just out of college."

Ii Author Barry Lopez began a process at Notre Dame ~ which continues today, twenty years after his gra­1 duation. "I learned how to learn in that school," he ~ says. "There were enough good people on theI faculty that I could always just go and talk with good 
~ people." 

Lopez graduated from Notre Dame in 1966 with a degree in communication arts and went on to earn his master's of arts and teaching degree from ND in 

~ 1968. He then enrolled in the master of fine arts ~ program at the University of Oregon, and switched 
~ to graduate study_ of jour?alism there after a ~e~es­
~ ter. In 1970 he withdrew m order to devote his time to freelance w·riting. 
Since then Lopez has written short storie~ and 

~ essays for a number of publications, including Sierra ~ and Audobon magazines, the New York Times andI the Washington Post. His Of Wolves and Men has ~ won him awards and recognition. And his mostI recent book, Arctic Dreams, details his experiencesI ·with the land and people of the arctic.

I "Every writer has a handful of questions about ~ the meaning and purpose of life," Lopez explains. "II feel most comfortable addressing these questions iriI the context of natural history, geography and anthro­~ pology." 
~ 

Lopez. traces his treatment of such moral and spir­
~ 

~ itual topics to his time at Notre Dame. He believes the University is unique in its attention to such ~ topics. 
"What's impressive about ND is not only that the students are as bright as anywhere else, but that the ~student body is aware of obligations to community ~ and to self, and aware of the responsibility of spiri­
fB 
~ tual being," Lopez says. "It's not to say that ND gra­duates are exemplars of moral living, but that they know this moral dimension of life exists." 
Lopez consciously applies his experience of life's 
~moral dimension to his work. ''I try in my writing to ~ bring order out of chaos," he says. "I try to bringI light into the darkness, to contribute to a literature of ~ hope." ~

on the environment as an important modem issue. "The relationship of human beings to landscape will form the basis for political thought and political change in the next 20 or 30 years," he says. 
As an author, Lopez devotes himself to pursuit of issues and ideas which interest him. He is hopeful that today's graduates have the same opportunity. "It's possible," he says, "to get 20 or 30 years down the road and not have to give up everything you believe in order to make a living."

Fred Graver works for a Hoosier, but he doesn't live in Indiana. Three years ago Graver joined the staff of Late Night in New York with David Letterman. 
Graver graduated from Notre Dame in 1976 as an English and American studies major. He believes his comic outlook developed a great deal while he was a student. 
"Professor Jemielity's satiri:: class continues to be a very big influence on me," Graver says. "It taught ;nt! two things: One, that it's okay to feel that every­thing has gone seriously wrong. And two, that there is a right way and a wrong way to express that." 
During his junior year, Graver was editor of the Observer. At graduation, his career plans reflected that experience. "I had the great misfortune of gra­duating the same year as All the Presidents' Men and I wanted to be a newspaperman," he says. "I found myself competing for a job emptying trash at the · New York Times." 
Disillusioned by journalism, Graver spent a few months working for a local politician on Long Island. For five years he was an editor with a publishing house, dealing with both fiction and non-fiction books. His experience editing humor books led him to a writing position with National Lampoon. 
After a staff shake-up at the Lampoon, Graver applied to Late Night. Following a rigorous applica­tion process, he interviewed with the show's host. "The only time going to Notre Dame helped me in an interview was with David Letterman," he says. "He

Graver doesn't think Notre Dame is as receptive ~ to students' creativity as it could be. But he doesn't ~ think that is necessarily bad. ~ 
"A lot of schools give a heady atmosphere for artists," he says. "But when they get out in the gen­eral culture, people give them the same response as the usual ND roommate: 'okay, but what are you going to do with your life?"' 
"I think the ND attitude -having no place for artists -allows you to carve a place out for yourself." 
Writing comedy can be difficult at times," Graver says. "You have to have a lot of faith in the process," he says. "If you happen to look at the world in a cer­tain way to produce comedy, you can use that." 
"The only time going to Notre Dame helped me in an interview was with David Letterman." 
Graver keeps his success at comedy in perspec­tive. "I don't know how I'd do in the Vandal cul­ture," he says. "But I'm doing okay here."•

The result of all this attention is

~ 

that 86 percent of the more than 74,000 Notre Dame alumni donated to the last major fundrais­ing campaign, 1975's "Campaign ~ for Notre Dame," which raised a ~. total of $180.5 million for the University. "That's the highest percentage in the country," said 
¦ Lennon. This year 50 percent

Lennon sees three major rea­sons. "First, it is a residential com­munity. You can't live in this place and not come away feeling that this is a caring and loving community. You'd have to be a nerd and live in a corner to not come away affected. Second, they really believe in the educational process, and. the educational out­come that they've got here." 
A third factor could be football tickets. 
In order to be eligible for the football ticket lottery, an alumnus must contribute at least $25 per year. That will guarantee at least one pair of tickets to a Notre Dame home football game. 
Alumni contributions have built an endowment which currently stands at approximately $310 mil­lion. The next fundraising campaign ·is expected to raise more than $295 million, the most ambi­tious goal the University has ever set.

ALUMNI CLUBS FOR WHEREVER YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF 
compiled by Matt Bradley 

"Life after graduation"...it tends to be a popular topic for conversation· 
these days. The plans of the graduating seniors cover a broad scale. But, for 
many, those plans include Notre Dame in some way, either in buiness or 
socially. With this in mind, Scholastic is including the following list of 
Notre Dame alumni clubs. Included with each is the name of the club's 
president and his/her business telephone number (or residential number,

enu 
ORIENTAL EXPRESS. (Univer­sity Commons Shopping Center, 272-6702) A notch above your average Chinese fare, and the best prices in town for dinner. Most items are between $4-6. Nice atmosphere and good service. 
DELUXE SANDWICH SHOP. 
(529 N. Michigan, 233-0642) You never know who you will see at the Deluxe on a Saturday morning -all the local celebs hang out here. This is a coffee shop in the truest sense of the word and liasn't changed a bit since it opened in the late 50's. John, the owner/manager/chef, makes the best omelette and hash browns in town, and always manages to keep things interesting. Everyone should stop in and experience this place at least once. 
filLVER TOWER SEAFOOD HOUSE. (1536 Lincolnway West, 
233-0304) This is a classic neigh­borhood restaurant, it almost has the atmosphere of a British pub. While nothing fancy, the seafood here is always fresh and first rate. They specialize in fish -trout, pike, salmon, etc. -but they also have a good selection of other seafood available. The best deals are the nightly specials, but every­thing is reasonable -usually between $5-10. The steaks here are also worth a try; I had a T-bone here that was excellent. 
GOL:OEN NUGGET SALOON. 
(202 E. Main St., Niles, MI,(616)234-8788) This is your basic bar and grill -a great place to go for a burger and a few beers if you are up in Niles. The menu is mainly sandwiches, burittos and tacos. The onion rings are great. For dessert, go next door to the Paris Lunch &: Candy -an authen­tic soda shop from 1910. o

The First Step 

MUCH IS EXPECTED BUT HOLTZ IS MAKING NO PROMISES 
by Pete Pranica 
It's back . 

.,,· Nobody· knows just what "it.. ·' is, only ·that it is back. Whether ·you choose to call it wishful think­ing, optimism, rosy visions or bla­tant fannishness. there is a special feeling being nurtured in the wasteland that was Notre Dame Stadium.· 
There are about a hundred or so who check out the latest edition of the Fighting _Irish when they scrimmage inside the House That Rock Built. The oldest among them bring battered seat cushions. cigars and memories of a _grand and glorious past as well as a. not­so-grand · last five years. Then there are the new ones, kids fresh out of school on a Friday after­noon, not fully realizing what may be in progress. 

What is happening with the Notre· Dame football team this spring?· Just trying to figure out who goes where is .a major prob­lem.

1cm is his penchant for throwing the ball behind his receivers. His 13-3 interception-touchdown ratio of last year is completely unac­ceptable, even if Allen Pinkett scored the lion's share of the touches on the ground. At this writing, Beuerlcin is running with the number one offense while last year's pleasant surprise, Terry Andrysiak, is leading the second teamers. Steve Belles, who DNP'ed as a frosh last fall, is the most nimple afoot of the three and will likely give his elders a tussle through the Blue-Gold game and into the fall. 
Behind the quarterback, the cupboard is equally well-stocked. Without Allen Pinkett, Hiawatha 
While alums and stu­dents call for a reawak­ening of the echoes in Notre Dame Stadium, Lou Holtz is taking a very cautious approach in his first spring. 

Francisco will have to coax some heavy-duty mileage out of a pair of creaky knees, but his running in scrimmages seems to indicate that he his up to the challenge. Last year's super frosh receiver, Mark Green, will return to his high school position .at tailback to duel sophomore Corny Southall for playing time behind Francisco. Frank Starns, who suffered a leg injury early on, and Pernell Taylor will give the Irish a potent one­two punch at fullback while Tom Monahan will provide depth. However, Holtz has apparently gotten away from the "power I" with two fullbacks and a tailback in favor of a wishbone. 
That's right, Holtz does use the 'bone, primarily to showcase the running ability of wideout Tirri Brown. Throughout the spring, Holtz has guaranteed that Brown would get the ball "unless our opponents intercept the snap." Instead of three running backs, Holtz has the fullback at the point of the 'bone with a tailback as one half and a flanker as the other half. Thus, even if the quarterback of choice is having an off day, you can still get the ball into Brown's hands -a terrifying prospect for opponents as Michigan State and Navy will attest. 
The rest of the receiving corps returns intact with Brown, Alvin Miller, Milt Jackson, and Reggie Ward at the wideouts. Tight end is a bit thin as Tom Rehder grew large enough to play tackle, leav­ing an inconsistent duo of Joel Williams and Andy Heck in the breech. 
Notre Dame's offensive line might finally benefit from not being tabbed an All-American unit. At first glance, the loss of Mike Perrino, Ron Plantz, Tom Doerger, and Tim Scannell might seem devastating, but when you consider that all their backups saw considerable time last year, the picture seems less bleak. 
On defense, Holtz is concerned because when he counts the number of people at a given posi­tion "sometimes the numbers don't go very high." He's referring to the defensive line which has all the depth of a manilla folder. Only four scholarship players 
·return and two, Mike Griffin and Wally Kleine, are coming off seri­ous leg injuries. Kleine has shown this spring that he will be an impact player for the Irish, but Griffin is still watching from the sidelines. Matt Dingens and Jeff Kunz will have to do yeoman's work unless (or until) somebody like converted offensive lineman Marty Lippincott steps to the fore. A move to make outside line­backer Robert Banks a defensive end will be a help. 
The linebacking and secondary units should be in good hands, although a pass rush, disturbingly absent last year, will make them look even better. While the line­backing corps has no real head­liners, lunchpail players like Mike Kovaleski, Cedric Figaro and Ron 
Weissenhofer will add experience while "Flash" Gordon and Wes Pritchett will add the spunk.

After dropping a pass ''which my nephew could have caught" Miller was counseled that he was at Notre Dame because he could catch the ball, so there was no sense in yelling cir screaming about it. Just relax and make sure you catch the next one. Dissati3fied with a poorly-run passing drill, Holtz lined up, ran a crisp pattern and caught the ball in stride for a touchdown. Picking up his whis­tle, he said, "That's how it's done." 
Holtz is nothing if not in com­mand • of everything. "The Holtz mystique is that I do not stand up and promise things which we can­not guarantee," he asserts. Wr.en pressed on the subject of wins and losses, he simply says, "I believe we have the ability to win." 
And while that is not a guaran­tee, one gets the feeling listening to Lou Holtz that even if wins aren't promised or pledged they will be delivered nonetheless. •

What few stuaents realize is that some of their professors are work­ing even harder than they are just to stay at Notre Dame. In the case of junior faculty their jobs and often their entire careers depend on the results of their tenure review which will come out this week. Tenure came into being as a

security and protecting the faculty's freedom _to teach and do research on unpopular subjects. Upon receiving a doctorate, a per­son begins work as an assistant professor. After a probationary period of five to seven years, those who receive tenure are promoted to the rank of associate professor ­a virtual guarantee of lifetime teaching employment -while those who are not tenured are usually given one year's grace to find a job elsewhere. Traditionally, if an instructor's performance does not )iv~ UP. to the standards of excel­lence in teaching and research set by a given university, he is denied

Across the nation,· tenure has become a hotly debated issue among college faculty and administrators. Critics of tenure charge that it is too expensive to maintain during these times of educational budget cuts and that it deprives schools of the flexibility necessary to meet the changing

needs of today's college students. Proponents argue that the system is essential to protect faculty members' academic freedom . as well as f.reetlom from the uncer­tainty a Bout whether or not they v;ill have a j,ob next year. 
Throughout academia, the pros­pects for junior faculty in pursuit of tenure are dismal. An overa­bunda.nce of tenured professors at a time when college enrollments continue to decline and budg~t cuts affect an increasing number of institutions has brought about a tenure crisis in American academia. 
With a glut of young PhD's seeking faculty positions, especially in the humanities, it is certainly an employer's market. Only an estimated 20 percent of those now entering academia are able to find ten tire-track positions. Junior faculty on campuses across the country work under severe pressure as they compete fiercely for the few tenured positions available. 
Notre Dame is no exception. The issue of tenure at Notre Dame reflects the national crisis as well as some concerns particular to the university. As the university con­tinues in its efforts to switch over from a primarily teaching oriented undergraduate institution to a research and graduate oriented institution, the pressure on the junior faculty becomes ever more intense. Members of the junior faculty have revealed some serious misgivings about the organization of the tenure system at Notre Dame. 
At Notre Dame, 65 percent of those eligible are tenured, which is slightly above the national average of 60 percent. The system at Notre Dame is similar to that at other universities: to obtain tenure junior faculty must serve two three-year terms before becoming eligible. However, at other universities, renewal after the third year is only a token renewal awarded to all instructors who ful­fill the mm1mum professional requirements. At Notre Dame, the third year renewal has tradition­ally been as rigorous if not more so than the tenure review itself. In the spring of 1983, 60 percent of the younger teachers were denied 





renewal of their first 3~ year con­tracts. 
The primary objection of among the junior faculty is not the system itself which they feel comes with the profession, but the way that system is carried out by the Administration --more partic­ularly, they object to the aura of secrecy which surrounds the entire process. 
Whereas, at other universities, 

candidates for -renewal are informed of the progress of their case as it moves along from the departmental review committee up through the higher levels of the administration, at Notre Dame, the applicant receives no notification of the progress of his application until the final decision is made. From the time he submits his dos­sier in November until the letter arrives from Fr. Hesburgh in early May to announce whether or not renewal has been granted, the applicant is kept in silence. Furthermore, the president's letter only grants or denies renewal, but does not include an explanation for the decision. 
The secrecy surrounding the entire process lead one junior faculty member* to speculate that other factors such as religious orientation may be taken into con­sideration for renewal besides teaching and research perfor­mance. He commented, "One thing that adds to the pressure here is the way the Catholic nature of the University is defined. It seems the University has chosen to define Catholicism in a narrow way which results in preferential treatment for nominal Catholics." 
This prospect is very frightening for junior faculty who feel even outstanding professional creden­tials are not even enough to secure their renewal if they do not meet other ambiguous standards. 
Other junior faculty voiced similar concerns about the secrecy surrounding the renewal process and it's damaging affects. One candidate up for renewal this spring explained, "If you know in December that the department isn't behind your reappointment, you can start looking for a job then, and your chances on the job market are significantly greater earlier in the year and before you're turned down by one' school." He continued, "The morale among the junior faculty would be a lot stronger if the sys­tem were more humane." 
In addition, this assistant pro­fessor would like to see entire restructuring of the tenure system at the university in order to demystify the process so that the the use of power is no longer seen as an arbitrary force in the hands of the administration. 
According to normal pro­cedure, a candidate must submit his application for renewal during November of his third year. Though technically he is still per­mitted to. update his file throughout the year, the Commit­tee on Appointments and Promo­tions (CAP) for each department begins to judge the candidate essentially on his accomplishments during the past two years. Two years is an extremely short period for a young faculty member, espe­cially one just out of graduate school, to prove himself as a scho­lar. After review by the CAP, each application is then reviewed by the dean of the college who decides on the applicant in January or Febru­ary, the provost and finally the president whose decision is released to the candidate during the first week in May. 
It is extremely difficult for an assistant professor to go through this process and teach at the same time. At Notre Dame these diffi­culties are amplified as the school undergoes a transition from .an undergraduate teaching institution to a university with research and gra.duate status. This transition has brought about a dramatic increase in emphasis on scholarly achieve­ment, the burden of which has fal­len on the shoulders of the junior faculty. Among the junior faculty there is no doubt about the impor­tance of scholarship and research in obtaining renewal yet there is confusion as to exactly what con­stitutes scholarly achievement. 

Hi Mikel, Did you have a good weekend? Get any books pub­lished?" 

APRIL 30, 1986 
·, . 

"We know we have to publish or perish, but what do we have to publish? How much is enough?" asked one assistant professor. 
This comment reflects one of the greatest difficulties facing junior (acuity, the ambiguity sur­rounding the scholarship require­ments for renewal. Junior faculty 

complain that the standards for renewal are unclear. "The one who should be informed about the standards is the department head, but he is reluctant to counsel junior faculty since he doesn't know the criteria being used in the evaluation process by the higher levels of administration," said one tenure-track professor. 
The present form of adminis­trative review is particularly upsetting to junior faculty. "The administration tends to be impressed with the superficial rather than the substantial. They don't read the book you wrote, or look at it, just -where you pub­lished it," commented one profes­sor. H_e then qualified the criticism by adding that difficulties of judging scholarship in a highly specialized age are problems of the entire field and not just Notre Dame. 
Another candidate echoed this dissatisfaction with the adminis­trative policy. "The emphasis is on short term rather than long term scholarly development. The tenure process doesn't permit con­sistent, slow maturation. We're expected to produce articles like cookies in an atmosphere where the emphasis is on quantity not quality." 
Other hinderances to scholarly achievement include inadequate research facilities and heavy teaching loads. "How can they expect us to be a Harvard or Yale when they don't proyide us with a research library?" asked one assis­tant professor. "The library here is very good for only a few specific disciplines like philosophy and theology which isn't much help to those of us in languages," he added. 
In addition, three of the junior faculty members in the College of Arts and Letters noted that the teaching load they were required to carry was excessive given the research requirements. One explained, "The teaching load in modern languages and English is three courses per semester. No research university has such a heavy load." Another assistant 
professor summed it up well in a statement which seems to reflect the sentiments ..of his colleagues interviewed: "The· University hasn't made up its mind yet. It wants to be a first rate research institution, yet it is unwilling to pay the price for it by increasing faculty and facilities." 
With such an emphasis on scho­larship and research, junior faculty have experienced conflicts with their work as teachers. "Clearly the administration expects us to put teaching behind ­far behind -our research," com­mented one tenure-track professor up for renewal this year. 
This same professor pointed out with derision the passage from the Admissions Office .brochure which tells perspective students that "Professors here spend the major­ity of their time teaching and meeting with undergraduates." He added that that statement was probably written by the same administrator who told him off the record that teaching doesn't count for a thing when it comes to renewal. He commented further, "Bad teaching won't be tolerated, but the administration demands nothing more than adequate teach­ing and an awful lot of publica­tion." 
Another assistant professor expressed similar concern that research at the university was flourishing at the expense of teaching. "Teaching stimulates research and vice-versa, so I try to strike a balance between the two, 

but it's extremely difficult." This same professor noted, "It would be a shame to lose the tradition of good undergraduate teaching here," and added "I think students have a right to something better than they're getting m some cases." 
The experiences of one assistant professor who was denied tenure after his sixth year on tenure-track are a striking example of some of the weaknesses in the present system. The teacher, now finish­ing up· his grace year, reports· that he was very surprised to find his petition for tenure turned down after his sixth year especially since he was renewed after his third year and told to simply keep up the good work. "In fact I actually

Male Athlete Of The Year 
NOTRE DAME RELAY TEAM HEADS FOR THE RECORD BOOKS 
by Pete Gegen 

To achieve all-American str,tus: from the start of the school year that was the goal of four very talented middle-distance runners ­John McNelis, Robert Nobles, Jeff Van Wie, and Jim Tyler. Of cou: se it is easy to set goals for yourse If. The question is always whether or not they are attainable. As it turned out, this goal was in reach. 
And did foey ever reach that 


Rob Nobles 

goal. These four runners not only achieved all-American status by placing third in the NCAA Indoor Championships, but they also ran the fifth fastest indoor two-mile rel~y time ever. 
"I don't know if people realize what these guys have done," says a very proud Head Track Coach Joe Piane. "You take the fifth best running back in football, and he is enshrined. People should recognize the magnitude of the accomplish-
APRIL 30, 1986 
ment." 
Indeed th~y should. That is why the ~cholastic has named the four members of the two-mile relay team as the Male Athletes of the Year. On a March weekend, the two-mile relay team was one of the best in the nation. 
The wheels were set in motion last April when the outdoor two­mile relay tearr; of McNeil:,, Nobles, Van Wic, and Nick Sparks set a school record at the Drakl! Relays. It was the first time this relay was ever run -prior to this year the two-mile relay was not run in either indoor or outdoor track. But as the indoor rules changed, McNelis recognized the pe-tential of this talented crop of middle-distance runners. 
They ran the fifth fastest indoor two-mile relay ever. 
"I knew the two-mile relay would be strong," said the co­captain. "It was just a matter of deciding which four would run." 
Unfortunately that decision was determined by an injury. Sparks hurt his foot the second week back from summer vacation, and was forced to sit out the entire year. His place was taken by Tyler. The line-up was set. 
After two unsuccessful attempcs at qualifying for the NCAA Nationals, the relay team put together a strong race at the Terrier Classic in Boston. And despite recording what was then the third fastest time in the nation of 7:24.84, all four runners felt that they were still capable of run­ning faster. Piane noted, "No one ran out of their minds, in fa.ct only Tyler set a personal mark in that race." 
So on March 14, the relay team entered the MYRIAD Coliseum in Oklahoma City for the preliminary race of the two-mile relay. At this point the full weight of the impor­tance of the race was felt by all four runners. Nobles, for example, said that he forgot how many laps he had done around the one-tenth 

John McNelis 

mile track. Nevertheless, the relay team broke the school indoor record with a time of 7:23.07. 
The four returned the following afternoon for the finals. The ner­vousness of the previous day had worn off, and the Irish were prepared to fly. The competition was formidable -Penn State had won the prelim, Georgetown had a dangerous sprinter who could close a gap quickly, and both Auburn and Houston Baptist had run faster times previously. 
The leadoff -runner was McNelis, a three-year monogram winner. "He is a very reliable runner," said Piane. "For the last several years when we needed a leadoff runner, John could do it." It was McNelis' ability to stay at the front of the pack which esta­blished him as the leadoff runner. 
His time in this race was only 
1:52.4. But more importantly, he finished his leg in second place, 
Nobles then took the baton for the second leg. "My job is to get us in the lead if we are behind, or to increase the lead if we are ahead,., he said of his simple stra­tegy. Formerly a 400-meter runner, he doubled his distance in moving up to the relay last spring, and the results have been 
impressive. 
Fortunately, Nobles quickly moved out front in his leg, as a spill occured at his heels. Houston Baptist was disqualified when its 



The relay's time of 7:21.11 wa_s another school record, and it was also a national record. 
Jeff Van Wie 

the last turn, he was unable to hold off Auburn and Arkansas. 
Nobles' strategy sits well with Van_ Wie, who likes to run out in front. "Rob just makes things easier on me," said the smallest of the four runners, who does not like the pushing and jockeying for

in a quick 1:19. But as he rounded 


position of running in a pack. 
IJJ1mediately Van Wie passed the Auburn runner. He then keyed on the Arkansas runner, but he could not pass and a runner from G,eorgetown sneaked past · Van Wie. He brought the baton in with a split.of 1:49.4. · 
. The Tesponsibility of the anchor leg rested in Tyler's hand. The confident cross country co-captain expressed the correct mentality for the final leg when he said, '·I feel I can run with anybody." 

Tyler positioned himself directly behind the Georgetown runner. He tried twice to pass the Hoya, but he was unsuccessful. At the finish line, Arkansas, George­town, and Notre Dame crossed the line within a four-tenths of a second spread. Tyler's split of 1:48.7 was amazingly fast, indicat­ing that he gave it his best shot. 
The relay's time of 7:21.11 was another school record, and it was also a national record for a 160-yard track. But the sense of accomplishment did. not set in immediately, nor has the relay team had a chance to rest and reflect. "We had so little time on the track, less than two minutes each," lamented McNelis. 
Instead all four runners have jumped right into the outdoor sea­son. McNelis and Nobles are con­centrating on the 800-meter run and the mile relay. Tyler is staying 
with the 1500-meter run, and Van Wie is splitting time in the 800 and the 1500. Because there is no two­mile relay in outdoor track, all four are concentrat!.ng on indivi­dual events in the hr,p~ of qualify­ing for the nationr.ls. They will, however, get together for one more race. And it seems only appropriate that -the four all­Americans will do it at the Drake Relays, the place where the wheels were set in motion last year: •

Female Athlete Of The Year 
SULLIVAN ADDED NCAA TITLE TO LONG LIST OF ACCOLADES 
Molly Sullivan has once again gar­nered an athletic honor. The sophomore fencing sensation has been named 1986 Scholastic Female Athlete of the Year. But Sullivan isn't one to brag. In fact, all the attention is a bit puzzling to her. 

"If I wanted notoriety I cer­tainly wouldn't have picked fenc­ing as my sport," says the 1986 NCAA champion. "I just love to fence, plain and simple. Even if I hadn't received any of the hono;s I have this year, I'd still be fencing. It's even kind of confusing to get all this attention now. When I walk across campus and people say congratulations to me, I sometimes have to think twice and think, 'what for?' I just want my peers to accept me for who I am and not for my athletic skills." 
But for a talent like Sullivan, it is difficult to overlook such dis­tinguished accomplishments. She began training at a young age when her mother became acquainted with a fencing instruc­tor. Mrs. Sullivan asked her friend to come show her children the finer points of the sport and from the very start Molly seemed adept at the hand and foot work. 
She burst on the national fenc­ing scene at the ripe old age of 13 when she competed in the Junior oiympics in Portland, Ore., and won the 16-and-under title. The accolades continued as Sullivan found herself competing in the 1982 Junior Olympics in Switzer­land and the 1984 Junior Olympics in Leningrad, Soviet Union. 
"The traveling and such that I did early on really heli,ed me to grow," reflects the North And­over, Mass., native. "I learned a great deal about other people and 

The two-time Great Lakes 
champion. 
other cultures. And I learned a lot about myself. I was forced to be independent and handle difficult situations on my own." 
When the time came for her to decide which college to attend, Sullivan will admit that the main reason she chose Notre Dame was head fencing coach Mike DeCicco. For Sullivan, fencing is a part of life but not a way of life, and she saw that s~me type of a~titude coming from the Irish mentor. 
"Coach DeCicco is really a spe­cial person," says the Pasquerilla West resident. "He knows what the priorities in life are. Although winning and competing is impor­tant to him, he realizes that there is much more to life as a student­athlete. And he has been like a guardian angel for me -always keeping on my back to make me do my best academically and ath­letically."

won the '85 Great Lakes cham­
pionship. She also earned All­
America honors, placing fifth in 
the NCAA finals. Because of her 
abilities, the team as a whole went 
12-7 and things were looking up 
for the program. · 
During the summer prior to her sophomore year Sullivan turned her full attention to fencing and became the first woman ever to win both the junior and senior gold medals at the Nationals, as well as being a member of the gold medal team. 
The benefits of the extra sum­mer training paid off when Sul­livan and the Irish rolled to a 23-0 mark in 1986, winning the Great Lakes Championships. Individu­ally, Sullivan posted a 48-3 record (.941) which put her second on the career winning percentage Ust for 
women fencers at the University with a .929 mark. She also cap­tured the Junior Olympic gold medal in February and won her second straight Great Lakes title ­not to mention her accomplish­ments in the NCAA Champion­ships. The team as a whole fin­ished second in the NCAAs, the best finish ever for a Notre Dame women's fencing team. 
"Winning the Championships is like a dream come true right now," says the sophomore. "It was a fantastic weekend for the team and myself. What more could you ask? I really had worked hard for this, and I enjoyed every minute of it." 
But Sullivan holds other dreams in her heart that have yet to come true. The 19-year old has plans to travel to Seoul, Korea in 1988 for the Olympics. With the way she _has been going, don't be too surprised if her dreams of an Olympic title become reality. e

BILL BRADLEY MAV LEAD A NEW MOVEMENT INTO POWER 
by Elizabeth Dold 

For anyone who has ever worked, interned or campaigned for a poli­tician, the following is what! con­sider to be the most embarrassing situation you could encounter: 
The phone rings and a new intern answers it in the manner that he has just been carefully trained. 
Intern: "Hello, Senator Bradley's office. May I help you?" 
Caller: "Hi, can I speak to Ray please?" 
Intern: "May I ask who's calling?" 
Caller: "This is Bill." 
(Now here's the embarrassing part) 
intern: "Bill who?" 
Caller. "Bill Bradley" . 
Intern: "Oh..:.Sorry, Sir" 
Luckily for the senior senator from New Jersey, Bill Bradley is · in some ways better known outside 

of his office than in. In fact, Sena­
tor· Bradley is fast becoming one 
of the best known names in poli­
tics. T4e all-American boy is . quickly accelerating his pace on the climb up Capitol Hill. 
I remember being quite pleased when so many people responded with unexpected recognition as I told them for which Senator I was working. Why do so many people, and not only basketball fans, know who Bill Bradley is? There are several reasons. 
Bradley, who was born in Mis­souri, attended Princeton Univer­sity where he received honors in American History. As .is often the case, his political views began to take shape at this time. But politics was temporarily put · aside for a dazzling career in basketball. 
His first political job was as a summer intern while he was still an undergraduate. He worked for a young Republican congressman from Philadelphia, Richard Schweiker.' Schweiker went on to become a senator and then Secre­tary of Health and Human Services. From there Bradley was offered the chance to work for the Scranton-for-President campaign. He saw and heard the senate debate on the Civil Rights act tak­ing place at the time and a few years later he would be influenced by Robert Kennedy and the anti­war wing of the Democratic party. 
Following Princeton, he attended Oxford as a Rhodes scho­lar, passing up an opportunity to play for the New York Knicks. In 1967 it came time to make a choice -basketball or politi'.cs. In an age where the image makes the man, Bradley made the right choice. He signed with the Knicks, becoming the highest paid basketball player in the world at the time. 
Ten years later a lot more peo­ple knew who Bill Bradley was and his confidence was bolstered. He decided to run against New Jersey's Senator Clifford Case. The state's most· influential Democrats had, however, already decided to back Richard Leone, a highly · 
SCHOLASTIC 

regarded young politician. This initial fight revealed exactly what type of political creature Bill Bradley was, faults and all. He was self-conscious about using his basketball career and delivered speeches that could leave even the most ardent supporter feeling drowsy. Nevertheless, he had lit­tle trouble defeating Leone in the primary, improving his campaign­ing skills along the way, and won the general eleotion with 56.8 per­cent of the vote. 
While most Democrats will recall 1984 with a wince, for Brad­ley it was another year of political success. By winning 65 percent of the vote in a state in which Reagan won with 60 percent, Bradley gained his second term as senator and registered the most impressive personal victory in New Jersey electoral history. His acceptance speech was reserved, taking into account the mood of a crowd whose party leader in Washington had just been trampled on, but the underlying thoughts were undeni­able. Bradley was already looking forward to his next challenge when he said, "When I think of this campaign, the images of New Jersey flash across my mind and then all the eyes and all the smiles and all the faces merge into one and it is the face of America." 
Regardless of the thinly veiled hints of higher political ambitions, Bradley displays a keen sense of diplomacy and timing. If you ask the senator about his political future now, he will simply state that he wishes to be the best sena­tor that he can be. In no way is his success seen by those in New Jer­sey as only a stepping stone for Bradley to the presidency; his con­stituents seem to sense his loyalty. 
Thus, the beginning · to Bradley's career, is very impres­sive; a solid background for a man of 42 years. As a senator, Bradley has been appointed to the Finance Committee, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Special Committee on Aging and 
APRIL 30, 1986 
the Intelligence Committee. He has chaired two task forces on economic growth for the Senate Democratic Caucus. The Senator's list of accomplishments and blue collar work ethic is enough to command the attention and respect given to him, but behind all this is the man himself. 

Bradley has built a reputation as one who eschews the Washing­ton social circuit for nights in the office. He attends to many duties other senators leave for their staffs. He has found his element in the nuances of legislative com-
Susan Thomases, manager of Bradley's '78 campaign, said it best when she remarked, " ... there's also the _pride factor: what does it give us, knowing that other states covet our senator? And· what does he give us, in kindling within us the hope that American politics can again become attractive ... [he is] willing to take the risks that make excellence happen." 
Bradley has been placed among a new breed of politicians that have been called both the New Pragmatists and the· neoliberals. Bradley himself, who does not like these kinds of labels admitted that

mittee fighting and has logged in more time than any of his col­leagues in the tedious job of presiding over the Senate. 
Bradley's . time as senator is obviously not being spent as one long campaign for the presidency. In an interview with New Jersey Monthly magazine the Senator stated, "I'm unabashedly a New Jersey advocate. I'm trying to make people take a look at New Jersey and say, "Wow! Look at what's there -it's fantastic! And they do, and they will." 
there is a new group in Washing­ton who see "that the traditional Democratic responses really had their origins in the '30's and are not going to meet the problems of the '80's." 
Neoliberalism is still in its for­mative stages and to a large extent is still more a spirit than a set of policies. The New Republic cap­tured that spirit when it said that their purpose is "to make good intentions marketable again."

secure. Neoliberalism is largely interested in the sphere of real policy and . is still somewhat incomplete in its intellectual for­mulation. Moreover, and perhaps most importantly, it has yet to be articulated in a clear, coherent and easily digestible package by a can­didate of national stature, much like the current President has been with Reaganism.

What. makes his case most upsetting is that he has been unable to obtain from the adminis­tration a solid explanation for his dismissal. "NJ one minds getting canned if they know why, but 011e is entitled to. a goo:l answer," he said. He explained that such an answer is very important for his future plans .. "How can I avoid ~aking the same mistake else­where in the future if Notre Dame won't tell me what went wrong here?" 

Among the other specific objections this assistant professor has· to the way his case was han­dled are the following: the first notification, written or verbal, he received about the requirements for renewal in his department was put in his mailbox two weeks before his rejection; although he had been an instructor at Notre Dame since 1973, he did not begin tenure-track until 1978 at which time he was given no choice as to whether or not he wanted to be considered for tenure or continue on as an instructor; the university made no concessions in his case though he was carrying a heavy · teaching load and was involved working overtime with students; and since he was not informed of the problems with his renewal early enough in the semester to find another job he was forced to 
stay on for the extra year. 
He went on to say that though he loves to teach, his future plans do not include academia. "The process isn't worth the mental anguish." He added, "It's tougher to get reviewed by the administra­tion than by the CIA." 
Though the experiences of this particular professor reflect one of the saddest cases, they indicate many of the weaknesses underly­ing Notre Dame's present tenure policy. •

final word _____________________ 
At Odds With The Vatica·n 
ISSUES IN THE CURRAN DISPUTE 
by Reverend Robert J. Kennedy 

On September 17, 1985, Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, Prefect of the Vatican Congregation for the Doc­trine of the Faith, sent a letter to Father Charles E. Curran, profes­sor of moral theology at the Catholic University of America, stating that unless he retracted certain views on various official teachings of the Catholic Church, Curran would not be allowed to continue teaching Catholic theol­ogy in the name of the Church. The letter was the conclusion of a six-year investigation of Curran's work, especially in. the area of sex­ual and marital ethics: abortion, birth control, premarital sex, mas-. turbation, homosexuality, artificial insemination and the indissolubil­
ity of marriage. 
On March 11, 1986, Father Curran issued a statement indicat­ing that he would not retract his teaching until it was made clear to him the specific nature of his alleged deviation from Catholic teaching and he denied that his positions were either rebellious or radical. Between these two events, efforts were made by Curran and several U.S. bishops to strike a compromise with Rome, and those negotiations continue. There has also been strong support from his bishop and his academic colleagues around the world for Curran's careful scholarship, his attention to the traditional teaching of the Church and his pastoral sensi­tivity. · 
But now Father Curran waits for further word from Rome -and so do we. 
But why should we wait for the outcome of the controversy? Isn't it simply a case of Rome disciplin­ing one of its disobedient sons? Isn't it clear that a Catholic theolo­gian must teach what the hierarch­ical magisterium teaches? Unfor­tunately, it is not so clear and sim­ple. Serious issues are at stake in the decision about Father Curran and his work which will have an impact on Catholic moral theology and Catholic theology in general, on the pastoral practice of the Church and on the academic enterprise, especially as it is car­ried out in the American setting. 


The most important issue this controversy raises is the role of the theologian in the life of the Church. Is he the mouthpiece of the hierarchical magisterium through which credal formula­tions, papal statements, conciliar decrees and curial pronouncements are voiced; or is the theologian a creative and critical commentator who serves the · research and ' reflective dimension of the overall teaching enterprise in the Church by searching for new and better formulations of . the truth of 
·church teachings? This is answered in part by naming the sources available to a theologian for his task. If the pronounce­ments of the official ·magisterium are considered the -sole source, then the task of the Catholic theo­logian is very different than if one is able to consider· scripture, the full tradition of the Church and the experience of faithful men and women, past and present, as sources. 
A second issue is the ·terms of public theological debate. .Rome and all the Church's theologians have to recognize that theological research and discussion no longer go on in isolated monastic libraries or insulated university classrooms; the theological enterprise today is as public as St. Peter's Square. Vatican officials and theologians alike have to accept that fact and then operate carefully and respon­sibly in light of it. It is also fair to expect, in view of this public con­text, that theological debate would involve honest efforts at dialogue for the sake of clarifying mutual positions. This has not occurred in 
APRIL 30, 1986 
the Curran-Ratzinger debate. The precise disharmony between the official teachings and Curran's _ positio"ns have not been clearly · articulated by Rome. And, as a matter of fact, when one reads Curran's work, one finds that his positions are not very far at all from the Church's official stand. 
But this raises a third area of concern: do Catholic theologians ­or any Catholics, for that matter ­have the right to dissent from the Church's non-infallible teachings? It should be clearly understood that the official magisterium, while teaching expressly about the above mentioned topics in sexual ethics, has never issued an infalli­ble statement about any one of them. For that reason, these 
teachings are open for reflection by theologians so that the Church's teaching might be more credibly_ presented in the context of the present world. But this reflection may also lead theologians to ques­tion the validity of the Church's arguments or -the theological .r:,esources it brings to bear in mak­ing its case. Father Curran has, for a long time, argued that such dissent is consistent with the role ­and the responsibility -of the acts if the truth is to be found. 
A final point to be raised here is the impact this controversv will have on theological reflecti~n in the American setting. In the United States, Catholic education and the Catholic intellectual tradi­tion have had a hard time estab-

lishing themselves as credible partners in an atmosphere which has often been suspicious of the motives of the Roman Catholic Church. Perceived Roman control of church members seemed to threaten the pluralism and indivi­dual freedom so proudly valued in America. That perception is fueled by this controversy which calls into question academic freedom and ecumenical theological dialo­
gue. 

As we await the outcome of this present controversy, the Church, and especially its academic com­munities, need to think through the questions it raises. What is the relationship of the Church's theo­logians with the hierarchical ,magisterium? What are the terms and concerns of public theological debate when the viewpoints of the theologians, as well as that of the pope, are regularly part of the evening news? Do theologians and church members have a right to dissent from the non-infallible teaching of the Church, and, if they do dissent, can they still be considered members of the Church? How can the Church faithfully and credibly present its teaching, so that the world can hear it and engage in dialogue? •
