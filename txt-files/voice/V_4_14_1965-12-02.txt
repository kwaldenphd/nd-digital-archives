The programs under the Human -Affairs Coordinator, including the -Civil Rights Commission, the In­ternational Commission, and the Committee on South Bend-Notre Dame relations, were allocated a · total . of -$2640~ The Academic · Commission was allowed $4470, · mo'st of which ls for lectures, and the Student· Affairs Commission was given $1195.71, The Hall _Life Coordinator . · was given $927.50.

The· debate which followed cen­· tered. on the question of whether such -a :referendum would nee­essarily pass in the student body, . and whether ·it was proper to dsk the future of the VOICE on such an ultimatum•. It .was decided not to attach the rider to the budget, but

··The.-Voice -Finances· 
At ~fonday ·night's Senate meeting, Stay Senator Jed Kee pre-· sented a proposal to force the VOICE out of existence unless support from either tile ·communicatio1i Arts Department or an increased activities fee was forthcoming. Although the resolu­tion was. d~feated and an alternative study by the Policy com­mittee was substituted, some discussion of the VOICE's financial situation seems called for in reply. . 
Actually, the Kee resolution presented only one alternative· to the VOICE, since the. CA department turned down a similar request by f.he paper for financial support last spring. The head .of the department said at Utat time that he was not interested in supporting practical journalism or in starting a journalism · school at Notre Dame. -· 
Despite Kee's· allegations, the VOICE ·is costing student Government less this year than last, and the percentage· of the paper's. total budget contributed by SG continues to decline, · from 100% just four years ago to less than 45% for 1965-66. 'The prospects are· for· increasing self-sufficiency. A subscrip­. .tion drive, · \\bile not providing spectacular results, has been ·a profitable venture~ In corning years it promises to be even 
more profitable. Advertising revenues· are substantially higher than previous figures; with increasing emphasis on highly­profitable local arlvertising, revenues should go even higherwhile ad lineage declines. · . .senator Kee based his argument on the necessity :of increasing the SG activities.fee to keep pace with increasing SG respons­ibilities. Ho,vever, Treasurer Rich. Linting points out that the 
oresent $5 assessment will be adequate after this year, when 
. the debt is retired. What's more, there is no correlation between the VOICE and the activity fee, Although the VOICE is the most recent and ambitious undertaking of student government, an increase in the fee would not go entirely to the VOICE. In-· stead the Academic commission, ·international commission, Civil 'Rights commission, and many other activities would ben­efit. The activity fee !increase should be considered as it af­fects the entire range.of SG activities. . . 
The VOICE would like to be weaned from the Student govern~ 
_ment, and the· accompanying• dependen_ce on the vagaries of campus politics; To cut off the paper at this stage, however, when it .is on Ute verge of financial indeperidence I would be to throw away the several thousand dollars that three previousSG administrations have· invested, 'And to consider. the essen­tially separate questions of Ute VOICE and the activities fee would be both unfair and potentially tragic. · ·
