THE OTHER MARDI. GRAS 
THE 
VOICE
A recent editorial in the St. Mary's· CRUX described the typical Notre during .the day· a~d wander th.rough the. bistros ~.f Bourbo·n street at 
Dame Mardi Gras activities: the Grand Boll, the .Carnival, the Con­cert,.the Champagne Brunch, and Communion Breakfast; .. 
The air af solemn boredom indicated that the writer must have been at least.a sophomore.(For, you see, it takes.only one .visit to the''ND Mardi Gros to reoli%e that if this is the third bigge_st collegiate.wei,k­
. and:. as It. is blatantly. billed • then there mui.t be many firsts· seconds.) · . . . · . . . . .. 
With this in mind, several editors of.the VOICE decided ta see what_ Mardi Gras is· really like; and .what better place to find out than th·e traditio11al' home of the Shrove Tuesday festivities, New. Orleans, Louisiana,.· , ' · • . . 
What we found .deep in that Bayou country was fn stork and refresh• · ing contrqst to the. stilted a~cr boring formalism of Mardi Gras I and II; "Mardi Gras IH" is a •thne of ·open and honest jubi lotion•. It is. an in• formal and spontarie'ous celebration, ·characte~i:zed by the _abandoning of all the cares af society'to the joys of boisterous revelry.. . .. 
•Gue·sts attending Mardi Gros ·111 ,do not have to leave their ID cards at motel desks, they do not, have to tell their rectors or house· mothers where they are g~ing to be, who they. are going to be with, what time they are coming in, and what they expect to' be ·doing, -In fact, t_hey do not have• to tell anyone anything, for they ore re:.ptinsible to no one· but themselves and society. . · . . 
There· is a s'en.se of absurdity: about Mardi.· Gras in New Orleans: -for some it would seem absurd •that the city ·spends hundreds of thou­. sands of dollard each year ·on ·a community. celebration; for some· it would. seem absurd that alm.ost every school and college in the state of Louisiana· suspends classes Jor at least 'the days of Shrove Tuesday 
. and ·Ash Wednesday; for some it. ·w·ould · seem-absurd that thousands ·· of, college studenJs (estimated .at ·over one hundred thousand this year) : return.·each year to sleep 'an the floors of fraternity an~ sorority _houses

For some 'al I this -might. seem absurd. But nothing· that goes on in New Orleans· during Mardi Gros approaches the· childish absurdity of Notre Dame's medieval precept which preempto~ily announces -that ''no couple attending, the Mardi· Gras Bol I may leave the Stepan Center 

(er LoFortuna1 bafore twelve midn1aht." The fantastic: nbsurdity of 
such .a rule existing at a supposedly ernlightonod university sta9gers 
the imaaination and s~uns the modern mind. . · . . · 
· Tha religious. mentality behind such. restrictions enforces· regulo• tions . implying that ND. men will go. berserk at the. slightest opporiun• ity. The p~octice ·is .reminiscent of .th_e Crusad!lr's precaution of lock, Ing their wives in metal corsets as·. they left for ·.the Holy· Wars; to in• sure their constancy. Notre ·Dome ·men· leave the· University similarly insulated from the real .world,'·_hoving been· ·nurtured in on atmosphere artificial and stultifying to the expression of human freedom, · 
La;k of a ·proper, sociai life_ a't Notre 'Dame creates a serious· enough problem without the. compllcot!ons arising from childish rules rei.!ri.ct~ · ing student spontaneity. The formalism and stuffiness that _hove long been c:haracteristic of Notre· Dome social· gatherings are no_t cond1c1civeof mature Individuals. To ·advocate freedom. for ·students ,does not imply a .call for. the irrational excesses tnat often accompany the New Orleans version of the Mardi Gras celebration, It does imply; however, that _students can only develop free_dom from the unnatural. constraints 
·with wl,ich theadministration hos shackled .them in the past. . The outstandi~g sch~ols· of the world h~v~ discovered that tr~e great~ ness must include recognition of student independence,· And yet.Notre· Dame· logs behind, Until the administration realizes that its. students are individuals ci:rpi:rble of,· and in need of,· respon-sibility; ND cannot hope to achieve greatness.. : . ·
