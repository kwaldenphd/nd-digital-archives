This year's method, . though, may have achieved the height of inefficiency. stu­dents may suffer through th.e . entire , pro­cess -of meeting with advisors,: con1ple­ting their. schedules, and: obtaining author­ization slips, only to find that some section · or course is closed and that . the · process must oe repeated.

Today,. I d~idedto stick to the. title of this column and discuss exactly that: '.Believe it or· not, 

" -59me things are · going on at that nearby institution. For instance, last Saturday night the Missions Cltib sponsored the annual Charity Ball. The dance brought many 
-Notre Daine gentlemen their first opportunity to see just what's · ' behind those doors in the foyer of ~ans Hall. Theyfound the long 

; hall of administration offices, and main · entrance, and Stapleton __ _ 
--Lounge, the college•·s formal living -­. --:· room. The ball itself was held in 
the former dining room, which is also the former ballroom. Follow­fag a "Palals de Roi0 theme,· the ·paneled, marble floored hall · · glowed to the.French theme around ·. a -roaring · fire. iri .the fireplace•. 
. The old dining-hall has proved to be an excellent.place for dances; More will be coming up this year. 
Several ·Saint Mary's girls are getting the BobHope.;;U.S.O. spirit. · and are writing to soldiers in Viet _ Nam. -I suppose thisis the girls' reverse an.,wer to .buming draft. cards~ The Crux received a letter 

· from· three Marines in· Viet Nam . (complete with vital statistics. and · descriptions of themselves) who wanted Saint Mary's girls-for pen­pals. I don't know how they decided on Saint Mary• s. We don't have an Alunmac Association in Saigon. Perhaps. they went to Notre Dame _ at:one time. However, they will 
· -. probably get at least 300 lettersin· response. Atleast we can't say Saint Mary's is ignoring the war in Viet Nam!. The first snowfall this. year is . bringing thoughts of ice skating on. Saint Mary's lake. It was only frozen-once last year. during finals. A Winter Carnival for early February. is being planned, · although plans are not· definite. · It wlll include an Ice shaw, skating, snowball bights, and adance after-. ·wards.
