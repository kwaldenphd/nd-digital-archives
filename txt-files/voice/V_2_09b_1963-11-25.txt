Dallas Stud~nt Analyzes City: Assassination Plausible There 
.:.. few Tl'iles from MV heme President Kennedv was assassinated. P-s a.!::>allasite I must.search mv mind for the reason -behir1d this treP.:­edy. 
Dallas, whose motto is "Freindliness," has long been know as the hone of radicals of all persuasion. 

Just as assassination is plausible because of the no­. litical extremism in Dallas, nurder is casual and comron place in ·Dallas and Te·xas society. Each year the state leads the nation in murder. There are more murders in 
Dallas alone than in F.np,land. Murder wit.11out motive is al,­so ~pical. These murders are often accomplished with no retribution. A waran or teen­ager is seldom given more than a few years_ sentence, and often go free. Last year,
p.rand juries in Dallas no-
b'll d f .
i e one O every three persons charged with nurder.
