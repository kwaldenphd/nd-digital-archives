The ·Stt1;dent-Facidty Community 
Lately much attention has been •focused on a pervading disposition of anti-intell­ectualism and immaturity among the men of Notre Dame. The expression of this mood is considered by some as respon­sible for the lack of the kind of intellect­ual commitment which· fosters private dis­

cussions.  Others go  so  far·· as  to  blame  
this atmosphere for hotel vandal. All of  the as  rationale have read  or the of the  

,. discontent ·caused by this "our" ·attitude in numerous campus editorials. Barry Lopez mod_erated a session on· WSND last sat-· urday night which allowed tliis airing of · similar views on this subject by a number of students. On the program nearly all or the ·men felt tllat "something" · was lacking in the intellectual life, in the' gen­
. eral outlook of the student. body and yet they .were ready to admit ·or a spirit of COJl!munity here•. a difficult thing to. d~­sci:1be; but something very real. · To ex-: amme some of the reasons · behind this discontent, .to· pay due·-attention to· ·the spirit .we feel, are· Uie · purposes of this 
editorial. · · .· .· ·· ·... . · 
. ·part of the problem of attitude -might -be ascribed. · to -the·· depersonalizing• .atmos­phere. of the. modem_ mechanized universicy. ·Also _analysts of.' the present• system of 

higher education·. observe ·a trend .. toward · . . professionalism on· the ·part.of both.students.. · and· faculty members; . . . . --. . . · It' seems, after informal discussion with 
members .of. otir faculty. that they .are . well · aware of the evils ·of depersonalization. It affects them as it ·does the students. The greater number of them . are earnestly con-. tending with · this problem.·:· Professor. Sniegowski remarked. that• "·The· · great majority_ ot Qie. r;ic!]lf;yt: lloth Qld.1tnd. young ·are approachable :and . interested'. in -student contact."· :He: feels: that<''student· retic­ence!'· i~: largely ·responsible for ·w!Jat: may be lac~!•i_n ~~~~n!~faculty rel_at~0l}S· : • : .

victim of this aspect of· the multiversity. Professor Costello· cited reasons for the ready involvement of our faculty in the . task of teac;hing, While noting that "a time for scholarship is certainly important.,, he said, "We can be happy for the fact that in a Christian university the responsibilityfor instructing the young is well rec'og­nized." He pointed out that "The teach­. ing encounter adds life to · the scholar' s perspective or his field." · The fact that · our professors are noi distant .and. unapproachable, the fact that ;they: are not' constantly occupied in re­
search to the exclusion of -the students-. · these add to the spirit of community which · prevails· here at Notre Dame. students re-.
