The United Nations, headed by Student Body President John Gearen as Secretary General, served as a force.working toward peace in a world troubled by · such issues as armaments,.the Congo, Viet Nam, Red China, and the votes of Russia and France in the U.N. 
The organi:zed governing body for eachnation was set up in a differ­ent room, with a set of diplomatic channels for international com­munication. To further complicate matters, a presidentialelectionin the United States and governmental shake-ups in some of the other cotintries provided internal pressure to the world situation. . 
Just as the real world situation is made knovm through various channels of information, a ''world View," consisting of both news · items and security leaks was published periodically throughout the course of the games. 
Capt. T.F., Kennedy, USAF, played the role of Military AdVisor in the exercise,assessing the military strength of each nation and de­termining the victor in any armed conflict.

An exercise in diplorcatic war games was staged by members of the 
political science depai1:ment and other interested students last Fri­
day and Saturday in O'.Shaughnessey Hall. These "international" 
games grew out of an attempt to test a graduate paper on political.

The leaders were allowed to create their own world problems; ac­
cording to Mr. James Bogle, faculty moderator. "The participants 
were free to develop their own problems; however, the system

. 
I have been imprudent enough in my increasing years on this earth ro have given battle against _many a cause. Bue I have never been so imprudent as to give battle against natural phenom­ena. I have bowed my head to weather, mountain ranges, and the tides of the seasons. In the same spirit I accept students evaluating their teachers. In fact, like most teachers, I was once a student myself, and I evaluated with 
the best of them. 
But I made my, own judgments and I. shared them with other students mak-· ing their judgments in the most natur­al and inevitable way --by word of mouth and openness of ear. And this is the difference between the teacher-evaluation that is a good natural phe­nomenon and the kind of evaluation that has been suggested recently by some few students here at Notre Dame. l --we --111_ade our own judgments and we did not think we had to depend upon the Star-Chamber evaluations made br a handful of students --act­ually, some sixteen ---who, by the presumption of some sort of superior wisdom, are able to determine what professional men are first-rate and 
what ones are inferior. Make no mistake about it. This is what is meant. by the student evaluation 
Propo_sal at Notre Dame now. Some sixteen students, necessarily in their spare time, have come together in what manner few :know, to pool their· necessarily parti~l experience, with 
. · 

what principles· of·selection no one knows·, that they may determine who are, in effect, the. most worthy teach­

broad experience really want to take on so much responsibility; I suggest they do it this way: let them publish their findings, put their names on the 
•title page, and present this publica­tion as their opinion . and no one else's. 
'Here my quarrel with these student~ ends. Those of the Sixteen I know I admire as students and as young m~n, and I forgive them much for the good­ness of their hearts and the purity of their ideals. But as young men of ad• mittedly good intentions, these gentle• men asked the Dean of the College of Arts and Letters for $100 to finance their project. That students should want to-judge their teachers is, I re-pe·at, both good and inevitable. That some small group of students should ~ant their judgments P.ublished is not beyond belief. But that this partial 
.. an_d limited judgment --which is not necessary, arid which will help so few and hurt so many --should be sane­tioned by the Dean of the College, 
which it will be if it is financed, is beyondbelief. There are many valid formal methods 
of teacher-evaluation. One method is for, students, working from a broad consensus, to finance and publish their findings. Another is for the Col­lege or the University, µsing profes-­
· l

s1ona techniques, to distribute eval­uation· forms which all the students will fill out, and which will be s~ud­

Why the· Fuss_ over· Evaluation? 
The suggestion that students com­pile and distribute extended descrip­tions of university courses has a­roused controversy beyond expecta­tions for such . a modest proposal. Since the courses are not to be "eval­uated" b~ t only listed the exercise, superficially, appears· pointless: form~ alistic. Of course this is less 'than the truth since it will be reasonably inferred that the "better", or at least more popular, courses will be listed and others will not. In human terms, one inevitable result will be that fac­ulty members whose courses are listed will regard the project with favor; those ,whose courses are not included will likely be critical. 
·But what real difference will this make? Course evaluation booklets (not mere lists) circulate more _or less openly on·many campuses. From time immemorial. students have freely' ex­changed· opinions about the character and appeal of teachers and the worth · ofcourses. Any student considering a given co_urse always has ample oppor­~unity to consult ~urviving veterans of previous years. To put some of this on paper, either directly or by impli­cation, is hardly revolutionary. ' 
The objection is often raise·d that students are incompetent to evaluate courses. Unquestionably this is true . of some courses and quite a few stu-' dents; but it is not a universal truth. · -
by those who must bear the responsi­bility of teacher-hiring, firing, and promotion. 
These • -and especially the second form •• are responsible evaluations. 
But for any College to sanction the judgments of a few upon the many who have ;given long ·and dedicated pro­fessional service is incredible! 
· Norljng, Bernard P. 
Associate Professor, 
·Hulory 


Many· students are quite intelligent, 
perceptive, mature, and interested 
enough to discern faults in courses 
and to offer reasonable suggestions 
for improiement. (I know this to be 
true from personal experience, having 
asked for course evaluations in one 
of my own classes for some years.) 
It· is also true that an individual 
teacher, like any other person, is not 
always · the best judge of his own 
case. If one's courses were' consist­
ently omitted from the lis't this might occasion some .pr!vate humiliation but it might also spur one t~ try a lit­de better. It i_s not harmful for anyone · to be reminded _occasionally that his customary efforts and performances arc probably less than the best of -which he is ~apable. Anyway, what• ever criticisms or recommendations students may · offer -~ •:, a'nd in this 
case they will be only by implication .• 
--• the teacher, will remain free co 
heed or ignore them. 

Finally, it should not· be forgotten, 
that education at Notre Dame is ex­
pensiVe. If sane students arc growing. 
concemed to. get a bit more for their 
money, thisis hardly cause foralarm 
or opposition.. 

Vote Tomorrow. _.for Action 
-·, ,• -' ' 
A handsh~ke ·and a smile are· unfortunately about the most potent of the political weapons being used to sway· votes in the Student Government elections 
tomorrow. 
Much more, however, lies behind the passage from the Gearen Administratior to the next. The present administration, in achieving many· of its goals, has opened up new area for closer relations between stu­dents, faculty and administration, and has increased the prospect of greater student rights. 
The exploration of these areas is vital to the future development of student Government and of Notre Dame.· itself. If left alone, the ideas planted by Gearen will be lost to the wind -unfertilized through inaction. 
The elections tomorrow offer a chance for the stu­dents themselves to pick men of experience, per­haps even vision, who can press those explorations. It is important for each student to vote and vote wisely for their choice. 
Protect the hope that coff!placency can be overcome by action.

mittee under Stay Senator Pete
Carey, is going to try to or­
ganiz.e and channel these at­
tempts. Specifically, the com­

in the fall of next year and supply 
them with information so that 
they can represent Notre Dame 
to their high schools when they 
return home for Christmas va­
cation, Perhaps the members of 
the Alumni Project will be ask­
ed to be the nucleus of this at­
tempt. 

Surely there are limitations to what can be done. The Dean of Admissions will want tobe satis­fied that each person represent­ing Notre -Dame is well pre­pared with all the relevant facts. He may also be unwilling to let. so;me students, speak before a general assembly of the high 
personal view. And these are just the formal points. Besidesthese, who could give better advice than a student here about exactly how much it costs to spend the year . at Notre Dame -what depart­
ments are strong andwhatteach­erwith in the· department? Who could be more convincing than someone right now involved and committed, in not only an ad-. ministrative but a personal way. And what could be better for the individual student, to understand . better his own relation to Notre Dame, and to suggest to another .a decision which he is happy to 
have made himself. 
·Despite minor drawbacks, it 
seems that there is a great deal 
of merit in the prograrn, bothfor 
the -individuals and for Notre 
Dame. It seems that there is a 
convenient nucleus for operation 
and a solid committee with a will­
ing and competent head. Let's 
hope that , action can .be taken.

Rooney_ Speaks on Leadership 
"The principal contribution of Sargent Shriver in the War on college ·is .·a scholastic edu-·Poverty program, also spoke at catiori," said Fr. William .: the:conference. · · ' ·• Rooney, -English professor at ·· In·, the keynote speech, Fr. Catholic University and Exe-:;·Roone'y. brought up topics for 
cutive Director of the. Catholic Commission on Intellectual arid Cultural Affairs, at a Sunday afternoon speech· in the Library Auditorium. ,The address by Fr. Rooney was the highlight of the Blue Circle Leadership Conference held over the past weekend in the Library. Francis Hennigan, assistant to group discussion, concentrating his.talk on moral leadership and. preparation in college. 


Fr. Rooney began his speech by noting that moral leadership and· values are determined by one's capacity for judgment, stemming from participation .and commit­ment. There is ''no sUbstitute for action in the formation of values," Father · emphasized throughout his talk, since this helps man .to COPe with the cru­cial problem of society-his i­dentity, or relation as part of a larger · society. The basis of a liberal education, Father con­cluded, is to provide a rational basis for judgment--to decide "what is true, what is good, what is beautiful" rathe'r than depend upon others for information. 
Father Rooney then mentioned a characteristic of society, that people·do not make any judgment, whether right or wrong. This type of impotence in decision­making seemed to stem from a confusion of values. 


Computer Recital? 
By Ray Foecy 
DemonStrating ·.every form of 

musical expression from the. · piercing tones of a high-pitched . flute to the moaning booms of a 
Babylonian gong, composerVlad­imir Ussachevsky intrigued an overflow audience at the Library. Auditorium last Tuesday with his 
.display of "electronic music." According to Mr. Ussachevsky, · 
the age of computers and tape recording has done much to widen the range of techniques available to composers. By experimenting 
today' s composer is able to pro­duce sounds unheard of-in fact, never heard -only a few years ago. 

Ussachevsky fascinated the au­dience with many recordings he ·· . had made of artiSts employing these new techniques. Some of the ·recordings had ~en ·con­structed -with the help of an actual computer, one somewhat 
similar to Notre Dame's ll07. By running the "music" through the computer in the same way that player piano programs are fed, some of the wierdest mu­
sical combinations can be real-· ized. 
One of the. rriore' interesting creations featUred a young fe-· male voice sensUously mouthing lines from Finnegan's Wake to a background ofelectronically pro­duced chimes, screeches and eerie whistles. 
Constant "blips," similar to those heard on a radar receiv-~ 
_--:-.:::..-_t:.with these'new andvariedmeanS,''1ngurut;'furmed-then1a"in'iheme_,_ 
of another rendition, this one 
suggesting the vastness of outer 
space. 
Ussachevsky augrriented his 
presentation with slides showing 
some of the equipment used in 
creating these ·sounds, expla~­
ing that "tomorrow's orchestra 
may be just one piece, the com­
puting complex, andtomorrow's 
might have to have a· degree in 
computing science.''
