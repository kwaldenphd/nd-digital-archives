by Bock McFadden · Question: Where cannot a priest be just a priest? Answer: At Notre Dame. The· case in point is the situation within our halls on campus, . That · situation is presently a sham. The . · system purports to be one of a priest-rector, a chaplain and sev­eral priest-prefects in each hall who are in close, meaningful con­tact with the students residing iri each hall, . · b th i mi 
0 viously, · at s a srepres•
entation of the actual situation. In 
fact, in the vast majority of cases,_. . such meaningful priest and student contact does not exist within our halls, for tpe simple reason that 
our hall personnel are part-time · to maintain a minimum of seven­personnel; · they are not even teen priests as full-time hall per­PRIMARILY hallpersonnel. _With sonnel, .then just who is kidding few exceptions, the roleofteacher, whom? . . · administrator or businessman.
