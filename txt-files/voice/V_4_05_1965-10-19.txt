But South·Bend had yet to quiet down~ · Paul Parashak, who had earlier accomoaniedhis roommate . Jim Perkins to the WSND studio for an interview, decided to go , back to. his .apartment on Angela 'about 1:00 a.m. As hewas walking· past. the cemetery, a colored boy 
·jumped. out ·of the bushes and slugged him••Parashak was able to contain the. one boy, but then another Negro jurnped him. from behind. Flashing a short knife, the colored·youth slashed Paul's books .as he tried to defend him­self. In the fight that followed; the .second fellow was wounded in the shoulder with his owff knife. Taking this chance to escape, Paul managed to. run back. to campus, · where he reported the incident to Fr. Simons. · 
There were no other knifings reported, . 
Frs. · Simons and McCarragher met around 10 a.m. Monday and decided · ·to let the student body· 
bandle · the situation thru its · "until it is no longer necessary.'' · representatives•. They then con-. .· Armed •with this statement, ferred with Minch. Lewis, Barry,. Minch Lewis spoke to a gathering 
McNamara, Jay Cooper,.and Pete· ··carey in an. attempt to determine just what action ·should be taken. As a result of . this meeting Lewis, McNamara, andCoopei-'met with South Bend Mayor Lloyd Allen and Police Chief Irvin Hampton. The Notre Dame contingent had . . two proposals: toincreasellghting­~ alonrrNotre Dame Avenue and to 
· · begin patrolling of the avenue by South. Bend ··pollcement. Mayor Allen would agree to neither ofthe proposals. · 
· : He instead offered to launch a full-scale investigation as to the causes of the incidents in order· to determine what can be• done to prevent them in the future. How­

·ever, he refused to· grant· any immediate protection to ND stu­dents. 
of around 350 students in front of' ·. the Biologybuildingatfouro'clock. 
In.a sensibly written, well-pre­sented speech Lewis outlined the situation,i:o the student body, em-:-· 

. phasizing ·the· fact that • protection · . · had. • been provided and that a . · solution, of the problem , -·was fo_reseeable; :' .c<;; .·· ...... , : ,,. .

. Avenue at Angela~ However, feel-Ing . that they had 'been double­· crossed ·· .by publicity seeking students, the two lawmen pro­. ceeded to drive. sirens wailing, 
right UP to the circle. 
As a result ~f .this negative attitude on thepartofcityofficials, · student body representatives fear­ed adverse student reaction and thus took ·.steps• ·to prevent a 
· possible riot. Minch Lewis called a two o'clock meeting of about 75 upperclassmen in. the Fieldhouse. There he outlined his plans to placate the student body and divert 
· any tendencies to riotintoapeace­ful demonstration. He ·called for . order at .all costs and asked this 
· ·"control" group to infiltrate the crowd in frontoftheBiologyBuild­ing in an attempt to keep tensions . down. 
Between 2 and 4 p.m. the St, Joseph County Sheriff, William Locks, met with student leaders in an effort to gain some protec­tion for Notre Dame students. He promised one patrol car. and· one unmarked car for patrol.of Notre Dame Avenue this next Friday and Saturday evening from dark till 2 a.m. He also stated that his men would patrol ND Avenue 

in experimental;. developmental, social,. and abnormal psychology, · as well; as .more courses in ·stat­istics within the near future. The ultimate ·a1m is the establishment of a doctorai program within five 
or six years. · --· 
.In addition to the establishment of an enlarged course program, Drs. Santos and Farrow hope to develop an extensive researchdiv­ision. This will necessitate en­
, larging the staff. IBtimately Dr. Santos hopes to see the emphasis placed on research. In its initial stages th~· research program wm concentrate on.the exploration of perceptual . cognotive processes, the area in which the two doctors 
. have been working. . Currently the lab.facilities are .·more than adequate with ten ex­perimental,and calculation rooms, but the department is in the pro­cess of ordering new equipment.

The following is the resultof1n.: could ever develop-here. AnCI. we tervfews with seven juniors who .· l<new each other so well itwasim­
were ·in Innsbruck last year. The views expressed are those. of the individuals and do not necessarily reflect the opinion of others who were at Innsbruck: · Question: Areyou satisfied with 
· your year at Innsbruck? . . Jim .Carmody: UnquestionablyI Some of us had reservations ·be­forehand, but now I'm certainly 
. s}ad I went. Question: What are some of the things you gained from the year? Tom McMahon: We had the ad­vantages. of living In another cul­·rure and seeing America from the 
·possible to be superficial with each 
other.· 
· Bill Ragen: ·I'd say that ·the 
friendship we had was worthwhat­
ever we sacrificed of learning the 
culture. 
Question: Do you find the stu­
dent .body here interested In your 
ruq>erlences?· · . 
Jim Carmody: Nol The ques-. 
dons .rm asked are so superficial 
it isn't funny. The first question 
is "How were the girls?" or "Did 
you ha1e a'good time?". It rarely 
gets deeper than that, 
Question: 'What do you think of 
the infamous "maid" -rumor that 

. outside. Also, I think we matured ··started on campus last year? · 
during th~ year, because we lived · so independently. Fr. Engleton was'.liberal with us, and we acted maturely in accordance with . the freedom we had. · 
Question:· How difficult was your year academically? 
.B111 Ragen: As for school­work, I thought it was a little less hard than. the average freshman year here. . 
Question: How. do you rate the education you received? John· Baumgartner: rm very satisfied with the education I got, although most of it came outside 
the ·classroom, .For example, r 
. think we gained more from our travels· and contacts with. differ­ent cultures than we could pos-· sibly have. gotten from a class­rOOm. '· 
Question: How .good was your German? 1 Tom McMahon: . We were able 
•to go into. Innsbruck and speak with the average Austrian, be fairly relaxed,. and saywhat we wanted to. 
Andre Papantonio: · Our German was .good, but it could have beeri 
· better. ·' ·Question: Why? Tom McMahon:· Most of thetime in. the· Pension we spoke English • .·We should have· spoken only Ger­man -nofhalf and half. We would , . have learned even more about Austria if we had lived with Aus­trian families. . 
of your living together in the Pen­
·, sionr ... ·, Mike Crowe: We had the kind of. thing they' re trying to get here . with .the siay.:.ha11 system, and I thought. it was a b1g ,advantage • . Steve Hermes: 'What wehadwas
