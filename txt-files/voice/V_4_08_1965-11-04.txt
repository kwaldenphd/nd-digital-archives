by Terry Mahoney 
· The odds were small ratherthari great last Saturday in the Stadium as the mighty Irish_. subdued a. somewhat medi~re Navy team. In· the first half, Notre Dame flirted. 
.unsuccessfully ·with· the forward pass, eriabling the Navy to sail to· a temporary three"pointadvantage· · by rrieans of a 29-yard Chris Hoch placement. The Middles executed 
· · a balanced. attack as they checked the Irish for the greater part ofSO minutes. However, not to be denied 
a storybook finish, the always . fighting Irishdelightedthepartisan crowd of.59,206.as Nick Eddy took A screen pass'from-BlltZfoch and. 
raced 55 yards for a touchdown be: . 
hind the final block of Bill Wolski. 
Notre Dame Jeft the gridiron at 
intermission with a four-point ad­
vantage. , 
..The third stanza of this· 39th meeting between ND and the Navy · began rather eventfully. Ara Par-. seghian decided to abandon the air 
waves and, with anhistoricallyun-· 
precedented plan, conclude!! that 
an infantry assault would soundly 
defeat .the Navy. Regar_dlessofthe 
paradox, theirishlaunchedafierce 

touchdowns during the pedod on ; one yard plunges by Larry Con~ 
jar and Bill Zloch, and a scintil­lating 64-yard punt return by Nick Rassas. · · 
Notre Dame ·achieved its·29th victory over the Navy in 39 games and its first victory in· Notre Dame· Stadium versus the Middles since 1959, Final statistics showed 

. a surprising balance in. the Irish assault, totaling 151 yards rushing and ·154 yards through the air. This balanced attack was led by a talented backfield of four. new horsemen· -Zloch, Eddy, Wolski, and Conjar.

· The presence of Paul th~ Pope seemed t'o embodythe words of Paul the Saint. There was something special in the air that bright, wind-swept day in 
... New York, a feeling that coursed through the waiting throngs. It was expressed by a . short, elderly man too far back in the crowds to see· the · 
Pope. "You don't have to sec himOYou can feel
that he is here.'' . · · · That special mood has been captured by the· Editors of Time-Life Books in an extraordinary
book; Here is a permanent and fascinating record of the man; his pilgrimage; and the meaning of his mission for peace. 
• 96 pages of illuminating text and vivid photo­grnphs (66 pages in color), both intimate· and 
· sweeping, bring you all the pomp, pageantry and prayer that marked Paul's visit. You'll 'see why the 
Pope has broken with the traditional isolation of' 
his office and ceased to be "the prisoner of. the 
Vatican." This is Paul's third venture forth to 
preach, like Christ, in the marketplace, His earlier.· 
trips to India and Palestine· are also pictured in 
this remarkable volume. 
. Among the other elements: a chronicle. of the 
Papacy, a biography of Paul, a reminiscence of 
the role played by his illustrious predecessor, John 
XXIII, in the changing Church, and an evaluation: 
of the struggles and riccomplishments of the 
Ecumenical Council. · · · . 

While the. Pope was ·addressing. the UN, guns were still sounding in troubled areas of the world. His dramatic mission was a step towards the silenc­ing of the guns, now and forever. The Pope's-Visit 
.. -and its inspiring message-belong in your home.
