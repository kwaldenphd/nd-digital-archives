Letter From The: ·Editor 
The following letter is being sent . ·. to thP editor of the Chicago Sun Times in answer to the story which . ~ppeared there Sunday. 
Editor: · · · 
Your article Sunday on academic irregu•arities at Notre Dame was a complete. distortion .and I'!lis­representation . of my. views •. As editor of the student-newspaper,
The. Voice, I mu.st dissociate my­. ·self from m.any of the remarks_ attributed to me -in the article. 
1. Anyone reading the article can­
not fail to notice the obvious lack 
of. connection of the headlirie and. 
lead sentence . with the ·rest of · the story. I simply did not.claim that athletes. are involved in a. 
~heating· scandal at. Notre Dame. 
What. I did say. 1s· that. my in­
. vestigatlons .'have unco','.ered the 
·
existence of cases· of academic h·1 · 
· irregularities· involvin~ at etes. · 
· · 
2. I did not state that athlet~~ . dom of student journalism-as Fr. 
help other athletes to cheat. \\'hat 'Tdid say. was that I have a report from a faculty member.indicating this . to .be. ·the .case. I do not know how widespread this prac-. 
tice is.. · . 
3. The none.:.roo-subtle lnsinu­ations of the phrase ."he cannot reveal his sources" -i.e., that I have manufactured the evidence­
. ignores the obvious. Evidence was gathered from students· and fac-'­. ulty alike on the condition that 
names and .sources be withheld to prevent .unnecessary and fruit­less character assassinatiori. Toe occurrence of the . cases; and 
not the· parties involved, is what · is sinnificant. _ . . · 4-. The..,. statement·. "a coach exer­
ted pr"ssure to allo.w_ football play­
_ ~ 
ers · to help one another on exam­· · 
inatlons" is, absurd and a figment· . I ·question whether this excellence 
of reporter's · apparently. lurid imagination. I made no such state­ment. · . . _. · · 
5. I did .not then and do not now fear iecrlmimitlons~ The·.admin­istration of the University of Notre 
. -Dame may .c.halleng· e my positio.n: but. their recognition of the free-
Walsh admits-would prevent their. silencing· me•. Furthermore, the . students-of the University are not inclined to settle disputes with 
6. The comment on Coaches De,;. Cicco and · · Parseghian deserves · further elaboration. I have the ut.;. . most respect for these.two gentle­men, and for the integrity of their··. 
.motives. I do believe, however, that 
, ·d · · h bl h' h
