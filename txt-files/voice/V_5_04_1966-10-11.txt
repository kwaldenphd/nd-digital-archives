Dear Sir: 
At Notre Dame. as at most Universities. the happening kn~wn 
•as ..sohpomore ·slump" seems to be inevitable•.As freshmen we are ushered into the University and ·sheltered by the Fresh­man Year program in a manner reminiscent of an·An state Insur­ance advertisement, After that, sophomore year is a· wilderness and the only map is based on· hearsay and ·a few meager bul: 
letin notes. · • · · -. This year there. is a concerted effort being made by the col­lege _of :Arts and Letters. to redeem the situation, Asst. Dean· ,,actd1ck has. already· .begun _briefing· ·sessions for sophomores on sue~. t~ngs as· major requirements, honors programs, ·and·. counselmg. He has stated that his door is open at·all times. But it .is-obvious that one man's efforts are. not, enough. Two additional programs. are being planned. The first is a compre­hensive Advisor system. Members.of the faculty are being asked to act as advisors for a small (8-10) group of students. As soon as.the system becomes operative, hopefully sometime in Novem­ber, the advisor will invite those students assigned to him to a _get-together of some ·sort. Thereafter;, there will be group meet­.ings_ and indivi?ual me_etings. Through this structure the Collegehopes to provide the student with a closer contact with the College and its activities, to challenge the student to evaluate ·him self and the meafi;lng of his, own education, to. pinpoint any problems a .studen~ might have and· help him solve them. If this advisor sy'stem· works, it will serve to replace the cumbersome 
Sophomore Interview. . . · ~he se~ond of the.two programs involves a five-week period · d?nng 'Yh1ch there will be a series of guest lecturers; group d1scuss1ons, and speakers froin different professions. The en­tire :couplex ·wm be _united, as· Father Sheedy, Dean of Arts and Letters says, by· tlie themes '.''Comittment,-involvement, life­relatedness." The program ·will be· reserved for sophomores on­
ly,": and is designed to make them think serlously about their actions. It is hoped' that there. will emerge from all the words a ·p!c~re: of .reality;-a picture in: which. the individual can r1=cog­
mze·himself and his direction; . · .. · , · · : · All this sounds·very nice on paper; .but the harsh fact is. that it cannot_ possi_bl_e :wor~ un_less the ·sophomores· themselves emerge from. an apattietic attitude which seems to be traditional, ang. do something.:It is· within each man's capability to believe · that this: tliirig i_s for th·e other guy, the intellec~µtu, Nothing is farther from the· truth•. The other. guy isn'tlivingyourlife, make your. decisions.:· What you _do with yourself is your personal .choice, but :unless -you make -an effort to choose intelligently on·the basis of fa.cts and-.knowledge instead'of on popular mis­

. conception :rimior~ then you forfeit your right to choose, because 
you ·have ·ignored your rational nature. ·.· · · The faculty are willing -the success of this program no_w depends upon. the Sophomores.

.This student body has almost lackadaisically tolerated the in· creasing inefficiency of the South · 
. Dining Hall in the hope that indivi­dual complaints and suggestions would )1ave been sufficient to attain 
· reform.· All such attempts have quite obviously been abortive and consequently a movement has been initiated to emphasize our dis­tress. We call for a serious con­sideration of the following grie­vances: · · 
. 1) Most definitely -an extension of the meal hours to alleviate (and. · hopefully· abolish) the long lines. 
2) A STUDENT· referendum on the, continuation of the 'coat and tie rule'., . 
. : ·3) We are notqualified to suggest 
:· a change in· the food goods, but it is strongly felt that a more pro­fessional approach could be taken in the preparation and variety of meals. . 
We further place ourselves· at 
· your convenience ifyou should wish to, discuss these suggestions with us since the present situation is clearly intolerable and can no long­
. er be ignored•. . Richard L. Storatz, 233 Sorin •.
