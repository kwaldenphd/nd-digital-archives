ND And The. So~th. Bend _Community 
· Part 111 . • ·. . 
In the first .two parts of this series we took a quick· 1ook at· the problems that sur­round Notre oame-~South Bend relations. 
. we especially looked at problems in south 
. Bend: the problems with poor and unedu­catl!d youth. the situation-with Negro min­ority groups; · and . the problems among groups . of migrant .workers or ex-migrant workers. We look now at the response from Notre Dame. we are doing this for. two reasons. In the first place, because the re• sponses will_ help to define the • problems more·clearly. In the second place, because these .·programs forin excellent guidelines for-a further involvement, . · To deal with the community of migrants in the area, the Centro Cristiano de la 
· comunidad was set up at 2910 western , Avenue. It is ·administered with . a grant from the Office of .Economic Opportunity. The center conducts a general program for 
·· · migrants . from ··. education and . leadership . training to recreatio_n. PAC (P!ogram for Advancement ·of capablliUes) _1s part of ·the center's work. in· the PAC eleven law students from .ND are assisting in the training of natural leaders from the com­munity of migrants throughout . Indiana. Undergraduate .students •from Notre Dame and st. Mary's have also worked in Centro doing . everything from tutoring to giving parties for the-children. Arnold Sullivan, director of Centro, says that some student , assistance.is.coming this y~a.z-from Cll.:A and from NSHP (Neighborhood Study Help · Program) but Centro could use many more : . students -to help Spanisl\•speaking .adults learn better English, to organize youth pro­·. grams to teach and to organize recreational. ·· programs~ · · · · . · · . A new program that is cmTently awaiting . approval of the office of Econo~ic oppor­to-the people tJiere whose very situation

tunity. is ·the proposed ·N efghborhool • Law Office. The NLO would be staffed by stu.;, · dents from ·the law· school and, according to Dr. Conrad Kellenberg, it would offer a full rang~ of legal service-legal advice on housing, credit, social welfare; free legaladvice to "poverty groups" like the Centro; plus preventive legal education for people· in the community. The first Office-would be_ located in the West Washington Street area. · The Peter Claver House on west Jeffer­son st. is a small community center with an . educational program and several youth pro­
. grams. Like the Migrant Center, the Peter Claver House also needs college students to implementits programs•. 
The Neighborhood study Help Program moves into its third year with over 600 tutors and a probable budget :of $100,000. · The tutors try to reach· the culturally 'de­prived · child ·who bas grown up fo an en­vironment that neither knows nor respects · 
1 · education. Unless his motivation to seek . tile education· open·. to him is restored he · will· ·become another ·of the jobless Md hopless, perhaps forever beyond lasting
assistance. · · · .· · · 
'·In addition to these· rather well-known programs·there are many other smaller ones · very much. in .need of workers •. Sr. Celine, Ii grad student at N.n.;has received a small gmnt to open· a neighborhood study ·center which would be staffed by · students. A group of students from Farley and Pangborn have been working in the st. Augustine Par­ish community center organizing youth pro­grams~ Under the auspices of Student Gov­ernment a new youth tenter will soon be. opened in soutJi . Bend~ There are other smaller projects like these, almost all in need of student workers. 
student involvement in south Bend is the · answer that should be given by Chri!'ltians 
Pait of the job of meeting the needs in 
. south Bend rests •on the faculty. As per­manent residents of the South Bend commu­nity illey are in .a better position to provide leadership. in ·meeting its problems.·. Many of. thein have. students should be concerned especially with education, They are in the position of being able to develop more ef" · fective educational techniques to . help those · less ·fortunate in their community, Forthennore~ education itself has much to · gain from involvement in real human situa­tions. A university which attempts to edu­cate leaders for a modem world can't remain· 
isolated from· it. . · · . 
This is the last of this series. There now seems little question of the ~agnitude ·of the need for students willing to give ,them­selves to people in South Bend whose prob• lems are representative· of the major prob­lems of modern society. students have a propensity for analyzing and ·protesting the conditions· of modern society•. They also have the chance to do something about-it. 
asks for assistance. The response that has been given so far is one that. is largely · · founded on the insight of our time, that the · layman does have a role to play in the work 
· .of the Church, and that this role inv'olve·s renewing the political, economic; •educa­tional. and social institutions in which we live. The.students at Notre name have come · to be . knoMI. in South Bend primarily be­
..cause ·they recreate there. This has been the .dominant relationship of ND students to the community and is therefore the domi­nant means by which impressions· are gained. Fortunately· this is changing and it . will continue to change if Notre name stu­dents are willing to change it.

by Dan Ferguson ·0ne sign that hockey is · finally making it at Notre Dame WAS its recent change from club to minor sport status accompanied by par­tial sub"1dat1on from the athletic department. · For two years the Hockey Club struggled with inadequate fac­.ilities, a sceptical administration, ·and scarce personel that tumed injuries into plagues: · The first real ·break came in 1963 when an enterprising en• tI.ineer, Bob Cherrus, charmed the South Bend Park Board Into .an ·agreement in which club members performed rink guard duties in ex­change for use of the artlflclal rink for practice.
