house canaries.) Let us today look into the causes of infe~ riority feelings and their possible cures. . . Psychologistsdivide inferiority feelings into three princi-·. pal categories; · _ , · 
1. Physical inferiority. 
•2. Mental inferiority. 
3. Financial inferiority. . _ . (A few say there is also a fourth category: ichthyological inferiority-a feeling that other people have prettier fish­·_ but I believe this is common only along the coasts and in the Great Lakes area.) · · · · 
Let us startwith the feeling of. physical -inferiority, per-· haps the easiest to understand. Naturally-we are im;Iined · ­to feel inferior to the brawny football captain or the beauti-· · 
· : ful homecoming queen. But we should not. Look at all the people, neither brawny nor beautiful, who have made their· rriarks in the world; Look at Napoleon. Look at Socrates. · Look at Caesar. Look at Lassie. . · ·. . . -·-. ·_ ' 
What I mean is you can't always tell what's inside a : package by looking at the outside .. (Sometimes, of course, . you can. Take Personna Stainless Steel Blades,for exam­ple. Just'one gla11ce..atthat joHy blue andwhite package.::,-___ so bright and.pert, so neat but not gaudy-and you knolv it ·. has to contain blades of absolute perfec;tion. And you are ·

right! Personn~ gives you so many sha~es per blade ittakes a math major to count them. And they are luxury'shaves­. smoother,. comfortabler, ki_nder .to the kisser. Moreover Personna comes both in_ Double Edge and Injector style'. And as if this weren't enough, Personna is now offering.you 
_ a chance to grab a fistful of $100 bills from a $100,000 bowl! The. Personna Stainless Stee!'Sweepstakes is off and run­ning, and you're :~II eligible to enter. Visit your friendly ·. · 
_ Personna ~ealer today to: get d~tai~s arid an eritry blank.) ­
-•_ , Bu~I digress. Let us turn now to the second category­. · .mental inferiority. A lot of people think they. are dumber · . than other people. This is not so. It must be remembered that there are different'kinds ofintelligence. Take for in­
. stance, the classic case of the Sigafoos brothers Cla~de and · Sturbridge, students at a .p_rominent Wester~ university ·· (.Qartmouth); It was always assumed that Claude was the 
· more iritehigentjust_ beqause he knew·more than Sturbridge:.· a_bout the arts; the sciences, the social sciences, the huinank . t!es;andJike:~hat, :Sturbi:idge, cin· the other hand, was ten t~mes smarter than :Claude wheri it came to tying graim'y
