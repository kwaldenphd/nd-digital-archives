. On'. Saturday afternoon, · the longest continuing intersectlonal rivalry in college football will be renewed as the fourth. ranked Fighting Irish meet the .Midship.;, men from Navy for the thirty-ninth time. In the past, this most tra,;. · ditional of . pigskin · rivalries has been constantly characterized by competitive gridiron contests, · w~ich ·show the Irish holding a 
distinct edge in the series. 
Navy's somewhat explosive off­ense can best be described as a multiple formation type unit, 



lri h 
having employed a total of 25 dift· . erent formations In the previous ·four games. Led by quarterbacks 
Bruce Bickel and_JohnCartwright, the Sailor attack has been equally balanced betWeen the ground game and the passing game, amassing 870 yards rushing while gaining 940 yards through the air. 
. Cartwright ls the leader in the 

· passing department with 38 com-· pletions .. in· 79 anempts for.· 487 yards and three touchdowns, while Bruce Bickel has completed 34 of 63 tosses for 444 yards and four touchdowns. . 

e 

However, Bickel wm probably be awarded the starting nod from Elias · on Saturday as the more versatile signal-caller of the two. The prime target of Bickel's · aerials will likely be Senior left end Phil Norton, a rangy 195 pound receiver who has caught 20 passes for 236 yards., Scatback Calvin Huey is another of Bickel's favorite targets, owning 13 recep• tions for 173 yards so far this season. Navy•s aerial assault· operates from a pro-type forma-. tion, with an end sp11t to the port side and a halfback flanked on the starboard. · 

id 

The infantry attack ·forms the other half of the balanced Mid­shipman offense. The leading rusher is Senior fullback AlRood-· house, with261 yardsin64carries. · Once again, however, Danny Wong (153 yards in 30 carries) is ex­pected to start at fullback, having· captured the starting assignment from Roodhouse in recent weeks. Tom Leiser andTerryMurraywill alternate at left halfback while Steve Shrawder and Calvin Huey will share the right side. Coach Elias will employ the platoon sys­tem in·the Navy backfield due to the wealµi of talent and depth
