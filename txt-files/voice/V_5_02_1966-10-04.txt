The film ·MORGAN, which is showing at the Avon Theatre this week, is a tremendously entertain­ing film. It consists of a ·series of funny lines, vlsual tricks, and ex­cellent mime by the lead David 
warner,. 
Morgan · has a preoccupation with Communism and its symbols, phrases, and heroes. This he pre• sumablv picked up from his par­ents, However Morgan's primary obsession is with animals, He says that he would have been happy If he hid been conceived in the womb of an ape. Initially it appears that his imitation of animals and his viewing of people as different ani­mals (through cuts similar to BILLY LIAR) is just an expression of his eccentric humor. But as the film develops ii becomes evident that Morgan can· face his wife's · divorce and re-engagement only by responding as a dL1mb ammal. 
'I11e link between his obsession with Marxism and his schizoph­renic flight into an animal world is reve·aled when he accompanies his moth~r to Marx's grave, Morgan backs away from the · gravestone and stares intensely at it. There are cuts back and forth between prolonged shots of a close up Marx's round face and a full length view of the studious Morgan. Thus the director cinematically achieves a communion of the two. Suddenly Morgan begins to beat his chest slowly in King Kong fashion 
· then with increasingly furious action he emits a· 1oud yell. A synthesis of Morgan's personality has been achieved soon after this 
·· his decision to kidnap his wife is. made. It• .is this synthesis that holds the sustance of Morgan's personalitv.
The motifs of. a political philo­sophy and the animal worldcom.; bine in the form of · a Platonic analogy. If Morgan's mind is examined. in view of the analogy between man and the state, we find the expression ot Morgan's tragedy. The analogy compares man's intellect ·to the ruler, and man's body .to.the citizens. 
Morgan wishes to throw out · his intellectual processes and be­

Generally speaking, no one was too happy. Terry Hanratty was dis~ rurbed with himself for "playing like a sophomore.'' Johnny Ray wore a frown because bis budding reserves· had given up th_e shutout that the first unit had so forcefully preserved with three plays within their own 5-yard line. The people who had the ••good seats" on the 'fifty behind the Notre Dame bench were upset·because no one on the sidelines would kneel down and let them see. Alex Agase, the Wildcat coach, didn't like

So were most of the people who had seen the game. It was that kind of day. They had seen just what everyone said it would be.

Waiting for it to happen, though; became too arduous and, if it's possible; a game in which six touchdowns were scored became boring, -.. . " · · · 
For a large part of the game it looked like the Notre Dame offense was bored, too. Though spirited as always, it seemed to lack the usual drive and purposefulness. In between it flashed enough excellence in execution to score 4 touchdowns and reassure most. . 
For Johnny Ray it was-particularly a day of mixed emotions, While he spent most of. the game struggling with a set of radio phones that
