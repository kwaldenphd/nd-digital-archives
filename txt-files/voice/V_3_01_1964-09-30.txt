the fund to get around• so ~hat mor,e people can 1:1.~e it. . . The fund. started with a $35,000 . gift from the estate ofJohnMor­

. The only requirements. for a· 
· borrower are that he be a stu­dent of Notre Dame and have no ' loan outstanding from the. fund. Loans are for a mortth; the usual maximum amount is $100 and the only expense is a 1% s~rvice cha­rge. . ·: 
.. .Dwyer is quite proud of the 
_ ftind. "This loan fund is unique. Most colleges have. student loaris toward ·tuition,'' :he explained, "but none for personal uses." · 
.. Because of this. he does a boom­ing business' just before big ~o­

·: · Last year he loaned $59,000 
to 1281 people; ·this was almost ·,three times the volume in the_•· .first year of the fund, and over -twice as much as four years ago. ·And Dwyer expects business to
