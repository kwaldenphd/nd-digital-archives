The Honor Code 
Changes in the attitudes of the administrationand the students should be important for the Honor Code as it enters its second year. A new awareness of problems and an interest in the students seems to be prevading the administration. Old .ideas are being re­thought and rejected where inadequate; ·the tradition of strong discipline and regulations no longer seems valid. 
A major chang~ also .seems ·evident in the attitude of many students. Student leadership is more purposeful and dedicated, than . before, and there is a,growing sense of responsibility among the student body. There is a feeling that many of the long-sought i_deals may .be effected this .year. · 
The Honor C~mncil is aware of these new attitudes. The coun-· ell· had Jo rely on a practical appeal in 'the past, pointing out the long-range benefits of acceptance of the code,· the personal advan~ages that the code could bring. But now these benefits are being realized, if indirectly, in plans· for a student ·hoard and the revised curfews ..The warnings and penaiities, the safeguard and :the ·fear elements of the code, once had to be emphasized: But with relaxed discipline and a growing sdudcnt maturity, the coun­cil_ can talk ·about the ideal of honor and personal intergrity. . A community of honor and an elect.lie atmosphere of honor were. the ideals of the many students who worked thr<:mgh five years to make the code a reality. Maybe this year, Notre Dame is ready to take a step toward these ideals. · 
Bar .Bits·. I 
-by Buck McFadden 
The past few weeks have seen-' quite a bit of attention and com­ment directed toward the social behavior of the Notre Dame stu­dent. The consensus of that com­ment is that the behavior all too frequently leaves something.to be desired. 

· We should not be concerned with · whom to blame for the situation: surely last week•s column demon~ strated the futility of attempting ·to assign blame for the problem.­Rather, we-should be concerned with what we can do to alleviate . 
the problem:' and, unfortunately, there is an element of futility in­volved here, also •. _ . -. · , · . The obviotisanswertotbebehav­ior problem ls to create within our community a,contlnous, pervasive annosphere of gentlemanly·social conduct •. However, upon attemptingthis one encounters the substantial 
1>roblem · of the lack of adequate social facilities' through which to effect· that atmosphere. The local bars are unconcerned about serving as vehicles for the pro"'. motion of gentlemanly behavior and perhaps rightly -so; for· it is not 
. 
. 
properly their concern •. An on-... 
campus pub would be a most ef­
fective means of establishing and 
maintaining adult drinking habits, 
but it appears that our Adminis-. 
tratlon.-has 'an ambivalent attitude :toward· establishing one. Bars iri . our halls would-be more effective still and in·an probabilitywouldbe 
the ideal solution; but are obviously · 
beyond ·realization for the present. · 
Despair is not quite called for, though, because class government. in the form of John Buck, Senior · Class President, is workingonthe­situation; John is !n the process of transforming the basement of the ''Flamingo" into a · Senior nightclub. Tiie. club will be operi to Seniors and alumni exclusively, although there is some question as to whether or not Seniors under 21 · will. be included. Personally, I · feel that to exclude those Seniors ' 1lllder 21 would be to frustrate to that . degree 'the maturing. effect inherent ht the club; John assures me that. he is quite serious about expecting mature bahavior. 6n the part of the Seniors, even to the point . of -revoking the membership privileges of those· Seniors who loan their cards and keys to under­classmen~ It would seem to me that the more persons who come into contact with this working· at­titude the more widespread would be the effects of it within our cam­pus community, 
. This nightclub should prove to be a signi(icant, if_limlted, steptoward the alleviation of the pro­blem, and the soon·er it opens the better-:, :There is; by the way,

Dear Editor: 
We arrived inParisontheeight­eenth of August. Having ·spent the better: part of the day roaming and exploring the city, we were off on an overnight train headed through the Arlberg Pass toward the city of Salsburg. · . . 
Professor Eric Bauer of Notre Dame, · a native Austrian, -who headed our study at the N.D. cam­pus, was at the Salsburg Bahnhof · to welcome the group. We were brought by bus to the Klessheim school; so named because of. the summer palace grounds on which the school stands. The buildings we occupied, as did an earlier summer course, belong to the Agricultural School. . 
Gerhard Stiegler, a native Inns.: brucker, who taught Germari at 

· N.D~ last year, was an instructor: ·: 
of the_ language for us again at '. Klessheim. We were divided into 
five groups according ·to · our achievement last year. 

The Austro.;.American. Society, which makes :our study in Austria · possible, arranged . a· folk dance evening, a discussion . between · party leaders from the two groups. · which make up Austria's coalition· government, and a barbeque at a mountain lodge, atwhichthemem­

In soccer, facing St. Louis, who• .. hasJ1eld the national championship · 1n four of the last· five years, ·. the Irish were pushed aside losing·. 10;.o. · . With.the first goal marked ·up 
.one ..minute five seconds Into the 
. game,· goalle Eduardo Simon was faced with an .. almost continuous barrage of.St. Louis shots. 
On the other hand, the St. Louis goalies were given a good show by · their defense, as the. Irish broke · through.only eight tlJI?~S for tries. 

'\~ith Mike Coffey and Ed .Dean : · leading the Irish Harriers qirciugh . the wind . and· rain last ·Friday,

Reiser and Bill Brown form the 
· number one doubles combination. Together they. were National Tn­door Junior Doubles champions in 1962 and 1963, 

The Irish will play an Inter­squad match on .Sunday afternoon . October 17th." · · · with the happy results betng a 
17-0 Irish win. 
It was the Army who threatened first. With quarterback ·Fred Barofsky mixing his passes and running plays effectively the Cad­ets marches steadily into Irish territory. A holding . penalty stopped them momentarily, and on a third down and longyardagepass Nick Rassasstoppedthemforgood. Rassas, who seems tohaveaknack for coming up. with ·the big play, stepped in front of Army end Sam· Champl and intercepted a Barofsky 
· pass,retuming it into Army ter­ritory. This was the fourth in­terceptlon of the year for Rassas. 

From this point It took Irish · quarterback Tom Schoen two tries · to get Notre Dame on the score . board and thi:S he did on a pass . off of a. broken pattern to end Don 
Gmltter. Ken Ivan added the extra point and it looked temporarily as if d1e Irish might be started on a high scoring romp. ·A tough Army 

. defense held on, however, and the teams went into the locker ·rooms at halftime with the 7 -O score standing. The play that really broke the Cadets . back came early in the third-quarter .· when Junior def­ensive end Tom Rhoads batted a 
Curt Cook pass inco the air and grabbed it before it hit theground. This gave Notre Dame possession on the Army 33, and with Bill Zloch, the leader of the·ground at­tack, in the game, the Irish marched directly to paydirt, The touchdown came on a five yard sweep around left end by Nick Eddy.Once again Ivan kicked the extra point and Notre Dame led 14-0 with theCad­
· ets seeming now to be going no­where. 
The third Notre Dame score came after an awesome display of power on the partoffullbackLarry Conjar. Tn a drive originating ·at the Notre Dame 35; Conjar carried the ball 9 out of 11 times to bring the ball all the way down to the Army three.·· From the three, a pitchout to Wolski lostyardageand Ken Ivan was called on to kick his tenth career fieldgoal from 13 yards out. This brought the final talley to 17-0•. 
Once again the defense was out• standing· for Notre .Dame., . The play of Rhoads, Mike Mcgill, Jim Lynch, John Horney, and Tony Carey led the way.· On offense 
. the question of who will be "the" quarterback remained unanswered as both• Schoen and· Zloch played welL It all comes · down to a
