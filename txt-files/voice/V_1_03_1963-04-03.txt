Fifteen years ago, jazz for the first time became an official part of the educational atmosphere of the colleges ·and univer­sities of the United States. Credit' 1:ourscs, .summe~ ~amps, and college jazz festivals have taught ··stu'den"t' musicians to be keenly· aware of the traditions, techq_iques, _and ,new trends in 

.. music today. One· of the most successful of the jazz festivals 
· has· been the Collegiate Jazz Festival· held· at the University 
. 'of Notre Dame. · · ' · · -. · · _­
Last· Friday and Saturday nights, t_wenty-two big bands and combos COJ)lpeted for prizes and prestige. in the fifth annual CJ F in the Field House. Among t~ e collE;ges represented were 

· Michigan State, the University of Florida, Denver University, the Air Force Academy, University of West Virginia, a~d others. Entered from Notre Dame were "the' Lettermen."
' . 
A '.panel of five judges, -c~nsisting of Leonard Feather, Charles Suber, Robert Share, Terry Gibbs, and Manny Albam, judged the groups on a basis of presentation, arrangements, interpretation, dynamics, rhythm,. , bal_ance, ·intonation, and blend. In the first three sessions the panel heard each of the twenty-two groups play once, and then chose six, three '.combos and three big bands,' to _compete for the big prizes in the final session Saturday night. At' this session th·e in­dividual awards wCre also presented. 
In the comb~ field,: nine musicians odess; "The Bob Pozar Trio" was-named Finest Combo and received engagements at the Village Vanguard, New York City, and also the London House in Chicago, _ · _ · 
The Finest Big Band Award went to the_.Denver U_niversity Stage Band. Each member of the band.received a·one year sub­scription to .Down Beat magazine and scholarships to the Na­tional Stage Band .Camp Stan Kenton· Clinics. 
The coveted Finest Jazz Group Award and the accompanying trophy went once again to •~The' Bob 'Pozar Trio.''· This was the second year in a row that. this amazing trio has· won both the Finest_ Combo and Finest Jazz Group Awards. In, addition, the tri_o took Best Soloists Awards, in bass, drum, ancj. piano. 
Others receiving Best Soloist Awards were Osc·ar Brazier on· trumpet and Frank_ Tesinsky, on .trcimbon_1:, _po_!1!,_ oJ0 WrighL Junior College;--and Rein :English of Michigan State Unive'rsity · on 'guitar. Each of these men' received musical instruments· and . scholarships to the Berkley School of l\lusic. · · 
One of the_ best of the big bands. but unable to ~ompete, were "The Melodons" of Notre Dame High School, Niles, Illinois. The band, directed by Rev. George Wiskirchen, C.S.c.,· was 

-making its third appearance at the Festival, and received a . standing ovation from the judges and audience: for its polished performance. 
. Selection_. of the. twenty-two ·groups was based upon· tapes sent to the Festival Committee from colleges throu·ghout the nation. Heading this year's selection committee were Charlie -. Murphy of Alumni,· an_d Dave Paliganoff of Badin. Their work 
· and knowledge, as well as that of their committee, has ·made possible one of the most successful of college jazz festivals to be held _in recent years.

from my personal · position. The question is feeble and· sometimes. desperate: . Why is 
· this? Why is it that married students, who have · a special, perhaps acutefinanciiU situ_ation . to face, are, virtally forced to 
. go elsewhere? And · this is· especially jarring if the transfer · must be made in the last two years of undergraduate .study. 
And while asking questions about the scholarship program, why are scholarship holders compelled to live on campus? Does· living off campus and/or being · married eliminate the possibility of being "an asset ·

"ARTFUL PHILOSOPHERS" 
I ­

Dr. Mclnerny of the Philos­ophy Depa;tment was confronted by six people in the Biolo·gy Auditorium as he stepped up to deliver his text "Artful Philos­ophers" for the Student Faculty Lecture S.eries Sunday_ after­noon. This apatny displayed by the ·student. body has called into serious question the con­tinuance of this series •next year by the Academic. Commis­sion. 
Dr. Mcinerny, nevertheless, proceeded · to carefully .delin­eate in his talk the differen~e between a 'philosophical ·poet,' one who offers a solution _to the moral problems_ of existing·,
, . a poetic philosopher;' one who aims at cognitive .assent of trnth, and the 'artful philos­opher,' one·who is not concern­ed with either the ethical correctne_ss or cognitive recog­nition, but one whose concern

Starting' .with  a  definition of,  

the common ground between the artist and the . philosopher of . each presenting a world view either in the form of a Divine Comedy. or:Summa, he proceeded to exemplify a .philosophical poet by. taking.from Santayana's Three ,Meta.physical Poets as a poet_ wh·o presupposes an. order in -li_fe and asks .what does· 
this mean·; · · · _ : A .poetic· philosopher .is oi{e : \\'hose· chief concern/ on'.·the oth_~r hand, ;is. th_e' ·.language ­w,.h1c_h must h_ave a philosophicar

_  The artful philosopher is one  
,  whos·e concern is quite different

, a :,vorldly point of view. By 
, taking a -vantage point above 
! Chdstianity, Kierkegaard sees
