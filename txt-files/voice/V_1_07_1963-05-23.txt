Summer st_orage, begun last Friday, is, once again offering a storage place for student articles during summer vacation.· 
. There are three standard rates, depending on the size of the item to be stored: $1. 75 for small articles su9h as lamps; $2. 50 for chairs, footlockers, and chests of drawers; and $3. 25 for such large items as ·couches. 
All articles are insurable for amounts up to $50. 00, Last year, $2, 000 was paid out in theft and damage claims.~Accordirig to Bob· Mier, General Manager, "We have 
·, switchedour storage to the fourth floor of thE' Singer Warehouse on Western Ave. If we can, .we ...~!! use better methods of handling, 
. such as lift trucks, -to prevent da­mage.·" . 
He stressed tho importance of proper packing. "Much. of ·the damage that is caused ls due to _poor packing by students, ·such as o;erloadeci chests ofdrawers.· The

Nixon, he said, carried more states, more congressional dis­tricts, and more counties than his opponent, but characteristi~ally lost the big cities and as a result the election. The party therefqre is now working, largely through the efforts of the National Com­mittee, to pull in the labor and 
minority votes that had previously. been ignored or given up as lost. The Committee has spent over $5000, 000 and is starting a large publicitycampaign to this end._ He cited Republican victories in re­cent .elections as an indicallon of growing strength in the cities.

118th Cotnmencem.ent\~~ Honors 1400Students 
Approxim"'.ely 1400 Senior and graduate students will receive degrees in Notre Dames' 118th commencement exercise,· conduct­ed during what will be a very memorable and exciting June· 7~9 weekend. The long and arduous 4-year struggle will end on Sunday, June 9th, and a majority of the members ofthe Class of 1963 will 
, step into the non-academic world "to make their mark;" Addres-. sing the commencement gathering of students, families and faculty will be Lester Pea·rson, Prime Minisl'3r of Canada and former U, N. president. 
The graduation weekend begins on Friday afternoon with Com­missioning ceremonies for the University's ROTC students. Eve­ning entertainment wiU beprov_idedby the Concert Band in the first. oftwoperformances, and also on the agenda is the University The­ater's musical, aptly titled "The Fantasticks." 
Early Saturday morning the Class of'63 will make its final visit to Sacred Heart Church. This visit is to be private, and.will be fol­lowed by a procession to the University Gymnasium for Class Day exercises and the Award of Senior Prizes 1n· the afternoon, an 1open house' is planned for the families _of the _graduates, They are invited to meet faculty members and vi.sit the buildin·gs ;andfacili­ties of the Univcr~ity. Mid-afternoon offer's the Central-Collegiate Conference track meet at Cartier field, and later there is a recep­tion by the University· Administration in the Student Cent.er .. The Notre Dame_ Glee Club, besides the band and theater will provide 
i 

the late su.mmer evening_ CJttertainmenL 'j Sunday is thcday! Beginningthat memorable day, an academ­
ic procession will proceedfrom the Main Building to the Universi­ty Mall where a Solemn Pontifical Mass will be celebrated b:ir· His Eminence Raul Cardinal Silva_ Henriquez of Chile, who will also de­
liver the baccalaureate sermon .and receive an honorary. degree.· During the Mass, the flag presented to Notre Dame on \Vashington's Birthday by the Class,of 1963 will be blessed.and immediately rai­sed above the Main Quad. 
In the afternoon commencement ceremony rr. Hesburgh will· confer the degrees en masse, and.-Lester Pearson will present.his address. This years diplomas will be precented graduates by their• respective colleges in ceremonies following the commencement. 


, Those :receivi~g honorary degrees, besides the Hon. LesL.,1· : 
, . . , • . j Pearson and Cardi?~} Silv_a Henriquez, are Most Rev_. l\fa~k Mc_--: _ . , 
dent of the Stepan Chemical Co. , and 1\-lr. Don McNeill, star of ra­dio's Breakfast Club and father of the ·class Valedictoria~, Robert McNeil!. ' • , · ."-. · · · 
Thus, with such an eventful and momentous day approacning; j 
. !

it is not extremely difficult to explain that present (and somewhat pleasant) occurence which might be called the Seniors' "Days ,of . Wine and Roses.'' But above the celebration there looms the sober..:_. Ing (literally) future, and for the Notre Dame Class of '63 that fu­ture is certain to be asuccessful one. .

Freideldispensed the popular con:. ception that FDR was a radical by pointingoutth~t hehadbeen a mild Wilsonian progressive in the "20's and dispelled the i1otion of Hoover as a do-nothing Presidentby poin­ting out that the roots of the New Deal lie In Iloc.iver's administra.:. tion.

The Voice was begunwith the convictionthat Notre Dame needed an independently-run, if not finan­ced, weekly newspaper. We feel that it now has one, a strikingly inadequate one. But it is the germ of a better newspaper, an institu­tion, with a larger, more skilled staff, published more frequently, of greater size and quality. 
At this point, nextyearisne­cessarily somewhat uncertain. There are, however, some defi­
. nite statements which can be made. The Voice will be published. The staff will be Jarger, production will be more efficient. There will 
important, support will rise nat­urally. 
The group which has begun The Voice is a narrow one, we re­alize, and the hopes for the paper are sometimes, in our minds, somewhat grand.Perhaps the best feature of the hopes is the tenden­cy of the editors to disassociate themselves from those plans.

(inuc with Project Apollo -the effort to fly three men to.th~ moon:/ and back. No one questions what good will come of it. No one· ever openly wonders if the whole attempt is just a huge mi~take. Doubt-,'. ing -Thomases have beensatisfied by steriotyped answers about the· space race and the need for imporvement. But is this sufficient jus..:-..

Undeniably the project -of investigating tlie moon has a grca!·:, romaiiti~' appeal,; s~rneho,;,. ino'on-pion~ers wiU be classed :,;itn'ihe ''. Forty-Niners,· an iti the American heritage, There is no accuratk estimate of the co'st of Project Apollo, as a matter. of fact. But;ttie .,.·,·;.'· project does deserve inspection·-. as _does any proje~t"where cost is·: measured in billions of dollars. Yet the quoted figures,.range .from

. . Eq~ally great strides.can be m<tde'•in chemistry,: metali~rgy;. · engineering, navigation, and guidance .vithout requ1rmg an enor­mously eh-pensive project. And itisentirely feasible that unmanned flights can procure, with electronic devices, all or nearly·an the knowledge that a manned flight will procure at a fraction of the cost. It seems illogical to send aman· pureiy for the sake of adventure. 
Some argue that the manned· trip to the moon and back is "in:--· _.,,.,..._. surance. " Insurance against technological obsolescense and insur­ance against a military surprise from ·space. However, these po­sitions are still highly debatable, and it seems ridiculous .to spend billions of dollars on unsubstantiated assumptions and opinions. .. 
Furthermore, as far as military purposes are concerned; no­thing can be accomplished. The moon is almost a quarter million . miles away. As an observationpost it is not as satisfactory as· a sat-. ellite station. As a rocket or a missile station, it . is hope­lessly inadequate. The idea ofreachh1g the moon, constructing laun­ching platforms, maintainingalaunchforce, and transporting a mis­sile to the moon is far beyond the scope of technology -or national . budget -possible or available. Even the problem of hitting a target • on earth is•awesome. One miscalcu1ation and the ·missile will not · _·_] only miss the target -it could miss the: continent_ it was aimed at: 
There is, of course, the psychological advantage of being the' ll first country to spansuchadistance with men and to land on the lu.: nar surface. The power ofpopularopinioncan never be discounted. J 
_Yet it should not be allowed t~ be the criterion for establishing the jj national budget. Space ventures must be brought into account ·with the economic situation on_ earth and not vice· versa.

If anything, they are used as a rea­son for up-grading our schools. On the subject of space, time plays an important part in reducing effects,_ importance and interest. 
Project Apollo is a daring and romantic concept. The very 
thought of landing men on the surface of the moon is breath-taking. Still, the· important question is not whether men·should be landed on the moon -they should. The important question is when. Could the money be put to better use in another field? What is the sense of ha-. ving that man on the moon, if the nation he left is. struggling for so­

To The Editor 

Editors; 
It is one thing to criticize and.quite ar.other to of:ur personal insult. Wqatever the validity of Mr. Morris' opinions about the recent St. Mary's "Arena '63 11 ·as an artistic achievement, his epit­hets concerning :Jack Pehler -and bis performance·are unpardonable.. 'Mr. Pehler is an experienced and· competent actor,· hardly a !'hani" (the very use of such a fulsome, sloppy word betrays a certain po­verty of critical reflection). 
. I may be.. endowing the criti­ciam_ with an undeserved dlgnity 
l:y protesting sucha gaffe, but su­ch a breach of charity is unexcus­ablo even in amateurs, as are we al~. Better to make the "tedious distinctions, " or to remain silent, if your judgements are to be rea·­pected in the furture. 
: Terry Francke, 141. Cavanaugh 
We are all amateurs,' the critic included, but criticism can-. not make excuses on this basis 
and when itdoes,. it is inconclusive · and pointless. The purpose of cr­iticism is to evaluate, to blame as

r-,.. ally, concerning your experience with Washington Hall_? 
I · A: As far as I can tell at.this point,. Fr. Harvey, the theatre here, and all the people connected with it ha­
. ve bee1i tremendously beneficial. In terms of my own development, · the climaie couldn't have been more favorable. It's been a grand opportunity. I don't know when a­gain I'll be able to play the roles I've had here. 
Q: What role have you most en­joyed doing? · 
A: Edmund, Long Day's Journey. 
Q: Your ·Hamlet received some impre~sive •compliments. What was your reaction to that role? 
A: You know, it's 'incredible, but all I'm able to recall is a haze of work and sweat. Of course, I was physically rightfor the role at this age. Ithink that might have helped to give me some dimension that I didn't really deserve. Anactor who takes it cri at forty or fifty is han­dicapped in a way that I wasn't.

Q: ,Vho are some of the' more promising students who'll be seen· in the theatre here during the next _ few years? 
A: There's Terry Franke, afresh­

Q: I notice that you've mentioned no actresses..• 
A: We've used so few this year. And, you know, since the feminine auditions have been thrown open, agreat many of the actresses are from South Bend. There are a lot of good actresses at St. Mary's, though..•some. 
Q: With whom have you most.en­joyed playing? 
A: Jim ·cooney, Long Day's Jour.:'. ~-JeM Kllne; she played-Celia. in Cocktail Party. And Hank Whit­temore. 
Q: Would you have made the de­cision to continue in the theatre without the .Fulbright? 
A: My decision was made long be­fore I received the scholarship: It might have been disastrous, though if I hadn't received one'. l'minROTC; I'm facing hvo years in the army. Bcy::!!rl that's too dif­ficult. I plan for two years, then take care of the service, I've got no grand pla~. But I'm glad for the chance to get away. Really away. I've had to compromise myself 

-here between my studies and act.:. ing. I suppose I'll always have to. But at least in London I'll be able to concentratQ on the acting, which Ihaven't beeii':able_ to do here. And in Europe a st_ud1nt can afford the theatre, Here one can't.

A  Visitor  from  D bl ¦ U ­1n  
·  ·  

--Prof. Thomas Kilroy 
This semester, about sixty-five students have participated in a course in Anglo-Irish literature which had an added dimension of authenticity. The crisply wa.l'm accent of Asst. Professor Thomas 
F. Kilroyhas a charm of its own. Tbe slight, twenty-eight year old professor is visiting from Stratford -College (Dublin), to which he will return as headmaster after this semester. 
Mr. Kilroy has his M.A. and Higher Degree in Education from the National University ofireland in Dublin. Born in Kilkenny Coun­ty, he came -to Notre Dame partly because he "wanted to spend a year in America, partly for personal reasons. " Mr; Kilroy was married to the former l\liss Patricia Cobey of New York at the end 
of spring vacation. 

Questioned recently on his -impression.s-ofhis-yearrhc seem­ed eager to 1talk, _though he cau­tioned" that liis classroom experi­
·erice here mfght not be-typical. ­
Asked to\ make comparisons of Notre Dame and Irish universi­ties, Mr. Kilroy's ·softly intent manner brightened and he· ran a thin hand through his reddish hair.· 
"Well, the systems at No­tre Dame and University College Dublin are very· different in at­mosphere and methods. U. C. D. is co-ed, non-residential, and non­sectarian, though it is, of course heavily Catholic-orientated. The word 'teacher' is hardly ever used. Theprofessorlectures, usually to very large groups; he gives his o­pinion -professes -and becomes knownfor it. Thus, while there is a certain anonymity for the, stri­dent, the professor is better known as an individual over there. " 
· Speaking ofprocedures to de­grees, Prof. Kilroy said: "Al-: though there are some attendance requirements, one can practically go through -the University without " . "This matter of opinion -­the -lack-of. diversity.-of-views.-,-~ 
· interests me 'a good deal. One of the most surprisingaspects of this campusloaEuropean fs the seem­ing lack of political opinion, in a wide sense. The students' view se­ems so settled; they seem totally and unquestioningly committed. to the Americandream. Tbcre•s·rc­markably little debate, little of the constant evaluation ofself and pri­nciples that's necessary to keep a system a living, organic thing. " 
l\Ir. Kilroy, however, made it clearthat he thought the Ameri­can manner "necessaryto meet the huge challenge of living up to and supporting the well-defined but complex massiveness of U. s: civ-:­ilization. " 
The professor also pointed outsome "truly admirable featur­es" of Notre Dame life over that 
of a European university. ''Tbe .quality of teaching and particu:... larly specialists, available to A­merican students is very high. There is no comparison in physi­
ever going near the le.cture room•.. cal facilities; they are staggering 
Thequality ofyour degree depends here. The fact that almost all of almost totally_ on final exams in 
the books are available .to the stu­
your last two years. "' . I 
dent's personal libraryis remark­This was contrasted _with the able. Finally; I think the research common American practice ofpre­done in this country is far super­sentation of materialwith a test­

labelled "spoon-feeding. " .' · "Parents ge·t ·a guaranteed product at a U.S. university, while they take a greater chance in Eu­rope. " He emphasized the sense of personal responsibility.and inde­pendence in the students. The student body in Ireland, Mr,-Kilroy noted, is likely to of­fer more radical variety than he has .seen here. "There's not such strictresidential ·control the_re, no community atmosphere. Therese-ems far greater diversity in the student body, there, in dress, and opinion. A great part of the matu­ringis done outside the clussroom. Such societies as student debating and literary clubs seem much stronger and more important the­re,· and have a definite and vital educational value. 

............_ 

tant and exciting research pro­. gram." 
. . . Soon to return to Dublin, ..Mr'. Kilroy seemed highly pleased with --the experience. ''Yes, I've enjoyed the year quite a bit, ,and have certainly learned a great de­al; I appreciate the response and · all the help I've gotten from the faculty and my students. Would _I · return?_ Oh yes. I'd bok forward to coming back to America and I 
• 

_hope to be able to,arrange it. Thomas Kilroy is a consid­ering and a cons!derable man, a talented teacher, a sincere schol­ar. \\'hen he returns to this coun­try, it is to be hoped that it will be at Notre Dame. Ile will be wel­
come.

ofthe coming year will be the for-\ mulationofanhonor system, most ' probably limited to the academic realm. The honor system is tenta­tivcly sheduled .for installation in Fall, 1964, for the freshman dass. 
Before this shedule can be met; ·a · · sound and practicable system must be developed. The blunt of this work will' 
fall upon the shoulders of an "hon­
orsystemcommittee"that has re-· 
cently been fornied. Tbe commit­

is hoped that the un-affiliated na­
tureofthecommittee will promote 
a more objective appraisal of the 
honor system. · The_ need for enlarged sfod­ent responsibllty in maintaining 
academic integrity is •acute. The proctor systemhas not only failed to stop cheating, but has created· 
an atmosphere favorable to it. Cheatinghas become something of a "game" played to the disadvant-. age of the faculty and students. 
There ts little doubt that an honorsystemwoulddiminish these evils andmake students more con­scious of their responsibilities. But ifan honor system is to be ef-· 
foctive, it must contain provision for enforcement: students would Iiave to report cheaters to a stud­ent "honor council" if they should refuse to report themselves. Tbe honor system and the "buddy sys­tem" are incompatible. 
It is essential, therefore, that the spirit of honor permeate the student body before any system is inaugurated.

·Thomas Kinsella­The Poetic Risk 
Professor Kilroy .of the No­tre Dame English Department has · calledhis friend, Thomas Kinsel­la, one of the greatest poets of his generation. The Irish p~et is the . only writer ever to receive the a­ward ofthe Poetry Book Society of Great Britain for two successive volumes. Though unfamilier to a 
good many American readers, his 
European reputation is consider­
able.. More importantly, he. is 
youngin the best ways; he posses­
ses what his development will re­
quire. 
Because his May 13 reading 

in the Art Gallery was virtually 
unpublicized, most students were 
denied exposure to Kinselfa, _whose 
appearances in this country will 
not be frequent. That most of the 
seats were filled, however, and 
·1argelybypersons over 35 or stu­
dents of l\Ir. Kilroy, suggests de_­
sign. 
The readingofpoetry cast in 

such palpably rigid forms and who-· 
se matter finds depth to such tight 
precisionas Kinsella's requires a 
very delicate dramatic sense as 
well as understanding. For writers 
like Thomas Kinsella, poetry is a 
substantial risk On the basis of· 
his performance, it ts a risk well 
taken.

t" NEW ERA 
When Joe Kuharich took the reigns of the Irish football team in 1958, he announced that that season would be devoted to rebuild..: ing the Notre Dame football mach­ine which had been sporadically . breaking down in recent years .·_ This past season, Kuharieh's last was also, coincidently, a rebuild­ing year. It was left to Hugh De­ore to collect the pieces and get the machine backin running order. 
Kuharich, a man of many ta­lents, apparently lacked the one which the Irish needed most, an ability to unify the team into a . working unit. In his four years al . '. the head coach post, he saw his team drop 23 games and win only} 7. 
His departure may usher in aneweraatNotreDame. The var­sity's 37-0 rout of the Lamonica led Old-Timers got.Devore off on 
the right foot, if nothing else. I suspect. that Wisconsin will be somewhat stronger on opening day, as will U. C. L. A. , Southern Cal. , Stanford, etc. Time and perform­ance will tell if Devore is equal to the task. 
I didn't plan to write this as an editorial, but what can I, or anyone else, · say about last sea­son's 5-5 record... only the obvi­ous. We opened with an impres­sive goal line stand. Then we ran into. the Big Ten and Notre Dame managed' one TD a game for four Straight weekends. 
After the famine, feast, and The Irish feasted for a month before being "upset" by the nation's top­
-ranked team, 25-0.

_ Outstanding pitching and e­qually tremendous skill at the pla­te usually spell an undefeated sea­son. Notre Damehas been blessed with both this year and has done well, well enough to make plans for the_NCAA championships,' bar­ring a broken leg or an outbreak of malaria in the pitching staff. 
There are several legitimate reasons. why the Irish baseball team is not undefeated, one is La­dy Luck and the other is the Big Ten. Not much can be done about either. 
Notre Dame's baseball team has gone 18-6 so far, but has on­ly won one ofsix from the now tra­ditional Irish nemesis. Jake Kli­ne's nine opened with a 20-3 mas­sacre of_ Indiana, butfrom thcnon its been a downhill slide. Both the Hoosiers and Michigan have beat­en us twic_e and Northwestern has poked the other thorn in the Irish 
side. · No news can be all bad and fortunately Notre Dame piays oth­er teams oµtside· the Big Ten. The pitching staff is the best in years

HOW GREAT 
Remember how bright· ahings looked after semester break and before St. John's? If you follow Notre Dame basketball at all, it's pretty hard to forget. Remember the yea~ before last? Be thankful then for what we've got.. 
· Remember lastJanuary when Notre Dame's basketball team had justcome out of their usually dis­
.astrous Christmas tour alive and boasting a 90-88 victory over pre­viously undefeated Illinios7 Rem­ember how br,ight things looked? After all, we· had just played the toughest part of our shedule, the, rest looked easy 
Notre Dame spent a couple of weeks in the nation's top twenty lastseason, but whenever we look­ed ready to break into the top ten, we ran into a Billy Cunningham, 
M. C. Thompson, or Department o_f Academic Affairs. 
It does no good tc; speculate as to the abrupt shortening of the seasons of Ron Reed and Larry Sheffield and the effects of their loss cin the team. Before they left, we won twelve of sixteen; after their departure, we were five and five, including our 77-72 NCAA defeat at the hands of Bowling j! Green.
