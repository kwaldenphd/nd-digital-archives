The various understand­ings of those favoring pleasure range from Words­worth' s view of it as quiet, charming, graceful, intel­lectual and essential to man; through Keat' s roticism and Byron's "sin" (he is 
"damned for you," the you meaning pleasure); through the radical philosophical materialism -of Bentham and Diderot, to the lit'e-force and "drive" notion of Freud and the power-plea­sure humanism of Nietszche. Given that leasure is some­how both the reader-protect­ing urpose of poetic meter
