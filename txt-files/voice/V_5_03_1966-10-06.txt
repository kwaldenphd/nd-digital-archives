Atheists,. Agnostics Gather· . · CLASS. CORNER 
BY BARNEY HING 
. Atheists, agnostics and religious liberals were invited to gather at Frankie's last Saturday evening to 

· hear Reverend Joseph Schneiders, minister of· the First Unitarian Church of South Bend. Reverend Schneiders, an ex-Roman GathoUc and an ex-television producer, conducted the discussion in an in­formal question and answer style, 
Some ofthemainproblemsposed by the estimated s·eventy-fiveper­sons present were those of moral codes, value Judgements, the Uni:­tarian Church organization, and 
World issues, , ."Morality,". In Rev.Schnelder.s• words, ..is · 'that which society
approves." Good, bad, rinht, and
0•
wrong are terms which for Rev. Schneiders are not vaUd; because he has no specific reference point with which to compare them. He does not· acc~pt any .universal norms, although he admits he can find some validity in an "I-thou" relationship norm. He considers 

anything "evil" which prevents growth in Ufe in another person. In addition. he stated: that "the · Ten Commandments are no longer viable and are therefore obsolete ... . For example, he finds inairpollu­non and the use of napalm: bombs 
both subtle and overt examples of . accepted human genocide•. 

. . Scripture was Important in its tlrne, Rev. Schneiders said, and if 
•demythologized, could possibly be of . some significance to the modern ~n.·. . . . 
· In reply to a ·,question: Rev. ~ Schneiders · stated :that : Situation· · Ethics was the basis of his moral code. He defined Situation Ethics . as a momentary conscience ·on which decisions arebased.A situa-. • 

tion develops :moral·codes·· and ·norms peculiar to that situation. A man, after due corisideration of. the• situation, and the personal·.
meaning, . based on logical and . psychological attitudes, ft has for him; makes a decision and acts

similarly. However, the stand he· · takes must be defendable before .his system of ehtlcs can.be con­sl~red valid. . . • . . . · When asked to define hls philo­
· 

But he could have feelings, though..
inexpressable, about certain things. As an example, he stated that he could experience a loving act, but love did not exist. · 
His concept of God (a god) Rev. Schneiders does not claim to be an .atheist Ipso facto, rather a "non-theist," In his eyes atheism 
· ls a relativistlc label applied by society. For example, if a Catho­llc described his God and Rev. Schneiders dld not accept him, the Catholic would, in reference to . . 
his beliefs, call him an .;theist. · Furthermore, any theistic con­cept whkh would . show our alle­glance to or dependence on a 
· supreme being, he rejects.

the Civil Rights Code? . 
A. It ls a social and psycholo­glcal system which depends upon the effects received and the plea­sure felt when dealing in matters . concerning it, · 
.Q. How do you feel· about Viet Nam? 
A. Get out! We don't belong there. The issue ls not a rational one: it has been solely determined by personal feeling. . 
Q. 1n .the world of ideas, is there anything· which· is more than In-· terestlng to you? . . 
A. Motivations basic to Ideas, , 

However, I feel the basis for them needs more investittatlnn.
