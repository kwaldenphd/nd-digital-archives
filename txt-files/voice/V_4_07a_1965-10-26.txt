On Being Number One A cross section of last week's polls formulated by the men who follow and know the game, the 
· nation's sportswriters, found Southern Cal rated about four notches above 'the Irish. Obj~ctively, this would lead.one to.think s.c. a more powerful group th.an Notre D_ame: · The danger of this sort. of reasoning, was graphically demonstrated Sat­urday. This w~s no freakupser:type of victor')'., .Actually, why shouldn't Notre Dame be number one? They certainly played with the poise and· determination of the best team in the country. Suppose Griese had missed -on ·a pass or fumbled during that fatal final drive. ND would be·un­defeated and undoubtedly at the top of the list•. ND is no wor·se of a football team because Purdue­didn't make this mistake, and yet, no matter how brilliant, the Irishwill be denied the place they're . starting to deserve. The nation'.s numberoneteam remained ~defeated by slipping by that perennial power North Texas State, 55 to 20, ina tough inter­conference battle. ·Nebraska, another team in the running for the No. 1 spot, beat Colorado 38 to 13 in another tough "~ontest."
