Lewis said that the represen­tative duty of Student Government is two-fold. He declared that the Student Government is responsible, first ••for crymalizing the opinion· of the student body," and second; "for formulating basic policydec­

-larations .-. ~· and presenting them 'to the students for their rejection . or .acceptance." He noted that 
tie had met several tirnes with ad­

. ministration' officials _and found them aware· that '.students have· . ·opiniqns. They·are unaware, how­
. ever; of what those opinions might. be; It' is Student Government's·. duty to find _out these opiriions 
·and act ori them. · . , 
-The .formative function of Stu­dent Government Lewis explained as involving "taking the time to do .
reflective thinkingincirdertoraise 
,relevant questions:• But, "The ­students must be left free to answer those questions." . 

Responsibility, Student Govern-· mein, and Community Awareness committees will soon be organized. The Student Responsibility Com­mittee shall be concerned with:· ."the· relation between freedomand­responsibility, with the'role of the student in .determining academic 
·pollcy, and with the _value ofhaving the student set his; own .social.· regulations!' . . .. . .

The Ui1ivel'sity of Notre Dame is orienteJ. towards ··excellence" in everyone of its many endeavors. Rugby is no exception. In -fact, Rugby mighl be hel9 as_ane.\ample. 
in which the drive for •·excellence" has beea most sticcessful. Though the -Rugby team is only four years old, the name Notre Damehasbee11 · forged as one· ofthe mo5t success-· · fu! i11collegiate rugby circles. Tiiis spring the Irish were thought to be among the best--if.not the best-­
'ln the land. ·Last Saturday another chapter of this story was opened · in a characterfstic fashionas Notre

The scoring was limited, and what of it there was, took place in the second period. Early· in that frame. -Teddy Valenti, (playiagwith a bad knee) picked up a loose ball 
· and scooted 40 yards for.a score. Jamie Toohey missed.the conver-·· sion; the Irish led 3 -o.

Northwestern wasn't supposed· to beat the mighty Irish. They didn't•. 
in· fact, at 110 point in the game did a1~yone,excluding Ara who lives . in fear,. ever doubt we would win. This _optimism was.in spite of the -dishearteni11g performance _of-the scoring unit... The.y left us behind wuil three minutes. shy of the closing quarter. Even the three scores that put Ara's men ahead and out of reach were products of an ag­gressive defense. .. , . _ .. · . . · 
· The· defense, which was decidedly .weak against the·B01lermaker onslaught, redeeme·d · itself by forcing· mistakes such. as key fumbles ·and ailinterception that broke the game open. · . . . _ 
The Raymen can't expect to contain the opposition ·with· their sel­fish ground defenses. AU the clubs we face will be filli11g the air­ways, and only strong pressure, such as was appHed in the fourth quarter, will put the. brakes· on. even a mediocre pa,sser. Something; about· our· three veteran pass defenders. inspires confidence in rival· quarterbacks•.Maybe it's their,_record. In the firsuwogarnes;both 
_of which offered many opponunities, this trio .conibh1ed for an unim­
pressive total of two, passes actually broken up. :. But _a strong rush 
McGill and Jeziorski, who are. getting a little wiser every·week, can! 
make our pass defense even stingier than it was against N_orthwestern. 
_offensively, this is the year of the_ third down. Third and four. Wi~h · a leg attack you must be able to come up with these clutch yards.. One missed assignmem, outstanding defensive stop, or any failure to make at· least three .. or four yards per down can bog our offense down and force Mr. McGinn 10· employ his talented· foor; · Our attack was not impressive .because it failed to come up with the e~-plosive big play· when theY needed it. · . . . '. .. 
-Tom Sci1oen came into the game with a gang of his classmates after the game haµ bee1i won. lie didn't !mow it was over. Schoen, with the assistance of Don Gmitter, showed he has the ability to give his coach the big play. He carries himself like a(cockv soph ----: always un­sn.1pping his chinsnap like John Wayne in a heroic war.movie.----:­and isn't a very smoothe ball handler, but added ~o his confidence. he can·•really throw that thing. There's no doubt that's what we need to loosen up those stacked defenses that a re being thrown against us. Messrs, Blier, llarshman. May, and O'Leary certainly showed .that Notre Dame· doesn't have to give up big,time football when\volski· 
and Eddy depart. . . . , _ 
The Northwesteri1 game had some moments ·that were cause for optimism. offensively and· defensively. The M_et's gaudy goat pas:­wi-·e will host a better team than the one that srnmbled on the greasy
