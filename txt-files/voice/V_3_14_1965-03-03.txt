These are just two of many reported instan­ces where the obligation entailed by the Hon­or Code, that of accepting personal responsi­bility for academic honesty, is being felt. And it's examples like these that are en­couraging. Council members, -professors and 
. many students to applaud an initial success for. the new system. 
There were 50 cases.handled by the Council during the first semester. Of this number ap­proximately 32 were self-reported, while the rest were reported by someone else. Four of . the 18 cases reported . by another were dropped for lack· of evidence. 10 students pleaded guilty and failed the course, and the

Unlimited Cuts Possible 
The investigation by the student government committee of· the rules governing class attendance has yielded two recommendations for change: that professors, rath­er than administrators, be re­sponsible for the attendance of their own classes, and that more cuts be . allowed both to· all the students and to. a wider segment at the top of the class. 
First, the professor knows -better than the administrator by the context of his particular class how close· to the rule he must keep (the administrators involved are the first to point' this out). Some· professors have _already · taken this on, and the students have responded well to the per­sonal rather than business like 

i • approach. 
Second, the results of a survey in 1%1 of which Notre Dame was a part show that in general, as a university progresses, its class · attendance rules become .less strict, ,with the assumption that the student can be assumed re­sponsible enough to decide when he can afford to cut and whether ' he can make up the work, and with the. assumption that _the ex-. ercise of'this responsibility will ·· benefit hiin from a strictly aca­demic as well as from a per­

sonal standpoint•.· . . .. The ideas which have ariren here-are: l) the limit af cuts al­lowed in a course would be in­creased from x to· 2X 1, •with X ·, ./o· standing for credit hours, and 2) 
rem.aining four ·went to trial. At the first trial two were found guilty and suspended from school. One• was found not guilty. and the 
case dropped. At the second trial the· student also was found not guilty. 
Of the 32 who reported themselves and put the penalty up to the professor two failed the course, two others failed the work involved and the rest were given D's for the course. 
These statistics cause Council chairman, Lance Drane to feel optimistic, but a touch of worry --mostly.over what can•t be deter­. mined until the Code is in effa ct longer -­

He  cites  several positive instances of ac•

Mardi Gras '65 
By Al Schulte 

· Mardi Gras '65' ran exactly ac­cording to prescription. On;Fri­day evening there was the Mardi Gras I and the Ma~ Gras Il. 
Peter Palmer and his Voices wailed; the Lettermen played good dancing music. There was the Champagne Brunch on Sat­urday morning, a concert.with the Serendipity Singers.and the Oscar Peterson Trio in the afternoon. And in the evening there was the Carnival,

the required average for being absolved of attendance rules would be lowered from 3.25 to 
3.0. ,(A professor's comment here was that the B student in this range at Notre Dame isgenerally very hard-working and conscien­tious -perhaps even more than the . student with· a higher av.: erage,) 

: There are manyunder-the-sur­face problems involved fu this issue, It is imperative that the first part eliminates administra­tive detail rather than transfer-. 
ring it from the administrator to the professor, and thisinvolvesa ,difficult shifting of excused' and cancelled cu'st. A simpler system which would shed some ofthe de­
tails is being sought. 
The · problem with the general

ments seem to indicate. that enough people fee1thatthefresh­men need the enforced discipline so that the rule may have to be tougher for them. The ideal would be to bring them into the wtlver­

There .are still problems, however, one of the most·· important being that the majority of reports come from professors or are due to their urging. Perhaps this indicates a lower stude~t involvement ·than desirable, yet even in saying this, you can't tell how many warn­ings .are being giv~n that go unnoticed, or how many searching ccbull sessions" are go­ing on. 
Based on all the available facts, conclu­sions abo'ut the Code i~dicate that. accept­ance is continually· growing stronger, that the vote for the Code was an indicator of a real support for honor, and not for a looser rein, to allow cheating, .and that the vast majority of campus opinion is beginning to nod yes to the responsibility.

third largest college weekend in 
the nation; but this is in terms 
af its budget, Every year Mardi

(Haven't we seen all of them at Notre Dame yet?) Maybe the Committee is afraid to try some-· 
thing new because of the risk in­volved, but maybe the Committee is right: that the taste around campus is very sensitive to new inversions. But we could at least try. Why are all of our big dances Friday night? Many of the girls are tired from· traveling, they

· .I am fully aware that these sug­gestions may seem ridiculous in terms of the problemswithwhich the Committee must cope, but scheduling on a weekend is es­sential' to success. Maybe Mardi Gras is too big for drastic changes,·.. but . a' little bit of. up tempo never hurt any Irishmaq.

Topic for today is that perennial favorite of English.majors, that ever-popular crowd pleaser, that good sport and great American'-William Shakespeare (or "The Swedish Nightin­gale" as hc'is better known as). 
DEAL...~· 

First let us examine the persistent theory.that Shakespeare ( or "The Pearl of the Pacific" as he is jocularly called) is not the real author of his plays. Advocates of this theory insist the plays are so full of classical allusions and learned refer_enccs that they couldn't possibly have been written by the son of anilliteratc country butcher. . ' 
To which I reply "Faugh!" \Vas not the great Spinoza's father a humble woodcutter? Was not the immortal Isaac Newton's father a simple second baseman? (The elder Newton, incidental­ly, is one of history's truly pathetic figures. He was; by all ac­counts, the greatest second baseman of his time, but baseball, alas, had not yet.been invented. It used to break young Isaac's heart ~o see his father get up every morning, put on uniform, spikes, glove, and c·ap, and stand alertly behind second base, bent forward, eyes narrowed, waiting, waiting; waiting. That's ,. all-waiting. Isaac loyally sat in the bleachers and yelled "Good · · show, Dad!" and stuff like that, but everyone else in town snig­gered derisively, made coarse gestures, and pelted the Newtons with overripe fruit-figs for the elder Newton, apples for the.· younger. Thus, as we all know, the famous_monient came when Isaac Newton, struck in the head with an apple; leapt to his feet,· shouted "Europa!" and announced the third law of motion: "For . every_action there_is an opposite_and equal re11~.tj~n!7:'_ . ____, .. __

Irish Rout ·Creighton 92-7 4; Accept Bid to NCAA Tourney 
The Notre Dame basketball team by virtue oftheir 9l-74 win over Creighton has accepted a bid to the NCAA tournament. Notre Dame's acceptance com­pletes the field of 23 teams for this year's tourna­ment and places the Irish in the Midwest regional with an opening round game against Houston at Lubbock, Texas on Monday. 
The Irish led by Ron Reed' s22 points, Jay Miller's 18 .and Larry Sheffield's 17 took command from the start and never relinquished the lead asthey rolled over the highly regarded Blue Jays from Omaha. . If there was one factor that stood out it was Notre Dame's board strength as they out -rebounded Creighton 87-33. 
This win plus last Saturday'swinconvincing83-67 thrashing of DePaul which had won 17 consecutive games at home, made up for Wednesday's poor showing against New York University at Madison Square Garden. In that game the Irish hit a season low of 54 points in.their six point loss to the Vio­lets. A miserable shooting night' which saw N. D.

The Irish also set four new meet records in the victory, . The first relay, the 400 medley relay, broke the previous record by 12 seconds, The quartet of John Frey, Bob Husson, Tim 
Kristi, and Paul Drunker finish­ed in 3:56, which tied their var­sity record in January against Northwestern. Jack Stoltz, turn­ing. in his usual fine perform­ance, chopped six seconds offhis 200 freestyle record set Jast year. ·His time was· 1:55~3~ Bill Ramis bettered his own breast­stroke record with ·a titre of 2!34,6, James .

In the 137 lb. class, Bob Carey lost 9-5 to a stronger opponent. Clete Williams got off to a prom­ising start in his match with Cy Faulkner of Wheaton, but fault­
ered in the waning minutes to cqme out on the short end of a (5-2) decision. 
The first bright spot in the even­ing for the Notre Dame fans was l'vlike Eiben's excellent perform­ance in the 157 lb. class; pinning. down a (9-5) victory. Apparently inspired by Eiben' s victory, Bill Schickel came out on the mat for . a ·most impressive performance against Wheaton team captain and 1963 NCAA Division Champion Tom Jarman.

to be a breeze for Wheaton,
