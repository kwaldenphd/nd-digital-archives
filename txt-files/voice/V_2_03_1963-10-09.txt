New Activities

Fro·m·· Blu·e· Ci_rcl·e-. 
"This year's Blue Circle.will inlti~ nte a number of new activities' on campus," reports Paul Tierney, this year's General Chairman, 
One of these is the Senior Ad~ visors Committee. This group, or-· ganized by Jerry Young, includes all Circle members arid about fifty seniors and juniors. The purpose of this group is to advise the fresh­men on all phases of student life: This will be accomplished by as­signing two or three upperclassmen to each floor in the five· freshinan dormitories. These advisors will meet regularly with the freshmen _and,make themselves o.vailable for any problems that come up through­out the year. 
Another innovation Is the Grad­uate School Bureau. Tom O'Brien, the chairman, and his committee have been compiling information on graduate schools, professional schools, scholarships,· and fellow­ships all summer and are still en­gaged· in research. This centraliz­ing of information will be of much use ·to future graduating classes seeking further education. 
A third committee· is the Col­legiate Investigation Committee led
