-Tom ·nooley room, late last night. He and other election officials had just finished counting more than 3000 votes, and now he tried toex.,. pla.in why the .statistics ·of the Senate elections were not released.· · It was the first time that the status of a Senatorial election have been withheld, but Fish thought the innovation was a prudent one. "We don't want a senator who received a large majority of votes to lord ft over the other senator 1n his hall who just squeezed in," Fish said. "There should be no senior-junior senator concept in the Senate. We want the Senators from the Halls to work as equal partners. If anyone questions the results, we can give him a parti­cular statistic privately." The only unopposed candl.dateas· such was Garey Malek of Sorin Hall. In .Dillon, however,· the three elected senators were unopposed in the finals due to that Hall's unique primary race. . . . Wishing to elect·a senator from • each floor (Dillon has -three floors . -and three senators) the Hall ran 
afoul of the student constitution feelings of our Hallconstituericy," which demands that the senators · . Pointing to his party's 50 per­
be elected at. large. By running a primary 'on each floor and having the losing candidates then withdraw their names Dillon circumvented the · rule. As a · result of the manuver, election official Rick · Dunn said that an amendment to the constitution, allowing each Hall autonomy in the manner ofelection 
structure could be anticipated. 
The most interesting result of 
yesterday's elections was the in-:­
trodtiction of a party ticket into 
Notre Dame politics. The Action ·student Party (ASP) ran 12 can­. di dates in 11 of the 18 halls, six · of whom were victorious. 
In these 11 halls an ASP plat­
form pamphlet .. was distributed.. 
"This was a platform unanimously 
agreed . upon by our candidates," 
said Paul Higgins, president ofthe 
ASP's . and new Senator from 
Howard Hall. "These are not· 
cent elect1on success, Higgins re.;· plied: "Since I feel we were con­tending with an unfavorable image as· well as with other candidates,· · I am pretty much satisfied," 
HiF)l priorities for the ASP's, according to Higgins, are res61u:..
