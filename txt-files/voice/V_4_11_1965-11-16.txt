.'University of Notre Dame ·iTitesday, November -16;·1965 


1t•s time that the Notre Dame student body faced up to the responsibilities of . living in a democratic society. Judging from the. events of the last week there are 
· a large number of students· at this univer-: sity whose definition or the ''right of free speech" is that "anyone can say anytl1ing as long as he· doesn't disagree with me.'' Last week a petition of support for the u.s. government's position in Viet Nam· was circulated. Members of S,D,S, and sympa­thizers soon appeared handing out flyers offering reasons for not signing the petition. They were subjected to a completely .un-. 
. justifiable amount of verbal abuse. threats, character. assasinations, and out-right plty~­ical violence. In one incident a stu,J.ent was . knocked to the. ground, in another incident a student was throttled and shaken·. Jllmost all. those handing· out literature had the ex­

·Firstly, "Apparently, little more than a personal production of the LUNA committee." 
Secondly, "This committee is bent on determining the outcome:• 
Thirdly, "Selecti~ns will osten~ sibly be based on the quallfica­tions ,· of . delegation members,
