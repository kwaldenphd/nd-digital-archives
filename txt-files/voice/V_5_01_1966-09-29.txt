in the film adaptation of Norman · Maller•s recent novel. The film does manage to carry some of 
. the violence of the novel to the screen. Whitman is a difficult actor to understand in that he 1s seldom able to indicate the ·motl­vatlon of his characters. Janet Leigh does well as the wife. The 
film has all the elements of a Hollywood film which obviously app~al . to many people;. un­fortunately one of these elements 1s compromise. 
. STATE "Goldfinger" 1:20, 5:10, 
9:05 "Dr. No" 3:15, 7:05. These two Bond films are being dropped on the· public again. Many people missed ..Dr, No" which, yes fans, does· have ·an the· sex. that the other Bond films do; but it ts lacking in ·plot. ..Goldinger" is better, with the musical score its 
.outstanding characteristic.
