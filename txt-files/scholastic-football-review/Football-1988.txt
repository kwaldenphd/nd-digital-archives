THEY WANTED To WIN 
1988 NOTRE DAME FOOTBALL NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP REVIEW 




··: 
i ,. 


Forevvord 

I have to be honest. I never thought it would happen. 
Yes, I grew up where the Notre Dame name was big when Frank Leahy's teams were going unbeaten for four years straight in the 1940s. 
Yes, I did grow up singing the Notre Dame Victory March as we marched in and out of St. Aloysius grade school. 
Yes, I did think so highly of this Uni­versity that I put that clause in the con­tract at Minnesota, so that if the Notre Dame job ever opened up, I would be able to consider it as long as we had been invited to a bowl game at Minnesota. 
But, when Gerry Faust resigned in 1985 and I ended up at Notre Dame, ev­
"I always have said Notre Dame would win one (national championship) again -I just didn't know when it would be or who would be coach­ing." 
-Lou Holtz 

eryone told me why we couldn't win. 
The academic standards, the tough schedule, the no redshirting policy, the lack of an athletic dormitory -all those were reasons people gave me why Notre Dame would never be great again. 
I thought we proved we could be com­petitive again, even in '86 when we lost five games by 14 points. 
I thought we proved we could be a fac­tor nationally in '87 when we won eight of our first nine games and earned an in­vitation to a major bowl game. 
But win a national championship? I al­ways have said Notre Dame would win one again -I just didn't know when it would be or who would be coaching. I honestly never considered that we had a chance in 1988. There were a million reasons why we didn't have a chance. 
I don't know how many times people told me we could never win with Tony Rice as our quarterback. People thought he was one-dimensional and that we couldn't throw well enough to beat the great teams. At times, I even agreed with them. But maybe none of us realized just how great a competitor Tony Rice really is, which he proved in 1988. 
Our offensive line had been decimat­ed. There was nothing left, especially af­ter Jeff Pearson t;lected to leave school during the summer. Our line had been such a strong point in '87, that it was hard to imagine how we could replace all those people. · 
I felt our running backs would be pretty good. But who knew if our line would be good enough to open any holes for them? 
Our receivers? What a huge question mark that was. Tim Brown was gone and so was Reggie Ward. I thought Bobby Carpenter and Pierre Martin would be pretty good based on spring practice then they both became ineligible. Ricky Watters and Pat Eliers had never played flanker before and Steve Alaniz, who had hardly played at all, was the only split end left on the roster. So, even if Tony Rice was improved, it didn't look like he had much to throw to. 
Our kicking game didn't look much better. Tim Brown had done everything for us in terms of ~eturns. I thought Reg­
t '· ~.. • • ,. -:-•• ·~

"''.:. .'• ·-. 
····· ... ~ :-. 
gie Ho and Billy Hackett would be ade­quate for field goals and PATs but we didn't have any idea who the punter would be when we started in August. 
You looked at all this on paper and you wondered how we ever would score. 
I did think we had a chance on defense because we had more people back over there and I thought we looked pretty good in the spring. 
But, there still were questions. Chris Zorich never played at all as a freshman and George Williams didn't play much. Jeff Aim had never been a full-time play­er before. Once we found outJohn Foley wouldn't be able to play all year, I really didn't know what to expect from the de­fensive line. 
I thought our linebackers would be fine, inside and outside. Between Wes Pritchett, Michael Stonebreaker and Ned Bolcar inside along with Frank Starns, Flash Gordon and Andre Jones outside, we weren't in bad shape there. 
D'Juan Francisco had really come along at cornerback in the spring, and I thought Patrick Terrell would make a good contribution. 
But, when you looked at it on paper, an awfully large number of things had to fall in place for us to think we could be any good. There were things about this group that no one recognized. 
No one knew how hard this team worked in the off-season to get better fundamentally. The fans don't see the time they spend in the weightroom or working out during the winter program or even during the summer. I felt good about our attitude this spring. 
I just didn't know if we could score because we couldn't all spring. I felt our defense had a chance to be good, but I wasn't sure if we were capable of having a good record if we had to count on win­ning 10-7 every Saturday. 
No one recognized how badly this group wanted to win. No one recognized the determination left behind when we lost three games at the end of '87. 
I never once mentioned it, but I got the feeling that there was still something left undone for the seniors who had come here and gone 5-6 their first two years. They had been there for the 58-7 game against Miami and I think they wanted to find a way to prove Notre Dame football was more than that. 
Our players' attitude all the way through was one of, ''Tell us what we have to do to win." I can't overempha­size that. They understood their roles, they u~derstood the kind of commit­ment it would take and they didn't care who told them we weren't good enough. 
When we met in August for the first time, I was extremely realistic, as I al­ways try to be with the players. I don't ever try to con them, I'm as honest as I can possibly be. 
I told them about all those question marks, about all the reasons people had for us not being a real good item. And most of those were legitimate reasons. 
But, on the other hand, I didn't see any reason why we couldn't go into eve­ry single football game thinking we should win. 
We took it week by week, we didn't take anything for granted and we had an amazing number of our questions an­swered with exclamation points. 
You look back on the season, and there may still be some other teams who think they were better than we were. But, we proved it every week on the field. We didn't say we were the best team in the country. We just said we had to be better than the team on the other sideline every Saturday. We beat three excellent foot­ball teams in Miami, USC, and West Vir­ginia that would have been 12-0 if it hadn't been for Notre Dame, and we beat some other pretty good teams in Michi­gan, Michigan State and Pittsburgh. 
We were a great football team because nobody proved we weren't. We had 12 challenges put in front of us and we met every one of them. 
I don't know if we can be as good in 1989 as some people have suggested. I don't know what the chemistry will be like. I don't know how hard our players will be willing to work. 
I didn't come to Notre Dame to win national championships. I didn't come here thinking I had something to prove. 
I'm just happy for the seniors who fin­ished their careers on the field in Tempe onJanuary 2. They came to Notre Dame ready to shoot for the stars, thinking they could be great. They probably had some doubts along the way and maybe they qidn't win quite as many games as they thought they would. 
But, in 1988, they proved to people that Notre Dame could be great again on the football field. I think there were an awful lot of people who just didn't be­lieve that could happen. 
I'm glad it did. 

-Lou Holtz 


Introduction 
Those misty, water-color memories that Barbra Streisand sang about a few years back -those are the moments that will remain crystalized in our minds. 
Punch the button that says, "Notre Dame Football, 1988," and let those memories unravel. 
Remember the sight of the Cotton Bowl scoreboard that read, ''Texas A&M 35, Notre Dame 10." Remember the feel­ing that this wasn't what big-time bowl games were supposed to be like. 
Remember the headlines trumpeting 
another top-ranked recruiting season in February for Notre Dame. Back then, names like De­rek Brown, Rod Smith, Arnold Ale and Gene McGuire quali­fied only as high school all­stars. Eleven months later they would qualify for na­tional champi­onship rings. 
Remember the coaching changes that came quick on the heels of the 

recruiting triumphs. Add John Palermo, Joe Moore and Chuck-Heater to the staff roster -and chalk up a new position coach for every single Irish defender. 
Remember the rock 'em sock 'em spring scrimmages that raised so many questions. Can the defense really be this good? Can the offense really be strug­gling this much? Will the Irish ever score? Will anybody ever score against that defense? 
Remember the off-the-field stories that characterized summer in South Bend. First, Pierre Martin and Bobby Carpen­ter, the Irish hopes at split end, left school, facing ineligibility. Next, starting guard Jeff Pearson, the only returning of­fensive line regular, left school and even­tually transferred to Michigan State. Next came the unfair and unfounded rumors surrounding Tony Rice's academic stand­
8 

ing. Finally came the news of John Fo­ 
ley's loss due to a bicep nerve injury dat­ 
ing all the way back to the Cotton Bowl.  
Every episode seemed to add to the list  
of questions surrounding the '88 team.  
Remember the afternoon of August 29  
when, as Lou Holtz put it. ''We threw  
away the whistle.'' The Irish blocked and  
tackled like never before and when Holtz  
and his charges walked off the practice  
field that day there was no question of  
commitment.  
Remember Andy Heck putting to rest  
any doubts of the strength of the re­ 
vamped offensive line after he spoke at the preseason luncheon sponsored by  ,. !!  
the Chamber of Commerce.  
Heck related, "Coach Goe) Moore told  
us the other day about how the winners  
in life have the best of everything. They  
make the most money, they have the  
best jobs, they go out with the best-look­ 
ing girls. Frankly, I'm tired of all this talk  
about our offensive line being a weak­ 
ness. I just want you to know that all of  
us who play on the offensive line have  
great-looking girlfriends." Case closed.  
Remember the anxiety involved in try­ 
ing to figure out if all these new names  
and faces meant good things for Irish  
football.  
Who is this Chris Zorich and can he  
really be as good as Lou Holtz says? What  
about George Williams and Jeff Aim and  
are they really good enough to be  
starters? Can Michael Stonebreaker come  
back from. a year off and regain his  
touch? Can Frank Starns and Wes Prit­ 
chett take a few minutes off from enjoy­ 
ing life to play with the intensity mir­ 
rored every day in practice?  
Can Tony Rice throw the ball aily bet­ 
ter than he did last year? Can Ricky Wat­ 
ters fill the bill at flanker better than  
Mark Green? Can the Irish ever catch the  
football with all these new people at the  
receiver spots? Can the Irish ever run the  
football with all these new people on the  
offensive line?  
Remember how the Michigan game an­ 
swered those questions. Yes, Zorich  
seems to be worth waiting for. Yes, Wil­ 
liams and Aim just might get the job  
done. Yes, Stonebreaker looks like he  
was never gone. Yes, Starns and Pritchett  
have every. intention of being the emo­ 


tionalleaders of this team. Yes, Rice does throw the ball better, it's just that he's working with a brand new cast. 
He's not Tim Brown, but, yes, Watters does indeed know how to return punts for touchdowns. Yes, the Irish will catch the football, even if it takes a few weeks for rookies like Derek Brown and Raghib Ismail to get their feet on the ground. Yes, the Irish will indeed run the ball and maybe it doesn't make any difference who's up front blocking. 
Remember the warm feeling of watch­ing a little-known walk-on named Reggie Ho suddenly thrust into the hero's role in what is supposed to be a big man's game. Remember the thought that maybe there aren't enough Reggie Ho stories to go around in this game of college football. 
Remember the heart-in-the-throat feel­ing as Mike Gillette's last-ditch field goal try sails toward the uprights and looks for a moment like it might be good. Re­member the elation when it was not. 
Remember hearing all those great facts about Michigan State's defense. Remem­ber Notre Dame running right through it for 245 yards. Remember the Irish de­fense doing an impression in East Lansing of what the Spartans' defense was sup­posed to be like. · 
Remember seeing two fullbacks get hurt and having a tailback (Tony Brooks) who's supposed to be hurt look even bet­ter. 
Remember seeing the scoreboard regis­ter 42-0 by halftime against Purdue even though there actually were three posses­sions where the Irish didn't score. Re­member Notre Dame scoring three dif­ferent times on one-play drives. 
Remember the thought of sweeping three Big Ten rivals for the second straight year. 
Remember those people who said Rice couldn't throw? Well, remember those same people reading his name in the No­tre Dame record book for completing 10 straight passes. 
Remember the Irish rolling to a 21-0 advantage in the evening coolness in front of the ESPN cameras against Stan­ford before the defense even worked up a sweat. 
Remember how a few breaks now and then never hurt -as the Irish found out against Pittsburgh. Darnell Dickeson ap­petizingly fumbled the ball into the end zone and the Panthers earned an assist on Notre Dame's last touchdown drive by keeping it alive with 12 men on the field on a punt. 

Remember the thought of just how big the Notre Dame vs. Miami confrontation would be now that the Irish and 'Canes were both coming in unbeaten. 
Remember watching one of the great­est exhibitions of competitive football ever to be seen in Notre Dame Stadium. Remember a back-and-forth swing of emotion and momentum so good you al­most hated to see it end. 
Remember wondering just how many more passes Steve Walsh would complete before Frank Starns or Pat Terrell or someone else would make him pay. 
Remember just how perfect an Octo­ber Saturday can be in South Bend when your football team knocks off the num­ber one team in the country and ends a regular season winning streak that stretches over four seasons. 
Remember wondering if it really gets any better than this. And remember Lou Holtz having to remind everyone that be­ing 6-0 does nothing but guarantee a winning season. 
Remember being scared to death of an Air Force wishbone that was rolling up 432 rushing yards a week. Then, remem­ber th~ Irish rolling up 267 rushing yards themselves. 
Rememper the irony of watching No­tre Dame play its least-inspiring football game of the season against Navy -only to step off the plane from Baltimore to learn that UCLA had been beaten and the Irish were going to be number one. 
Remember the disappointment of 
President Ronald Rea­gan congratulated Lou Holtz and the Fighting Irish on their champi­onship. 
·_ . ~ "·~ ' . 

.: .. ·. 


Notre Dame took the field ·12 times last sea­son and came away with 12 victories. 

learning from Lou Holtz that being num­ber one doesn't guarantee anything ­that you still have to go 10 yards for a first down, you still only get six points for a touchdown and you don't get the ball back if the other team recovers your fumble. 
Remember the feeling of walking into your own stadium as the nation's top­ranked team and leaving that way after scoring 54 points and giving up just 11. 
Remember the satisfaction of beating a Penn State team that had been a thorn in the side of so many recent season re­cords. Remember the satisfaction of those Fiesta Bowl representatives in their lemon-yellow coats finally making offi­cial what had been rumored for weeks. 
Remember the possibility that if Mi­ami-Notre Dame at· midseason is big, maybe Notre Dame-USC with the top ranking at stake is even bigger. 
Remember the sight of Tony Rice sprinting 65 yards in front of his own bench with the enti~e Trojan defense in pursuit. 
Remember the sight of Stan Smagala single-handedly snatching the momen­tum away from USC with his intercep­tion and return for a touchdown. 
Remember the Irish defense throwing up a brick wall around the goal line late in the third period and making the Tro­jans settle for a field goal that did noth­ing but set Notre Dame up for its clinch­ing touchdown drive. 
Remember the thought that it's possi­ble to beat the powerful and favored Tro­jans on their own field, even without your leading rusher and receiver. 
Remember the constant reminders from Lou Holtz that you're not playing for the national championship-you're just playing to prove you're better than West Virginia on one given day. 
Remember the domination by the de­fense in the early going, as Major Harris and his mates need a penalty flag to get a first down. Remember that by that time the Irish already led 16-0. 
Remember how silent the critics of Tony Rice's passing became after he lured West Virginia into playing the option, on­ly to throw for·a career-high 213 yards. 
Remember thinking that a quarter­back's statistics don't count. As Steve Walsh, Rodney Peete and Major Harris can attest, it's only 12-0 that matters. 
Remember the feeling that in Sun Devil Stadium on)anuary 2, 1989, Notre Dame without doubt guaranteed itself the national championship. 
Remember the feeling of self-satisfac­tion in the Fiesta Bowl locker room. Maybe there wasn't quite as much cele­brating as some observers might have ex­pected. After all, there had never been any thought that the result might be dif­ferent that it was. 
Remember waking up the next morn­ing and reading the newspapers and real­izing the dream that 120-some football players had dared to dream really had come true. 
And remember that the dream never dies. It simply fades a bit over the years, into misty, water-color memories.

Noting the Irish 
The Streak: Notre Dame's current 12­game winning streak is the ninth-longest in Irish history. Notre Dame's longest all-time winning streak of 21 games was compiled during the '46-'48 seasons. Notre Dame's all­time unbeaten streak is 39 games that includ­ed 37 victories and two ties from '46-'50. 
The Ranked Wins: Notre Dame .defeated four ranked teams in '88, downing #9 Michi­gan, #I Miami, #2 USC and #3 West Virgin­ia (all AP rankings the week of the game). This marked the first time since 1980 that No­tre Dame beat four ranked teams in a season. 
After a Turnover: Notre Dame's defense was particularly tough following a turnover by the offense this year. The Irish turned the ball over 23 times in '88 and allowed only four touchdowns and three field goals following those turnovers. On the other hand, Notre Dame's offense managed to capitalize with scores 13 of the 35 times an opponent com­mitted a turnover. The Irish scored 10 touch­downs and three field goals after gaining the ball by a turnover. · 
Answering the Challenge: Irish coach Lou Holtz continually stressed the importance of his team answering the challenge with points any time the opponent scored. Notre Dame was especially good at that in 1988, doing it on 16 occasions out of 30 opponent scores. 
Punching It In: Notre Dame was especial­ly impressive once the Irish got inside the en­emy 20-yard line in 1988. Lou Holtz's squad scored 41 of 48 times inside the 20, finishing with 31 TDs, 10 field goals, three missed field goals, one interception and two lost fum­bles. One time the Irish lost the ball on downs. 
Shutting Them Down: Before the start of the season Irish coach Lou Holtz continually pointed out that Notre Dame's defense would be the key to a successful season. The nation­al rankings illustrate how strong the Irish de­

fense was:  
Category  Rank  Allowed  
Scoring Defense  3rd  12.3  
Rushing Defense  lOth  112.4  
Passing Defense  34th  280.3  
Total Defense  13th  392.7  

The Big Plays: Notre Dame wasn't espe­cially known as a big play team in '88, yet its return teams and defense accounted for seven TDs. They were: 
1. 
Ricky Watters' 81-yard punt return for a TO vs. Michigan 

2. 
Michael Stonebreaker's 39-yard interception return for a TO vs. Michigan State 

3. 
Ricky Watters' 66-yard punt return for a TO vs. Purdue 

4. 
Pat Terrell's 60-yard interception return for a TO vs. Miami 

5. 
Raghib Ismail's 87-yard kickoff return for a TO vs. Rice 

6. 
Raghib Ismail's 83-yard kickoff return for a TO vs. Rice

Mike Gillette, perhaps Michigan's finest kicker ever, missed just right on a 48-yard attempt with three seconds· remaining that would have given the Wolverines the ·win. 
Ho had four field goals in the game, and after Gillete's miss, the Notre Dame student section chanted, "Reggie, Reggie, Reggie."

Notre Dame vs. Michigan 
The Matchup: #13 Notre Dame (0-0, 8­4 in '87) vs. #9 Michigan (0-0, 8-4 in '87), September 10 in Notre Dame Stadium. 
The Holtz Pre-game Quote: "I know there will be one great team in No­tre Dame Stadium on September 10. It's our obligation to make sure Michigan's not the only one.'' · 
The Angle: This marks the sixth anni­versary of Notre Dame's first-ever night game in Notre Dame Stadium, a game the Irish won over Michigan, 23-17, on Sept. 18, 1982. . 
The Beginning: This marks the first of seven home games in '88 and is the first time Notre Dame has had seven home games in a single year. 
The Question: Would the Notre Dame defense be substantially improved after yielding 80 combined points in three consecutive losses that ended the '87 campaign? 
The Answer: The Sporting News had rated Michigan's offensive line as the best in the country, but Notre Dame's defense permitted only 213 total yards, 139 rush­ing yards, no drive longer than 48 yards and gains of one yard or less on 17 dif­ferent rushing plays. In fact, both Michi­gan TDs came after Irish special team miscues -a 59-yard Wolverine kickoff return and a fumbled punt that left Mich­igan at the Notre Dame 15. 
The Irony: Notre Dame won the game despite not scoring a touchdown from scrimmage. 
The Youth: Notre Dame got off to a winning start despite a young lineup that featured 10 first-time starters. 
The Hero: Diminutive walk-on kicker Reggie Ho enjoyed a sensational debut by kicking a school-record-tying four field goals, including the game-winner with 
1:13 left on the clock. He was named the Sports Illustrated special teams player of the week. 
The Unsung Hero: Junior Michael Stonebreaker made 16 tackles in his first appearance after sitting out the entire '87 campaign due to academic ineligibility. He was named Tbe Sporting News' de­fensive player of the week. 
The Newcomer: Maybe the best of the new faces on the scene was sopho­more nose tackle Chris Zorich, who after not playing a single down as a freshman, made 1 0 tackles and had a sack and a half against Michigan. 
The Comparison: Lou Holtz had tried to avoid comparisons of first-year flanker Ricky Watters with graduated Reisman Trophy winner Ti~ Brown. But Watters didn't make it easy for his coach by re­turning Michigan's first punt 81 yards for a score. 
The Key Moves: Notre Dame twice answered the challenge with scoring drives in the fourth period after Michi­gan had.taken leads of 14-13 and 17-16. 
The Gamewinner: Notre Dame's tri­umph wasn't secure until Mike Gillette missed a 48-yard field goal as time ex­pired. 
The Holtz Post-game Quote: "When our placekicker, Ted Gradel, graduated last year, he told me not to overlook Re­ggie Ho. He said you may have other people with more potential, but nobody works harder than Reggie Ho. He's out there kicking every day, even in the snow.'' 

Ricky \Vatters re­turned a Michigan punt 81 yards to give Notre Dame an early 7-0 lead. ·

What they said... 
What was a. first-half _standoff became a second-half ·Stampede. 
Getting no points for being pretty, Notre Dame marched on a team it wasn't supposed to and wound up with a 20-3 victory over Michigan State Saturday afternoon. 
All but giving up on a passing game that has hit rock bottom, the Fighting Irish banged some, optioned some and got the job done. 
If it wasn't for the running game, it wouldn't have happened for the 2-0 and eighth-ranked Irish. And against MSU that's doing it the hard way. 

20--3 
of their game. 
It was another exceptional day for linebacker Michael Stonebreaker. Stepping in front of a Bobby McAllister pass at the MSU 39, the Irish junior hauled it to the end zone to all but end it with 5: 18 to play. Reggie Ho 's kick, his eighth point of the afternoon,. made it 20-3. 
The Irish defense set the tone in the Spar­tans' first drive of the second half when tackle George Williams sacked McAllister for a 10­yard loss to the 6. A penalty on the punt re­turn prevented the Irish from starting in MSU territory. 
But on first down, fullback Tony Brooks took a pitch and broke it for 37 yards. There were five more plays in the drive, all on the ground. Senior tailback Mark Green added 20 of his 125 yards (21 carries) on the drive and Rice went the final eight on the option. 
Sept. 18, 1988 South Bend Tribune 
Ifat first you don't succeed-try, try, then run the option. 
That's the way Notre Dame ran its record to 2-0 with a convincing 20-3 win over Michi­gan State. 
After managing to secure a 6-3 lead at half­time on two Reggie Ho field goals, the Irish used a punishing second-half running attack and a tenacious defense to hold on to the ball, the lead and their early season momentum. 
With Tony Brooks (11 carries, 66 yards) filling the fullback slot and Mark Green (21 carries, 125 yards) taking the pitch outside, Irish quarterback Tony Rice directed the op­tion to march Notre Dame down the field against the Spartans, who led the nation in rush defense last season. 
"I felt Tony (Rice) handled the option real well," said Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz. "We hadn't been able to make the power game go, so we had to go to the option more than we wanted to in the second half. We think we're gonna break some things ·on people." 
Any concerns that this inexperienced offen­sive line couldn't hold its own were washed away by Notre Dame's 245 yards rushing, 195 in the second half. 
"It's been a long time since someone has gained that many yards on us," said Michigan State head coach George Perl~s. "They got a lead where they could play ball control. It was great execution." Jan. 19, 1989 The· Observer

Michigan State led the nation against the rush last year and didn't lose much. With its passing game all but scrapped, Notre Dame didn't have a choice but to try. 
For the second straight week, the Irish de­fense was .outstanding, keeping it close until the offense could put it away. The Spartans had only 89 yards rushing, which is the name

Notre Dame vs. Michigan State 
The Matchup: #8 Notre Dame (1-0) 
vs. Michigan State (0-1), September 17 in 
Spartan Stadium, East Lansing, Mich.. 
The Holtz Pre-game Quote: ''I felt 
coming into this season that ·playing on 
the road at Michigan State would be as 
tough as any game on our schedule. J 
think it's safe to say that Rutgers' win Sat­
urday doesn't make our task any easier." 
The Angle: Lou Holtz had never be­
fore won a game as a visiting coach in 
Spartan Stadium losing once each while 
coaching at North Carolina State, Minne­
sota and Notre Dame. 

The Question: Would the Irish be able 
to run the ball against a Michigan State 
defense that ranked first nationally 
against the rush in '87, allowing just 61.5 . yards per game? 
The Answer: Despite managing only 
two pass completions all day, Notre 
Dame ran for 245 yards, including a sea­
son-high 125 by senior tailback Mark 
Green. The Irish had 195 rushing yards 
in the second half, thanks to impressive 
use of the option. 

The Irony, Part I: Notre Dame's 
rushing success came despite losing jun­
ior fullbacks Anthony Johnson and Brax­
ston Banks to injuries within minutes of 
each other in the first period. That 
forced sophomore Tony Brooks to 
switch over to fullback for the second 
half, despite a stress fracture in his foot. The Irony, Part II: Notre Dame won its second straight game despite the lack of a legitimate passing attack. Tony Rice ·completed only three-of-12 throws vs. 
Michigan and only two-of-nine vs. Michi­
gan for a total of 90 yards, with one in­
terception in each game. On the plus 
side, Rice did rush for 105 combined 
yards in those two outings. 

The Hero: Junior linebacker Michael . Stonebreaker played even better than he 
did the week before -this time making 
17 tackles and intercepting two passes, 
including the game-clincher for a touch­
down in the final period. He was named 
Associated Press' Midwest defensive 
player of the week. 

The Unsung Hero, Part I: Notre 
Dame's defense, which held the Spartans 
to only 89 yards rushing and limited 
Blake Ezor (who came in leading the na­
tion in rushing after gaining 196 yards the previous week vs. Rutgers) to· 66 yards on 22 carries. Michigan State's only points came after Rice threw an intercep­tion to set the Spartans up on the Notre Dame 43. 

The Unsung Hero, Part II: Rookie Raghib Ismail didn't catch a pass, but his blocked punt set up the second Reggie Ho field goal. 
The Key Move: Clinging to a· precari­ous 6-3 halftime lead, Notre Dame got a 37 -yard gain from Tony Brooks on its first offensive play of the second half and drove 71 yards in six plays for its only offensive touchdown. Meanwhile, Michi­gan State never really threatened in the second half -its only meaningful excur­sion past midfield snuffed out by a Wes Pritchett sack. 
The H~ltz Post-game Quote: ''The kicking game and defense kept us in until the second half. At halftime we made a few adjustments, but all we were trying to do was. hang on. Our team never flinched or lost its poise. That's a credit to them." 
Chris Zorich makes another crunching hit at the line of scrim­mage.

What they said... 
For everyone wondering what could happen if Notre Dame's passing attack clicked just a little, the evidence was there to see Saturday afternoon. 
Purdue took it on the chin and just about everywhere else. 
Before the first half was over, Notre Dame had 42 points and Purdue was done. Because of head coach Lou Holtz's gracious approach, it didn't get ridiculous as the Fighting Irish walked away from Notre Dame Stadium 52-7 winners. 
It could have been even worse. Notre Dame had a touchdown run by Mark Green called back because of a penalty on its first posses­sion and Reggie Ho missed the subsequent 47-yard field goal attempt. 
The rest was bad news for Purdue. The Boilers couldn't budge against the Irish de­fense in the first half (only 42 yards on the ground and 72 in the air with three intercep­tions) and starting quarterback Shawn Mc­Carthy was pulled for freshman Brian Fox with four minutes left in the half. Sept. 25, 1988 · South Bend Tribune 
After beating Michigan and Michigan State, Notre Dame was having trouble taking Purdue seriously. 
"We didn't have a particularly good prac­tice on Wednesday," said guard Tim Grunhard. "Coach (Lou) Holtz looked at the film, and he wasn't happy. He really got on our backs. 
"He said, 'The offense has got to get it to­gether. We can't have the defense carry us.' " 
Thanks; coach. 
On Saturday, the offense got it together and quarterback Tony Rice got it together. And Notre Dame (3-0) took apart the Boilermak­ers (1-2) 52-7 in front of 59,075 at Notre Dame Stadium. 
The victory was Notre Dame's seventh straight against a member of the Big Ten. The Fighting Irish showed they could blow out a team they were supposed to blow out, and fig­ure to move up a notch or two from eighth place in the AP poll. 
We have to keep this win in perspective," 
Holtz said, trying to be kind. "Although we 
played well, Purdue was beat and banged up 
coming into the game."· 
Sept. 25, ·1988 Chicago Tribune 



It was just Notre Dame's day. 
The Irish jumped all over a hobbled Purdue squad 52-7 at Notre Dame Stadium Sept. 24, which completed a season-opening three­game sweep of Big Ten schools and raised the question of just how good was the Notre Dame football team. 
The Notre Dame totals told the story: 31 rushing attempts for 236 yards, five comple­tions for 119 yards, 15 first downs and three interceptions by the defense. Leading rusher Tony Brooks had 11 carries for 110 yards, and Tony Rice. completed four of six passes and threw for two touchdowns against the top pass defense in the country coming into the game. 
And that was just the first half. 
"Notre Dame could have picked the score after that start," said Purdue head coach Fred Akers. "Once they got rolling and things start­ed going their way, they became awfully good." 
Besides the point deficit, Akers had to cope with the loss of several interior linemen. With everything going right for the Irish and wrong for the Boilermakers, the outcome was not in doubt for long. · 
"We're a good football team that has im­proved fundamentally over a year ago," he said. "But we still have a long way to go. Where are we right now? We're 3-0, which is exactly where we were a year ago." Jan. 19, 1989 The Observer 

The Matchup: #8 Notre Dame (2-0) 
vs. Purdue (1-1), September 24 in Notre 
Dame Stadium. 

The Holtz Pre-game Quote: "We're not very pretty.· We don't do anything fancy. But our running game isn't bad, our defense is pretty good and our kick­ing game has been decent. But we can't even begin to think a.bout a complete football team until we prove we can throw the football.'' 
The Angle: Notre Dame was looking for its seventh straight victory over a Big Ten foe -and was attempting to sweep Michigan, Michigan State and Purdue for the second straight season. 
The Question: Could the Irish con­tinue to win 'Yith a passing game that ranked last' among all Division I teams with only five completions in 21 at­tempts in the first two wins combined? 
The Answer: Attributing part of his improvement to throwing darts on a dartboard in his dormitory room, Tony Rice completed four-of-six passes for 85 yards, including TD passes to freshmen Derek Brown and Raghib Ismail. 
The Irony, Part I: Lou Holtz would have loved to have Tony Rice throw more to give him additional game experi­ence, but Notre Dame's commanding 42­0 halftime lead made that impossible. The halftime margin was the most lop­sided in Notre Dame's favor in 20 years. As a result, the Irish threw only four times the entire second half. 
The Irony, Part II: Purdue came in with the nation's top-rated defensive backfield. But it was Notre Dame that in­tercepted five passes, two by senior safety George Streeter. 
The Hero: Sophomore Tony Brooks got. his only start of the season-at full­back this time with Braxston Banks and Anthony Johnson out-and responded with 110 yards on 11 carries to go with a 34-yard reception. 
The Unsung Heroes, Part I: The Irish offensive line, with five new starters, led the way for 321 rushing yards -not to mention 147 passing yards against a secondary rated number one in the country (59.0 yards permitted per game). 
The Unsung Heroes, Part II:There were a million of them as the Irish got 83 players into the game. There were 12 dif­

ferent rushers, five quarterbacks and sev­
en touchdown-scorers. Notre Dame had 
3 55 total yards by halftime and amaz­
ingly had three first-half possessions 
where it didn't put points on the board. 
. The Unsung Heroes, Part III: How 
tough was the Irish defense? Even lead­
-ing 52-0 midway through the fourth peri­od, Notre Dame gave up only one yard on four plays after the Boilers had first and goal on the four. Purdue's only score came after a 40-yard punt return. 
The Key Move: It was tough to tab a turning point. Purdue threw an intercep­tion on its third play from scrimmage and it was all downhill from there for the Boilermakers. Notre Dame had a Mark Green touchdown run called back by a penalty on its second offensive play and ended up missing a field goal -but that's as much of a moral victory as Pur­due would earn all day. 
The Holtz Post-game Quote:: ''We have to keep this game in perspective. We played well, but Purdue was beat up coming into the game. I did think Tony . Rice threw the ball today more like he does in practice. Don't get me wrong, though, he's not ready to play on Sun­day.'' 
Tony Rice hooked up with Derek Brown on an eight-yard pass for Notre Dame's second touchdown.

Game 4 
What they said... 
A year ago, in the fourth week of the sea­son, Notre Dame quarterback Tony Rice came off the bench against Pittsburgh and dis­played promising talent. 
Saturday night, one year later, he was a bundle of talent as the Fighting Irish whipped Stanford, 42-14, at Notre Dame Stadium. 
Rice celebrated a year of playing quarter­back by running some, passing some, direct­ing the option some and scoring two touch­downs for the fifth-ranked and 4-0 Irish. 
Sure he got some help from his offensive and defensive friends in Blue and Gold, but Rice had the most impressive numbers. For instance: 
*He passed 14 times and completed 11 for 129 yards and one touchdown. *He rushed for a single-game career-high 107 yards on 14 carries and two touchdowns. 
Oct. 2, 1988 Grand Rapids Press 
Tony Rice threw the football against Stan­ford as if he was throwing darts. And he ran like somebody was throwing darts at him. ·

Everyone knew the Irish quarterback could run like he did in Notre Dame's 42-14 tri­umph over the Cardinal at Notre Dame Stadi­um. Rice gained 107 yards on 14 carries and scored two touchdowns to prove it. 
But the doubters of Rice's passing ability got a glimpse of what the junior can do through the air as Rice completed 11-of-14 passes for 129 yards and one touchdown with­out throwing an interception. He tied a Notre Dame single-season record (held by many players) by completing 10 consecutive passes, including four in the previous week's 52-7 Irish triumph over Purdue and six more to start the Stanford contest. 
Rice attributed much of his success against the Cardinal to an interest in throwing darts inspired by Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz. 
"Me and coach Holtz were talking, and he suggested I get some darts and just throw in my room," Rice said. "It seemed like it just carried on. Every night I threw darts and in practice I could see I was improving a bit. 
"I'm going to keep throwing them. I think darts really helped me tonight." Jan. 19, 1989 The Observer

The Matchup: #5 Notre Dame (3-0) vs. Stanford (1-2), October 1 in Notre Dame Stadium. 
The Holtz Pre-game Quote: "How good is this football team? I can't answer that right now. I know this much ­we're a much better fundamental foot­ball team than we were a year ago. But we're 3-0 just like we were last year at this time. I'm really not interested in evaluating a football team in September and October as much as I am in Decem­ber or hopefully January." 
The Angle: Notre Dame was looking to go 4-0 for the rtrst time since '82 while meeting Stanford for the rtrst time since 1964, when John Huarte set an Irish single-game record with 21 comple­tions for 300 yards. 
The Question: How would Notre Dame's defense deal with Stanford's ball­control, run-and-shoot passing attack? 
The ~swer: The Irish put all kinds of pressure on the Stanford quarterbacks and didn't allow the Cardinal to advance past their own 37 until after Notre Dame had built a 21-0 lead. 1\vo of Stanford's rtrst four possessions resulted in turn­overs, one an interception by Flash Gor­don, the other a fumble recovery by Ned Bolcar at the Cardinal one. 
The Irony: Irish quarterback Tony Rice had endured all kinds of criticism of his passing in recent weeks. Yet, by half­time, he had tied a Notre Dame record with 10 straight pass completions, his last four vs. Purdue and his first six vs. Stanford. Further irony -what would have been Rice's record-setting 11th straight hookup was a 65-yard bomb to Raghib Ismail who ended up barely out of bounds. 
The Hero: Tony Rice ran for a career­high 107 yards and two TDs and showed he could be a high-percentage passer with a career-high 11 completions in 14 attempts for 129 yards and another score. For the second straight week, Rice opened the Notre Dame scoring with an option run of 30 yards or more. 
The Unsung Heroes, Part 1: Notre Dame's offensive balance again was the most impressive. The Idsh had seven dif­ferent receivers catch passes, used 11 dif­ferent ballcarriers, had a different player gain 100 yards on the ground for the third straight week and had no turnovers for the only time in the '88 season. 

The Unsung Heroes, Part II: For the second straight week, Notre Dame's de­fense forced its opponent to change quarterbacks. The Irish permitted only five net second-half rushing yards. 
The Switch: Notre Dame's triumph broke a string that had seen the Irish lose the fourth game of the campaign in three straight seasons. 
The Key Move: Notre Dame's defense dictated the pace early, especially on a key sequence late in the first period and early in the second. Leading 6-0, the Irish had driven to a first and goal at the Stan­ford six. Notre Dame missed on three straight tries from the one, and the mo­mentum might have swung in favor of the visitors. But Cardinal quarterback Brian Johnson fumbled on the rtrst play from the one. Mark Green scored on the next play and the Irish had a 14-0 edge they never lost. 
The Holtz Post-game Quote: "I have a lot of concerns. I don't know how good we are on offense. A lot of things trouble me. As I look down the road at our schedule, I see nothing but semis coming at us.'' 
Derek Brown pulled down a touchdown pass from Tony Rice to give Notre Dame a 36-7lead.

Game 5 
What they said... 
Notre Dame's football team finally extract­
ed a painful thorn from its side. It took major surgery. With a battle on its hands from the start of a 
sunny afternoon deep into a drizzly evening, the No. 5 Fighting Irish finally tur:ned back Pittsburgh, 30-20, in Pitt Stadium. 
The victory assured that two undefeated teams -the 5-0 Irish and No. 1 ranked Mi­ami -would meet in Notre Dame Stadium next Saturday afternoon. 
Notre Dame's first triumph over Pittsburgh 
· (2-3) after three straight losses, may have been expensive. By the time it was over, the Irish had weathered the talent of crafty Pitt quarterback Darnell Dickerson and survived the loss of two offensive guards, Tim Grunhard (ankle) and Tim Ryan (shoulder). 
But sophomore Joe Allen and Winston San­dri fit right in when the Irish ran off 14 plays and more than 5:4 7 off the fourth quarter­clock to punch across their final TD. 
Oct. 9, 1988 South Bend Tribune 
Notre Dame's Fighting Irish played keep away and got away from Pitt Stadium with a 30-20 win over the Pitt Panthers Saturday night. 
Time of possession became the second­most important statistic in the game -second only to the score. 
The Fighting Irish offense controlled the ball 39 minutes and 49 seconds of the game, while Pitt played. offense for just 20 minutes and 11 seconds. 
That difference, coupled with some critical Panthers' mistakes, allowed the fifth-ranked and undefeated Irish to win their fifth game of the season. 
Oct. 9, 1988 Grand Rapids Press 
For the Pitt Panthers, it was a case of three too many Notre Dame runners, two too many punts and one too many men on the field. 
For Notre Dame, it was one less monkey on its back. 
The Irish beat the Panthers, 30-20, in the second-half drizzle at Pitt Stadium, taking ad­vantage of three crucial Pitt miscues to break the Panthers' thr~e-game winning streak over the Irish. 
"It's like anything else," said Irish coach Lou Holtz. "If you give someone a chance, 
30--20 
and they're good, then they'll take advantage.

From the Pitt perspective, it was a game 
they should have won. From the Irish point of 
view, they were happy to get out of Pittsburgh 
with a win. 

. Tony Brooks, Mark Green and Tony Rice . combined for 257 yards as Notre Dame's 
strong running game totalled 310 yards. and 
four touchdowns. 
The turning point came in the fourth quar­
ter. With 11 :45 to play, the Panthers' Scott 
Kaplan hit a 34-yard field goal to cut the Irish 
lead to 23-20. Pitt held the Irish to minus­
three yards on three plays, and Jim Sexton 
was in to punt the football ·to the Panthers on 
fourth down and 13. 
With the snap, 11 Pitt players went for the 
block and one was back to return. That's 12 
players, and that's too many. And because all 
12 players participated in the play, it was a 15­
yard personal foul penalty, not the usual 12­
men on the field penalty. 
"It was really a key error on our part," Pitt 
coach Mike Gottfried said. "It kept the drive 
alive for them, and they went and scored. It 
was a mistake that never should have hap­
pened." 
"I couldn't believe it," Pitt punt returner 
Alonzo Hampton said, "especially. since I'm 
the one who's supposed to count the players. I 
didn't ge( it done; and it turned the game 
around. We always seem to make one little 
mistake, and the other team always seems to 
capitalize."

The Matchup: #5 Notre Dame (4-0) vs. Pittsburgh (2-2), October 8 in Pitt Sta­dium, Pittsburgh, Pa. 
The Holtz Pre-game Quote: "I'll guarantee you one thing, the Pittsburgh team we see Saturday will be the one that beat Ohio State 42-10, not the one that lost to Boston College or West Virginia. There's something about Notre Dame coming to town that brings out the best in everybody we play.''

What they said... 
The edge of the seats in Notre Dame Stadi­um may be worn thin, but the Stadium's magic is alive and well. 
And so is Notre Dame's football program. 
When Pat Terrell batted away Steve Walsh's two-point conversion pass with 45 seconds to play, the Irish locked up a stunning 31-30 up­set of No. 1-ranked Miami. 
Erased was Miami's mystique and all the embarrassment it's handed the Irish in recent years. 
"This was a big win by the Notre Dame spirit," said head coach Lou Holtz, whose club is 6-0 and may be destined for a No. 1 ranking next week. "It was a win by the spirit of a group of guys who just refused to fold, and believed. I congratulate our players for a 
31--30 

great football game." 
Oct. 16, 1988 South Bend Tribune 
The Fighting Irish of Notre Dame got the best of the last minute in a game that appeared to have 100 minutes of action packed into 60, and with it they got the best of the No. 1 ranked Miami Hurricanes. 
Irish free safety Pat Terrell knocked down a two-point conversion pass with 45 seconds re­maining, and three seconds later fullback An­thony Johnson fell on a Miami on-side kick attempt to help preserve Notre Dame's 31-30 upset of the Hurricanes Saturday in Notre Dame Stadium. 
These two final big plays were just the last of many in a game that ended Miami's im­pressive regular-season winning streak at 36 games. 
"I wo~ld like to give Notre Dame credit," said Miami coach Jimmy Johnson. "They did what they had to do to win the game. As many mistakes as we made, and we made a ton, in my mind we should have ·won." 
Oct. 16, 1988 Grand Rapids Press 
All the hype came down to three hours of football, and three hours of football came down to one play with 45 seconds left on the clock. 
And when Steve Walsh's pass· came down in the end zone, down with it fell Miami's 36­game regular-season winning streak, No. 1 ranking and recent dominance of Notre Dame football. 
The Notre Dame student body came down as well, rushing onto the field to celebrate the 31-30 victory that gave birth to hopes of the next Irish national championship, and pushed Lou Holtz' squad to No. 2 in the nation . 
. "This was a win by the Notre Dame spirit," said Holtz after the Oct. 15 contest that boost­ed the Irish to 6-0 and ended the frustration of humbling Notre Dame losses to the Hurri­canes in 1985 (58-7) and 1987 (24-0). 
"It was a win by the spirit of a group of guys who refused to fold," Holtz continued. "The spirit of Notre Dame was something we talked about all week and I congratulate our players .. .lt was a great game by two great teams who just competed as hard as anything I've ever seen." 
Jan. 19, 1989 The Observer 


The Matchup: #4 Notre Dame (5-0) vs. #1 Miami (4-0), October 15 in Notre Dame Stadium. 
The Holtz Pre-game Quote: "My son, Skip, is a graduate assistant coach at Florida State. After Miami beat Florida State in their first game, he told me, 'Dad, Miami is unbelievable.' I have eve­ry reason to believe what he said, be­cause we always taught our children not to lie." 
The Angle, Part I: Notre Dame had plenty to play for. The Irish had lost their last four games to Miami by a cumu­lative 133-20 count.-including a 58-7 disaster in '85. Notre Dame had been shut out only twice in its last 119 games -both times by Miami, in '83 (20-0) and '87 (24-0). 
The Angle, Part II: Notre Dame, a team that historically has been at its best against top-ranked, unbeaten teams with impressive streaks, was facing a Miami team that had won 36 straight regular­season games. 
The Angle, Part III: Notre Dame was meeting a number-one team for the 20th time in history, the sixth time in Notre Dame Stadium history, but only the first time at home since 1968. It marked the first time the Irish had started a season 5­0 or better and played another unbeaten opponent in Notre Dame Stadium since a 14-13 win over Iowa-Pre Flight in 1943. 
The Irony: Miami ended up losing in part to a missed two-point conversion at­tempt, exactly the same way the Hurri­canes had beaten Florida State in '87 (the Seminoles missed it) and had beaten Ne~ braska for the national title in '85 (the Huskers missed it). 
The Question: Had the Irish im­proved enough from a year ago -con­sidering a 24-0 Hurricane win in Notre Danie's '87 regular-season final~ -to play with the nation's top-rated team? 
The Answer: Not only did Notre Dame play with Miami, but the Irish also administered the sole defeat suffered by the 'Canes in the last two years. 
Notre ' Dame got touchdowns from Pat Eilers (two-yard run) and Braxston Banks (nine-yard pass). 

Notre Dame vs. Miami 

:I 
I 
Two of Notre Dame's big play men were Pat Terrell (#15) and Frank Stams (#30). Terrell picked off a Steve Walsh pass and returned it 60 yards for a touchdown. Stams forced two Walsh fumbles and re­
covered another. 


The Hero: All of Lou Holtz's fingers and toes weren't enough to count all of them. 
11 Frank Starns, the veteran defensive end who forced two Steve Walsh fum­bles, recovered another, tipped a Walsh pass that Pat Terrell ran back for a score and generally made life difficult for Mi­ami's standout quarterback. He was named Associated Press' Midwest defen­sive player of the week. He played a key role in limiting Miami to 57 net rushing yards and only two rushing first downs. 
11 Terrell, who not only ran back that interception 60 yards for six points, but also knocked down the potential game­winning two-point conversion throw by Walsh in the final minute. Walsh'.s 424 passing yards marked the most ever given up by a Notre Dame defense. 
11 Tony Rice, who threw for a career­high 195 yards, ran .21 times and scored the first Irish touchdown. 
11 Others like Pat Eilers, who scored his first career TD on only his fifth career carry; Derek Brown, who made two crit­ical catches deep in Irish territory; } Raghib Ismail, whose 57-yard catch set up the second Irish TD; Ricky Watters, whose only catch of the day, a 44-yard­er, set up Eilers' score; Wes Pritchett, who had 15 tackles despite playing with a broken hand. 
The Unsung Hero: The Notre Dame 
spirit, which Lou Holtz said accounted 
for the key victory; . 
The Key Move: Miami faked a punt on fourth down midway through the third period with the score tied, but Steve Belles smelled it out and made the tackle on fourth-and-three. Tony Rice threw long to Ricky Watters on the next play, Eilers scored from two yards out, and the Irish never trailed again. 
The Controversy: With the Irish lead­ing, 31-24, with seven minutes left, Steve Walsh threw to Cleveland Gary. Gary took the ball to the one before being hit by George Streeter, fumbling and watch­ing Michael Stonebreaker recover the loose ball. The officials gave Notre Dame the football; Miami coach Jimmy Johnson said Gary scored before the fumble. Either way, the 'Canes hurt themsevles with sev­en turnovers and Irish coach Lou Holtz pointed to several other controversial calls on potential turnovers, all of which went Miami's way. 
The Lineup: One-time walk-on Mike Brennan, formerly a tight end and offen­sive tackle, moved to guard this week and·ended up starting his first game with Tim Grunhard and Tim Ryan hobbled by injuries. Others making their first starts vs. the 'Canes were sophomore guardJoe Allen, freshman split end Raghib Ismail and freshman· defensive end Arnold Ale, whose interception the previous week vs. Pitt sealed that victory. 
The Holtz Post-game Quote: ''This was a great football game. It was two great teams that competed as hard as any­thing I've seen. Usually when you have a game with this much hype, it disappoints you, but not today. This was a win by a bunch of guys who refused to fold.''

What they said... 
There never was a question that all the size and strength was in Notre Dame's corner. But the package wasn't complete until the emotion kicked in. 
That happened at halftime, Saturday. The rest of the afternoon in damp Notre Dame Stadium then belonged to the Irish in a 41-13 victory over Air Force. 
With the Irish battling to a 20-13 halftime lead, the coaching staff had a few adjustments to make and the seniors a few words to say. 
And the second half was a different story. 
Allowing the riation 's No. 1 rushing offense a mere 39-yards in the s~cond half, No. 2 Notre Dame bagged its seventh straight victo­ry and saddled the Falcons with their lowest point production since their last game of 1986 against BYU. 
Oct. 23, 1988 South Bend Tribune 
Notre Dame middle linebacker Wes Prit­
chett took a few minutes at halftime to scream 
and the rest of the Fighting Irish defenders 
wisely listened. 
Pritchett and his listeners then limited the 
Air Force Falcons' highly-regarded wishbone 
offense to 29 yards rushing in the second half, 
and that more than anything assured the Irish 
of a convincing 41-13 win in Notre Dame 
Stadium Saturday. 
.."We fought for our lives in the first half, 
but I thought in the second half that we domi­
nated the game," said Notre Dame Coach Lou 
Holtz, who saw his No. 2-ranked team out­
score Air Force, 21-0, over the final two 
quarters and win for the seventh time in seven 
starts this year. 
41--13 
"I don't think it was a case of us wearing them down at all, because they are in marvel­ous condition," Holtz continued. "We were just bigger and stronger than them, and we were just too strong for them in the second half." 
Oct. 23, 1988 Grand Rapids Press 
The post-Miami letdown that everyone feared seemed eerily close to reality when Air Force was thinking upset and trailing Notre Dame by just a touchdown at halftime. 
Unfortunately for the Falcons, the Irish weren't thinking upset at all. Notre Dame outscored Air Force 21-0 in the second half to win 41-13 and improve its record to 7-0. 
"I thought that in the second half we domi­nated the game," said Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz. "We fought for our lives in the first half. At halftime, this was a real football game." 
Air Force (5-3) cut Notre Dame's halftime lead to 20-13 with a three-yard run by Andy Smith with 1:57 left in the second quarter. 
"We had to go back out there in the second 
half and make something happen," said Air 
Force coach Fisher DeBerry. "If we could 
have stopped them and gotten the football, it 
would have given our team the confidence and 
momentum it needed." 
Instead, Notre Dame methodically drove to 
the Air Force 42-yard line, where Tony Brooks 
took a screen pass and raced down the left 
sideline for a touchdown. Reggie Ho's ensuing 
extra point gave Notre Dame a 27-13 lead. 
Jan. 19, 1989 The Observer 


Notre Dame vs. Air Force 

The Matchup: #2 Notre Dame (6-0) vs. Air Force (5-2), October 22 in Notre Dame Stadium. · 
The Holtz Pre-game Quote: "Are we in contention for the national champion­ship? I don't believe we have a chance to win a national championship with six victories. All we've done so far is guaran­tee ourselves a winning seaso'n.'' 
The Angle: Notre Dame's defense had to shift gears dramatically in a week's · time -going from the Miami passing at­tack to the Air Force wishbone that aver­aged 432.0 rushing yards per game to lead the nation. 
The Question: Could the Irish come down off their cloud in time to rejoin re­ality and handle Air Force? 
The Answer: An intangible that prob­ably helped was that the Notre Dame stu­dents were on fall break, so there weren't many people around to pat the players on the back and tell them how great they were. The Irish got serious in the second half and rolled from a 20-13 halftime lead to an easy 41-13 triumph. 
The Irony: Air Force came in with the impressive ground-gaining stats and rankings, but it was Notre Dame that dominated the rushing column. The Irish rolled up 267 rushing yards while the Falcons managed only 170, including just 44 from dangerous quarterback Dee Dowis. No Falcon player: gained more than 46 net yards rushing. 
The Hero, Part 1: Notre Dame's de­fense held Air Force to only 48 net yards in the second half after a lackluster first half. . 
The Hero, Part II: Flanker Ricky Wat­ters looked as comfortable at that position as he did all year, catching four passes, including TD grabs of 50 and 28 yards. 
The Speeches: Several Irish seniors made impassioned comments in the lock­er room at halftime, and Notre Dame ­without doubt -played with more emo-. tion after the break. 
The Record: With Joe Theismann watching from the press box, Irish quar­terback Tony Rice became the most pro­ductive single-season rushing quarter­back in a Notre Dame uniform breaking Theismann's 1970 record of 
384. . 

The Key Move: Notre Dame took control with a momentum-grabbing 81­yard drive to start the second half that produced a 27-13 advantage following a 42-yard scoring pass from Tony Rice to Tony Brooks. 
The Holtz Post-game Quote: "We won the football game and that's what we wanted. I thought we dominated the second half. We fought for our lives in the first half. At halftime, this was a real football game. But I was impressed by our team the second half.'' 
Notre Dame's defense, featuring Pat Terrell (#15) and Stan Smaga­la (#29), put the hurt on Air Force's potent rushing attack.

Notre Dame vs. Navy 




The Matchup: #2 Notre Dame (7-0) vs. Navy (3-4), October 29 in Memorial Stadium, Baltimore, Md. 
The Holtz Pre-game Quote: "I don't expect our team to be flat this week or any week. We scrimmaged hard for two hours every other day last spring and the intensity was tremendous. There weren't many people in the stands, but they really went after it. I told them, 'Man, if you're going to do it like that in the spring, you've got to do it when the tele­vision lights are on and the fans are in the stands.' That's why I'ni never con­cerned about us not playing hard.'' 
The Angle: Notre Dame was trying to move to 8-0 for the first time since 1973 when the Irish went 11-0 and won the national championship. 
The Question: Could the Irish prevail despite a drawn-out travel day in which Notre Dame's flight to Baltimore was postponed twice and dido't permit the team to arrive at its hotel until after 
11:00 p.m.? · 

The Answer: Notre Dame was spo­radic offensively, but the defense held tight when it counted in allowing just 192 total yards and the Irish escaped with the win. 
The Irony: Though it probably was Notre Dame's leasi impressive outing of the season, it was good enough to move the Irish to the top of the polls after UCLA's 34-30 loss to Washington State. 
The Hero: Once again, ~ake it the Irish defense which permitted only one pass completion, didn't give up a first down to the Middies until the second period and held Navy to two first downs and 46 total yards in the opening half. 
The Frustrations: Notre Dame never got its offense in gear, thanks to two lost fumbles, 90 yards in penalties, a missed PAT, a 10-yard punt that set up Navy's only TD and several dropped passes. 
The Key Move: Navy almost fought its way back into the contest in the sec­ond half. With the score 22-7, Navy ran on fourth down and two from the Irish 32 with seven minutes left. After a lengthy measurement, the ball went back to Notre Dame on downs and the Irish held on for the victory. 
The Holtz Post-game Quote: "We're not a very good football team right now. Offensively, they whipped us up front. We were not mentally alert and that's no one's responsibility but mine."

The Irish defensive front limited Navy to 192 yards of total of­fense and only 10 first downs.

Pete Graham was one of four Notre Dame quarterbacks to see action in the 54-11 win over Rice. 


Gatne 9 
What they.said... 
Notre Dame's freshman split end Raghib Is­mail is called "the Rocket," partly because of his 4.28 speed in the 40-yard dash and partly because his first name is difficult to pro­nounce. 
In Notre Dame's 54-11 cooking of Rice, Is­mail showed off his speed with two touch­down kickoff returns and showed the Owls that no matter how hard it is to say his name (it's pronounced Ra-GIB), it's even tougher to catch him from behind. · 
"I have to give credit where credit is due, and none of it goes to me," said Ismail, whose brother Qadry plays for Syracuse. "The whole key to the returns was getting through the first line of blocking, and nobody got a

clean shot at me. That is good. blocking. I returned kickoffs in high school, but I get all my confidence from the blocking the kick re­turn team gives me." 
The first return, which went 83 yards and was keyed by a Steve Belles block, followed a Rice 70-yard opening drive that ended with a Clint Parsons' 23-yard field goal. The 3-0 Rice lead lasted all of 13 seconds. 
"He (Ismail) hit it good," said Rice coach Jerry Berndt, who would see his team finish the season 0-11. "We made two crucial mis­takes. We had a couple of guys out of lanes. But as soon as he hit it, I knew he had a touchdown." 
Nov. 6, 1988 The Observer 
Notre Dame made short work of its con­cerns. 
One week after playing well below their par at Navy, the Irish were on their game and all over Rice,-54-11. 
On a dismal day, a damp crowd of 59,075 watched the 9-0 Irish make their shiny new No. 1 ranking look like a perfect fit. 
"It was the type a week that scared me to death," remarked head coach Lou Holtz in the post-game conference. "I think the players could sense that. Watching them (0-8 Rice) on film, I am in shock. Ifyou told me that would be the score, I would have never believed that. I think we were a little too strong for them overall and we were ready to play, I'll say that." 
In the last five games, particularly on the 
road, the Southwest Conference member had 
been competitive and given a good account of 
itself. Saturday, they were way out of their 
league. 
But the Owls did lead, 3-0, aft~r their first 
possession. That lasted about 13 seconds. 
Freshman Raghib Ismail (they call him 
"Rocket") caught the ensuing kickoff at the 
13 and, breaking up the right side, shed a cou­

The Matchup: #I Notre Dame (8-0) vs. Rice (0-7), November 5 in Notre Dame Stadium. 
The Holtz Pre-game Quote, Part 1: "I'm not really concerned about where we're ranked. If you win enough games, the polls and the bowls take care of themselves. People ask me about being ranked here or there and all I want to know is, are they going to vote again? If they're going to vote again, I'm not really worried about the rankings this time. If this is the last poll, then I'm in­terested.'' 
The Holtz Pre-game Quote, Part II: ''Rice scares me to death.'' 
The Angle: Notre Dame brought the number-one ranking into its own stadi­um for the first time since 1970 and ranked atop the polls for the first time since 1981. 
The Irony: Notre Dame's first oppo­nent as the top-ranked team is a team with the nation's longest losing streak. 
The Question: How would the Irish respond to the pressure of being number one? 
The Answer: Notre Dame responded by scoring on five of its six first-half pos­sessions for a 31-6 lead at the break. The one time the Irish didn't score came when they lost a fumble at the Rice 20. Two plays later, Jeff Aim intercepted a Rice pass and Notre Dame needed just three plays to travel 18 yards to the goal line. 


The Hero: Raghib Ismail tied an NCAA record by returning two kickoffs for touchdowns -once after the Owls had moved 70 yards downfield for a field goal on the opening possession and once early in the final period after another Rice field goal. 
The Unsung Hero: Going up against all-star center Courtney Hall, Irish nose tackle Chris Zorich managed nine tack­les, one sack and two tackles for lost yardage. He played a key role in holding Rice to mi1:1us-three rushing yards in the second half. . The Holtz Post-game Quote: "I am in shock. Ifyou had told me this was go­ing to be the score, I wouldn't have be­lieved you. But we were ready to play and we were just a little too strong for them overall. I'd like to keep going after a game like this, but we've got an open . date and we have to take it.''

Game 10 21--3 
What they said... 
By killing off one more long-standing debt 
Saturday afternoon, Notre Dame kept all the 
intrigue alive. 
Nemesis Penn State fell in its path, 21-3, 
while No. 2 Southern California waits six 
days ahead. 
The showdown of the season, the big one, 
No. 1 vs. No. 2, is all set and ready to go 
after the Irish shaved the Nittany Lions for the 
first time since 1984. Meanwhile, USC pol­
ished off UCLA, 31-22. 
"Ever since I've been here I've dreamed 
about this:' Notre Dame tackle Andy Heck 
said after Notre Dame's lOth straight victory 
and 12th straight in Notre Dame Stadium. 
"We're No. 1 and 10-0 going into the last 
game against our greatest rival -I couldn't 
ask. for more. Maybe it will be the game of 
the century." 
Nov. 20; 1988 South Bend Tribune 
Revenge might be sweet, but nobody said it 
had to be fair. 
Against Penn State it wasn't, as Notre 
Dame took out the frustration of three straight 
losses to strong Penn State teams on a rare 
weak one. The Irish totaled 502 yards and 
powered to a 21-3 victory in their last home 
game of the year. 
The win was the first over Penn State for 
Notre Dame's seniors and sent Nittany Lions 
coach Joe Paterno home with his first losing 
season (5-6) in 23 years at the helm. 
"I just feel great for the seniors and the 
things we've done," said Irish senior tailback 
Mark Green, who scored on a 22-yard run in 
the second quarter. "It's great to go out with 
a bang and finally beat Penn State. We've 
never beaten them before." 
The Irish not only beat the Nittany Lions ­
they nearly blanked them. Penn State scored ·its only points on Eric Etze's 52-yard field goai on the last play of the first half. The at­


tempt was made possible only after Notre snared an interception.

Notre Dame vs. Penn State 
I! 


The Matchup: #I Notre Dame (9-0) vs. Penn State (5-5), November 19 in No-. . tre Dame Stadium. 
The Holtz Pre-game Quote: "This is new for me because I've never been number one before. You're not talking to Knute Rockne or Ara (Parseghian) orJim­my Johnson. They've been there. I'm the guy who's usually looking at it from the tilted side of the field. I would like to get to the point that everybody says, ho­hum, we're number one and it's no big deal. I'd like to be number one and have nobody here even know it.'' 
The Angle, Part 1: Penn State had to 
defeat the Irish to avoid its first losing 
season in 50 years. 

The Angle, Part II: Notre Dame was attempting to end its home season un­beaten for the second straight year and move its homefield winning streak to 12, the longest since a 28-gamer that cov­ered the 1942-50. seasons. 
The Question: Can the Irish prevail 
against a Penn State team that has beaten 
them six times in seven attempts since 
the series was renewed in-1981? 

The Answer: The score doesn't show 
it, but Notre Dame dominates with 502 
total yards -while limiting the Nittany 
Lions to 105 rushing yards and only five 
pass completions in 24 attempts. Penn 
State keeps it respectable because of a 
missed field goal and three Irish turn­
overs deep in Nittany Lion territory. 

The Irony: A couple of Pennsylva­
nians -Raghib Ismail from Wilkes-Barre 
and Ricky Watters from Harrisburg ­
each put nails in the Penn State coffin. 
Ismail catches a 67-yard bomb from Tony 
Rice for the final Irishpoints. Watters en­
joys one of his better receiving days with 
four grabs for 71 yards. 

The Hero: Tony Rice throws for 191 
yards and runs for 84 more -running 
for one score and throwing for another. 
The Unsung Hero: Defensive tackle Jeff Aim moved into the team lead for iJ:?.terceptions with his third of the year. He also forced a fumble, broke up an­other pass and had two tackles for lost yardage. 
The Key Move: Notre Dame's defense 
kept the Nittany Lions on their own side 
of midfield for the entire. second half, other than one possession when Penn State got as far as the Irish 38 before mis­firing·on a pass ,out of punt formation on fourth-and-12. 

The Spoils: Notre Dame's victory earned the Irish an invitation to the Fies­ta Bowl to face unbeaten West Virginia. 
The Holtz Post-game Quote: "I'm happy for the football team. Other than penalties, turnovers and the kicking game, they played outstanding. I'm hap­py for the seniors. They're going out of here not having lost at home in two years."

Notre Dame vs.·USC 





From deep in his own territory, Tony Rice hooked with Raghib Ismail for a 55-yard pass play on the first Irish play from scrim­mage. 




Game 11 
What they said... 
The Fighting Irish of Notre Dame are not necessarily dominant or stylish at all times, but they manage to win all the pme. 
Showing a blitz-filled defense for the first time this year, and shaking opportunity's hand when it knocked with fumbles and inter­ceptions, the No. 1 Fighting Irish finished the regular season a perfect 11-0 with a 27-10 win over No. 2 USC Saturday before 93,829 fans in the Los Angeles Coliseum. 
"We blitzed more than we have in the past, and we were opportunistic and scored when Southern Cal made turnovers," offered Irish Coach Lou Holtz, whose team can probably lock up the national championship with a win over West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl. 
"It wasn't all that pretty. In fact, I tell the team that the only thing they were prettier than is me, and that's not saying much. We just did what we had to do to win." Nov. 27, 1988 .Grand Rapids Press 
Since when does Oklahoma take a back seat to Notre Dame on the option play? 
Since Saturday, of course. USC stopped the Sooners, famed runners of the wishbone, ear­ly this season. USC didn't stop Notre Dame. 
The Fighting Irish used their option to rush for 162 yards in their 27-10 victory over USC at the Coliseum. The Trojans hadn't allowed that ·many rushing yards since the Arizona game seven weeks ago, or that many points since the Washington game five weeks ago. 
"With Oklahoma,' Washington, Arizona, I came up to make someone ou~side take me," 
27--10 

USC cornerback Ernest Spears said. "But (the Irish) had everyone covered. It was about as· good as Arizona's. Those two stick out in 
, my mind." Nov. 27, 1988 Orange. County Register · 
The team that was "a year away" put itself 60 minutes away from the 1988 national championship against USC. 
Notre Dame cashed in on numerous South­ern Cal mistakes and toppled the Trojans 27­. 10 in the Los Angeles Coliseum to finish the 
regular season. 
The way the Irish defense pressured South­ern Cal quarterback ·Rodney Peete had to make the Reisman Trophy candidate long for the days of measles and laryngitis, which slowed, but did not stop Peete over the two weeks prior to the Notre Dame game. 
Jan. 19, 1989 The Observer 
In the most important game of the season and, for that matter, one of the most signifi­cant in any season, USC made just enough errors to help Notre Dame retain its No. 1 college football ranking. 
Clearly, though, Notre Dame was the better team Saturday at the Coliseum, winning 27-10 before a crowd of 93,829. 
The Irish beat the Trojans on big plays, a 65-yard touchdown run by quarterback Tony Rice in the first quarter and a 64-yard inter­ception return .for a touchdown by cornerback Stan Smagala in the second quarter. 
Nov. 27, 1988 Los Angeles Times 

The Matchup: #1 Notre Dame (10-0) vs. #2 USC (10-0), November 25 in Los Angeles Coliseum, Los Angeles, Calif. 
The Holtz Pre-game Quote: "This isn't the end of the journey. We haven't accomplished anything yet. All we've done is put ourselves in position to do something big. We're 10-0, but this isn't where we want to end.'' 
The Angle, Part I: Despite the huge accomplishments of both programs, this marks the first time Notre Dame and USC have faced each other with perfect rec­ords. The only times both teams were unbeaten were 1947 (Notre Dame #1 at 8-0, USC 7-0-I) and I973 (Notre Dame 5­0, usc 5-0-I). 
The ·Angle, Part II: This marks the 24th time in the history of the Associated Press poll that the two top-ranked teams have met. Notre Dame was involved in six of the previous 23, going 2-0-I as #I and 0-2-I as #2. Notre Dame had not won a #I vs. #2 battle since doing it twice in I943. · 
The Question: Could the Irish deal with the Trojans' I4-game winning streak (longest in the country), an of­fense averaging 472.I yards per game led by Reisman Trophy candidate Rodney Peete and a defense leading the nation by allowing only 68.I rushing yards per game? 
The Answer: Notre Dame prevailed by gambling with one-on-one coverage of the Trojan receivers so it could put ex­tra pressure on Rodney Peete. The Irish sacked him three times, forced four first­half turnovers and held USC to I 0. points. 
The Irony, Part I: Notre Dame tri­umphed despite only eight first downs, despite being outgained by more than I 00 yards and despite going· the entire second period and the first I4 minutes of the third without a first down. 
The Irony, Part II: Notre Dame tri­umphed despite suspending its leading rusher (Tony Brooks) and leading receiv­er (Ricky Watters) before the game. 
The Hero: They were the Irish big­play people -Tony Rice_ for his 65-yard option run, Stan Smagala for his 64-yard interception return, native Californian Mark Green for his two touchdowns and defensive end Frank Starns for his nine tackles, two-and-a-half sacks and fumble recovery. 

The Unsung Hero: Fullback Anthony johnson made two critical plays on No­tre Dame's final scoring drive. On third­and-three from midfield, he hulled off tackle for IO yards. Then, on third-and­six from the USC 36, he took a screen pass through the right side for 23 yards. 
The Sting: Notre Dame set the tone for the contest when Tony Rice threw a 55-yard bomb to Raghib Ismail on the first Irish play from· scimmage after a USC punt had backed the visitors to their two. 
The Key Move: USC had a big chance to get back into the game late in the third period, starting with a first and goal from the Irish four with Notre Dame leading 20-7. The Irish defense made two critical stops of Aaron Emanuel, and then a pro­cedure penalty vs. the Trojans forced them to settle for a field goal. Notre Dame then launched its 70-yard drive for the clinching score. 
The Holtz Post-game Quote: "I think this team is underrated, even though we're number one. I've read ar­ticles people have sent me saying we were lucky against this team or that team. Our football team is prettier than I am, but that's about it. They don't play pretty all the time, but they sure play to­gether as a team. I said to my wife on Thesday that God works in strange ways. He's managed to expire my enthusiasm and energy at the same time as our sea­son. I'm completely beat right now. I have absolutely no emotion. BU:t I'm thrilled for our players.'' 
Chris Zorich found his way into the USC backfield on many oc­casions. 
65 


Rodney Peete and the USC offense became very familiar with the Notre Dame defensive unit. 
66 
Mark Green's one­yard TD dive in the fourth quarter gave the Irish the final mar­gin ofvictory, 27-10.

Game 12 
What they said... 
· Enough of the blarney. 
Monday's Fiesta Bowl provided, with strik­
ing clarity, two indisputable fac:;ts that can­
celed out much of the fiction surrounding this 
match up. 
First, Notre Dame is the No. 1 team in the .land. Case closed. 
Secondly, Mountaineers coach Don Nehlen 
was right-Lou Holtz is the biggest con art­
ist in America. 
The Irish, the worst team to ever be top­
ranked if you believed the gospel according to 
Holtz, blew away their coach's smoke screen 
as well as the third-ranked Not-Ready-For­
Prime-Time-Players, er, Mountaineers in Sun 
Devil Stadium. 
Jan. 3, 1989 Mesa Tribune/Tempe Daily News Tribune/Chandler Arizonan Tribune 
Controversy aside. Really, way aside. Outta 
here. No votes, no polls, no strong schedules 
and weak opponents. As darkness fell on the 
Arizona desert last night, the only question 
left about rank was where this Notre Dame 
team falls into line with the 10 national cham­
pions that preceded it through South Bend. 
The Irish (12-0) splashed the final stokes on 
both a title and a resurrection by beating West 
Virginia, 34-21, in the Fiesta Bowl. Notre 
Dame was both artistic and brutal, as it was 
through a perfect regular season, sprouting 
big plays from a mechanical offense and a 
rancorous defense that often didn't stop at the 
whistle but always stopped West Virginia. 
"They absolutely. stuffed us," West Virgin­
ia's center Kevin Koken said. "We believed 
all year that we were the best offensive line 
34--21 
in the country, and they shut us down. Notre Dame's a great team: they showed us that to­day." 
Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz, who in three years has restored Notre Dame to its glory but has resisted praising this team for four months, said, "When you're 12-0, it's (not important) whether this is a great football team. It is because nobody proved it wasn't." Jan. 3, 1989 Newsday 
West Virginia coach Don Nehlen looked at the Notre Dame game films in preparation for the Fiesta Bowl and didn't discover until it was too late, what movie buffs have known for a long time: in Hollywood, you can make time stand still. 
Nehlen clearly understood how the unde­feated Irish had physically whipped their first 11 opponents coming into the national cham­pionship game. But what the Mountaineer coach still can't believe is how much faster they are in real life. 
Talk all you want about Knute Rockne and George Gipp and the Notre Dame mystique. Despite what Lou Holtz would have anyone believe, Notre Dame won its first National Championship since 1977 because it has the fastest team in college football. 
"Notre Dame's films weren't shot real fast, but when you play them, they run like deer,". Nehlen said. "Maybe it's because they played a lot on the grass, but when you're studying the films, you think they can't run like they do. But they can run like the devil."· 
Jan. 4, 1989 New York Post 



The Matchup: #1 Notre Dame (11-0) vs. #3 West Virginia (11-0), January 2 in the Fiesta Bowl in Sun Devil Stadium, Tempe, Ariz. . 
The Holtz Pre-game Quote: ''This game is what college football is all about. It should·be a fun week for everyone in­volved. All we've tried to do is be the best team in the· stadium on each Satur­day. That's all we have to do this time. There's no burden of playing for the na­tional championship. All we have to do is be better than West Virginia.H 
The Angle, Part 1: Notre Dame is in a position to win its first national title in 11 years after becoming the first Irish team ever to win 11 regular-season 
games. 

The Angle, Part II: This marks the 13th time in history that two undefeated, untied teams have met in a bowl game. It has happened each of the last two years, including the Fiesta Bowl in '86 between Miami and Penn State. Notre Dame's on­ly previous involvement in a game of teams with perfect records came in its '73 Sugar Bowl win over Alabama. 
The Question: Can the youthful Irish deal with a team loaded with 24 fifth­year seniors, a team that has never trailed the entire season, a team that dominated the two common opponents (Pitt and Penn State) far more impressively than Notre Dame, a team thatJoe Paterno said was the most impressive offensive unit he'd ever seen? 
The Answer: Notre Dame did it with a physical defensive effort that kept West Virginia out of the first down column un­til after the Irish established a 16-0 ·lead. They did it with a dominating ground game that forced the Mountaineers de­fense to commit to the run threat -ena­bling Tony Rice to take full advantage of the man-to-man pass coverage for a ca­reer-high 213 passing yards. 
The Irony: West Virginia never had an opposing quarterback finish a game against them in '88. Yet, it was Mountain­eer quarterback Major Harris who· suf­fered a shoulder bruise early in the con­test and eventually gave way to backup Greg James for the final West Virginia scoring drive. 
The Hero, Part I: . Tony Rice played spectacularly, completing seven-of-11 passes for an average of better than 30 yards-per-completion. He also led all .rushers with 75 yards. Rice seldom was the heralded signal-caller in duals with better-known quarterbacks like Steve Walsh, Rodney Peete and Major Harris­all finalists in the Reisman Trophy voting -yet Rice won all three battles. 
The Hero, Part II: Frank Starns once again displayed his ability to be at his best in the big games, as he had a pair of sacks that helped him earn the defensive MVP award. 
The Unsung Hero: Inside linebacker Ned Bolcar stepped in and played most of the way after Michael Stonebreaker suffered an Achilles tendon injury early in the first period. 
The Key Move: West Virginia had a chance to get back in the game late in the third period with the score 26-13 after a Tony Rice interception set up the Moun­taineers at the Irish 26. But Flash Gordon stopped Major Harris for a loss of two, Stan Smagala made a superb deflection in the end zone and Frank Stanis and Arnold Ale combined on a sack of Harris that took West Virginia completely out of field goal range. 
The Holtz Post-game Quote, Part I: ''This team will go down as a great foot-. ball team because nobody proved other­wise.'' 
The Holtz Post-game Quote, Part 
II: "I did say that Tony Rice's passing had improved this week in practice.'' 
Ready for battle.

Head Coach Lou Holtz

Head Coach 


What they said about Holtz... 
The flaxen blonde bangs harmlessly fall short of the wire-rimmed glasses and the wrinkled ·face. When he smiles, an elfish smile, you'd almost be tempted to call him cute. 
His figure is unimposing. ·As he carries his brittle frame about you wouldn't be surprised to see him crumble on the spot. 
A football coach? This. guy? This little Dutch Boy of a man? The concept of him mo­tivating 270-pound behemoths, much less commanding their respect seems far-fetched, a joke. 
Maybe, just maybe, you could see him as a trainer, taping ankles and inspecting twisted knees. Or maybe an equipment manager. "What's that,' your helmet cracked?/' he would say, staring up at a gi­ant obligingly. 
"No problem, I'll go fetch another." 

But a head coach? Of the most tradition­laden team in the entire sports universe? You must be joking. · 
"I'm not very impressive," says Lou Holtz, who jokes often, but is most serious about his job as football coach of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. 
Dec. 4, 1988 Spartanburg Herald 

Holtz desribes himself as a very complex person, and one few people know well. 
He is private and deeply devoted to his fam­ily, friends and religon. He and his wife, Beth, have been married 27 years and have four children. His oldest son, Skip, is a grad­uate assistant (football) coach at Florida State. 
Holtz has been hailed as a great leader, a powerful motivator and a convincing recruit­er. 
His sense of humor and his Holtzisms ­"First we will be best, then we will be first" -are nationally recognized and make him a hot ticket on the dinner circuit. 
He is a football workaholic, so impatient that he sometimes runs to practice. He is a perfectionist, which sometimes leads to exhaustion. 
He survives on little or no sleep and supple­ments a steady diet of sandwiches with Zagnut candy bars. 
He said he didn't sleep for three days before last months's victory over Southern Cali for­
. Lou Holtz enjoyed 
. l1is finest season as a head coach in 1988, as the Irish captured the national title.

nia. Losing games keeps him awake nights., too. 
"I hate to lose," he said. "I can't sleep. I can't eat. When I talk about it I can't sleep. I'm talking about (not sleeping) for three or four days." Dec. 23, 1988 Indianapolis News 
It should happen late this afternoon, as the sun drops over the mountain hollow that swal­lows Sun Devil Stadium. The final seconds of the Fiesta Bowl will melt into zeroes, with Notre Dame having scored roughly 10 more points than West Virginia, and Louis Leo Holtz will be canonized on the premises as one of the legendary coaches of our time. 
A coach? ·A saint-like figure? It is not a fas~ionable projection in the country as we know it. We may be more demanding of our coaches than we are of our elected officials. 
These men are scrutinized in such micro­scopic detail, it's basically impossible for them to succeed. in our eyes. Can he disci­pline? Is he a motivator? Will the guys play for him? Can he hold his liquor? Does he know not to mix plaids and stripes? Can he tell a story, crack a joke? Can he golf? Arid, above all, can he meet the expectations of winning??? 
Floating on a cloud above the frazzled fray, Lou Holtz has answered all but one of the questions -he can't golf-with a polite nod of his Little Dutch Boy face. Most remark­ably, he has done so in the hottest seat in American athletics, in the cauldron of college football's most sacred icon: Notre Dame. Three years ago last month, Holtz inherited the ashes left by the incapable Gerry Faust. ''We were a lot of underachieving lunkheads who had no regard for discipline," said defen­sive end Frank Starns, a Faust recruit. "We needed direction." 
In a fascinating turnaround that has inspired considerable national attention, Holtz quickly has awakened the echoes, restored pride to Touchdown Jesus, returned the glow to the Golden Dome and made it great fun again to "Cheer, cheer for old Notre Dame." A young team figured to be a year away from title con­tention, but Holtz challenged his players with an intense, Marine-like grab-the-facemask practice style, then peppered them with moti­vational gimmicks ranging from meditation sessions to singalongs. 
Today, they are a victory from the school's 
first national title since 1977, its first 12-0 re­cord . . . and the completion of the most im­pressive football coaching performances since the Lombardi days. Jan. 2, 1989 Rocky Mountain News 
Holtz doesn't look like a legendary figure. He is a skinny, unimposing man with steel­rimmed glasses and blond hair combed down over his forehead. He pokes fun at himself at every opportunity. "Look at me," he is fa­mous for saying. "I'm 5-10, I weigh 150 pounds, I talk with a lisp, I look like I have scurvy, I'm not very smart, I was a terrible football player, and I graduated 234th in a high school clas.s of 27?." 
Make no mistake, though, Lou Holtz is a legend at Notre Dame. In just three years, he has brought the Irish to the brink of their first national championship since 1977. He has drawn striking comparisons to Notre Dame 


Head Coach 

immortals Knute Rockne, Frank Leahy and 
Ara Parseghian. 
"You can feel what he's done just by being on campus on game day," Parseghian said. "He's brought back the electricity. I tailgated before the Miami game and you couldn't be­lieve how it felt. It's the way everybody thinks it should be around here. But I've told him he's created a monster. Now, even one loss will be a letdown." 
Jan. 2, 1989 Philadelphia Daily News 
Lou Holtz is going to jump out of an air­plane. He's going to take one step forward and then drop several thousand feet down. 
At age 51, the Notre Dame football coach plans to go skydiving. 
"I just think it would be a great thrill," Holtz said. "The amazing thing is, I can't get anyone to do it with me." 
Make . no mistake, Holtz is serious. He planned the expedition more than 20 years ago, shortly after he· got fired as an assistant coach at South Carolina. 
It was one of the low points in Holtz's life. He had little in the bank and his wife, Beth, was eight months . pregnant with the couple's third child. So, as he came to one of life's crossroads, he sat down at the table and wrote down a list of goals. 
The 28-year-old unemployed coach came up with 107 wishes, from personal to profes­sional to just plain fun. He says he's accom­plished 84 of them, including sitting next to Johnny Carson, seeing the Pope, and eating at the White House. He has learned magic · tricks, recorded a hole-in-one, and landed on an aircraft carrier. 
Now he wants to go skydiving. 

"I've always said this would be one of the last goals," Holtz said. "I hope it's not the last one." 
That Holtz even wants to try such a stunt reveals much about the man. It all has to do with his philosophy of life and how he got to where he is today. 
"Here's my theory," Holtz explained. "How many times do you watch an airplane land on an aircraft carrier on television? Or watch the President at the White House? Or see the Pope in the Vatican? You watch those things, but why not go do it? Experience those things. Don't be a spectator in life, be a participant. 
· "You see people dropping out of planes all the time. If you did it once, every time you saw a skydiver, it would bring back the thrill and excitement of that experience. That's why I put all those things down. To be a partici­pant in life." 
Holtz then paused and laughed. "Who knows? I might jump Jan. 3. Without a chute." Dec. 25, 1988 Chicago Tribune 
The blue leather chair sits behind a pol­ished desk littered with trinkets of a family man and football coach. 
The chair is what bothers Lou Holtz, the football coach. The . school is what delights Lou Holtz, the father of four. 
On this snowy afternoon in the Midwest, he's being the football coach first. 
Ara Parseghian -he's the legend that walks around South Bend -describes the Notre Dame coaching job as a place to finish your career, not start it. 
Holtz, ari 18-year veteran of this profession, readily agrees with the Parseghian perspec­tive. And explains. · 
He talks about how none of his bosses told him he has to win. He sings the praises of ed1,1cation foremost, and touchdowns as an af­terthought. 
Then, he'll tell you he's uncomfortable, that the pressure to win eats at him. 
Holtz visits with USC quarterback Rodney Peete following the Irish 27-10 win over the Trojans. 


Head Coach 


When Notre Dame hired Lou Holtz, I knew they'd have a dynamite team.· You just didn't know if it would take one, two or three years. 
-West Virginia 
coach Don Nehlen 

Holtz pats the armrest of the blue leather chair to identify the source of his discomfort. 
"You sit in this chair, you feel the pres­sure," he says. "You sit in .this chair and you are the Notre Dame football coach. You feel responsible. You are responsible. You want to put Notre Dame football where it belongs." 
His latest resurrection job -constructed in the shadow of the school's famed "Touch­down Jesus" mosaic-has taken three years. 
Sound quick? Time to pause for a paton the back? Holtz laughs and hauls out a piece of fan mail. Scrawled on a yellow legal sheet is the · question: "What took you so long?" 
Holtz the kidder will say: "I think every Notre Dame student feels that his tuition guarantees that once in his four years that we'll play for a national championship." 
Perspective is the charm of this place to Holtz. It is a university with a football team, not the other way around. 
But he plays this game to win. 
"I'm a perfectionist," he says. "I want to see things done right. I'm a perfectionist at everything I do in life. Yes, even mowing the lawn." · 
That isn't always the easiest path to walk. · 

"You have to come to terms with things not always being done the way you want," he says. "That's not saying you have to accept it; just come to terms with it." 
Dec. 30, 1988 USA Today 
Holtz was characterized in a %11 Street Journal article Dec. 27 as a brilliant offensive strategist and a consummate motivator. 
"He'll beat you a different way every week," Arkansas athletic director Frank Broy­les told the %11 Street Journal. 
"He talks to God," Notre Dame junior quarterback Tony Rice said. On headphones, Rice was _asked. Rice gig­gled. 
"When Notre Dame hired Lou Holtz, I knew they'd have a dynamite team. You just didn't know if it would take one, two or three years," West Virginia coach Don Nehlen said. 
"When I was first being recruited, I was looking at those flashy teams with the half­shirts. Hot weather. Girls," said Watters, from Hattisburg, Pa. 
· "I was feeling like Oklahoma. They had al­ways been my team. Miami had been my team." 
But he chose Notre Dame. 
"The key factor in my coming here was Coach Lou Holtz. Knowing his record, and the way he presented himself," Watters said. 
"He can mold me. He knows when to get you relaxed. When to get you intense." Jan. 1, 1989 Arizona Daily Star · 
Guess who? "I think it will be very, very difficult for this team to rebound. "I will be shocked if we have a good year next year." . Said with a rising voice for emphasis, a hint of a lisp and the sincerity of a sermon. 
So who do you guess? 
How'd you know it was good ol' Boohoo Lou? ' 
Just minutes before his Notre Dame football team was officially named the 1988 national champion, Lou Holtz was already fretting about next season. 
He did stop short of wondering whether his '89 team with only 16 starters returning from this undefeated team, will win a single game. 
And no, he didn't even hint that he was concerned about just being able to get a first down, like Frank Leahy once did. 



But he did let it be known that next season Even the P. T. Barnum of college football is going to take some big-doings to make it realized he couldn't pull off this crying-towel successful in any shape, way or form. tale. 
Then Holtz smiled, almost sheepishly. "I know you're probably thinking, 'There He must have realized how far-fetched he goes again,' " said Holtz. "And I probably those statements sounded to a roomful of wouldn't believe it if I were you, either . . sports writers who had witnessed his team's "But dog-gone it, I feel that way. I'm

Notre Dame Coaches 





Assistant Coaches 
It was four o'clock on the afternoon of 
Wednesday, February 9, 1988. 
The molding and shaping of Notre 
Dame's 1988 football season was contin­
uing. 

Addressing his team in the Joyce Ath­
letic and Convocation Center audita­-rium, Fighting Irish head coach Lou 
Holtz filled in his players on the top­
ranked recruiting class being pencilled in 
on national letter of intent day by the 
Notre Dame staff. 
Since NCAA regulations forbid head 
coaches from going on the road on sign­
ing day, Holtz had to view the proceed­-ings from the hol_Ile front, while his assis­tants criss-crossed the nation. As the Irish players soon found out, three of those assistants would not return. 
Later that afternoon, Foge Fazio an­
nounced his departure as Notre Dame's 
defensive coordinator and inside line­
backer coach to become special teams 
coach of the Atlanta Falcons of the Na­
tional Football 'teague. He became the 
third Irish assistant in two years to 
move into the NFL, joining Mike Stock 
(to the Cincinnati Bengals) and Kurt 
Schottenheimer (to the Cleveland 
Browns). 
-Longtime Irish defensive line coach 
Joe Yonto received an invitation to join 
Notre Dame's athletic administration ­
and opted to take it after 24 seasons on 
the Irish staffs of Ara Parseghian, Dan 
Devine, Gerry Faust and Holtz. Second­
ary coach Terry Forbes decided to leave 
coaching to begin his own prep recruit­
-ing service for the state of Ohio. 
Three losses might have been a deter­
rent to a program just coming off a major 
bowl appearance and shooting for even 
loftier goats in the future. But Holtz had 
no intention of permitting staff changes 
to pose a roadblock to Irish progress. 
"I promised you we would not miss a 
beat if we ever had any changes in our 
staff," he said. "Believe me, we will hire 
the very best coaches in America and we 
will hire them quickly.'' 
So began the conception of Notre 
Dame's '88 football coaching staff. 
Holtz wasted little time elevating sec­
ond-year assistant Barry Alvarez to the 
key post of defensive coordinator. With 
Alvarez's shift from coaching the outside 
~ 

linebackers to handling the inside line­backers, every Notre Dame defensive player now was guaranteed to be work­ing with a brand new position coach. 
"You're just whistling in the dark if you think you can be an excellent foot­ball team if you're not great on defense," he said so many times. 
He also wasted little time naming the new additions to the staff. 
First, he added 36-year-old John Paler­mo, a former Florida State tight end and defensive tackle who had coached the previous four years at Minnesota. He would fill Yonto's role with the defen­sive line. 
Next, he added 35-year-old Chuck Heater, a former Michigan running back who had coached the three previous sea­sons at Ohio State. He would fill Forbes' spot in the secondary. 
Finally, he added 56-year-old Joe Moore, a former Penn State halfback who had coached the two previous sea­sons at Temple after handling Pitts­burgh's heralded offensive line for six of his nine years there. Moore would assist with the offensive tackles and tight ends, permitting Tony Yelovich to concentrate on the guards and centers. 
That also allowed George Stewart to give up his tight end duties and switch over to defense to coach the ends on Al­varez's invitation. 
One constant was Vinny Cerrato, who was starting his third year as Notre Dame's recruiting coordinator. He had s~rved in a similar capacity under Holtz at Minnesota and played a big part in the Irish recruiting success. 
There were two things that stood out immediately about this revamped unit. 
One, it was an amazingly young group. Two of the nine full-time assistants were undec30, six were under 40 and the av­erage age was 38. 
1\vo, it was a group with more than its share of Minnesota connections. Five of the nine had been with Holtz in Minneap­olis at some point -plus two others had other Big Ten connections (Alvarez at Io­wa and Heater at both Wisconsin and Ohio State). 
Holtz commonly opens his introduc­tion of his assistants by saying, ''the Bi­ble says, 'Peter died leaning on his staff.' 

The same will be said of me someday.'' phosis in '88 thanks

the Rice-to-Ismail combination became a scary one for Notre Dame opponents. 
TACKLES AND TIGHT ENDS -joe Moore's assig~ment as tackles coach was hardly an easy one: Take two people who had never played tackle before. and turn them into something. He took senior captain Andy Heck, a tight end the previous three years, and turned him into a near unanimous all­America. He took junior Dean Brown, who had been a re­serve guard, and turned him into a rochle good enough to start all 12 games. 
Only a season-end­ing broken leg kept freshman justin Hall from becoming one of the most produc­tive rookie offensive tackles the Irish have seen in recent years. 
At tight end, Moore had to replace Heck. But he could do it with two indi­viduals -sopho­more Frank jacobs and freshman Derek Brown -who had been tabbed the best high school tight ends in the country in their respective classes. jacobs began the season as the starter, though a troublesome arch in­jury limited him to only a single regular 

season catch before his scoring grab in 
the Fiesta Bowl. But Brown turned out to 
be as good as advertised. Each of his first 
two receptions went for scores and he 
finished the season with a pair of out­
standing catches versus West Virginia. 
GUARDS AND CENTERS -Notre Dame's graduation-ravaged offensive line for '88 provided Tony Yelovich with more than his share of question marks. But he put together the middle of the Irish line with nothing but underclass­men. 
With all-America Chuck Lanza gone from the center spot, the Irish spent much of the spring testing candidates to replace him. The winner turned out to be sophomore Mike Heldt, who ended up strong and consistent enough to start all 12 games. 
At guard, Yelovich at least had the bene­fit of junior Tim Grunhard, a part-time starter at the position in '87. But he also had to fill the other guard spot with new­comers -sophomore Tim Ryan, who had been a linebacker as a rookie and a center in the spring, and classmate Winston San­dri, who never played a down as a rookie. 
Things got even more complicated for the Irish with injuries to both Grunhard and Ryan in the Pittsburgh game. Depth paid off for Yelovich and the Irish as sophomore joe Allen was pressed into the starting lineup once and former walk-on Mike Brennan ended up in start­ing at guard three times, including vs. top-ranked Miami and vs. West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl. 
DEFENSIVE LINE -There were plenty of new faces here. Not just new coach John Palermo, but also sopho­mores Chris Zorich and George Williams and juniorJeff Alm, all first-year starters. 
Palermo's task was affected by three circumstances that made putting togeth­er a lineup even tougher. 
One, Zorich injured a knee the first day of spring practice and missed the rest of spring drills after not playing a down as a rookie. 
Two, senior Tom Gorman, the only re­turning regular among the defensive tackles, tore a chest muscle the first day in pads in August and ended up shifting to offense once he regained his health. 
Thr_ee, the Irish never did get a look at junior john Foley, who had been expect­ed to get a good look at tackle except for a bicep injury left over from the Cotton Bowl that sidelined him for the entire '88 season. 
-Still, Zorich and Williams added emo­tion, enthusiasm and quickness to the Irish lineup and Alm played with far more consistency than he had in the past -even leading the team in interceptions with three. 

Among the backups, the Irish enjoyed yet another success story in Mirko Jurkovic. A freshman who was expected to play on the offensive line eventually, Jurkovic was pressed into service on de­fense with Gorman hurt and Foley out. He ended up earning a monogram as Wil­liams' backup on the left side. 
DEFENSIVE ENDS -Penn State coach 

Joe Paterno knew at least one of the rea­
sonsfor Notre Dame's success in '88: 
"A year ago Frank Starns was just an­

other football player. -Now he's playing 
with character and that's one of the rea­
sons Notre Dame is where they are today." 
Under the tutelage of George Stewart, 

Starns developed into a dominant pass­
rusher and big-game player at the rush 
end slot. He also developed into a first­
team all-America after earning special 
plaudits for his play against Miami, USC 
and West Virginia. He, more that anyone, 
earned credit for the improvement in 
Notre Dame's pass rush. 
At the drop end position, Stewart got excellent mileage out of a trio of individ­uals -fifth-year senior Flash Gordon, sophomore Andre Jones and freshman Arnold Ale. The incumbent Gordon had his ups and downs but rebounded to earn back his starting role for the Fiesta BowL Jones added a good dose of athletic abili­ty with his quickness and Ale played well · enough to earn his first starting call 
against top-ranked Miami. 
LINEBACKERS -Barry Alvarez's big­

gest decision was which two of his three 
top-quality linebackers to put on the field. 
The answer turned out to be fifth-year 
senior Michael Stonebreaker, but that 
didn't mean veteran Ned Bolcar was far 
behind. 
Stonebreaker won a job the previous 

spring with Bolcar down with an ankle 
sprain from a basketball game -and he 
parlayed that opening into a stellar jun­
ior season that earned him a third-place 
finish in the Butkus Award voting for the 
nation's top linebacker. 
Pritchett, who led the '88 Irish in tack­

les, might have been one of the most un­
heralded stars anywhere in the country. 
He. and Starns so often set the tone for 
the entire Irish defense with their in­
tense, physical play. 
Bolcar, though he never started a 

game, still finished fourth overall in tack­
les while spelling both Pritchett and 
Stonebreaker. 
SECONDARY ­

Chuck Heater and the 
Irish opened the cam­
paign with a solid 
starting lineup of 
Stan Smagala and 
Todd Lyght at the 
corners and George 
Streeter and Corny 
Southall at the safe­
ties. But they re­
ceived outstanding 
season-long efforts 
from D'Juan Francis­
co and Pat Terrell as 
well. 
Combined, they played as big a role as anyone in the overall defensive improve­ment, especially against teams that threw the ball. 
Lyght earned such rave reviews that few teams threw in his di­rection on the wide side of the field. Sma­gala's surpnstng speed and quickness manifested themsel­ves in the intercep­tion return against USC that turned around the momen­tum late in the first half. Francisco, a converted tailback, proved far more con­sistent than he had been in the past, highlighted by an in­terception versus Mi­ami's Steve Walsh. 
Streeter, who ex­celled as a senior, joined Pritchett as an­other of the unsung heroes of the '88 na­tional championship effort. His sidekick, Corny Southall, gave way at free safety at midseason to Terrell. Yet, Southall's vocal leadership _made him invaluable to the Irish and Terrell's insertion paid quick dividends when he ran an interception back for six points then knocked down the late two­point conversion try against Miami. 
And that was how it all fell together for Notre Dame in 1988.

What they said about Alaniz... 
As a part of the team, Alaniz saw rel­atively little playing time until this, his senior year. He kept up his positive atti­tude and willingness to contribute to the team, accepted his assignments and im­proved. Alaniz realized that no one player has a lock on any position. 
"Ifthey ask you to block, you have to go out there and do it," Alaniz says. "If they ask you to go out there and catch a pass, then you go out there and catch a pass. Ifyou don't, somebody just as tal­ented will take your place." 


What they said about Belles... 
Alaniz's improvements and contribu­tions have not gone unnoticed by coach­es and teammates. 
Alaniz attributes his success to his competitive nature. He likes challenges and faces them. He has never-ending confidence in himself and his abilities. He quickly accepts changes, especially concerning his role on the team. 
"I've been working hard for a few years, and this year I've gotten a chance to play more," Alaniz says. "This year I've had to ~ccept my role more as a

The youngest child in the family, Belles took his share of lumps· from his older brothers. But they were also there with support, especially _his brother Mark. A coach at Glendale Community College in Arizona, Mark taught Steve the X's and O's of football. 
"I keep my brother in mind when I play," Belles says. "Mark taught me all I know about football. He was my sec­ond dad, when my dad wasn't there or didn't understand. Mark would be there. When I was a kid and had a bad day or I was down about a loss I went to Mark and pe would pick me up." 
Step-by-step, Belles worked his way through the ranks. He started out as a linebacker when he played his first or­ganized ball at the age of eight, but quickly became a quarterback. He fol­lowed the accomplishments of his boy­hood hero, Baltimore Colt quarterback Bert Jones. He copied not only his style, but also his success. Confidence and hard work followed him to St. Mary's High School, where Belles was a three­year starter and guided the team ·to the state championship in his senior year. 
Belles' appearances at quarterback have been limited. He's been called on to play tailback and he makes numerous appearances on the special teams. His willingness to switch positions and his work ethic has earned him the reputa­tion among his teammates as being the Irish's toughest player. 
"I believe that you should never give up on what you believe in," Belles says.

Alaniz's coming of age on the field is occurring simultaneously with Notre Dame's rejuvenated success. He has seen action in every game this season, which has seen the Irish climb to the top of the national poll. He earned his first start ever in the ·season opener against Michigan, a game in which he caught his first collegiate pass. Nov. 19, 1988 ND-Penn State Game Program ,. 



"Always hang in there. When things look tough, be ready for the opportuni­ty, otherwise the opportunity will pass you by. I feel like I have never done well enough.

What they said about Bolcar... 
When Ned Bolcar comes through the tunnel for a Notre Dame football game, he carries a lot more with him than his 6-2, 232-pound frame. 
The senior tri-captain carries memo­ries of the endless phon~ calls that flood his room. And that's all he needs to pump him up for 60 minutes of football on Saturday afternoon. 
"I get friends and subway alumni from home calling me up the night be­fore a game," says Bolcar, "and they're ready to cry on the phone and tell me how bad they want Notre Dame to win. They are so fired up. It's important to them in their life, so then you realize how important it should be to you and your life. We're out here playing for Notre Dame, practicing for Notre Dame and living for Notre Dame. You'd think when it came time to play the game we would care enough to get emotional enough and all excited to go out there and hit somebody." 
Hitting somebody is Bolcar's voca­tion at the linebacker spot, and with his nose for the football, he has become as difficult as a hurricane for opponents to stop. Irish defensive coordinator Barry Alvarez concurs. 
"Ned Bolcar is extremely physical and he is always around the football. All you need to say about him is that he makes plays on Saturday," says Alvarez. Oct. 7, 1988 -Tlze Observer 
Coach Lou Holtz put Bolcar on the kickoff coverage team, which seemed to be a problem area, and asked him to set the tempo in the huddle. He has and Holtz is happy with the results. 
"Coach Holtz put some of the older guys on it (kickoff coverage team), and I looked at it as just another opportunity t~ get on the field," said Bolcar. 
"I think I'm capable of getting the team fired up. I hope my presence had a little to do with it, but I think it's all 11 players." 

Football is a job, says Bolcar, but he does enjoy playing an important role in "the return of the Notre Dame mystique to the Irish campus. It's exciting. Hope­fully it will work out the best for Ned Bolcar and everybody involved." 
Nov. 16, 1988 Indianapolis News 
If you're looking for a way not to like Ned Bolcar, hang it up. You've got a better chance of feeling compassion for Robin Givens, or beating up on her ex­husband, or for that matter, getting a one-word answer out of Notre Dame's senior linebacker and tri-captain, 61' number 47 himself. 

Ned Bolcar likes to talk which would be a problem if he were anything but an eminently likable individual. The thing is, Ned is one of those people who makes others feel comfortable and listening to him talk about life as a college football player at Notre Dame is quite an enjoy­able experience. This becomes clear when he talks about his week leading up to a game. 
The major part of Bolcar's weekly rou­tine is football. He says it makes up about 60 percent of his life, and that includes not only the time that goes into it, but also the emotional investment that comes with making a commitment. 
"In college football there is a lot in­volved," Bolcar said. "You've got guys who want to win and play well, but some­times they do poorly and things bother diem. You try not to l<!t it happen and try to say to yourself it's only a small part of your life. But at school, football is 60 percent of your life. It's always been that way for me. You always feel like you have to do a little bit more, and you start to lose your perspective. 
If football's going badly, it's hard to go home and do your work. Football is a lot of mental work. It's hard to go out there everyday with the right tempera­ment if you don't have your life squared away. I find the best way to do that is to stay organized. If you've got your life organized, your schoolwork organized, your personal life is okay, it makes it easier to work on football. And if your football is squared away, it makes the other things easier. It all goes hand in hand." 
Maintaining that sort ofperspective is a large part of why Bolcar's teammates electe':l him as· one of their tri-captains for this season. Nov. 19, 1988 ND-Perm State Game Program

What they said about Brennan... 
The road to success for a walk-on on the Notre Dame football team is strenu­ous, at times unbearable. But senior tackle-tight end Mike Brennan achieved success the old-fashioned way -he earned it. 
"Football has made me the person that· I wasn't," Brennan says. "I just wanted to know in my heart that I start­ed at the very bottom with something and nobody handed me a single thing. I wanted to start from scratch and earn something that most people would die for; a chance to play football at Notre Dame." 
As a senior at Mt. St. Joseph's High School in Severna Park, Md.; Brennan was a 6-5, 180-pound all-America stand-out in lacrosse. Major universities with unparalleled lacrosse programs tried to attract the precious athlete. Still, he decided to walk onto the Notre Dame football team. Now, three years and 80 pounds later, Brennan has fi­nally secured a scholarship and is sec­ond on the depth chart at quick tackle. 
When Brennan reminisces about his first tough years on the squad, he men­tions his friendship with a senior full­back named Tom Monahan.. He ad­mired Monahan because he also started as a walk-on and eventually attained a scholarship. 
"Tom showed me what it was all about," Brennan says. "He was·very in­strumental in helping me stick to my goals because he knew what it was like to be a walk-on." 
Brennan presently backs up Andy Heck at the quick tackle position, but he gets most of his playing time when the special teams take the field. He's more concerned with his contribution to the team than his spot on the . depth chart. 

"Anything is possible this season, but I'm not so much concerned about mov­ing up the chart as long as I'm in a posi­tion where I'll be helping the team. And if that included playing time or moving up the charts, so be it." Oct. 1, 1988 ND-Stanford Game Pro­gram 
Those who remember Mike Brennan from_ his days as an all-America la­crosse player at Mount St. Joseph High School might not .recognize him now. He has put on nearly 80 pounds of mus­cle. He hasn't played lacrosse, at least with serious intent, for almost two years. 
One more thing: He is playing foot­ball at Notre Dame. 
"I think it's proof of what I set out to accomplish," Brennan said. "It'll show that it wasn't some shot in the dark." 
There were a lot of people back in Baltimore who thought Brennan was missing a few. bullets when he an­nounced his intention to pass up free rides to play lacrosse at places such as Johns Hopkins and North Carolina to pay his own way at Notre Dame. 
Since making his first collegiate start as a tackle in Notre Dame's 31-30 upset of then-No. 1 Miami, Brennan moved to guard because of injuries on the of­fensive line. 
"Most people do think it's a stigma," Brennan said of his former walk-on sta­tus. "But I thought it was great. That distinguished me from the rest of the guys. I think they respect me for that. There are some people on campus who still t~ink I'm a walk-on, and I don't tell them I'm not. I like what it represents."

From that beginning (Brennan weigh­ed 180 pounds as a high school senior), Brennan has climbled... and eaten ... and now is a starting offensive tackle on the number one ranked team in the na­tion. Nov. 3, 1988 The Observer

What they said about Eilers... 
spring drills sharing first -string status with George Streeter at strong safety. He played in all 12 games his junior year, and made more special teams ap­pearances than any other Irish player. 
Then with Heisman Trophy winner Tim Brown leaving the ranks, Eilers was called upon to fill a gap in the re­ceiving corps. 
Perhaps players like Watters and Is­mail earn more credits in the highlight films, but Eilers does not dwell on rec­ognition. 
"As far as being a match for a natu­rally talented athlete, I am not one of those types," Eilers said. "Others may have been given more talent, but I think I have more drive." Nov. 5, 1988 . ND-Rice Game Pro­gram 
It didn't take Notre Dame flanker Pat Eilers long to find out how it felt to take a big-time hit in college football. 
As a junior last year in the Irish sec­ondary, he had grown accustomed to making hits instead of taking them. But when the Irish put on pads for the first time, safety George Streeter put a hiton Eilers that took Eilers the rest of the day to recover from. 
·"George put a hit on me like I've never seen before," Eilers said. "I was knocked out for about five minutes." 
Ironically, if Eilers hadn't answered Coach Holtz's call for flankers last spring, Eilers might be backing up Streeter a strong safety or even playing with him in the secondary. 
Instead, he is sharing time with Rick.)' Watters and Aaron Robb at flanker.

What they said about Francisco... 
The sight of D'Juan Francisco com­ing out of a pack of football players and leaving everyone behind isn't unusual in the eyes of Cincinnati football fans. 
Seeing Francisco leave players in his wake was a weekly occuran_ce during his four-year career at Moeller, where he set records for career rushing yards (4,032), career points scored (378), sin­
. gle-season touchdowns (27 as a junior), single-season rushing yardage (1 ,658 as a junior), single-game TDs (five) and career 100-yard games (22). A state­class sprinter (10.5 seconds in 100-me­ter dash) in track to boot, and there were few football players in Ohio capa­ble of staying with him in high school. 
There also are very few players that can keep up with Francisco in college. But at Notre Dame, where Francisco is a senior, he's the one playing catch-up. 
Francisco, now 5-foot-11 and 188 pounds, has made the transition to cor­nerback and, if there were any doubts about his dedication, they ended in No­tre Dame's 19-17 victory over Michi­gan. While mighty-mite kicker Reggie Ho (5-5, 135) went down in the Notre Dame record book for his four field goals, it was Francisco's touchdown­saving tackle of Michigan's Tony Boles on a kickoff to start the second quarter that made the difference. 
"The important thing is that you want to play. You can't be selfish, and if the team needs some help on defense, that's where you have to go. I have rio regrets." Sept.· 17, 1988 Cincinnati Post 
Who's the fastest player on the Notre Dame football team? Is· it freshman Raghib "Rocket" Ismail? Maybe soph­omore Ricky Watters? Or how about freshman running back Rusty Setzer or sophomore tailback Tony Brooks? 
A couple of weeks ago, Lou Holtz told a group of reporters at a press confer­ence that Ismail thinks he's fast, and Watters thinks he's fast, and Brooks thinks he's fast, but D'Juan Francisco knows he's fast. 

D'Juan Francisco, or D.J. as he is fa­miliarly known, is Notre Dame's senior cornerback who submits, "I don't know who the fastest person on the team is, but I know the defensive backs are faster than any other position on the team."· 
The fact that Francisco ran a team­best 4.33 40-yard dash in spring drills last year certainly gives credence to his claim, as does the fact that the next three fastest times and four of the next five belong to members of the defensive backfield. 
But leave it to a truly team-oriented player like Francisco to find a solution to the question of who the fastest player is. 
"We've got some fast freshmen," he says. "But what I would like to do is get a few of my friends and put together a 4 x 100 relay team and race the freshmen. Get me, Stan Smagala (4.35 in the 40), Todd Lyght (4.41) and Mark Green 
(4.42) or someone like that and chal­lenge a team of freshmen. They are sup­posed to have the fastest incoming class, so I'm not going to just make it me, but I'd like to make it a team thing." 
Francisco did not see action in any of the games in 1985, his freshman year, and he saw limited time at tailback as a sophomore. In 1987, he became a cor-. nerback and was back to ground zero, but this year he is beginning to feel at home with his new position and has made some sparkling plays. 
Of particular note was the intercep­tion he made against Miami, when No­tre Dame staked its claim as a bonafide national championship contender by de­feating the Hurricanes, 31-30. Nov. 5, 1988 ND-Rice Game Program 



What they said about Gordon... 
You didn't hear or see him coming, but suddenly he is there. Startled, you imagine this is what it's like to be a quarterback just before being sacked in the pocket. You catch his eye and he walks over. 
At 6-3 and 215 pounds, his muscular body takes up most of the booth he is sitting in. He can bench press twice his weight, and you have no problem be­lieving it. 

Gordon's build is due in part to his extra year in the Irish weight room. But playing football at Notre Dame wasn't the only reason he decided to return for a fifth year of college. 
"It's prestigious to be at Notre Dame grad school," he says. "When I was in high school and looking at colleges I was very concerned about academics as well as football and I felt that Notre Dame was really the only place where I would be challenged in both areas. Here I could get the best education and play · for America's team. It was certainly hard to turn down. 
"My own family has had a tremen­dous influence on me. My brother, Vic­tor, was a professional boxer, and he made me believe that I could succeed as an athlete too. I watched his work habits and his dedication. He loves boxing and I love football and we both work hard at being the best we can be. 
"I can remember when I was young, he was always iri the limelight. Then, suddenly, when a few colleges started recruiting me, we were sharing it. I knew that if I worked as hard as he did, I could be under that spotlight with him. 
"I try to play up to expectations every time, and so does everyone else,'' Gor­don said. "If you can do that, even when things aren't going well for the entire team, you might end up with big­ger numbers sometimes. 
"I always look to be a little better each time. You always have to be dedi­cated. You have to want it. We want to prove that we will not let any team de­stroy our hopes. Eveyone should have that dream of a national championship 

and we will try to work toward it every week by playing consistently." Gordon's secret to playing consistent­ly comes from pregame preparation. 
"I try hard not to get too psyched up before a game,", Gordon says. "I don't want that rush to go away before I get out on the field. I want to be at an emo­tional high when I'm out there, thinking about making the big play every time the ball is snapped." Sept. 24, 1988 ND-Purdue Game Program 
He played football and basketball and threw the javelin and discus at Hillside High. He also studied. By the time he graduated, he was sixth in his senior class and ranked in the top 100 football seniors in the nation by one scouting publication. The big-timers were on his door. Notre Dame was the easy winner. 
"I'd just always heard about it," Flash Gordon said. "I knew it was a place where you could play football and get an education. That was what was most important to me. Nobody's going to play football forever, no matter how good he is. My parents were pushing for Notre Dame, too, but they left the decision up to me. I was with them. I wanted Notre Dame." 
The four years -five, actually ­have gone by in-OK-a flash. They haven't been easy· because the kid played on some of those Gerry Faust teams that lost and lost while everyone shook their heads, but football never was everything, anyway. The education arrived as promised. Only seven Notre Dame players since 1965 have failed to graduate, a 98.7 rate. The kid was part of that long line of Italians and Irish and Spanish and Poles and blacks and whites who used the game more than the game ever used them. 
Jan. I, 1989 Boston Globe 
Gordon, a fifth-year senior from Hill­side, N.J., is one of a handful of Irish seniors who have gone from digesting table scraps to riding the gravy train. But unlike those who were secure in their positions all season, Gordon has risen from mid-season bench-sitter to likely Fiesta Bowl starter.

What they said about Gorman... 
When Tom Gorman goes back to his room in Pangborn Hall every night after football practice, he knows that the phone is going to ring. No matter how the day went in the trenches, the offen­sive tackle can count on some words of encouragement from a man who under­stands the demands of a college. football player -his father. 
"I have the type of father who calls me every night to see how I'm doing," the Evergreen Park, Ill., native says. "He played football for a year when he was in college, but he realized that his education would get him further than football."

Pete Graham 6-3-207 Quarterback Rusmon, N.J. (Rumson-Fair Haven) 


What they said about Graham... 
Gorman, a player who has achieved plenty of success on the football field and in the classroom, boasts a 3.13 overall grade point average and knows that he is a fortunate son. Like his fa­ther, Gorman has learned to keep things in perspective. 
"I always learned to take football and school and put them in the right per­spective," Gorman says. 
Gorman developed his football skills at Brother Rice High School in Chicago where he was named to,. the Chicago Catholic all-America squad. As a mem­ber of the powerful Chicago Catholic league, Gorman learned the true spirit of sportsmanship. 
The Chicago Catholic league may have been tough to compete in, but the adjustment to Notre Dame seemed an enormous task at first. 
"I didn't know what to expect the first day I got here," Gorman recalls. "I saw Eric Dorsey and I thought, 'Oh my God what did I get myself into?' When he and Wally Kleine showed up, they just seemed colossal to me. After a while I realized that I could play here. I knew that it would take time, but I knew that I could do it."

There's an old adage that says "if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all." 
Senior reserve quarterback Pete Gra­ham is living proof that some people still adhere to that philosophy. Maybe it's because Graham is such a nice per­son who always has something pleasant to say about others. 
"I was always a pretty good kid," Graham says. "I never gave my parents too much trouble. At least, that's what they tell me." 
Graham's parents aren't the only ones with praise for him. "Pete has one of the greatest attitudes 
I've ever seen," says teammate Kent Graham (no relation). "Everyone loves the guy. He never has a negative word to say about anyone or anything, and that type of person adds so much to a team. He's a true team player." 
For the past four years, Graham has played a key role on· the Irish prep team at quarterback. But, he hasn't seen a lot of game playing time. In fact, Graham has only been in 18 games during his 
·college career and most of those ap­pearances have been with the kicking units as a holder. Graham feels he's contributing in more important ways than simply wearing the uniform. 
"I'm helping the prep team prepare themselves for a lot of tough teams just by playing my best in practice," he says. 
Graham is often the player behind the scenes who helps his teammates reach their full potential. As a holder, Gra­ham could hardly be compared to Lucy of the Peanuts comic strip who always pulls the football away from Charlie Brown just before he kicks it. It was Graham's steady hand which enabled Reggie Ho to kick . four field goals against Michigan in the opening game of the season. Sept. 24, 1988 ND-Purdue Game Program

What they said about Green... 
24Mark Green 6-0 184 Tailback ·Riverside, Calif. (Riverside Poly) 

Mark Green spent the summer work­ing in a law firm. His career goal is to get into broad­cast journalism. · 
Versatility is a way of life for Green. 

The 6-0, 184-pound Notre Dame sen­ior, who will serve as a tri-captain this year, didn't know if he would be out-. side or inside this year. He only knew it didn't matter. 
"A lot of people raised that question about how I felt," he said of his spring practice move from tailback to flanker. "You know, it really doesn't matter to me. I'll play flanker. I'll play tailback. I'll play anywhere." 
And he will play well. He had a mar­velous season as a tailback a year ago, rushing for a team-high 861 yards and an impressive 5.9 yards a carry. 
He just never has been known as a "fixture" anywhere because when there's a desperate need elsewhere, the staff looks to Green. 
"His personality is always the same," said Holtz. "He's usually got a smile on his face and he's kind of bubbly." 
Aug. 17, 1988 South Bend Tribune 
Call him Mr. Versatile. And it's not just because Mark Green has switched positions three times during his Notre Dame career. As Green says, "That was not as big a deal as ·people think." 
Call him Mr. Versatile because versa­tility is his way of life both on-and-off the field. ·some examples: . 
While in high school, Green was cap­tain of the football and track squads, a standout basketball player, class presi­dent and the commissioner of publicity at Riverside (Calif.) Poly High School. 
"I was the person in charge of publi­cizing major events on campus," he says. "I spoke on the intercom system, read the daily announcements to everyone in the school and led the Pledge of AI­legiance every day." 
His experience it:~ publicizing major events on the high school campus, com­bined with his current major (American Studies with an emphasis on communi­cation), have him thinking about a broadcasting career. Green plans to do an internship this spring with WNDU­TV in South Bend. 
"Being a football player at Notre Dame has helped me prepare for this in­directly because I have been interviewed quite a bit," Green says. "They say the more time you spend in front of the cam­era the better you get. When we played in Miami last year I got to discuss my ambition with (CBS announcer) Pat Ha­den when we rode back to the hotel to­gether after practice. He said to defin­itely pursue it to see if it's what I.want to do. He told me I'd be pretty good at it. Coming from the top, that's a pretty nice compliment."

Green, a 6-0, 184-pound senior, is one of Notre Dame's tri-captains and a form­er consensus all-America out of River­side Polytechnical High School in River­side, Calif. He is a big part of the reason for Notre Dame's national championship hopes, too. 
"Mark Green is a fine tailback, but he also does one thing I like: He's consist­ent," Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz said. "He's extremely consistent in how he does things." 
He is the ninth~leading rusher in 101 years of Irish football with 1,937 yards on 366 attempts. He is a co-owner of a school record with eight consecutive car­ries against Boston College last season. 
This season, he started every game, and rushed for 646 yards on 135 carries with five touchdowns. Last season, he started every game, rushed for 861 yards 
on 146 carries with six touchdowns, caught more passes than any Irish player ·except Reisman "Trophy winner Tim Brown and played more offensive min­

Mark Green had his college career 
mapped out from the start. 
Privately, of course. It's not exactly 
the kind of thing you blurt out to all your 
friends. Green was a man with a plan, 
though. From the day he left Riverside 
Poly High School and signed with Notre 
Dame, he envisioned it clearly: 
He· joins the Fighting Irish, starts at 
tailback for at least three years, and 
then, in his senior year, leads Notre 
Dame to an unbeaten national champion­
ship, dumping USC back home in the 
Coliseum -in front of his family and

What they said about Pritchett... 
"Wes Pritchett and I were together somewhere last season, and he got up and recited some Shakespeare," says head coach Lou Holtz. "I couldn't be­lieve it. That just didn't seem ·like the Wes Pritchett that I knew." 
But that shouldn't come as any sur­prise. Folks at Notre Dame ought to know by now to expect the unexpected from the outgoing Pritchett. 
"He's crazy," says fellow linebacker Ned Bolcar. "You never know what Wes is going to do next." 
Any examples? "None that you can print," he joking­ly says. You see, there are many sides to Wes Pritchett. One moment he is an aggres­
·sive, hard-hitting competitor on the 
field or as Holtz says, "Wes likes the 
game and it shows. He has a natural en­thusiasm for the game and it bubbles out and rubs off on other people." 

Then the next moment he does some­thing like the time last year when he recited 25 lines of Shakespeare's "Hen­ry IV" off the cuff at a Quarterback Club Luncheon. 
Then just when you think he's an in­tense and serious person all the time off the field, stop right there. There's an­other side to Pritchett. 
"I just like to have fun whatever I'm doing," he says with a big grin. "I like to get away from football sometimes and just relax. I may not be the most serious person in the world but I am when I have to be." Sept. 10, 1988 ND-Michigan Game Program 
Rhythm. Tempo. Tone. 

When Wes Pritchett talks about de­fense at the University of Notre Dame, it sounds a little more like he's helping conduct an orchestra than helping coor­dinate a football team. 
"It all has to do with tempo, some­times," he said. "I think we've been able to establish a certain tempo on de­fense. 
"So far this year, the defense has re­ally proven we're a fine defensive unit." 
Pritchett, a 6-6, 251-pounder from Atlanta, does more than his share in helping conduct the defense. Besides calling signals and being part of the tal­ented inside-linebacking trio that in­cludes senior Ned Bolcar and junior Michael Stonebreaker, Pritchett follows up on his call with aggressive, not-so­reckless. play. Sept. 29, 1988 Fort Wayne Journal­Gazette 
The word is out on Wes Pritchett, or at least part of it. Just the other day, in the course of 
conversation with three different peo­
ple, the Notre Dame linebacker was 
asked to detail his latest prank. 
Pritchett takes his fun seriously. His 
football, too. 
And that's the word people on the in­
side, like defensive coordinator Barry 
Alvarez, are spreading. 
Alvarez admits "no one has more fun 
than Wes." And no one has played bet­
ter. 
"I try to stay away from blowing any­
body's hom, but I really think Wes has 
been overlooked," remarked Alvarez 
before Thursday's practice. 
Pritchett might be overlooked nation­
ally, but he's certainly looked up to by 
his peers. 
Alvarez noticed it back in spring practice when Pritchett and Frank Starns, a pair of fifth-year seniors, start­. ed providing some leadership through 
their work ethic and comic relief. 
"Ifwe really need a good practice on 
a given day, I'll go to Wes and Frank;' 
related Alvarez. "When the kids see 
how serious they are, it rubs off. They 
listen to them." 
Nov. 16, 1988 South Bend Tribune 
Pritchett, a 6-6, 251-pound senior, 
calls the defensive signals and is crazed 
on the field. Against Miami, he suf­

quarter. He went to the sidetine, got it 
taped and played the rest of the game. 
The bones crunched every time he 
closed the hand. He finished with· nine 
tackles, two for losses. 
Starns said he thinks Pritchett also is 
stealing the other teams' playbooks. 
"Why else would he have so many 
tackles?" said Starns, referring to Prit­
chett's team-leading 112 tackles. "I want 
to know why he is not sharing that in­. formation with anyone else."

6-1 192 Flanker Coeur d'Alene, Idaho (Gonzaga Prep) 
What they said about Robb... 
Some things in life don't always turn out like you expect them to. Irish flank­er Aaron Robb can tell you that. 
"I was a running back in high school, but originally I thought I wanted to play basketball in college," the senior from Coeur d'Alene, Idaho says. "At the be­ginning of the recruiting process, though, I started telling football coaches that and they were really turned off by it. I realized that I had better commit myself to one or the other, and I knew that my best bet was to commit to foot­ball. 
"I played cornerback my freshman year and I thought that my future was on defense," Robb says. "But coach Holtz moved me to flanker in the fall of hi~ first year and I played behind Tim Brown the last two seasons." 

Even though he checked into 18 games during his sophomore and junior seasons, he found himself blocking de­fenders more often than he was catching passes. 
Robb put his time in at flanker and on special teams, even returning a kick once his sophomore year. He kept learning and improving his game, knowing that the time would come when he could prove himself on the field. At the beginning of the 1988 sea­son, with Tim Brown moving on to the Los Angeles Raiders, it looked like

What they said about Southall... 
Rochester, N.Y. (Rush-Henrietta Sperry) 
"As I cross the goal line, it's the big­gest thrill in the world for a defensive player to score a touchdown. As I tum around, I run back to celebrate with my teammates because Corny Southall knows that he could not have done this if everyone else didn't do their jobs." 
The scenario is not an unfamiliar one to the Rochester, N.Y., native because that's exactly how .he did it when he picked one off against Purdue last year and took it 57 yards for a score. But the most important thing about it is the teamwork behind it. 
"Sometimes I find myself late at night with the television on but the sound down," he says, "listening to some comforting music. I think about how lucky I am. I'm at the University of Notre Dame. 'I'm the free safety for the University of Notre Dame. I'll have a degree next May. I have great parents that I love. I'm just a very lucky person, and I wish I could share that with every person that's ever influenced me." 
One gets the impression that Southall was well-prepared for life's tosses and tUrns before he came to Notre Dame, Robb would at last have his chance to emerge from behind the all-America's shadow. But things don't always tum out the way you expect them to. 
"Going into this season I thought that I had a legitimate shot at splitting time at flanker. Both Ricky (Watters) and I were working with the first team. But then I pulled a muscle in my thigh when we started practice this fall and I was out for over a month. Not only that, but I fell down the depth chart and I'm try­ing now to work my way back up."

For now, though, Corny Southall will be poised in the defensive backfield at the free sa~ety position, with his eyes focused sharply on the quarterback and the task at hand.

Ifyou had one day left on this planet, you probably· wouldn't spend it the same way Frank Starns would. 
"That's easy. I'd spend it at a Lou Holtz Sunday practice," says Starns with a straight face. "Those things feel like they last three weeks." 
That's just the kind of response you'd expect from Starns. 
The fifth-year defensive end for the Irish lives for each hour of the day, es­pecially after 11 a.m .. because he likes to sleep in, but he appreciates the time he has left at Notre Dame. 
"The time I have spent here has been too short," says the Arkon, Ohio, na­tive. "I feel old, ancient. All the changes that have been made since I have been here -presidents, coaches, buildings -I feel like a fixture around here. I can look back on the past five years and it seems like yesterday. I just wanted to get through my freshman and sophomore years. Now, I spend every hour of the day the best I can. I like playing and one day I know I'll look back and the season will have gone so quickly." Oct. I, 1988 ND-Stanford Game Pro­gram 
Frank Starns answered the phone in Notre Dame's sports information office a few days before the Fighting Irish met Stanford last month. The caller asked what time the game was. 
Starns, in his most apologetic tone, told the ticketholder the game had been cancelled by agreement of the two schools. He expressed his sincerest re­grets on behalf of the university. 
The caller protested, but Starns toyed with him for several minutes, finally breaking down and admitting the lie. 
"Who is this?" the caller demanded. "Michael Stonebreaker ," Starns re­plied, passing the gag off. on the shy, 
soft-spoken Irish linebacker.

On the eve of the momentous Octo­ber showdown with No. 1 Miami, the mood around Notre Dame was light as a funeral. There was blood in every eye. Serious people prepared to play some serious football. 
Coach Lou Holtz fretted and brain­stormed. Hitman George Streeter planned shots violent enough to be heard 'round the world. Freshman de­fensive end Arnold Ale stilled butter­flies stirred by the prospect of his first start. Guard Tim Grunhard nursed an ankle injury and vowed he wo1:1ld play. 

Tony Rice worked hard to improve the Irish passing game. Reggie Ho wonder­ed if he might get the call for a dramat­ic, winning field goal and kicked a few dozen more balls in anticipation.

Notre Dame linebacker Frank Starns received an Associated Press Midwest Player of the Week award for his efforts in the 31-30 victory over Miami.

"Wes told me Sunday that he could hear the bones crunch everytime he moved his hand," said Starns, a fifth­year .senior from Akron, Ohio. "I told him, 'Wes, that really had to fire you up.' 
"I wish he would have told me about it (during Saturday's game). That would have pumped me up, too. I could have turned all that pain into energy. That would have been awesome." Oct. 19, 1988 South Bend Tribune

What they said about Streeter... 
Who are Oatmeal Man and the Nabis­

co Kid and what do they have to do with 
the Notre Dame secondary? 
The connection is Irish senior strong safety George Streeter. 
The creative side of Streeter does not 

come across on the football field, but 
off it, Streeter is very soft-spoken and 
creative for a 6-2, 200-pound football· 
player. 
"One of the problems with being an athlete is that, to be a good athlete, you can't be diversified," Streeter says. "You can't be well-rounded. You have to spe­cialize all the time. Those of us who do have other talents get stereotyped as only being able to play football." 
OK, but who is the Nabisco Kid? "One story I wrote, a children's story, was about Oatmeal Man and the N abis­co Kid. The whole story was cookies ­everybody in it was a cookie," Streeter explains. "People liked that story." 
Streeter has played in every Irish foot­ball game since he came to Notre Dame in 1985. Like all Notre Dame students, Streeter has his own formula for getting things done.. 
"From being a freshman to a senior, the only thing you change is emphasis. You have to know what day you have to go out there and be real physical on the practice field, so you know to go right to bed that night...you know when you have to stay up late to study...you learn the cycle of the tests you'll have. By that time you have the discipline to stay in when you need to." 
Sept. 29, 1988 The Observer 
Midway through his sophomore year, Streeter earned a starting job at strong safety, a position· he has held ever since. He has also earned a reputation as being one of the hardest hitters on the team. Flanker Pat Eilers can attest to that. He was on the receiving end of a 
bone-crunching  blow  by  Streeter  one  
day during  pre-season  practice  this  
year.  

"George Streeter just knocked me up and down," Eilers says. "I can't even remember it so I don't know if it hurt. It took me more than a half day to get all my senses back." 
Streeter has dished out that type of punishment on Saturdays, too. He is tops among the defensive secondary in tackles. Nov. 19, 1988 ND-Penn State Game Program 
"I sit here exhausted, totally, right down to the bone, but I feel exhilarated at the same time. Why? Because in my final collegiate game of the 1988 sea­son, I performed the absolute best that I have ever played in my life. 

"What is more gratifying than ~at is that my contribution was also necessary for the success of our team and the out­standing play of the secondary. I am most pleased with myself because I have improved from game to game. 
"I am thankful that I have an oppor­tunity to participate and add -can you imagine that -add to the already rich tradition of Notre Dame and be remem­bered as an outstanding player on a great team, during a great season. I could not have written a script any bet­ter than a season I have been a part of. 
"It is always important to take time to smell the roses. I have put off that time at many junctures during the season, at many plateaus on our long mountain climb. I feel it is all too appropriate, at 11-0, to look back. Look back at the fun, back at the good times, and back to the hard times (there have been no bad times -just difficult ones)." 
Nov. 30, 1988 The Observer 
Back in late October, Notre Dame went nose-to-nose with a moment of truth. 
Head coach Lou Holtz wasn't the on­ly one a little worried about his club following the lackluster 22-7 victory over Navy. 
Shortly after, the players met on their own to discuss the future. 
"We asked ourselves 'are we going to fold like last year (three losses of the final three games),' " Streeter recalled. "Things get pretty tough around here in November academically and you can lose your concentration. 
"But we made a promise to each oth­er there would not be a dropoff. For myself, I stood up and promised to play the best defense of my career." The rest, they say, is history. Dec. 23, 1988 South Bend Tribune

What they said about Aim... 
Combine the size and strength of a weightlifter with the height and agility of a basketball player, and you've got some idea of the threat Jeff Aim poses to opposing quarterbacks. 
The 6-7, 248-pound junior defensive tackle has been a disruptive force in op­posing backfields this season, stuffing ballcarriers, leaping to bat down passes, and occasionally coming down with the ball as well. 
"I may not be the most effective pass rusher," said Aim, "but I can get my hands up. A lot of the time, because of the way our defensive backs are cover­ing their receivers, their (opposing quarterbacks') only option is to do a kind of dump pass where the tight end will come around and the ball is just lofted over the line. 
"If there's nobody up there (on the line), the quarterback's just gonna throw it. Right when he throws it, you have a chance to jump up, and that's how I've made both of my interceptions." 
Two of Aim's interceptions directly contributed to Irish scores this season. He picked off a late third quarter pass against Mianii to set up Reggie Ho's 27­yard field goal and give Notre Dame a 31-21lead over the Hurricanes. He also pulled down a pass against Rice to set up· a Tony Brooks touchdown run. 
"I'll tell you what he does probably better than any player that I've ever coached," said Irish defensive tackles coach John Palermo. "He chases the football better than anyone I've been around. For the most part, he's at the right place at the right time." 
Aim is an integral part of a defensive line which features three first-year starters. He complements George Wil­liams and Chris Zorich in fending off opposing blockers and applying pres­sure on quarterbacks. 
"I think we've been slowly proving we can do it. I think people know we're some kind of force to be reckoned with, and they're gonna have to do something to stop us." 
Considered one of the top 16 players in the nation according to United Press International's 1985 prep ·talent survey, Aim was highly recruited coming out _of high school. Strangely enough, a lack of pocket change afforded him an op­portunity to visit Notre Dame. . 
"They screwed up on my recruiting visit," said Aim. "When I was sup­posed to come here my senior year for the recruiting weekend, they read me my arrival time in South Bend as my departure time in Chicago. So when I got to the airport, my. plane had just landed in South Bend. 
"Had I had enough money to take a cab, I probably would never have come (to Notre Dame), because I would have gone back home. But since I didn't, I waited at the airport and I went on stand­by and I came down here. I colnmitted on that visit, which was kind of strange." Nov. 15, 1988 The Observer 


What they said about Banks... 
"I knew we were in trouble up at Michigan State when I look around and standing next to me are Braxston Banks on one side and Anthony Johnson on the other. We've got the ball and I'm trying to figure out who's playing full­back for us. That's what happens when your two fullbacks both get hurt in the first two series. 
"But Braxston made an amazing comeback and ended up making a cou­ple of great plays in a critical drive at Pittsburgh when he hadn't even been expected to dress for the game. Then he scored a touchdown against Miami the next week. When Braxston Banks is healthy, he and Anthony give us an aw­fully solid situation at fullback, and that's not even mentioning Rodney Culver."

What they said about Brown.~. 
, The Dean Brown who will start at strongside offensive tackle for top­ranked and unbeaten Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl against unbeaten West Vir­ginia is virtually the same Dean Brown who dominated opposing linemen six years ago at Hartford Junior School. 
Oh, he's bigger -having grown to 6-3 and 280 pounds from his 195-pound playing weight at Hartford -and faster -he clocked a 4.8-second 40-yard dash earlier this year -and more learned in technique. But Brown's ap­proach to the game in particular and life in general hasn't changed one bit. 
Dean Brown only desires to face the toughest challenge available and to do the best he possibly can. 
"My mom always taught me that if anything is worth something you've got to work for it," said Brown. 
"If you want to be the best you have to go with the best and accept the chal­lenge rather than lo~king for and taking shortcuts. 

'~I've always believed that, and that was the main reason I wanted to play for McKinley and the main reason I chose Notre Dame when it came time to pick a college. 
"When I first heard of Notre Dame my sophomore year in high school, I thought it was somewhere in California. But once I found out about where it was and what Notre Dame was all about, I picked it and never changed my mind. 
"I'll never regret it because I wanted the challenges Notre Dame offered, be­cause within those opportunities laid the opportunity to be the best I could possi­bly be. 
"It took me· a while to get the level of learning done that the professors wanted. I had to retrain myself to school and it took me some time to get adjusted to it. 
"It also took me a while to get adjust­ed to playing football at this level. "It was a real shock to me when I got 
to Notre Dame. I had come from a great program at McKinley, which plays great competition, and I thought I'd walk into Notre Dame and start my first game. 
"Oh, I knew the competition at Notre Dame would be very, very high, but I quickly realized it was a matter of tak­ing it up another level. 
"The athletic ability of everybody you're competing against is incredible. I found out quickly that the key to suc­cess on the collegiate level is mental toughness. 
"You've got to be tough because the pressure always is there, in the class­room and on the field, and you have your up days and your down days. 
"On my down days, I try to think of what's really important and keep things in their proper perspective, and I always seem able to come back." Jan. 1, 1989 The Akron Beacon Journal 

What they said about Flannery...

What they said about Grunhard... 
When Lou Holtz was running down the offensive line probabilities the other day, he stopped when he got to Tim Grunhard. 
"An overachiever," Holtz said of his prize junior guard. 
Grunhard worked himself hard this summer and, lately, into a froth over -the collective underestimating of the of­
fensive line. 

"I'm sick of people saying everything about how we're not up to par with last year's line," remarked Grunhard. "I'm sick of hearing how we can't be good because we're young." 
That hits home for Grunhard. After all, the Chicago product fit in pretty well as a young player -as a long snapper his freshman year and at guard and on special teams as a sophomore. 
On paper, though, Notre Dame's line has a lot of work ahead. The graduation of four fifth-year seniors left some big holes. Jeff Pearson's departure left an­other and all Notre Dame can do is wait and see what happens. 
Grunhard has done about all he can. He worked so hard while staying behind this summer with 59 other players, that he ran himself into a case of shin splints and that threatened his availability for the first few practices. 
Aug. 15, 1988 South Bend Tribune 
Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz gets a kick out of his right guard, Tim Grunhard. 
"He's always wallowing around," Holtz said. "He's always got bumps and bruises, but you can't get him in the training room. He's a kickback to the old days. He'd love it if you didn't have a facemask." 
Sept. 8 Chicago Sun-Times 


What they said about Johnson... 
Anthony Johnson has spent more than his share of Saturdays at Notre Dame Stadium. 
The South Bend native spent his weekends starring for the Adams High School football team and working as a messenger to the ushers at Irish home games. But Johnson never thought he someday would be coming to the Stadi­urn as one of Notre Dame's top running backs. 
"I didn't think I'd play for a major college team," said the junior fullback. "I was surprised when I was contacted by teams. I was surprised that I could play for them." 
Once he signed with Notre Dame, not many people, including Johnson himself, figured he would see much playing time early. But Johnson played the most min­utes of any freshman during_ the 1986 season and has grown to an integral part of the Irish offensive backfield. 
"It surprised ·me greatly," Johnson said of his freshman season, in which he was the second-leading Irish rusher with 349 yards on 80 carries. "I expect­ed to contribute on the kicking game or perhaps just in .practice." 
The 6-0, 225-pounder led the team with 11 touchdowns last season. During a junior season that has been beset by injury problems, Johnson demonstrated his return to form with another one of his trademark touchdowns. He broke an Air Force tackle at the last possible mo­ment and burst to the end zone for a 12­yard score. 
"You look at the Air Force game and there were two linebackers trying to tackle him, and the next· thing you see, he pops out and scores," said Irish backfield coach Jim Strong. "When Anthony Johnson's healthy, he's as good an inside runner as there probably is in college football. It's hard for one man to tackle him." Oct. 28, 1988 The. Observer 


Juniors 


What they said about Rice... 
Every college quarterback has a style. But not all of them get the job done with it. The true quarterback mold and Notre Dame's Tony Rice just don't fit. 
Quarterbacks are supposed to be smooth operators. Coaches want them cool, a little cocky, and to play the part. 
Rice can look more like a runaway colt. 
The only thing classic about the Irish junior seems to be the results. He can go 100 miles-an-hour all day, get dirty, and get excited. He can make a major college stadium seem like his personal sandlot. 
Somewhere inside Tony Rice burns a Jim McMahon attitude. He came to No­tre Dame from small-school country in South Carolina with winner stamped on his forehead and question marks every­where else. 
Sept. 4, 1988 South Bend Tribune 
Notre Dame football fans expect a lot of improvement this season from quar­terback Tony Rice. What they forget is how far he already has come. 
Rice took over at halftime of the Pitts­burgh game last season when starter Terry Andrysiak limped into the locker room with a broken collarbone. 
"I came out of the· huddle for the first time in the second half and lined up un­der guard instead of center," said Rice. "I guess I was kind of nervous at first." 
Coach Lou Holtz doesn't ask his quarterbacks to win games. He de­mands they not lose them. Sept. 9, 1988 Indianapolis Star 
His passes aren't Hall of Fame spi­rals, like Joe Montana's or Joe Theis­mann's. He won't win a Reisman Tro­phy, like Paul Hornung or John Huarte. The name "Tony Rice" will never roll off Notre Dame lips with the magic of "Johnny Lujack." 
But look at his W's. 
With this uncommon, uncelebrated Irish quarterback at the throttle, Ameri­ca's No. 1 college team puffed its re­cord to 9-0, taking a 54-11 Saturday stroll against a wonderful Texas univer­sity with a woeful 0-8 football team that also happens to play under the name of Rice (no kin). 
Nov. 6, 1988 St. Petersburg Times 
The national spotlight will be on Reisman Trophy candidate Rodney Peete Saturday when he leads Southern Cal against Notre Dame in the Los Angeles Coliseum. 
Peete's counterpart for the Irish, quarterback Tony Rice, won't be trying to steal it. 
After a slow start, Rice is quietly de­veloping into the kind of quarterback Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz hopes he can be. 
No one questioned Rice's ability to run the option attack, but his passing talents were questionable. Of course, Rice has heard the critics and that made him only more determined to silence them. 
"A lot of people say I can't pass and that I shouldn't be quarterback at Notre Dame," said Rice, who threw for al­most 4,000 yards in high school. "But that doesn't bother me. They can say it. 
"A lot of people think passing is the big thing. They want to see a lot of spectacular passing plays. Well, I enjoy running the ball and passing, too. That's just my style." Nov. 25, 1988 Indianapolis News 
Tony Rice has spent three years at the University of Notre Dame hearing again and again what he can't do. On the football field or in the classroom, the quarterback from Woodruff, S.C., con­stantly has had to prove himself. 

"When I think of how much ·time I spent writing letters, explaining why he was quarterback," coach Lou Holtz said this week. 
Perhaps it is time to recognize that the Irish are 14-2 with Rice as a starter; that as Holtz described him this week, "Tony Rice just has a way to get things done." 
Nov. 27, 1988 Dallas Morning News 
It won't bother Tony Rice if he is nev­er heralded as a great quarterback. It will never bug him if people say he's not effective as a passer. Among Rice's greatest strengths is a confidence that overwhelms all labels. 
His love and feel for the game trans­lates into pure fun at competing, at leading and sharing it all with. 10 other guys. 
He doesn't set the tempo as much as the mood. Jan. 1, 1989 South Bend Tribune 


What they said about Smagala... 
Picture the scenario: an unprece­dented battle of the unbeatens between the Irish and the Trojans with the Irish ahead 14-7 in Los Angeles, with South­em Cal driving for a tying touchdown in the second quarter behind. Heisman hopeful Rodney Peete. 
Uh-oh, we're in trouble. 

But wait, Trojan flanker John Jack­son, while running a route, slips on a timing pattern and Peete throws the ball right into the hands of Stan Smagala, the Irish short-side cornerback, who promptly returns the ball for 64 yards and six points. 
Smagala 's . interception return was a major turning point in the game. With USC having just cut the lead in half and driving to score again, the turnover took the wind out of the Trojans' sails and put the Irish ahead, 20-7. 
The interception marked the biggest play to date in Smagala's career at No­tre Dame, a career which has wasted no time getting started. Smagala was thrust into the cornerback position, never hav­ing played it in his life. 
A tailback in high school, Smagala gained 1,300 yards on 170 carries at St. Laurence High School in Burbank, earning all-area and all-city honors. 
"(The transition from tailback to cor­nerback) was really ·difficult," said Smagala. "I had trouble my freshman year, pulling a lot of hamstrings. It was different to tackle someone instead of getting tackled.'' Nov. 30, ·1988 The Observer 


What they said about Stonebreaker.... 
It's not all the tackles that tickled No­tre Dame defensive coordinator Barry Alvarez. 
Inside linebacker Michael Stone­breaker had quite a day against Michi­gan in the 19-17 victory, even When a ballcarrier wasn't around. 
"Some things you just don't teach," remarked Alvarez. 
Like the block Stonebreaker threw during Ricky Watters' 81-yard punt re­turn for a touchdown, when he peeled back out of his "wall" responsibilities to free Watters. 
"On another play," said Alvarez, "we were really in the wrong defense for their (Michigan's) alignment. Mike saw it and forced the play back inside. He didn't make the tackle, but it was. a big play." 
Stonebreaker's biggest strength is his feel for the field, the natural instincts. He can read between the lines and re­spond in time. Sept. 15, 1988 South Bend Tribune 
Save a spot on your all-America bal­lot: It looks like an automatic. Line­backer: Mike Stonebreaker, junior, No­tre Dame. 
Stonebreaker, awiry, 6-1 player from River Ridge, La., who doesn't look anywhere near his 230 pounds, is build­ing a nice dossier. 
· In the Notre Dame opener against 
Michigan (nationally televised), he . 
pounded his way into 16 tackles. 
But that might not be enough to do the job, so he expanded his defensive role in the 20-3 victory over Michigan State (oh, yes, the TV lights were shin­ing again). 
Stonebreaker made seven unassisted 
tackles, plus three assists for 10 total 
tackles, plus intercepted two passes. 
In the fourth quarter, Stonebreaker 
became a backbreaker for MSU, steal­
ing Bobby McAllister's pass and racing 
39 yards for a clinching touchdown. 
Sept. 18, 1988 Detroit Free Press 



What they said about Terrell... 
Position switches are as common as victories at Notre Dame these days. 
Ricky Watters moves from tailback to flanker. Andy Heck from tight end to offensive tackle. Tom Gorman from de­fensive tackle to offensive tackle. Mark Green from flanker to tailback to flank­er to tailback. The list goes on. 
Pat Terrell, one of those players who has been moved to a new spot, says all of the position changing is one of the reasons the Irish are 7-0 and ranked second in the nation. 
"I really credit the coaching staff for that," said Terrell while preparing for Saturday's road game with Navy. "They do a good job in finding the right position for the athlete." 
Terrell came to Notre Dame as a wide receiver from Lakewood High School in St. Petersburg, Fla., but was moved to cornerback as a freshman. A year later, he was moved back to split end and played in all 12 games. He started five games before spraining an ankle against Navy. 
Oct. 24, 1988 Indianapolis News 
If it seems like every University of Notre Dame football player has made a position switch, then Pat Terrell is just a little above average. 
Terrell, you see, has done it not once, not twice, but three times for the Fight­ing Irish. 
First offense, then defense, then of­fense, then defense. But "this position swapping might not be over since Ter­rell, a free safety, is just a junior. 
Still, he doesn't mind-well, maybe a little -· changing his habits and his habitat for the sake of Notre Dame. 
"We felt in the case of Patrick, he possessed some particular skills (like 4.34-second speed in the 40-yard dash) not common for guys his size (6-0, 195­pounds)." Heater said. 
But he will be fondly remembered by Irish faithful for deflecting Steve Walsh's two-point conversion pass to Leonard Conley to help seal Notre Dame's win over then top-ranked Mi­ami. -He also had a 60-yard interception return for a touchdown in that game. 
Deflecting passes instead of receiving· them. · 
It's not what Terrell expected entering Notre Dame after earning two letters as a wide receiver, free safety and quarter­back at Lakewood High School in St. Petersburg. He moved to cornerback his freshman season, playing 11 games and recording seven tackles. 
As a sophomore, Terrell was moved to wide receiver, entering the starting lineup when Ray Dumas suffered a knee injury. He finished with five starts, and had two receptions for 63 yards. 
In the spring, Terrell started out as a wide receiver, but Holtz and Heater came calling. 
Now, he said he feels secure in his defensive surroundings. Oct. 27, 1988 Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette

What the said about Graham... 
Kent Graham, the second-string soph­omore quarterback from Wheaton, is quietly hanging in there, working hard -and waiting. · 
"If Tony (Rice) gets hurt, I'll be ready to go in. That's my role. I've got to ac­cept it," said Graham, who knows that even one year as the Notre Dame quar­terback can translate into a shot in the NFL. 
-"That's my dream,· to play here and to play in the pros. It's always in my mind. I think I have the talent and the capabili­ty to do it. I've just got to wait," said Graham. 
Irish assistant coach Pete Cordelli said he has improved at not forcing his throws. "He's studying the game. He's doing a great job of taking what the de­fense gives," Cordelli said. Oct. 27, 1988 Chicago Sun-Times 

What they said about Grimm... 
"You go back over the years and look at who has played a key role on the spe­cial teams -and then you see where those people end up when they're through. Not everyone is going to walk in and be a starter right away, but those who aren't· are going to have plenty of opportunities with the special teams. Donn Grimm made more special teams appearances than anybody else on de­fense last year .:,_ and he's going to be an excellent linbeacker before he's through."

What they said about Hackett... 
He is a sophomore now, and when Notre Dame went to Sun Devil Stadium Monday to meet West Virginia for the college football championship, he rode the bus with the knowledge that he would start the game. · 
"I was really nervous on the bus, but when we got dressed and got o~t there, giving each other high-fives, it went away;' Billy Hackett said. 
He kicked off, and sure enough, No­tre Dame held for three downs and re­ceived the ball. With three minutes played in the game Billy Hackett ran onto the field and kicked a 45-yard field goal, the longest of his life. Notre Dame scored first and went along to its merry 34-21 Fiesta Bowl win and the national title. Jan. 4, 1989 The Boston Globe

What they said about Jacobs... 
Notre Dame is 8-0 and No. 1 again for the first time since the first week of the 1981 season, so why is Irish coach Lou Holtz worried? 
In two words, Frank Jacobs. 

Jacobs, the 6-5, 235-pound sopho­more tight end from Newport Central Catholic, started the first four games but has missed the last four games after suffering an ankle sprain against ·Stan­ford. 
"We need to get Frank back," said Holtz. "We really need to get Frank back to full speed." Nov. 1, 1988 Kentucky Post

"You talk about people with all the potential in the world and that's Andre Jones. He's big, he's exceptionally quick and he's physical. He started out  working mainly with the special teams, but by last year he really became an im­pact player at defensive end. He's a solid hitter who gives you the agility to  be a cover guy in passing situations and that's so important at this level." Lou Holtz  


What ~hey said about Kowalkowski...  
"When you look at players who were just kind of waiting in the wings last year, you look at Scott Kowalkowski. He was playing behind Frank Starns, who just had a super season, and I think  Scott knows exactly what it takes to ex­cel at that position now. He and Donn Grimm were two of our special teams standouts -and I think they've pre­pared themselves well to move up the  ladder and play more of a full-time role in the future." Lou Holtz

Arnold Ale is quickly proving that he has what it takes to excel in competitive college football .. 
"He is progressing well," said George Stewart. "For a freshman to come into a situation like Notre Dame, a big-time college, and to have done as well as he has done is really an accomplishment." 
"Starting against Miami was an unbe­lievable experience," said Ale. "I was sive coordinator Barry Alvarez already has said: "Chris Zorich's level of play will be the standard by which all nose tackles will be judged."

What they said about Brown... 
Derek Brown, the Notre Dame fresh­man tight end whose first two recep­tions were for touchdowns, had already seen the world by the time he was eight. And now, the sky's the limit. 
Coach Lou Holtz said, "He has the potential to be as fine a tight end as I've ever been around. 
"He's one of those rare individuals who came here with a great reputation that I think was under-estimated. He's better than we thought."

He was recruited as a running back, then the Irish ·came up short at the

"He's really a wonderful young man," Holtz said. "He does not act like a freshman at all on the field."

Championship Review 
The Championships 

T
he national championship team in college football generally is considered to be the top-rated squad in the final rankings is­sued each year by the Associated Press (poll of sportswriters and broadcasters) and United Press International (poll of coaches). 
Since the AP began certifying the win­ner of its national crown in 1936, Notre Dame has won more national champion­ships than any other team in the country. \Vhen Lou Holtz's team captured the AP title in 1988, it became the eighth Irish squad to earn the prestigious honor. Oklahoma and Alabama are tied for sec­ond on the list with five championships each. 
The Irish parade of AP championships began with Frank Leahy's 1943 team. Leahy led Notre Dame to three more ti­tles in the decade (1946, 1947 and 1949). It would be another 17 years before the Irish would return to the top spot. They did it behind third-year head coach Ara Parseghian in 1966. Parseghian also brought home the crown in 1973. Dan Devine gave Notre Dame its second title in the '70s when his 1977 charges posted an 11-1 record, including the memorable 38-10 Cotton Bowl win over Texas. 
Notre Dame also lays claim to three na­tional championships before the Associ­ated Press began its college football rank-. ings. The Irish teams of 1924, 1929 and 1930 received the Rissman Trophy, which went to the nation's best team during that time. The Rissman Trophy was a forerun­ner of the Knute Rockne Trophy that AP awarded to the top team during the first few years of its national poll. 
The UPI coaches' poll has voted ana­tional champion since 1950. Notre Dame has won four titles (1966-73-77-88) dur­ing that period. Only USC with five has won more and Alabama and Oklahoma are tied with Notre Dame at four. The UPI poll was taken following the end of the regular season each year until the 1974 season when the coaches started waiting until the bowl games were con­cluded to issue their final rankings. 
The NCAA also recognizes national championships awarded by the Football Writ~rs Association of America and by the National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame. 
The FWAA has presented the Grantland Rice Award since 1954, with Notre Dame earning the trophy in 1966, '73, '77 and '88. The National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame has pre­sented the MacArthur Bowl to its nation­al champion since 1959. Notre Dame has won it on five occasions-1964, '66 (tie with Michigan State), '73, '77 and '88.

T
he.1924 Notre Dame football team will always be known best for New York Herald Tribune sportswriter Grantland Rice's account of the Notre D~me vs. Army game played October 18 
at the Polo Grounds in New York: "Outlined against a blue-gray October sky, the Four Horsemen rode again. 
"In dramatic lore they are known as famine, pesti­lence, destruction and death. These are only aliases. Their real names are Stuhldreher, Miller, Crowley, and Layden. They formed the crest of the South Bend cy­clone before which another fighting Army team was swept over the precipice at the Polo Grounds this afternoon as 55,000 spectators peered down on the be-·· wildering panorama spread out upon the green plain bclow:' . 
Quarterback Harry Stuhldreher, fullback Elmer Layden, and halfbacks Jim Crowley and Don Miller were the cornerstone of a team considered one of the best in collge football history. 
The Fighting Irish won the Army game 13-7, as the Four Horsemen played magnificently. Mille~ rushed for 148 yards, Crowley for 102 and Layden for 60, while Stuhldreher orchestrated the offense masterfully from the quarterback position. It was the third victory of the season for the Irish, it came against a foe considered the toughest on the schedule, and it spurred the Irish on to a perfect 10-0 season and the school's first recog­nized national championship. . 
Rice's account led to near-mythic status for the Irish. backfield, but the Seven Mules, who did the blocking, and the Shock Troops, who were perhaps the best sec­ond string in the game, played indispensible roles, too. Each week in 1924, seventh-year Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne started his second stringers, his Shock Troops. 
When Rockne felt his Shock Troops had done their job, he brought in the Four Horsemen and the Seven Mules, a group so good "that the Holy Ghost couldn't have broken into that lineup," said Harry O'Boyle, a kicker and reserve halfback on the Shock Troops. Cen­ter Andy Walsh was the heart of the Seven Mules, a group that also included ends Ed Huhsinger and Chuck Collins, tackles Rip Miller and Joe Bach, and guards Noble Kizer and John Wiebe!. Walsh characterized the grit and determination of the line when he secured the

win over Army with a late interception-which he made with two broken hands. 
The combination of the Shock Troops, the Seven Mules, and the Four Horsemen worked 10 times in 10 tries in 1924 against a national schedule that took the Irish to New York, Princeton, N.J., Madison, Wis., Sol­dier Field in Chicago, and Pittsburgh during the regular season while giving the team only four home games. In addition, ·at the end of the season, Rockne was able to convince the University administration to permit the football team to travel to California to play Stanford in the Rose Bowl, where the Irish clinched the Helms Athletic Foundation's ·national championship with a 27-10 victot,"y over the Indians. 
In the Rose Bowl-Notre Dame's only bowl appear­ance until the team began making regular bowl trips with the 1970 Cotton Bowl -the Irish were faced with stopping an undefeated, once-tied Stanford team that included legendary coach Pop Warner ·and fullback Ernie Nevers. Rockne was concerned his players might not be ready physically for the heat of the West Coast, so he arranged for a slow, cross-country train trip that included stops in Louisiana, Texas and Arizona so play­ers. would have time to adjust to warmer, more de­manding weather. 
It worked, as Elmer Layden scored Notre Dame's first touchdown on a three-yard run and returned in­terceptions of Nevers' passes 78 and 70 yards for two more touchdowns. The Irish took advantage of eight Stanford turnovers and made a critical goal-line stand in the fourth quarter to come up with the 17 -point win. 
"That would always be my favorite team," Rockne once said. "I think I sensed that the backfield was a product of destiny. At times they caused me a certain amount of pain and exasperation, but mainly they brought me great joy:'

filling that promise. 

The closest the Irish came to having a home game in 1929 were three games contested at Soldier Field in Chicago. The Irish defeated Wisconsin there, 19-0, Oc­tober 19, Drake, 19-7, November 9, and USC in the most important game of the year, 13-12, before 112,912 fans on November 16. 
The lack of home turf was not the only major diffi­culty of the 1929 season for Notre Dame. The team's legendary coach was in battle with phlebitis, which doctors said stood a 50-50 chance of taking Rockne's life if he tried to coach that season. But coach the team he did, through one dramatic victory after another, ei­ther by telephone from a hospital bed or from a wheel­chair on the sidelines. 
Rockne's leg problems began during the following week and the announcement was made that he would not accompany the team on its trip to Baltimore to face Navy. Line coach Tom Lieb took over for Rockne that day, as the Irish won 14-7. But back in South Bend, doctor's orders couldn't keep Rock away from practice at Cartier. Field, where he set.up his command post in his car and used a loudspeaker to direct activities. 
By the time the USC contest rolled around, the Irish were 6-0 and recognized as one of the top teams in the nation. Running back)oe Savoldi had earned acclaim in the Wisconsin game with dazzling touchdown runs of 71 and 40 yards, and he provided the only score of the game in Notre Dame'sa 7-0 win at Carnegie Tech Octo­ber 26. 
When the Irish faced USC at Soldier Field November 16, Rockne's status was as bad as ever, but the team

needed him. The Notre Dame-USC tradition was al­ready a great one, and the firs·t half foretold the kind of game everyone expected, with the teams battling to a 6-6 tie. In the lockerroom, the Fighting Irish were in desperate need of one of Rock's famous speeches, but he was nowhere to be found. So former Irish running back Paul Castner stepped up to do what he could, and in the middle of his oration, who should two Irish managers wheel into the room but Rockne himself. 
He was in great pain and had undergone quite a strain-not only from making the trip to Chicago but also from watching his team struggle in the first half. He gave an impassioned speech with what strength he had, during which a blood clot in one leg broke loose, _ passed through his heart ·and settled safely in the other leg. His speech worked, as the Irish escaped Chicago with a 13-12 win and an umblemished 7-0 record. 
The Irish still had traditional foes Northwestern and Army left. Northwestern fell relatively easy, as the Irish posted a 26-6 win on the Wildcats' home field. But the November 30 matchup with Army at Yankee Stadium proved to be a real battle. 
The game was played on turf that was frozen solid, and neither team was able to accomplish anything. It was eight degrees at gametime and a biting wind cut across the field as the players dashed out for the open­ing kic_koff. 
The first quarter was scoreless, but in the second period Army drove deep into Irish territory. When Red Cagle lofted a pass for his end, Carl Carlmark, it looked like a certain score for the Cadets. But Notre Dame's jack Elder came out of nowhere to snatch the ball away. He took it 93 yards for the game's only touch­down. The extra point was added to make it 7-0 Irish, and that's the way it stayed. 
Notre Dame was 9-0 and the season .was over. The team had survived without a home, Rockne had sur­vived his illness and Notre Dame had its second nation­al championship.

rand new.stadium, same old result -another national championship for the Notre Dame football team. · . The 1930 football season marked the open­ing of Notre Dame Stadium, just another in the long line of Knute Rockne masterpieces, only this was a football stadium instead of a team. With typical Rockne meticulosity, he had supervised every minute detail of the construction of the stadium. 
In addition, Rockne had for the first time a full-time equipment manager, a trainer, a doctor who traveled with the team, a business manager, several secretaries, and a staff to handle the complex sale and distribution of tickets. On top of all that, Rockne was healthy again. The doctors at the Mayo Clinic had given him a thor-' ough going-over from head to foot during the offsea­son and had given him a clean bill of health. 
All the Rock had to do was coach, and what a job he did. 
On October 4, 1920, the Fighting Irish opened their season in the imposing new stadium -an impressive amphitheatre of dull rod brick· trimmed with lime­stone. Rockne had the original sod from Cartier Field transplanted just for good measure. 
The Irish christened the good earth with a 20-14 win over Southern Methodist. The stadium was officially dedicated the following week, as Notre Dame trounced Navy, 26-2. In the third week of the season, Notre Dame played its third straight home game, defeating Carnegie Tech, 21-6, to cap off a successful first home­stand. 
Preseason prognosticators across the country consid­ered the 1930 Notre Dame team to be Rockne's strong­est yet. Rockne has said as much himself prior to the start of the season, and he had good reason for such high expectations. Frank Carideo, Marchy Schwartz, Marty Brill and Jumpin' joe Savoldi made up a latter day version of the Four Horsemen in the backfield, and all of them earned all-America status on one team or another that season. The Fighting Irish were not only stocked with an explosive collection of running backs, but the team also sported a tremendous crew of line­men. Center Tommy Yarr, guards Nordy Hoffmann and Bert Metzger, tackles joe Kurth and AI Culver, and end Tom Conley all made all-America teams either that sea­son or the following one.

eighth weeks of the season but continued to roll. Notre Dame traveled to Pitt and beat the Panthers, 35-19. A 27-0 romp over Indiana followed, before the Irish vis­ited a C?0-20 walloping on the Quakers of Pennsylvania. Marty Brill, who had transferred. to Notre Dame from Pennsylvania, played the greatest game of his career that day, breaking loose for three touchdowns on runs of 45, 52 and 65 yards. 
The Notre Dame winning streak stood at 15 games over two seasons, and it quickly grew to 17 as the Irish sprinted past Drake and Northwestern. All that re­mained between Notre Dame and another national title were games against Army and USC. 
On a November 29 afternoon that saw rain and sleet turn Soldier Field into a swamp, the Cadets and the Irish squared off, and it appeared that neither team was going to budge. Near the end of the game, however, Schwartz broke loose for a 54-yard scoring run. The all-important extra point gave the Irish a 7-0 lead. Ar­my scored quickly thereafter, though, on a blocked punt, and it appeared that things would be knotted up. But Notre Dame blocked the extra point, and that's the w~y it ended. 
To finish off the season, Rockne used all his psycho­logical expertise in a ploy that helped the Irish get ready for USC. Injuries during the season left the team with only one healthy fullback, Dan Hanley. So Rock decided to turn Bucky O'Connor, a second-team half­back, into a first-string fullback. However, in practice, Rock had O'Connor and Hanley trade jerseys, and not a single soul suspected anything unusual. 
When the game got underway, Notre Dame had one of the speediest fullbacks the Trojan defense had ever seen. O'Connor scored two touchdowns, including one on an 80-yard dash, and the Irish dominated the favored home team to the tune of 27-0. 
It was a fitting script to what turned out to be Rock­ne's final game as the Notre Dame head football-coach. The team won its second consecutive national champi­onship, and the following winter Rockne died in a plane crash in Kansas.

1943 

t the beginning of the 1943 season many ex­
perts called Notre Dame's schedule its most 
difficult in school history. The Irish faced sev­
n teams that season that were ranked among the nation's top 13 teams in the final Associated Press Poll. 
Frank Leahy's squad only had two returning starters from the '42 squad that finished 7-2-2. To make matters worse·, seven of the 10 games in '43 were on the road. 
The Irish were still in the early stages of adjusting to the T -formation, which Leahy installed the season be­fore, moving away from the traditional Notre Dame "Box Formation." The new offense enabled the '43 team to score 340 points, 156 more than the season before. The T-formation also led to the emergence of Angelo Bertelli, who moved from tailback to quarter­back to lead the Irish offense. 
Bertelli led the Irish to a 6-0 start as the team out­scored its opponents 261-31. Included in that stretch were key victories over second-ranked Michigan and third-ranked Navy. 
A record crowd of 85,688 witnessed the 35-12 Irish win in Ann Arbor. Bertelli was brilliant, completing five of eight passes for two touchdowns while all­America running back Creighton Miller averaged 16 yards per play against Michigan. 
Led by Bertelli and all-America tackle Jim White, both of whom finished· in the top 10 in the Reisman balloting that year, the Irish rolled on to a 50-0 victory over Wisconsin and a 47-0 bashing of Illinois following the win over Michigan, to extend their record to 5-0. 
Those wins were followed by a colossal matchup be­tween top-ranked Notre Dame and third-ranked Navy in Cleveland. The Irish cruised to a 33-6 win but lost their quarterback. The Marine Corps called Bertelli into

service with four games left in the season. 
Leahy called on a sophomore to be Bertelli's replace­ment in the following week's game against Army, the third-ranked team in the country that week. 
All Bertelli's replacement did was throw for two touchdowns, run for another and intercept a pass to lead the Irish to a 26-0 win. A new star was.born-the incomprable John Lujack. 
With Lujack calling the signals, the Irish defeated two more top 10 teams in the following two weeks, Northwestern and Iowa Pre-Flight. 
All that stood between Leahy's ·first undefeated and untied season was Great Lakes, a team that the Irish had tied in their two previous meetings during the 1918 and 1942 seasons. · , Notre Dame scored first but trailed 12-7 late in the fourth quarter. Miller capped off an 80-yard drive with a touchdown to put the Irish ahead 14-12 with 1:05 to play. 
With 3 3 seconds remaining, Great Lakes quarterback Steve Lach connected on a 46-yard pass to Paul Ander­son, who fielded the ball at the six-yard line and then went into the end zone for the game-winning score, ruining Notre Dame's perfect season. 
After the game, Leahy told his team, "You're still champions to me, boys. You fought your hearts out every inch of the way in the greatest drive I've ever seen. Nobody is to blame for that last Great Lakes touchdown. It was just a fine play, splendidly exe­cuted'.'' 
Despite the season-ending loss, Notre Dame picked up several awards that would soon become common­place for the school. The Irish were crowned national champions by the Associated Press for the first time ever and Bertelli became the first Notre Dame player to win the Reisman Trophy. 
Bertelli easily outdistanced Bob O'Dell of Pennsylva­nia and Otto Graham of Northwestern for the Reis­man.

1946 
W
orld War II had finally ended and the United States was ready to think about 
something more pleasant than interna­
tional conflict for a change-like Notre Dame football. The year was 1946, the coach was hard-driving Frank Leahy and it was the beginning of a dynasty for Notre Dame football. 
In 1943, Leahy had guided the Fighting Irish to their first wire-service national championship, and fourth overall, behind Reisman Trophy winner Angelo Bertelli and future Reisman winner John Lujack. World War II took many football players away from college, includ­ing Bertelli in the middle of his Reisman campaign in '43, but many returned to tqe gridiron after the war ended, including Lujack, who would go on to win the Reisman in 1947. 
For the players who returned to Notre Dame in '46, losing a college football game was not to be one of their post-war experiences. From 1946 to 1949, Notre Dame went 36-0-2 and won three national champion­ships in one of the most successful four-year periods in college football history. 
The 1946 season started it all. Halfback Terry Bren­nan and linemen Bill Walsh, Bill Fischer, and John Mas­trangelo were among the group of returnees from the previous season. There were several new faces who came to Notre Dame after Navy hitches had interrupt­ed their respective careers at Holy Cross and Texas A&M. There were also players for whom the war had postponed college football, like end Jim Martin and running back Emil (Red) Sitko, and there were fresh­men like Leon Hart. Returning to Notre Dame along with Lujack were veterans such as tackle Zygmont (Ziggy) Czarobski, end Jack Zilly, and fullback Jim Mel­lo. Even Leahy was coming back to Notre Dame after a

couple years in the service. 
Leahy was a perfectionist and strict disciplinarian, and enduring his practices wasn't much more fun than being a soldier. But it sure produced results. The Irish usually had two separate platoons ready for each game, and often the first string didn't play much more than half the game. On the. football field, the Irish had strength in numbers, and Leahy fought a war of attri­tion. 
The season began with the Irish routing their first five opponents -Illinois, which went on to win the Western (now Big Ten) conference championship, Pitts­burgh, Purdue, Iowa, and Navy before facing top­ranked Army. Coached by the great Earl (Red) Blaik and featuring Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis in the backfield, Army had won.two straight national champi­onships and 25 straight games, including two defeats of Notre Dame in the previous two seasons by a com­bined score of 1 07-0. 
The showdown was set for November 9 in Yankee Stadium, where 7 4, 121 fans turned out to see a 0-0 tie. Notre Dame advanced to the Army four-yard line in the second quarter for the game's deepest scoring threat, but the Cadets held on downs. Blanchard broke into the clear once and appeared to be headed for a score, but an open-field tackle by Lujack saved the Irish from defeat. 
Army retained its top ranking in the :Associated Press poll after the gaine. But the Irish walloped their final three opponents by a·combined score of 94-6 and were named national champions in the final poll of the sea­son. When the smoke cleared, the Irish found themsel­ves the nation's statistical leaders in total offense 
(441.3 yards per game), rushing offense (340.1 yards per game), total defense (141.7 yards per game) and scoring defense (2.7 points per game) and had allowed only Illinois, Purdue, Iowa, and USC to score points against them. For the season, Notre Dan1e outscored its opponents 271 to 24 in nine games. 
It was only the beginning.

1947 
n any discussion of college football's greatest 
teams, one team that always comes to mind is the 
1947 Notre Dame squad. The Irish never trailed in 
any game that year and compiled a 9-0 record, their first unblemished record in 17 years. 
Notre Dame held its opponents to under six points a game while averaging over 32 points. Only one team -Northwestern-scored more than one touchdown against the Irish thatyear. But maybe the most impres­sive note about the squad is that it sent 42 players to professional football. 
The mainstays on that team included consensus all­Americas George Connor, Bill Fischer andJohn Lujack, who won the Reisman Trophy that year. The team also included future Reisman winner Leon Hart and the man who later succeeded Leahy as head coach of the Irish, Terry Brennan. 
The Irish began the season with six turnovers against Pittsburgh, but Lujack scored three times to lead Notre Dame to an easy 40-6 win. Leahy's squad stumbled a little bit in the next game, too, but came out ahead of Purdue, 22-7. 
Notre Dame then exploded for three consecutive shutouts over Nebraska (3I-O), Iowa (21-0) and Navy (27-0). The win over the Cornhuskers avenged a I7-0 loss that Knute Rockne's I925 squad suffered to Ne­braska, the last time the two schools had met. 
Following three impressive shutouts, the Irish faced Army, a team that had become such a fierce rival in previous years that the series was discontinued for I 0 years after the 1947 game. The two teams battled to a 0-0 tie in I946 in one of the most famous games in Notre Dame history. 
Notre Dame entered the game as the top-ranked team in the country while Army was rated eighth. The

Irish struck first when Brennan broke loose for a 97­yard kickoff return. Notre Dame built a 20-0 lead be­fore Army finally scored. The Irish won 27-7 before a record crowd of 59, I7I at Notre Dame Stadium. 
The next week was the only close game of the year. Northwestern became the only team in I947 to come within two touchdowns of the Irish as Notre Dame won 26-I9. 
The Irish ended the season with a 59-6 thrashing of Tulane and an impressive 38-7 win over third-ranked Southern California. When the final national polls came out, Notre Dame was No. I for the second straight year. 
Just how good was this '47 team? Well, consider that several of the first string players that year (such as Brennan) didn't even try out for professional football but opted to coach instead. 
The great '47 squad also included six players who were elected into the National Football Foundation Hall of Fame -Lujack, Connor, Hart, Fischer, Sitko and Ziggy Czarobski. And to top that off, their coach, Frank Leahy, wound up the second winningest coach in college history just behind his mentor, Knute Rock­ne. 
The Boston Herald called the '47 Irish team, "the greatest Notre Dame squad of all time. Its third string could whip most varsities." 
The immortal sportswriter Grantland Rice added af­ter the final game of the season, ''There no longer is any doubt as to the best team in college football, it happens to be Notre Dame. College football never be­fore has known a team so big, so fast and so experi­enced.'' 
His words may still hold true today.

1949 
N
ovember 15, 1945 ranks as one of the most important dates in Notre Dame football histo­ry. Check the record books, though, and you won't find one of the greatest games in Irish history played on that day. 
November 15, 1945, was a Thursday,. not a Satur­day, and that was the day Lieutenant Frank Leahy was discharged from the Navy..He returned to the Notre Dame campus, signed a 10-year contract, and began what was to be one of the most successful four-year runs in college football history. 
The 1946 and 1947 seasons brought national cham­pionships to Notre Dame. The 9-0.:1 1948 team was runner-up to Michigan. But a national championship in 1949 would allow Notre Dat:ne to close out the decade in magnificent style. 
And that is exactly what happened. Notre Dame went 10-0 which made for a four-year mark of 36-0-2. End Leon Hart won the Reisman Trophy and Leahy had his fourth championship and the school's seventh. 
Before the season, however, nobody expected a championship team to emerge from the South Bend campus. The Irish needed somebody to emerge as a leader and attention was focused on Leon Hart, already recognized as the finest end in the college game, along with Emil Sitko, Larry Coutre and co-captain Jim Mar­tin. But most observers agreed that the Fighting Irish would need more than that. 
Soon enough, they got it. In the sixth game of the season, against Michigan State on November 5, quarter­back Bob Williams stepped to the fore. He led the top­ranked Irish to a 34-21 victory over the lOth-ranked Spartans in a game at East Lansing that the press thought would knock Notre Dame from its lofty perch atop collegiate football.

Williams continued to shine in subsequent games. He was at his daring best the following week in a game versus North Carolina played at Yankee Stadium. Leahy had given Williams instructions that he was never to pass the football on the fourth down situation on their own 19-yard l.ine with the score tied 6-6 in the second quarter. He couldn't help himself. Knowing that if he failed he'd have to head for the nearest exit to avoid Leahy, the self-assured Williams completed an 18-yard pass to Larry Coutre for an Irish first down. Notre Dame went on to a 42-6 win, and Williams soon be­came recognized as the nation's best quarterback. 
The Irish eased through their final two home games, rolling over Iowa, 28-7, and 17th-ranked Southern Cal, 32-0. All that remained was what was sure to be an easy win over Southern Methodist in Dallas. SMU would be without its top player, 1948 Reisman winner Doak Walker, and the nation had virtually conceded the national championship to Notre Dame. 
Notre Dame jumped to an early lead before Mustang running back Kyle Rote came to life in the steady after­noon drizzle. Running at will, he scored two quick touchdowns and thanks to a missed extra point by SMU, the score was tied at 20 with seven minutes to go. 
Notre Dame's back was to the wall for the first time all season, ·and the offense rose to the occasion. In blitzkrieg fashion, the Irish simply pushed SMU straight back into its own endzone with 10 determined rushes that covered 54 yards and put Notre Dame up by a touchdown, 27-20. 
The drive was so quick, however, that SMU still had time to score. But in the shadow of the Notre Dame goal post, when Rote tried to pass for the tying touch­down, Notre Dame's Jerry Groom made a game-saving interception. 
It was the final play of the game and qf a decade that saw Frank Leahy _lead the Fighting Irish to three nation­al championships in four years.

C 
oach Ara Parseghian, in his third season at No­tre Dame, made a difficult decision at the start of the '66 season, picking sophomore Terry Hanratty as his starting quarterback over class­mate Coley O'Brien, yet the decision proved without a doubt to be the correct one. Hanratty and split end Jim Seymour, also a sophomore, turned out to be one of the best passing combinations Notre Dame fans had ev­er seen. 
The two had begun working together during the pre­vious winter, developing their timing, moves and pat­terns so they would know each. other's habits inside and out when the 1966 season began. Seymour was a good bet to take over one of the end positions that was being vacated after the '65 season, but Hanratty had no such assurances of whether or not he would be the number-one quarterback. 
Fortunately for Hanratty, Parseghian decided to bal­ance an already solid running game, manned by Nick Eddy, Larry Conjar ana Rocky Bleier, with the passing talent of Hanratty. 
The decision bore fruit in the first game of the sea­son, as Hanratty and Seymour hooked up 13 times for 276 yards, Notre Dame records for receptions and yards, and three touchdowns, which tied a school re­cord. The Irish defeated Rose Bowl-bound Purdue that day, 26-14 in South Bend, and it was off to the races for the Irish. 
Notre Dame traveled to Northwestern for the second game of the season and won, 35-7. The Irish defense . gave up its last points for the next three games and showed the kind of stiffness that ensured Notre Dame would never be out of any contest. Notre Dame re­turned home for the next two games and defeated Ar­my and North Carolina by a combined score of 67-0,

setting the stage for a showdown with Oklahoma. 
Notre Dame traveled to Norman for what was sup­posed to be anybody's ballgame. The game was billed as a matchup between the small, quick, strong Sooners and the big, slow Irish. But Oklahoma was out of its depth that day. Although the Irish lost Seymour to an ankle injury that would cost him two games; the Fight­ing Irish rolled to a 38-0 victory and their third straight shutout of the young season. 
Notre Dame pounded its next three opponents ­Navy, Pittsburgh and Duke, giving up only one score, a touchdown to Navy. Meanwhile, the offense was hit­ting on all cylinders, racking up 31 points versus the Midshipmen, 40 against Pitt and a whopping 64 against the Blue Devils. · 
The game of the century in 1966 took place on No­vember 19 when number-one ranked Notre Dame trav­eled to East Lansing, Mich:, to play ·second-ranked Michigan State for all the marbles. 
Notre Dame fell behind 10-0 in the second quarter, but 0 'Brien, who had been diagnosed with diabetes only a few weeks earlier -and was still adjusting, brought the Irish back to tie in the second half. The Spartan offense was unable to net a single yard running the ball in the second half, and when Notre Dame in­tercepted a pass and returned it to the Spartan 18-yard line in the fourth quarter, it looked like Notre Dame's chance to win. But three plays and minus-six yards lat­er left the Irish with a 41-yard field goal attempt, which sailed wide to the right. 
Notre Dame had the ball again on its own 30 with 
1:24 left in the game. But rather than gamble with passes so deep in their own territory, the Irish attempt­ed to run the ball out of danger. The game ended in a 10-10 tie. 
The Irish held on to their top ranking and traveled to Los Angeles to play Rose Bowl-bound USC. The Irish tore the Trojans apart, 51-0, posting the team's sixth shutout in 10 games and ensuring another unanimous number-one selection for the national championship.

1973 
E
very college football season seems to have its own game of the century, but the 1973 match­
up between Notre Dame and Alabama was spe­
cial. It came in the Sugar Bowl, and it was to be a dream game. 
Two undefeated, highly-ranked teams with long and storied gridiron traditions were set to battle for the national championship. 
The prognosticators' predictions rang true as the Fighting Irish emerged 24-23 victors over the Crimson Tide of Alabama in a thriller that saw the lead change hands six times. 
Bob Thomas, who had missed two earlier attempts in the game, kicked a 19-yard ·field goal with 4:26 re­maining to give the Irish and coach Ara Parseghian the one-point triumph over top-rated Alabama. The win clinched Notre Dame's sixth wire-service national championship and ninth overall as the Irish finished the season with a perfect 11-0 record. 
The balanced Irish attack was keyed by four backs who gained over 300 yards apiece: fullback Wayne Bullock (752), halfback Art Best (700), halfback Eric Penick (586) and quarterback Tom Clements (360). It was one of the fastest backfields Notre Dame had ever assembled, as Penick had 9.5 speed in the 100-yard dash, while Best checked in at 9. 7. 
The Irish were ranked in the eighth spot with wins over Rice .and Army, setting the stage for what every­one considered to be Notre Dame's first real test of the year, a home battle with sixth-ranked USC. 
The Trojans came to town riding a 23-game unbeaten streak, and Notre Dame was full of memories of the previous season's clash, which saw running back An­thony Davis romp for six touchdowns in a 55-24 Trojan win.

Squib kicks were the solution to the problem of Davis returning kicks, and a fired up defense held him to just 55 yards on 19 carries. Quite simply, the day belonged to Notre Dame, as Penick ran for 118 yards, 50 more than the entire USC squad. The Irish pulled off a 23-14 win and jumped to fifth in the polls. 
Notre Dame cruised through the remainder of the schedule. Navy was an easy victim, 44-7, and 20th­ranked Pittsburgh played the docile host to the Irish and fell 31-10. The Irish finished off Parseghian 's first perfect regular season with a 48-15 win over Air Force and a 44-0 whitewashing of Miami at the Orange Bowl. 
The stage was set for the contest between number­one Alabama and third.:.ranked Notre Dame that seemed to deserve every phrase of its high-powered buildup. The Irish opened the contest with a superb defensive effort that held the Tide without a yard in the first period as Notre Dame took a 6-0 lead. Ala­bama's thoroughbred backs made it out of the starting gate in the second period, however. They produced three long drives that resulted in a pair of touchdowns, the first of which put the Tide up 7-6. 
Early in the fourth quarter, the game took a wild turn with three turnovers in 90 seconds. Alabama took charge and put in its own version of the razzle-dazzle. With the ball on the Notre Dame 25, quarterback Rich­ard Todd handed off to halfback Mike Strock, then raced to the sidelines where he took a return pass from Stock and went· in for the score. But Alabama missed the conversion try and the Tide had only a slim two­point lead. 
Notre Dame then marched 79 yards in 11 plays. Strong runs by Hunter, Penick and Clements and a 30­yard pass from Clements to Dave Casper carried the drive to the Alabama 15-yard line. The Irish got to the three, but couldn't get any closer before the call went to Thomas. His kick was true, the game belonged to the Irish, and so did the national championship.

feated Texas 38-10 in the 1978 Cotton 
Bowl? A fierce Terry Eurick was pictured fighting through a hole in the offensive line, the cap­tion reading, "The Irish Wake the Echoes." On the in­side, "Shakin' Down the Thunder" was the title of an article about how Notre Dame's victory over the previ­ously-unbeaten Longhorns was enough to vault the . Irish from fifth to first in the wire-service polls and give the University its seventh wire service national championship and 1Oth overall. 
The theme for that January 2 in Dallas could have been "and then there were none." For there was not one unbeaten team remaining after the Irish had knocked Texas from its No. I ranking. 
Third-year Irish coach Dan Devine made sure his charges were ready to take care·of America's last unde­feated team. An unrelenting defense was the reason why. The defense featured 1976 Outland Trophy win­ner Ross Browner at one end and Willie Fry at the oth­er, supported by a tough, mobile group of Unebackers headed by all-America, Bob Golic. The Irish forced six ·Texas turnovers in the Cotton Bowl, and an opportun­istic offense capitalized on five of them. In addition, Notre Dame's devastating strength in the trenches roped up Texas' Heisman Trophy winner Earl Camp­bell. He managed a tough 116 yards on 29 carries. 
Notre Dame's defensive strength came as no surprise in 1977, and it was the primary reason the Irish were near the top of the polls in the pre-season rankings. But it was an unexpected boost from the offense that gave Notre Dame the national championship in 1977. Quar­terbackJoe Montana and running backJerome Heavens both rebounded on offense, teaming with all-America

tight end Ken MacAfee, who led the team in receiving for the third straight year. 
The offense came on strong in 1977, however, as Montana threw for over 1,600 yards and II touch­downs and Heavens led the team with 994 rushing yards. Montana earned a reputation as "The Comeback Kid" with performances like the one he had in the third game of the season when, in his first appearance hi over a year, he engineered the Irish to 17 fourth­quarter points in Notre Dame's come-from-behind 31­24 win at Purdue. Later in the season, the Irish had to travel to Death Valley in Clemson, S.C., to play the 15th-ranked Tigers, and Montana scored two fourth­quarter touchdowns to bring the Irish from behind for a 21-17 win. 
Heavens was healthy again in 1977 and he joined the explosive' Vagas Ferguson behind Montana. Heavens proved himself fully recovered with 136 yards against Michigan State in the fourth game of the season. He followed his outburst against the Spartans with a Notre Dame-record 200 yards rushing versus Army, and two weeks later he went for 100 against Navy. 
But the key regular season win came in a mid-season 49-19 thrashing of fifth-ranked USC in Notre Dame Sta­dium. In that one, the Irish warmed up in their ususal blue jerseys, only to emerge in green just prior to kick­off. That triumph helped wipe out the memory of No­tre Dame's second-game road loss, a 20-13 defeat at Ole Miss that proved its sole '77 blemish. 
The Irish ran out to a 24-10 halftime lead in the Cot­ton Bowl and then added touchdowns in each of the final quarters for an overwhelming 28-point victory. Few. questioned who was number one. 
Notre Dame leapfrogged over the four teams ranked ahead of it to grab the nation's top position. The Irish did, indeed, wake the echoes and shake down the thunder.

Epilogue 
By Bernie Lincicome Chicago Tribune 
While there is no proof that a national championship for Notre Dame makes the world a better place, it does help it make more sense in an age of fewer and fewer sure things. 
The Marines. General Motors. The New York Yankees. Mother's milk. None of these things is any longer entirely reliable. 
Golf and tennis, the games of capitalism, have become Third World toys. Basketball gold medals hang around the necks of Soviets and Brazilians. 
·This is the time of the underdog as bully. Kansas City, Minnesota, the Dodgers in baseball. Villanova and Kansas in college basketball. Clemson and Brigham Young in college football. Whoever wins the next Su­per Bowl. 
Fables become redundant facts. Jack always cuts down the beanstalk. Little Red Riding Hood always gets rescued. The slipper always 
fits. · Sugar Ray Leonard waxes Marvelous Mar­vin Hagler. 
But on a vague winter day in the crude des­ert, in a bowl game longer on ambition than on tradition or good taste, reason returned with the new year. 
Notre Dame made the world safe for brand names. 
The Irish ended all arguments, as well as the fantasy of West Virginia, disguised only briefly as Cinderella. 
No confirming vote is needed. The best 



team of now is the best team of then, a legacy confirmed, a mission satisfied. 
"Is this a great team?". asked Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz without prompting. "Yes, because· nobody proved it wasn't." 
Not Michigan early or Miami in the middle or Southern Cal late. ­
Certainly not the Mountaineers, rubes in the wrong city, waiting to be sold a bridge. They played as ~f they had just gQtten off the bus or coulQ.n't wait to catch the next one. 
"We are a better team than we showed," said (West Virginia) coach Don Nehlen. 
Maybe so. It does not matter. They did the sense of order a great service by being there wheri Notre Dame needed them, conveniently unbeaten and vulnerable. 
Their one celebrated weapon, Major Harris, though impaired early, was not the best quarterback on the field, just as Steve Walsh of Miami and Rodney Peete of USC before him were not. 
Tony Rice again exceeded the other quarter­back and was named star of the game, a task made easier by the energetic Notre Dame de­fense. Notre Dame quarterbacks are supposed to be better than others, even when under sus­picion. 
"For a guy who wasn't supposed to be able to throw," Nehlen sa~d, "he sure looked like he could throw to me." 
Rice completed only seven passes, but they averaged more than 30 yards each and two went for touchdowns. 
"Now he probably won't want to run the option anymore," Holtz said. 
The great service done by Rice and Notre Dame for West Virginians, who were ready to measure all time before and after this day, is to discourage them from naming future male children Major. 
As for the rest of us, we are relieved from having to request a resume with our latest champion, even if Holtz himself needs further convincing. 
"I underestimated this team," Holtz admit­ted. "They've done everything I've asked. They've won every game. They are 12-0. 
"If not for us, Miami and West Virginia and USC would be undefeated. This has to go down as an excellent team. What they do best is they find a way to win." 
Of course they do. 

That is what we expect from Notre Dame.
