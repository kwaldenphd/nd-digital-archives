Sotne Pre-Sea-son Dope 
By \Yf. T. Fox, JR. 
NOTRE DAME, IND., Sept. 18-When apples grow on lilac trees and Tunney says, "I seen," it will be time enough to sell this country short on Notre Dame football prospects. 
This statement is. subscribed to by practically every member of Mr. Knute Kenneth Rockne's. board of strategy, which Mr. Rockne continues to pronquncc his annual boa.rd of tragedy. 
When one discovers Mr. Rockne refraining from his customary cigar-twisting act when discussing the approaching gridiron wars, something is very 

apt to be up. Twisting a cigar is Mr. Rockne's fa­vorite method of reflect­ing a highly nervous state; hence in refraining from so doing he becomes 
. a dead give-away. "I have no worries at ·all,'" said the prominent after-dinner speaker, im­mediately after dinner Monday evening. "We 
JOHN NIEMIEC . will not be as strong as 

we were last year, but 70 per cent is passing at Notre Dame, and .we may be able to get by. 
"My second team of last year, with one excep­tion, will be my first team this year. Practically every team we played in 1927 scored on the secon~ team in a minute and a half. Indiana scored on it in fifty seconds. Toward the end of the season the boys were showing some improvement because it took one team two minutes to score. 
"Having greater responsibilities this year, how­ever; these boys may do much better." It was suggested to Mr. Rockne that his team appeared to be a little heavier than usual. 
uyou'rc right. They arc big but they hav:e minds like chess players. They think rather late in the evening," he said. 
tt\Yfc have sixteen nationalities on the team this year-no, I guess it's seventeen, I forgot the Amer­ican," cracked Knutc. ucarrideo is the only fresh­man ·who passed his spelling, so we're living on left­overs." 
Asked to enumerate the nationalities Knute started down the list. Billie Dew is English; Christiansen, Norwegian; Chevigny, Frenchman; Carideo, Italian; Guadolno, a Spaniard; Miller, German; Niemiec, a Pole; Leppig, Lithuanian; Colrick, Bohemian; Vczie, Hungarian; Hcrwit, a 
Jew," then he hesitated momentarily, asking: "How many have you now?" uThat's eleven, Rock." 
uwcll, there's a Jugoslav, and there's an Arme­nian and an Austrian; I can't recall their names· right now. There's MacDougal for the Scotch­man, and we haven't found out wha.t Provissiero is yet. Is that enough?" he· asked.· 
«<You're one short, Rock." 
"That reminds me of a story. Stop me if you've 

heard it. It seems there 
were a couple of Irish­men--" 
And that ended the trca tise on Notre Dame and its relation to the world court of football . 
· All this took place around the dinner table in the LaSalle hotel, where Alderman George 
M. Maypole, of Chicago; 


Clarence Sweeney and GEORGE LEPP~G Mike Duffecy, of Indian­
apolis, and this correspondent endeavored to find out just how the boss· of the Fighting Irish feels about his 192 8 football team. 
He is in rare spirits this season, and while every­thing blue he says about his men is undoubtedly true, things seem to be in pretty fair shape for the season. Rockne appeared on the field about 3:30 with his chief assistant, John. Clipper Smith, Notre Dame's All-American guard of 1927. He went immediately to the center of the field and led his band of battlers in some musical comedy steps. 
uup on your toes, down on your heels!" shout­ed Rockne. But ·it was not the beginning of the Varsity Drag at all. \Vhilc this was going on one tardy member slipped into the ranks while Knute's back was turned. He whipped around in the op­posite direction a little later and spied the new cus­tomer among the 150 in the big circle. · 
"You're a little late for rehearsal, a.rcn't you, Clarence?" he chanted. 
The preliminaries disposed of, Rockne called his boys about .him and then without any reference to notebooks he called out, one by one, eighty-eight names. At stop eleven each time there was a wild whoopee as a full team started off into signal drill. 
·Over in another part of the field, Tommy Mills, head freshman coach, assisted by Poliskcy, one of the 1927 tackles, worked with some 200 freshmen.

They ran out of suits at the 200 mark and the re­maining candidates for the freshman team were outfitted today. Rockne slipped over to have a look at this group and returned in a less cheerful mood. Apparently he saw no Gipps or Granges. 
A truck labeled uMovietone" bearing a New · York license rolled into the ground and Rockne was called into executive session. The decision was that the picture men should watch the practice, see 

what they would care to take in the way of pic­tures, and return at 3 : 15. 
Captain Howard Ed­wards of 19 09 team drifted in and so did Frank Loughlin, 1920 .captain. 
uHow are your false teeth this year, Cap?" cracked Rockne. 

JOHN CHEVIGNY · ..Just as well as that hair restorer you bought m Europe," ·was the reply.. This was answered by one wild roar from Rockne! .. Everybody. out!" 


BRING BEAUTY INTO YOUR KITCHEN 
Glistening porcelain enamel -beautiful colors-graceful design -make this Crown Range a veritable picture for. your kitchen. It has that touch of color harmony needed to bring an air of happiness into the busiest room in every home. 
Just a stroke of a damp cloth will renew its shining porcelain beauty, inside and out. 
l;en student managers took care of that at once, although the crowd didn't lag any. 
Again there w:is a general roundup and Rockne stood before his men in stern silence. -When the last of the visitors had left the field, Rockne looked 
over those who had been told to remain. He spied one young rna~ in a light suit. 
.. \X'ho's that in that white suit?" he shouted. The answer came ringing back and it was okay. Then he turned to his men. 
..Our practices are 


short, men. Whatever we 
JOHN LAW

do. out here we will do Saturday afternoons. \X'e must take every step with that upp.ermost in mind." 
That ended the speech making. The quiet stopped. The men knew what was to come next­dummy scrimmage-and they tore into it as if the Army, the Navy and all of California were facing them. It was indeed a spirited workout. 
. The Crown Range has every desirable modern improvement. Two-way burners, oven temper­ature control, four-wall, heat­holding oven construction, and 
many other time and labor­saving features. Make your cooking a pleasant and easy task! See the complete Crown Range Line at your neighbor­hood store. \Vrite or 'phone for the name of the Crown 'dealer nearest to your home.

ROM the point of view of sports11tanship and courage, I can say that our 1928 eleven is without question one of the greatest that ever represented Notre Da11ze. That the tea11z lost 1nore ga11zes than Notre Da11ze tea11zs ordin­arily lose does not detract fro11z its greatness. Its 1ne11zbers were good winners and good losers. In fact, it was while they were losing that the·y showed to the bes~ ·advantage those qualities which Notre Da11ze 1nen strive to attain. Never have I coached 1nen who fought harder or played 1nore daringly when the gd11ze was going ~gainst the11z; they never ceased to fight even when their case was hopeless and defeat inevitable . . 
The tea11z was inexperienced when the season started and further handicapped by the loss; through injury, of a nu1nber of the 1·egulars at critical #11zes. Despite these set-bacl~s, the 1nen tackled a schedule that called for their 1neeting at least five of the country's best tea11zs; and it was only natural that they should lose now and then. After disheartening losses to Wisconsin and Georgia Tech they showed their courage by staging a brilliant co1ne-back f!gainst the A1·1ny, a tea11z that had been justly acclai11zed one of the 1nost powerful in the count1·y. They went into the ga11ze the underdogs, and through fight alone outplayed and defeated their heavier and -1nore experienced _opponents. Because of the fighting 
.spirit they displayed then and at af! other ti11zes, I have only praise. for Captain Miller and the tea11z of 1928.

HE honor of leading the 1928 teant, cOn­ferred upon 11ze by 11tJI teant 1nates is, to 1ne, the realization of an ideal. And now, after laying aside for the last. thne the reghnentals of 1ny school, it is 1ny desire to express, in whatever words I can, the debt of gratitude tbat I feel is _due to 1ny teant 1nates, 1ny fellow students, and Coach Rockne. The 1nanner in whicb ever·y 1nan on tbe varsity squad fought against odds, great or snzall, against every arising obstacle, bas hnplanted in 1ne tbe deepest feelings of ad11ziration and gratitude. The 1nen deserve tbe greatest praise· tbat Notre Danze can possibly give tbe11z. . To tbe student bod~y, I can onlJ' say tbat never before did a Notre Danre tea11t receive stauncher or 1nore loyal sup port -tban did the 192 8 varsitJ'· To tbe1n, too, I a11t grateful. . Finally, tbe principles and ideals tbat Coacb Rockne bas taugbt us all will1·e1nain with us for­ever. It is witb a beart full of sincere gratitude tbat I express 1ny farewell1nessage to the school a1zd tea11t that I love so well.

KNUTE K. ROCKNE 
Head Coach 

The name uRockne" represents the ugreatest of them all." Absolutely without peer, the great coach of Notre Dame's. teams is a man who will always be reckoned with whatever master coaches ·arc being mentioned. For uRock" had a. way of coming through in the pinches that alone would distinguish him.· Against Southern California two years ago, against Northwestern the same year-in the Loyola and Army games of this year-it was Rockne's superb judgment in deciding just when to play his trump cards that won these games. 
But .in victory or defeat, every Notre Dame man anywhere 
.knows that Coach Rockne is behind his guns. There is not a coach of any major school in the na-tion whose record in any way compares with Rockne's. 
To the Notre Dame student body, Coach Rockne is the ideal. . Always respecting and revering him, th~ men of Notre Dame know that he cannot fail them. They know that their teams fight for their coach. 
The players, too, vouch for «Roc;k's" greatness. And even though they may not escape the verbal lashings and hard drivings that only uRock" can administer, nevertheless they play in thc.knowledgc that they arc glad to fight, to battle to the end for Notre Dame and for «Rock.~' 
TOMMY MILLS 
·Ass't. Coach 

When Tommy Mills was bringing his Vikings to Cartier Field, his teams were always capable of giving the Irish a stiff combat. His men never once gave up, and even though defeated, they always gave a good account of themselves. 
And now. that Tommy Mills is at No~re Dam~a~ Head Base­ball Coach and Assistant to Mr. Rockne-the fighting, determined spirit.that is so characteristic of Tommy has done much to 'make the Notre Dame teams that he coaches real Fighting Irish. 
Tommy Mills is the type of coach tha.t makes his men want to give their utmost· for him. His ruggedness and personality unite in making him ideally suited to his job. 
Notre Dame and Coach Rockne realize deeply how much Tommy Mills means to the success of Notre Dame teams on gridiron and diamond. · .

JOHN SMITH 
Ass't. Coach 

\Vhen Hartley ..Hunk" Anderson left Notre Dame's coaching staff to take up his duties as head coach at St. Louis University, he left behind him an anxious student body, and a. head coach who ought to have been anxious, but who wasn't. 
For Rock had decided that Johnny Smith, his great All-American guard of 1927, would be the best man to take ..Hunk's" place. 
The line play of the 1928. varsity showed that Joh~ny Smith is every bit as good a coach as he is a player. 
John knows his line play.. He knows· guard play particularly. And his work this year is jus.t another example of a great football player who learned the · gam~ from a master coach, and who in turn was able to impart the knowledge acquired to his successors just as effectively as Rock taught him. A ·great player and a great coach·-John Smith. 
JOHN c:c:IKE" VOEDISCH 
Ass't. Coach 

..Ike" was a mighty valu'able man in his playing days at Notre Dame. They are still talking about the time when ..Ike" so deftly cleared the last obstacle in Christie Flanagan's path in the Army game of 1926~ And now that Voedisch has been added to the Irish coaching staff, he is making him­self as valuable a coach as he was a player. 
Ike has the technique of end play down to a science. Therefore, 'his aid in helping Coach Rockne perfect the play of the line, the ends especially, has been of great value. Another invaluable assistance that ..Ike" was able to give, was in that he had. played against many of the tackles who opposed the Irish this year. ·Thus, he was able to teach this year's wing­men the best manner o£,procedure against those men. 
. The addition of a man like Voedisch to the staff of Coaches is surely a 


profitable one. For ..Ike" has been of great assistance to Coach Rockne-and to the team. 
JOHN POLISKEY 
Freshnwn Coach 
.If one went to visit the Notre Dame gym on a. Sunday morning in late September of this year-when the freshmen wer_e reporting for equipment -the natural thing would be to utter a prayer for the soul of the unfor­tunate whose job it was to assort and coach them. For there were approxi­mately five hundred aspiring Stuhldrehers and Millers and Crowleys lined up in the gym, each one most confident that he was destined to be a great Notre Dame player. 
In the center of, the motley group stood two men-one was Coach Rockne, the other-John Poliskey. John was .one of Coach Rockne's tackles during the three seasons preceding this, and because of his ability·· and knowledge of the game, Rock considered .. Bull" an ideal man for such a Herculean job.

The Players 


CAPT. FRED MILLER 
Left Taclde 

Three years ago, when Joe Boland had his leg broken in a game with Minnesota, everyone was wondering whether Fred Miller, the sophomore who rushed into the game, would ~ake good. 
Now, after three years of specta·~~lar tackle play, Fred closes his col­legiate career, leaving behind him a most enviable record. He was an inspiring leader, always fighting, always encouraging. 
His play at tackle was at all times excellent. It was not uncommon for Fred to come down the field with the ends-to help them down the safety man who caught the punts. Gains through.Fred's position were negligible. 
Fred has been named on several All-Americans, and anyone who has seen Notre Dame in action since that day three years ago, when the Fighting Irish played Minnesota, knows that Fred ranks with the greatest tackles in the Nation. A real Notre Dame captain-Fred Miller. 
GEORGE LEPPIG 
•Rigbt Guard 
They told this Cleveland, Ohio, boy that his opponent in the first game of the season weighed two hundred and forty pounds, and that he had to have special pants and shoes made for him. George laughed. For George is a firm beli_ever in the old adage, .. the bigger they come, the harder they" fall." The large gentle­man mentioned, remained in the game slightly more than a quarter, due probably to George Leppig's concentrated attention. 
George had all the requisites for a good guard. ·Offensively and defensively, he took care of his position well, and his work in every ga~e was outstanding. 
Against Navy, he .-came through with a beautiful tackle that took the heart out of a desperate Navy attack. 
This year was George's last. He. leaves be­hind him a record that ranks him with the best guards in the history of Notre Dame.

JOHN NIEMIEC 
Left Half-Bac/~ 

A triple-threat man is one who can pass, kick and run with the ball. Real triple-threa.t men-those who carry out each threat well-are few and far between. Johnny Niemiec of· Bellaire, Ohio, takes his place, after this last year of his splen­
. did career, as one of the greatest backs to ever wear the Blue and Gold. · Butch is one of those fellows who does ·every thing as it should be done. He rises to occasions. Notre Dame supporters became accustomed to rely upon John Niemiec, and he never failed them. \'\Thatever was needed, be it a sixty-yard punt, or a perfect forward pass,· or a ten­yard slice through tackle, John always accomplished what was needed. 
Notre Dame must remember Niemiec as one of the very greatest. He is an example of what a real triple-threat man should be. He starred alwa.ys and never allowed his fame to enlarge the size of his hat. A real chap, Johnny Niemiec~ 
;-·-··--··-···-··--··----·..··-·--·-----------l 
JOHN CHEVIGNY 
Right Half-Back 

Here is a Notre Dame warrior who gives 'till it hurts. Here is a man who plays himself to complete exhaustion. Here is a man who doesn't know the meaning of .. give up." 
Jack Chevigny was a good running mate to Johnny Niemiec. He was splendid on offense, splendid on. defense. He seemed to delight in throwing the enemy for losses and his offensive powers are so well known that they need no repeti­tion. This year closed his playing career at Notre Dame. 
He played equally well in every game. Against the Service teams, he outdid himself. Chcvigny should be considered seriously whenever ..All-American" is mentioned. 
Jack Chevigny deserves the highest praise. A man who showed unselfish spirit, who worked himself 'till he dropped in exhaustion, who gave everything to his coach and his team­that was Jack Chevigny.

FRED COLLINS 
Full-Back 

In 1926, he broke his ja.w and was lost for the season. Last year, he was bothered by pulled tendons and what arc commonly called «charley horses." In 1928, he broke a wrist in the. first combat of the season. Most men would be discouraged with such perennial ill luck. But Fred Collins, the good-looking. blonde boy from Portland, Oregon, was too full of fight. 
Dr. Clough took great pains to sec that Fred's injured arm knit correctly and it was largely through his efforts that when the ·boys left for Philadelphia to play Penn State, Fred went along. He crashed and smashed his way· up and down Franklin Field like a meteor. Against Army, he was even more a meteor. He tore the Army forward.wall to pieces; he ran her ends at will. 
Fred is a tcn.:.sccond man. He backs up the line splendidly. He is abulwark against forward passes. What is more imp~rtant, u\X'hitic" is a boy who has a fighting heart-who can't be stopped just because they break his bones. · This season closed his career in a blaze of well earned,· but belated, glory.

p. TIM MOYNIHAN 
Center 

!I 
,, This husky Chicago lad upheld the tra­ditions of the Notre Dame centers that preceded him. He was quick to analyze the hostile attack, a fine passer, and was a veritable demon in sprinting down-field under ptints. Tim played great football ·an year; against Army' and Navy, he was superb. Time. and again the Army full­back, Murrell, thrust himself at Moyni­han, and each time Tim thrust Mr. Murrell backward. Opening holes in the opposing line was another of Tim's diversions. 
Tim's fighting Irish qualities stood him in good stead, and it is rumored that any one so unfortunate as to be playing op­posite to him, was in for a very sorrowful and painful afternoon. 
\X'hcn one remembers Bocringcr and \Valsh, and remembering, says that Tim filled their shoes admirably, the quality of Tim's workmanship is not to be ques­tioned. 
He has one more year of competition.

OFFICIAL FOOTBALL REVIEW-1928 

JOHN LAW 
Left Guard 

It requires courage to play guard, and power, and brains. John Law has an abundance ofall three qualities. When the term uFighting Irish" is used, you'll not go wrong by taking Johnny as a splendid example. For he was a tower of strength in every game. Too much cannot be said in his praise. 'fhey would knock him cold -and John would get up. Doctors shook their heads and predicted dire results, but what did John care? Notre Dame needed him and he responded nobly. His defensive play was a fea;. ture of every game. He was especially adept in crashing through and spilling _prospective ground carriers almost before they could get their hands on the ball. 
· There was no end to the fighting fearlessness of Johnny's efforts. Intestinal fortitude, com­bined with a keen sense of-perception, made him one of the greatest guards in the country. This is John's second year ofcompetition. 
JOHN COLRICK 
Left End 

They tried everything in their attempts to stop Johnny from snaring those passes from John Niemiec. The enemy line­men held him; the secondary defense blocked him~but Johnny had a way of sifting through and picking--those passes out of the air that made him a terror as long as he was in the game. 
Colrick's touchdown against Navy looked ·so simple that it seemed easy. It would not have been easy, had not the rangy end timed himself sq perfectly. 
In the Drake game, Johnny was completeiy surrounded by Bulldog defensive men, but when the ball· was ·throw~, he merely leaped high into the air-and came down with the ball­an~ a touchdown. Against Georgia Tech, Johnny was simply unstoppable. 
· John is a master in every department of end play. His foot­
work is clever, and blocking half-backs could ·do nothing with 
him as far as taking him out of plays was concerned. 




TED TWOMEY 
Right Tackle 

The Northlands of Minnesota produce rugged 'sons, and Duluth sent one of her most rugged notables to pla.y right tackle for Mr. Rockne's football team. Ted played his role like a veteran, even though this was his first year of varsity competition. 
Ted is the type of tackle for which every coach yearns. Able to withstand the repeated assaults of the enemy, a hard tackler, • and alert at all times, Ted distinguished himself by his ability to smear every play that was sent at him. 
Rock likes his tackles tough; he likes them vicious; he likes them to use their hands on the opposing ends. Ted did all this to a remarkable degree of perfection. He played on the left side of the line on defense, right on offense. Twomey is a sophomore who has made his mark, and great things can be expected of him.

JAMES BRADY i 
Quarter-Back 

To play quarter-back on Knute Rockne's team is to be able ~'.

He came back· from the Penn State game with a painful knee inj':lry. A less courageous chap would have given up hope of facing the Army juggernaut, but not Jim Brady. \'\Then the train left for New York, Jim was decidedly among those present.

MANFRED VEZIE 
Right End 

McDonald, Pennsylvania has a.t least one claim to distinction, for it is the home of ..Vez" Vezic, one of the reasons why the Notre Dame ends have not been skirted to any extent this season. 
There arc several types of ends. V czie is of the type tha:t boxes a tackle at will, that turns plays inward, and that harasses forward passers to their death. He played consistently all season, and in the Army game, he kept Mr. Cagle within reason­able bounds so Fred Miller could flatten him. 
Vezie enjoyed his first year of competition this year, and ought to shine ever more brightly next season. 
. Never flashy, but always performing his tasks in a most efficient manner-that was Vezie. \'\Then a play started around. the Blue and Gold right flank, you could wager ten to one that it would be Vezie who would stop the ball carrier. Rock could depend on V ezie. Is further . testimonial necessary? 
.ED COLLINS 
Left End 

The Millers, the \Yfalshes, and the Collins'. Ed is a younger brother of Chuck, the left end ~f the immortal Four Horsemen and Seven Mules . 
..Chuck" must have passed on to Eddie his own technique, for Ed's play all season was both steady ..and spectacular. Against \'\Tisconsin, Ed downed Bo Cuisinier in his tracks on three successive punts; in the Pe~n State game, he tossed French, who had been cutting capers aU afternoon, for a twe:Uty-yard loss, and on the next play, he recovered a Penn fumble; against Army, when ..Red" Cagle tried to circle his end, Eddie chased him back fifteen yards and then downed him. 
Ed is that type of end. A world of power in his arms enabled him to smash interference. His tackling was vicious; he had no superior in boxing a tackle. 
Eddie upheld the reputation that Chuck had made for the Collins family. And Chuck was a mighty fine end.

: FRANK CARIDEO 
Quarter 

To rise from the ranks of the freshmen to the position of varsity quarter-back, is no small task. But Frank, formerly a star at Dean Academy, because of his ability as a high-grade kicker, passer, runner and thinker, found i~ comparat~vely easy to make good. 
Frank ran his team well. His c~tching and return­ing of punts was spectacular. His own kicking was of the best. Carideo needed only this year, as a baptism of fire. His field generalship was always character­ised by coolness and good judgment. Defensively, too, his play was outstanding. 
Two more years remain of Frank's career, and with the experience gained this season, and with the ability that he has, there is· not a doubt that Carideo will take a place among Notre Dame's immortals.

At any rate,. Rock's judgment in choosing Tommy Murphy as one of his right ends was entirely vindicated by the way Tommy handled himself in every game he played.

BILLY DEW 
Right Half 

\Without fellows like Billy Dew around, Mr. Rockne might easily find himself in a trying situation. Last year, Bill was a full-back. This year he started at half, and then, after Fred Collins had broken his wrist, and bef()re ..Rock" discovered that Larry Mullins could play full-back, Billy found himself at full against the Navy. And he found himself in more ways than one. For he played fine football against the Navy, and against every team he got in against. Billy used his basketball ability to. advantage in breaking up passes. 
Dew is just a real good football player. Rockne has discovered that he can use Billy almost any place in the backfield, and Billy can make good, no matter where he is. He has the goods.

JACK CANNON 
Guard 

It's hardly fair to Jack to call him a substitute. For although he was on the second team, Cannon was sent into several games when the going was the_ toughest. And each time, he acquitted himse~f nobly. 
Jack is a guard of the scrappy, fast-charging, fierce tackling type. He has a way of knifing through the enemy line and spilling the ball-carriers. He also does a very neat job of kicking off, when occasion demands. 
\Whenever Jack was sent into a. game there was no groan of fear lest the line be weakened by the substi­tution. Quarter-backs of several teams sent their first plays at Jack, when he entered the game-and in every instance Jack stopped the ball-carrier with­out gain. 
Notre Dame is glad to know that Jack has another year of competition. 
~ ....... J .. 


]ERRY RANSAVAGE 
Left Taclde 

The tackle situation at Notre Dame never seems to be very bothersome to Coach Rockne. He seems al­ways to be fortified with strong, scrappy fellows who can handle their jobs as he wants them handled. 
Jerry Ransavage is one of our great mentor's besi: men, and several times during the season, the serious, likeable Jerry has stepped into the breach and done remarkably well. 
On defense, Jerry was impregnable. Any play sent at him was invariably smashed at the line of scrim­mage. His offensive work was of the highest caliber, too. This is Jerry's,second year as a Monogram man, 
i" and his great work as .. one of Rock's men" will al­
l 
ways be remembered.

GUS BONDI 
Guard 

Gus is one of those fellows who always seems to do· things right. Last year, when he was a Sophomore, Bondi was classi­fied as a possibility, and only that. But the quiet chap kept plugging along, surely and silently, 'till Coach Rockne found him to be a valuable man to have around. ·l 
i, ~ ~ I Gus Bondi is a master exponent of all gua.rd play. Never ;
I 
flashy, but always in the thick of the battle, Gus has proved ·(. 
himself to every one concerned in a most satisfactory manner. 
He has another year of eligibility.

DICK DONOGHUE 
Rigi:J~ T acl<.le 

Dick was the heaviest fellow on ~he squad. He was not only the heaviest, but very close to the toughest man for the oppos­ing ends to handle. He used his hands very well, is exception­ally fast for a man of his weight, and above all, Dick has an over abundance of what Rock calls intestinal fortitude. 
Injuries of one kind or another kept Dick fro~ coming to the front last year. Di'ck is another one of the men who under­went his first baptism this year. Coupled .with a fine. build for a tackle, Dick possesses a cool, level head which stands him in good stead. Next year Dick Donoghue should be a real star. . 
JOE· NASH 
Center 

In the Drake game a Notre Dame player,. ·----·-~·---:-·-~-~--------·----.----···--------~ 
· number 60, intercepted a Bulldog pass on the 50-yard line and proceeded to dodge, piv­ot and sprint through the entire Drake team. The spectators began to thumb their pm-. · grams in search of the name of tlus sensa-· tional back-field ace. The program read, ..60-Joe Nash, Center." So much for Joe's ball-carrying ability. 
\X'hcn he was not converting enemy passes into Notre Dame touchdowns or ncar touch­downs, Joe played a fine ball game at center. His passing was faultless; he was a deadly tackler. He possessed a sixth sense which told him when to drop back for ·passes, and when to smash through. Next year, should you behold Number ..60" running sixty yards after intercepting a pass-you'll know it's Joe Nash. 


JIM BRAY 
Left Half 

Jim, like Fred Collins, was followed th:s year by· the injury Jinx. His shoulder was smashed early in the sea­son, and as a result, he had to spend most of his time on the side lines. But when Dr. Clough allowed him to get in the game again, Jim showed that he was a typical Rockne half-back. Jim can run, kick and pass, which trio of accomplishments places him in the "triple-threat" class. 
In the Carnegie game, Jim was sent in at a most criti­cal moment; he came through with a sixty-yard punt on the first play. That's· what coaches want-fellows who can be depended upon to deliver. 
Jim Bray has shown Coach Rockne that he can de­liver. Despite his injury handicap, Jim came through.. 
LARRY MULLINS . Full-Back 

It is an old, old adage of the gridiron that success depends to a large extent on taking advantage of the "break" when the oppor-· tunity presents itself. "Moon" Mullins did just that. \Vhen Coach Rockne needed a full-back, he told Larry to forget that he ever was a half-back until he got into the open field. · 
Everyone who saw or read about the Drake game knows the rest.· . "Moon" slashed and crashed the Bulldog line to bits. He is a tall, rangy fellow, but he charges low 'till he pass~s the line_ of scrimmage; when the open field beckons, Larry can· run like a. deer . 
. This .was Mullins' first. year of competi­tion, and Rock will surely be able to use him next year. 

--. -----·--------·-· ----, 



JACK ELDER 
Left Half 

Jack Elder is the modest fellow who can ruu. He is the Kentucky Colonel who ran 50 yards through the entire Loyola \Vol£ Pack for Notre Dame's first touchdown. Against the Carnegie Skibos, he raced 67 yards through the mud. 
It was not speed alone that made Jack so dangerous. He was a master at pivoting and twisting his way from the grasp of tacklers. 
Few who witnessed the Loyola and Carnegie games can forget Jack Elder's performances. \Vhenever the ttRebel'' was inserted into the lineup, the enemy was due for some extensive ·cross-country work. For Jack is the speed merchant de luxe-a positive terror in the open field. 

GEORGE (DINNY) SHAY 
Full-Back 

There may be better football players than Dinny Shay. The limelight may fall more direcdy on some fellows than it does on Dinny Shay. But of one thing we are sure, that nowhere is there to be found a gamer, scrappier warrior than Dinny Shay. 
The full-back position is a bone-breaker even for a big fellow. To play full is to be in on every play; backing up the line, blocking, carrying the ball continually. And to play full as Dinny did while weighing only 15 5 lbs. is a . great accomplishment. · 
Dinny battled all the time. He was a terrific line plunger, and his defensive work in backing up the line was second to none. Dinny Shay is there. He's a real Fightin' Irishman.

JACK MONTROY 
Right Half 
Coach Rockne has half-backs for every occa~ 
sion. \Vhen he needs a good blocker he makes 
a certain change..\Vhen a long run is in order, 
he touches his magic lamp and his man appears. 
Several times during the season, Rock needed a · 
man who could back up a line fearlessly and 
surely; a fellow who could clip off a few yards 
at a time on drives through the tackles.or around 
end. \Vhen such occasions presented themselves, 
Jack Montroy got the call. 
In the Navy game, when Navy was starting ·a desperate drive, Jack cont.ributed a fine piece 
of work, when he sliced through and nailed a 
Navy ball-carrier with a deadly, vicious tackle. 
Jack was a fine half-back; He is a left­handed passer, and a splendid one, too. This is Jack's first year of competition, and he should rise to greater heights in· the years to come. 


JOHN O'BRIEN 
Left End 
\vhen Johnny O'Bric~ dashed onto the field to take Colrick's place in the Army game, Mr. Cagle, et al, bj-eathed a sigh of temporary relief. They knew what Colrick could do. And much to their chagriri, they soon discovered what John O'Brien can do. For within a few minutes, Johnny had· tumbled over the goal for the winning to.uchdown, after receiving a pas~. 
This was the high spot of John's -1928 career~ O'Brien is another of the Sophomore stars. He• kn.ows the principles of end play perfectly, and with the improvement that comes of experience, John should be a cracker"-ja~k end next season. 
Bu~ whatever may be his future accomplish­ments, he can never perform a more thrilling feat-than· that of scoring the touchdown that -Beat tbe Army. ·

BUD GEBERT 
Quarter-Back 

Bud won a Hering Medal for good judgment in calling plays. That means that his judgment in picking the right pJa,y coincided with ·that of Rockne's more closely than any of the other pilots. That alone is quite a tribute to Bud's 
· field generalship. · · Rockne. gave Bud his opportunity in several games, and each time Bud came through. He handled the team like ·a veteran against Drake and Carnegie. He intercepted. a pass· against Loyola that was a factor in saving the game. Bud is a typical Rockne fiel4 gener;tl. He knows what to call and when to call it. ­

Right T aclde 

Tackles, according to the leading a.uthoritics, either make or break a line. If the tackles arc weak, the line -is weak.. John Doarn is one of Rockne's tackles who is responsible for the strcng"th of the Notre Dame forward walls, this year and last. 
John has all the requisites for a tackle. He is a husky chap, and fast; he uses his hands to help him in checking the charges of opposing ends, and is a tower on defense. Tackle play de­mands much on defense and offense. The tackle niust try . to block punts, take care of the ball-carriers when the end turns them in, must be able to diagnose in a second the direc­tion of criss-cross and reverse plays. And to say that John Doarn did all this remarkably well is indeed a tribute to his ability. ·

TOM-CONLEY 
Rigbt End· 
Torn had to make good, because he comes from Roman Catholic High, Philadelphia. So, when Rock let Tom loose in the Penn State game, there was nothing for him to do but play a bang-up game-and that's just what Tom Conley did. 
Conley, with O'Brien, formed a Sophomore end combination that promises much for the next few seasons. 
It is mentioned that Tom had to make gopd because he comes from Catholic High, Phila-: delphia. That is very true. For behind Torn Conley were the guiding spirits of Joe Boland, Joe Maxwell, and Vince McNally, all of whom owe their early training to Roman Catholic High. As they watched Tom Conley in action against the Nittany Lion, the trio must surely have agreed that Tom Conley was carrying on-where they had· left off. 
BERNIE LEAHY 
Left·Half. 

Bernie is :i;Sophomore from St. Mel's High, Chicago, who is a triple-threat man, par excel­len~e. His .punting an·d drop-kicking alone would make him a valuable man, but in addi­tion," _Bernie's pas_sing and r.unning make him a. formidable :ind dangerous man. ­
The presence C?f so m~my·_ more experienced half;backs .kept Leahy in: the background most of t?e;'se;tson, but Coach Roc~ne is counting on Bernie ~oF the years to co;111e._' 
And ~ell ·he may, bec~us~ ~riple-threat men wh~ ca.n block as Bernie Leahy:; can arc always· at a premium. A kicker, a. passer, arunner, and' equally_ adept at all three departments, Bernie's future greatness se·erns to be a certainty. If he do~s not come through, he w.ill disappoint the student body and a J)1an named Rockne.

JOE MORRISSEY 
Ouarter-Bac/{
-. 

Some quarter-backs are strictly tacticians. They do no ball­carrying or passirig, but they do hold down their jobs because they call the plays as the coach wants them called. 
Joe Morrissey is not of this type;· For Joe is a splendid a punter of quality and a bal1-c~rrier de luxe: Joe's runs from punt format~on in the Loyola, game were spe-ctacular. 
A real triple-threat man, Morrissey was a valued performer. He was handicapped all season by a weak knee. This i11jury undoubtedly kept him out of, several games in :Which his pres­ence was needed badly. ·~ · ·· 
Joe has splendi-d n~tural ability and a keen sense ot football perception. · This was his second year of ~ompetitio.I?:." ­
BERT METZGER 
Right Guard 

It is considered good generalship to send the first plays through, or at a substitute who has just entered the game. 
In the Navy gaine·, when Rock saw that his guards were almost exhausted, he sent Bert Metzger in there. Bert is small; so small that he was almost given up as a .var~ity" prospect because of his lack of weight. And when the Navy quarter-back saw Bert, he probably con­cluded that his best chance to score would be to take a crack at Bert's territory. The ball at this time was on the Notre Dame ten-yard line. The two lines faced each other; the signals were called; the Navy full-back plunged ·directly a-t Bert. There .was a huge pile-up. \X'hen the boys were finally·lifted off, there was little Bert Metzger at the bottom, his arms wrapped se­curely about the ball-carrier's legs. ·They didn't gain a foot. 
Bert. made up for his lack of ~eight by terrific driving power in_his-legs and shoulders. He was ..tough." Next year Bert Metzger should be a star.

TOM KENNEALLY 
Quarter-Back 

Torn is a. chap of less than 140 lbs. It seems · a bit incredible to imagine that so small a fel­
low can .withstand the rigorous activity of a · 
football season. 

In Torn's case, however, there is no wonder. For Kenneally is as courageous as he is light. He makes up for his lack of beef by an ability to use his head. In addition to being an exponent of the art of master minding, Torn is afine passer. Rock demands much of his pilots. They are his main representatives;· they are his managing di­rectors. Tommy Kenneally represented the 'firm of Rockne, unlimited, to perfection. 
\Vfe predict that next season will make him a star. It is· interesting to note that Torn carne from the Interhall ranks. He was pilot of a championship Freshman Hall team. 
JACK McGRATH  
Right T acl?..le  
Thelot·of line men is a sad qne. Spectators are usu­ally too intent on the actions of the back-field men. They forget that there are seven men who spend the wh_ole afternoon charging, tackling, taking a fancy trimming, and getting no sympathy-at least from a spectatorial point of view. ·

JACK REILLY 
Rigbt Half 

Jack Reilly was a member of the team that equalled the world's record for the quarter-mile relay. Not satisfied with his track laurels, Jack took to football much as the proverbial duck takes to the proverbial water. 
Speed, ability to cut back sharply through the line, and general ·excellence in all depart­ments of the game, earned. for Jack his spurs as a varsity half-back. 
An old injury hampered Reilly for a time d~ring the season, but not seriously enough to prevent his getting into several games in all of which Jack performed a~mirably. . · Jack;s great speed made it easy for.hi~ toget into the open field. Once there,.he was a· terror. This W;tS Jack's first year of. varsity-competi­tion. If he returns to school in the fall, he will undoubtedly be a· valuable .asset to Rockne's 19 2 9 machine. . 
FRANK LEAHY 
Left Taclde 

Frank began his career as a center. But Coach Rockne decided that he could use him at tackle. Leahy applied himself and :soon mastered the difficult job in a· way _which must have made the wizard of Notre Dame smile. 
\Vhen Frank. entered the Carnegie game, Harpster sent Kan.~is, the 23 0-pound full-back through Leahy's position. Frank sliced through and nailed Mr. Karcis at the line of scrimma.ge. 
Leahy is not ~m exceptionally large fellow­he looks much lighter than he really is­but he is always first to strike. He is fast and his charges are strong, his blocking good. Frank has done well in his Sophomore year, and has every chance to go far-along football's path of fame.

They came to the genial Doctor Clough with bruised and broken bones, torn ligaments, pulled ten­dons, collapsible knees, cut faces, cauliflower ears, and the many other ailments that are bound to be the lot 
.of the varsity football players. But they could never stump Doc Clough. He would merely roll up his sleeves and by using his medical genius and by turn­ing on one of those soothing, comforting ray ma­chines that he has, he would very soon have his patient in good shape once again. ·

THE CHEERLEADERS 
The cheering this year was decidedly excellent. The cheering section was compact, and thus good volume could be more easily gotten. 
And the fellow who led the yells-the fellow who so successfully managed to make every one in the place howl themselves hoarse-was Bob Manix. Bob possesses the personality so necessary to the cheerleader .. He had a way of instilling into the cheering sections, «<the old pepper" that made him singularly successful. . Assisting Bob were two Juniors, Jerry Parker and Dan Barton. 
Cheer leading looks very easy. It seems to be a job that anyone could easily fill. The very oppo­site ·is true. It takes a personality and real ability to make the yells of a student body something to be proud of-and Bob, Jerry and Dan were abound­ing in the well-known uit."

OFFICIAL FOOTBALL REVIEW-1928 

The Reserves 
Reserve football has one great value-affording an opportunity for prospective varsity men to gain experience by giving such men a real baptism of fire. 
This year Coach Rockne mapped out such an extensive schedule that it was necessary at times to have, not only a ..B, team, but also a "C" team. It was due. to this fact that from a percentage standpoint, the Reserve season was not a success. However, when the Reserves were intact-when they had only one game to pla.y, they proved to be too much for the powerful Gopher and Wildcat 
..B, outfits. 
Too much emphasis cannot be placed upon the value of Reserve teams. Football, nowadays, with its intricate and deceptive formations, calls for a great deal of experience in· diagnosing the enemy attacks. And one game of football played on the field is twice as valuable as a three-hour "black­board session." 
For this reason the idea of putting two-or even three squads on different fields makes itself worth while. Coach Rockne, blessed with a wealth of inexperienced men, was able to divide his entire squad into three sections: Varsity .. B", and "C" teams. Many a coach would have been thankful to have as his first string, the m·en that comprised the Reserve Squad. The Reserves, for the most part, were Sophomores; for it was they who could profit most by experience: it is they who will be called upon to step into the gaps left by graduat­ing varsity men. 
It should be again pointed out that the chief rea­son for the games lost was the necessity of ·divid­ing the Reserves into two teams in order to fulfill scheduled games. 
It is a large enpugh assignment to play one ~e­serve game, but two-well it just goes to show that Rock realizes to the fullest extent the value of experience in building his squad for future years. 
They say that experience is the best teacher, and if what they say is true, t4en the Notre Dame Reserves learned plenty during the season of 1928. 
The opening of the season was marked by the Reserves dividing their forces and playing two games with· but small success. One team jour­neyed to Big Rapids, Michigan, and lost to Ferris Institute 24-7. The Irish rolled up a preponder­. ance of first downs, but a weak forward pass de­fense proved their ·undoing. The same day another Reserve team went to Evanston/and ba.ttled the 
Northwestern Reserves to a scoreless tic. 
The following Saturday, the Reserves again di­vided forces with still less success. \X'hile one team was losing 19-7 to St. Mary's at Winona, Minnesota, because of a weak defense against the forward pass, another team tossed a one-point lead away in the last minute of play by fumbling, and lost, 19-13, to \X'heaton College after decisively outplaying their opponents throughout. 
The squad remained intact the following Satur­day, and playing at home for a change, proceeded to settle all disputes as to which was the better team, by soundly trouncing the Northwestern Re­serves, 31-0, in a return game. 
The following week the Reserves again divided forces, and while one squad was losing, 13-0, to the Iowa. Reserves, in the mud, the other squad remained at home and decisively defeated the Minnesota Reserves, 24-0. 
The last game of. the season .found the pick of the Reserve squad going up ·to Flint, Michigan,. and handing the General Motors team a 34-0 trimming in the mud. 
Prendergast, Yarr and Y efland stood o~t among the Reserve centers, and Lyons, Metzger, O'Connor and Herwit among the Reserve guards. Culver, Guadnola, Thornton, Schwartz and McManmon were prominent among the tackles, and Kersjes, Vlk, Bailie, Chrisanti, Kosky, Enright and Griffin among the ends. Nichols, Christman and Fish­leigh were the most promising ·of the quarter­backs, while Dailey, O'Brien, Savoldi and Coving­ton were prominent among the full-backs. \X'il­helmy, Lahey, Stephan, Malik, Litzwan and Cron~ in were the best of the half...:backs. 
All in all, the season was a success, inasmuch as it gave these men what they wanted most, experi­ence. They were somewhat handicapped through­out by the fact that many of them would have to learn the plays of the varsity's opponents, use them against the first-stringers during the w~ek, and then on Saturday revert to the Rockne system. \X'hen one considers this, as well as the fact that 
a.s often as not their strength would be divided to play two opppnents, the season may well be called successful. · 
It was from the ranks of the Reserves that Lep­pig, Morrissey and Vezie rose to find berths on the varsity, ·and we can ·confidently look forward to many of this year's Reserves becoming monogram men in the not too ·distant future~ They have played their part well, both as representatives of . Our Lady on the field of·battle, and as scrub teams for the varsity. In the words of t(Big Bill" Edwards at a banquet· tendered an All-America team not so long ago, .. Gentlemen, a t?ast-The 
Scrub!"

The Cigar-Store AlUtnni 
By FRANKLYN E. DoAN 
Sports Editor of the South Beud News-Times 
The cigar-store alumni, that gregarious· body of discarded piccolo players, melancholy traffic policemen and itinerant scissors-grinders, have supplanted the cigar-store Indian. The tipsy pop­ulace of .thJs good nation laments the loss of the famous . wooden Indian, but I have seen no one wailing over misfortunes that might have hap­pened to the disreputable alumni with the five­cent smell on their coat lapels. 

\Vhen all the cigar-store alumni and week-end experts had conducted th~ir auto~.;tes over the . Wisconsin, Georgia Tech, and Carnegie Tech games, the Saturday night clubs proceeded to pull their stools up to the table for a few rounds of ale, or take the shine off the brass rails in the more proletarian beer gardens. That was Saturday night. Bright and early, Monday morning, the cigar­store alu~ni had their green-visored caps on the 
· sides of their gord~. again and their "Chauffeur No. 263" badges pinned neatly on their. sleeves. The experts were back at their lathes or ribbon coun­ters, telling the boss and the assistant general busi­ness manager that this Notre Dame football team has lost a ball ·game, thus going back on its followers. 
That's the history of the 1928 football season. For 11 years the good nag uVictory" has carried a Notre Dame jockey up the stretch ahead of the field. This year, by. luck and a few breaks, the Notre Dame team lost more ball games than was its wont in previous years and the wail went up. The cigar­store alumni needed someone to dip in their boiling oil, so why not put the Irish there? 
What does it matter if Notre Dame did lose a few football games this fall? What does it matter if the Irish did go up to Wisconsin and drop one, 26 to 6; travel down to Georgia Tech and get bumped off 13 to 0; stay right here in o~r own 
·backyard and see Carnegie Tech gallop back east with the fat half of a 27 to 7 event stuffed in their. valises? That's the business of the Irish and the sooner the cigar-store alumni hie themselves back to the ice wagons or the elevators, the better off everything . will be. 
The statistician who couldn't make a living at flagpole sitting, went back of the furnace in mid­November and did an Abe Lincoln with his ·shovel and broken beer bottle. He figured that just 25,000,000 would attend football games· during the fall, giving the winning team a big hurrah and the losing eleven a crate of sour plums. The whole tro~ble is that this American public, which 
plays bridge for a penny a point, bets a· dollar to a plug nickel that Jack Dempsey didn't shave for three days before the Tunney fight, and blows all of its cash hoping that St. Joseph County Oil will ad­vance four points along with the Hoover land­slide, has begun to take its football too seriously. 

It's no small wonder that the genuine grads come back to a game nowadays and wish that the cigar­store alumni had majored in something besides wind-jamming. In the fine old days, the Yale­Harvard, Notre Dame-Indiana and Chicago-\Vis­consin games were the talk of the country, and, when one or the other lost, no one shed a bath tub full of tears or threatened to turn the coach's children into left-handed third basemen. They at­tended football games leisurely in those days, and didn't need to be told that their favorite team might lose. . 
For Notre Dame, this has been a bad year in many ways, but it has been a. good one in many more ways. Since it was the first year that Notre Dame had lost more than two games, most of the experts developed a combination case of dyspepsia and grief. Worrying over small events like that seems as bad to me.as moaning because your young­est son, Hershel, is the first in five generations to wear a size eleven shoe. 
After that Carnegie game, the boys who lost a month of breakfasts in wagers were all hot and burning. Think of their grief if the record went unblemished for 100 years and someone came along to turn the trick! · All of the cigar-store alumni would have desired to sell their grand­mothers down the river and wear black bow-ties the rest of their lives. How many teams can boast · of going even 23 years without defeat on their home field? The correct answer is «none," Roger. If you don't mind a few personal opinions, I be­lieve that Notre Dame's 1928 sea_son was just about the best the school has ever had. You know we aren't in the era of dumbells anymore. There are a thousand husky young fellows at a hundred dif­
.ferent schools who can play football pretty well and it's only logical to believe that they will cut loose and play it. Some one of these days there will be a score of excellent teams in every section of the· country, and an undefeated team will be as scarce as a traffic law in South Bend. \'\That will the cigar-store alumni do then? 
Of course, some bald-headed financier in the fifth row (balcony), the one who lost an ux" when Georgia Tech beat Notre Dame and knocked all the predictions for a healthy row of modernis­

Notre Datne 12 Loyola, New Orleans 6 
Fighting Irish? At least that uFighting" is a rather mild description of the Notre Dame team that battled its way to a last-minute victory over a frenzied \Vol£ Pack from Loyola University, New 
·Orleans. Loyola has a great team. She showed a power­ful offense and a splendid defense. Her warriors scored :first, and held this lead 'till the second half. Several times during that great second half, the Notre Dame goal was in danger, but Loyola's task was too much for even so great a team. There were several little incidents that :finally drove the Wolves from our door of Victory. One incident was Jack Elder's brilliant 48-yard run early in the second half, which tied the score~ Another was Johnny Niemiec's portrayal of real ((Fighting Irish" spirit. He taped and band­aged that trick knee of his and went out there to :fight for all that was in him. He tossed a few passes to O'Brien and Colrick and then, just to show the folks he still had a card or two up his sleeve, he crashed through tackle for the winning touchdown with only a minute to play. 
Then there was Vezie, breaking up play after play, spilling the interference and tackling the ball carrier. 
uBucky" Moore of Loyola, made some sizeable dashes, and Drouillet, a giant tackle, played a :fine defensive game 'till his forced retirement through injuries. 
Speaking of injuries, Mr. Ja.ubert, Loyola cen­ter, had his jersey removed from his back rather completely, and although the front remained in­tact, he acquired quite a case of sunburn. Tim Moynihan, when questioned, could give no infor­mation as to how Mr. Jaubert's jersey came to so ill an end. 
At any rate, not even a Pack of \Volves was strong enough to stem that last minute march to victory. 
It's fairly hard to beat a band of ~·Fighting Irish," the Hocus-Pocus of Mr. K. K. Rockne, and the undefeated spirit of Cartier Field. 
But Loyola tried. Make no mistake about that.

Rockne Men Trium.ph, 12~6, In Uphill Battle 
By wARREN BROWN 
SOUTH BEND, IND., Sept. 29-I guess they are "Fighting Irish" at Notre Dame. 
Hauling a f~otball game out of the possibilities of a 6 to 6 tie in the closing minutes of today's season-opener with Loyola of New Orleans was the first bit of evidence. for 1928 that Coach Knutc Rockne is still able to work miracles with the relics of Notre Dame. 
And the Irish helped, and how they pelped! Break after break had come the way of Notre Dame during the course of a furious struggle with 
Loyola. Break after break had failed to .materialize in­to any points and at the end of the first half the "Fight­ing Irish" were lagging, with the score of 6 to 0 against them, a sneak across the line by Lopez of Loyola putting 
the finishing touch on a march that had extended from the close of the first period through the opening minutes of the second. ­

Once they were let loose on the field for the second half, Notre Dame proceeded to squa.re that count, Jack Elder, sprinting 48 yards fair sort of Irish combination, if you ask me. don't know what became of Murphy. I know he did what was expected of him. I do know that O'Brien, leaping high in the air, outscramblcd a flock of Loyola goal defenders very soon after he had entered the game and came down with a for­ward pass that Johnny Niemiec, the collapsible knee controller, had sh~cd his wa.y.

\Vhat happened for the next few seconds will al­ways remain a mystery to me. A lady with a fur coat, who perched at the top of the· stand, blocked off my VISion, as relentlessly as Loyola thrust back the first two attempts Notre Dame made to get across those· final two yards. 
On the third, there was a rush, a bump, a scattering 

early in the period for the touchdown that evened things up. For a while then it looked like a parade for the Irish. But time after time Loyola's strength or Notre Dame's weakness kept scores from materializing, though chances bobbed up with regularity that was al­most monotonous. 
Thus the game wore along into its very last few minutes, when a break, that was to prove the much needed one, gave the Irish a chance to pull the con test out of the possibility of a tic. 
It came by way of afumble, just on:e of the many of these pesky things that had featured or marred the -progress of the play throughout the afternoon. 
I1·ishe1·s Se1tt l1t 

It was Notre Dame's ball on the enemy 23-yard line. Two more bluc-jcrseyed stalwarts slipped on the field, just two of a. parade of replacements that had been going on throughout the hard~ fought game. 
And these two were O'Brien and Murphy, a 

of  Loyola  defenses,  and  
across  the line,  ball hugged tight ly,  was  a  man  
named "Dinny" Shay.  

The Fighting Irish, it seems, had taken charge of . things. . 
But it developed after much deliberation and celebration .for the achievement of "Dinny" Shay in carrying across -the winning touchdown that it 
· wasn't Shay at all who did this, but Niemiec. The cheers, if delayed a. trifle, are now in order for this· young man whose wabbling knee was in such shape that Coach Rockne, before the game, said he didn't think the young man would ever be ·able to play again. \Vith his passing to O'Brien and his final smash across for a touchdown,· Niemiec the man with the collapsible knee, didn't do badly at all. 
R. H. L. Maites the Review 

AND NOTRE DAl\IEI Why; you little rascals, after that ~arne of yours with Wisconsin we thou~ht the Navy would simply bury you ri~ht in the center of Soldiers' Field. And then look what you did! It's as hard to predict how a football game is going to come out as it is to forecast an election. 

Notre Dam.e Wisconsin 
The statistics would say that Notre Dame badly outplayed Glen Thistlewaite's powerful Wiscon­sin eleven. They would prove that the Blue and Gold gained more than twice as much ground as the Badgers from scrimmage; but the score-board on Randall Field showed twenty-two points for the Cardinal and six for Rockne's Fighting Irish. And, after all, points are the things tha.t win ball 
games. The Notre Dame backs fumbled, and they fum­bled at most inopportune moments. It was these unfortunate occurrences alone that led to \Visean­

i I 
sin's victory. Rockne's men drove down the field in true Notre Dame fashion late in the secondil quarter, and climaxed this march with a touch­
il 
_down; which offset the two point margin \Vis­I! consin had gained through a safety.
It 
But Old Man Fumble kept hanging around; and before the. third period had ended, he had hung the Indian sign on the Fighting Irish in the form of two more \Visconsin touchdowns.

v 
I i

Notre Dame was defeated, but not outplayed. Fumbles are like errors in baseball. They arc un­fortunate happenings, but they should not cause a cry for the scalps of the offenders. 
The defensive play of John Law and Ed. Collins featured for the Irish. John, as usual,. was at the bottom of every play. The tm.{gher they make it for John, the better he likes it. Ed. Collins dumped the Badger safety man in his ·tracks on three suc­cessive punts.· Each time he raced down the field and tackled Cuisinier before the latter could even get started. 
\Visconsin has a strong team-a fast-charging line, and a deceptive running and aerial attack. The Badgers should come close to a Conference Championship. 
A cheer for the great·team that won. But do not be inclined to criticize the Fighting Irish who outgained and outran the Badgers, but who couldn't beat Old Man Fumble.

Too Many Futnbles-Irish .Lose 
By HARLAND RoHM 
Chicago Tribuue Press Service 
MADISON, \'\TIS., Oct. 6-\'V'isconsin swept back the Notre Dame tidal wave in the Badgers' opening game of the season today, 22 to 6. 
Fumbles .paved the way for two of Wisconsin's touchdowns, but it was a powerful line whic;;h re­covered the fumbles and gav~ the backs a chance. Wisconsin scored first when Kettelaar broke through to block a· kick and fall on the ball be­hind Notre Dame's end zone for a safety. In the second quarter Notre Dame marched 70 yards, chiefly by passes, to score and at the half the count was 6 and 2.

\'V'ithin five .minutes two N~tre Dame fumbles gave \'V'isconsin its chance for two touchdowns. 
I~ yardage and downs there is a sad discrepancy ·between the figures and those on the scoreboard, for Notre Dame gained far more ground from scrim­mage, with the distances the ball was moved on passes about equal.

Irish March Dowtt Field 

l ~ 
All of which doesn't relate Notre Dame's own really fine bit of football. A punting duel had
i 
lasted most of the first quarter, with Lusby's toe
t 
keeping the ball in Notre Dame's territory 
j most of the time. It was his punt that sailed out 
I 
! of bounds on Notre Dame's 12-yard line and two line plays that failed to get more than one yard 
that led to that first score. A penalty put Notre Dame on their goal line and Elder dropped back to punt. Kettclaar came through to drop him for a safety and two points. 
Binish ruined Morrissey's first pass and Rebholz spoiled the next one hurled by Niemiec.· But the next two came off. Niemiec tossed to the tall Colrick for 20 yards. Chevigny lost four· on a line-buck, but on the next play Niemiec again hurled the pigskin to Colrick an~ he clipped off 16 yards. · 
Behind great interference Niemiec ripped off tackle for 15 yards to \'V'isconsin's six-ya.rd line. Shay lost on a line-buck, but Niemiec got it back, and though Notre Dame was penalized five yards for offside, Chevigny once more crashed through for eight yards to \'V'isconsin's three-yard line. On the next play he went over for the touchdown, · but missed the kick. 
The third quarter began with a rush. After the 
· kick-off and a. punt, Notre 
own 20-yard line. Elder fumbled, but fell on the ball, losing twelve yards, and on the next play, Mor­rissey fumbled and Ganten­bein dove on the ball on the three-yard line. Bartholo­mew circled Notre Dame's left end for the three yards on the next· play,· but his kick was blocked. · 
\'V'ith the score 8 to 6 in its favor, Wisconsin took its second break V,;ithin two minutes. Backus kicked off and Chevigny punted. An exchange of punts followed, with Notre Dame in posses­

sion of the ball on its ·20-yard line. Conroy th.rew Shay for a three-yard loss. Chevigny fumbled and Harold Smith fell on the ball.. Smith made three yards through left tackle, Bartholomew added one on a thrust through right guard, Behr his left guard for three, and \'V'isconsin was penalized five yards for delay in calling the next play. \'V'ith the ball on the 20-yard line, Cuisinier tossed a perfect pass to Smith at his right and Smith crossed the line. Bartholomew kicked goal. 
Beh1· ·Passes to Cuisi11ie1· 

The third \'V'isconsin .touchdown came at the be­ginning of the fourth quarter, when threats at goal had been meager for some time, but with \Viscon-. sin in possession of the ball on its own 65-yard line Behr snapped a pass to Cuisinier, who caught it on the. Notre Dame forty-five-yard line. For twenty yards his interference dumped everything in sight .and for the last twenty-five he went it alone, and he went plenty fast. L. Smith's kick on the tryout for point was perfect. 
Notre Datne Navy 

l'vfr. K. K. Rockne may, or may not, be a psy­chologist. But, he did array his Fighting Irish in bright green jerseys for their battle with the United States Naval Academy. Mr. Rockne evidently sur­mised that garbing a band of native and adopted Irish in their native color is somewhat akin to show­ing a bull the Russian flag. 
The more plausible reason for the sinking of the Navy craft, however, is that Notre Dame played football as it should be played. The fumbles that marred and lost the \X'isconsin game were absent; the offense was powerful; the defense, steady. Navy was helpless until nearly the end of the ·game, when a march dowri the field, led by Lloyd, brought the Middies to the seven-yard line. Here they were stopped. 

No one will easily forget the fine work of John Chevigny, who played himself to exhaustion. His offensive work sparkled, and he broke through sev­. eral times to upset·some hopeful Navy ball carrier. Nor is Johnny Niemiec likely to go unremembered. He drove through the tackles like a meteor, drag­ging the Navy lineman five yards before he was 
7 0 

downed completely; his pass-to Colrick for the winning points was a classic. And Tim Moynihan, son of Erin, garbed in green-didn't .he make Irish eyes smile, and Irish voices cheer when he came down on the punts to tackle the safety man? And wasn't he smearing Na:vy pla.ys before they even got started? 
Captain Freddie Miller, always lead~ng, always. working, always fighting, as only he can, was a bulwark on offense and defense. Johnny Colrick, pass snaring demon, comes in for his laurel wreath. But, don't forget the rest of those Fighting Irish. Each one was a cog in the machine; each one de­serves all the credit possible. 
The Middies gave their best-and lost gamely. But they wore blue jerseys; Notre Dame had to wear another color and Mr. Rockne chose green. If you really wonder why a green jersey should affect men with names like Chevigny, Niemiec, Leppig, Herwit, and. the like, come close and we'll whisper the answer in your ears. 
They're Irish by association.

Pass, Nie:miec to Colrick, Wins Ga:me 
By. wARREN BROWN 
Notre Dame's revamped football team gained enough yards at Soldier Field, to defeat three football teams. They. gained enough points to defeat but one, and by a score of 7 to 0. The stand of ..Navy Bill" Ingram's. Middies before a crowd of 120,000 persons was all in vain. 
Only for a few moments, in the ga.thering dark­

ness of what was a. long, drawn-out afternoon, 
did the Middies have a look-in in that ball game. . And even then it required the employment of 
high-powered glasses to discover that. 
From start to finish, Knute Rockne's ramblers . outrushed them·, outpassed them, and; in the first few minutes of the fourth pe­riod,-shoved over the touch­down that outscored them.

backfield is forgotten, the Notre Dame adherents, and their number toda.y was legion, will b~ talk­ing about the onslaught of those Johnnies, Niemiec and Chevigny. 
They cantered off tackles. They slipped around the ends. They, or rather Niemiec, passed, by way variety, and-when ·all else had failed-he passed by way of a. touchdown. · 
It was his. slanting toss over to the left side of his line, just out of the reach of some frantically clutching Midshipmen, that landed in the o':lt­stretched paws of Colrick, shortly after the final period had begun. · 
Cm·ideo Kicks Goal 

As Colrick happened to be standing on the right side ~f the Navy line at that time, there was _nothing much to be done about it. It was the touchdown that Notre Dame has awaited all after­noon and the touchdown that 120,000 spectators had just about despaired of ever seeing. 
Cariedo kicked the goal, just to pick up the extra point, and the ball game· was over, though Navy, fi.ghting to the last, opened up a belated rush that carried the Middies cause down close enough to Notre Dame's goal line to make the Irish following uncomfortable .for the first and last time ip the afternoon. 

Up until this last despairing effort, most of the ground covered by Navy was in the wrong di­rection. But even at that, they were as close, for all practical purposes, to scoring for three periods as were the Irish, though the latter, with marches 
. 
of sixty-five and fifty-six yards, one of thirty-two and a pair of twenty-eight yards, were gaining practically all the territory encompassed in the gray walls of Soldier Field. 
The twenty-eight ·yard march, and the last one, at that, was the one· that ma­terialized in the touchdown. 
I1·ish Pe1zalized 65 Ym·ds Some of the early efforts were neutralized. by the in­fliction of penalties, some sixty-five yards of these be­ing charged against the Irish, compared with twen­ty-five yards of the same ir-· ritating decisions against the 

Navy. In the course of the competition, Notre Dame rolled up something like 268 yards to Navy's 93, and much of the latter yardage ·wasn't c·om.:.. piled until after Notre Dame had scored: In fact, in the first half and a goodly portion of the sec~ ond, Navy was inside Notre Dame territory just twice, a~d then across the line that marks mid­field. 
Coach Rockne, who can always be depended t1pon to do the unexpected, started wi1at amounts to his first team, and the .. shock troops" .w~re conspicuous by their absence. 
01tiy 01te Fumble_ l1z The Ga;tte 

The lads that-started for Notre Dame hung on until they were physically unable to continue,.and Chcvigny, one of the two heroic figures of the victorious cause: remained on the job until he had to be carried from the field. But before he left, Notre Dame had seven points and Navy had none. 
Notre Dam.e 0 Georgia Tech 13 
A real team takes victory modestly and defeat without an alibi. Georgia Tech has a powerful teafl.l this year, while Knute Rockne's machine is in a stage of development. 
Tech scored in the first five minutes by means of a long pass and then a short one, with Durant doing the pitching and Thomason and Mizell on the receiving end. 
These throws brought the ball to the three­yard line, and Mizell took it across for the touch­down. Mizell kicked goal. That ended the scor­ing 'till two minutes before the close of hostilities, when a Tech manwhose name is Father Lumpkin, caught one of Niemiec's passes and sprinted to the Irish three'-yard line. He scored on the second pla.y. 
The. Irish offense was strong, and the Notre Dame backs penetrated the Georgian's 10-yard line twice, only to be thrust back or to have passes grounded in the -end zone. The Gold and Blue missed sorely the presence of a plunging full-back. 
Not :in iota of credit is to be taken from Tech, however, their passing attack was dev;stating in its power; their line, especially the giant. center and captain, Peter Pund, charged through and dumped secondary consistently. 
And our Fighting Irish did justice to their name, too; Chevigny and N~emiec played their heads off; Billy Dew gained much yardage; John Colrick snagged several beautiful passes from Niemiec. But it was not our day. 
Tech is to be congratulated on her splendid team. Thomason, Mizell and this Father Lump­kin were the main reasons for the victory, Mizell particularly being responsible for some sizeable gains. 
And Atlanta was a wild place the night of the game. The Engineers had beaten Notre Dame. But not without a bitter struggle. For Notre Dame, the sometimes beaten, always makes the opposition feel that they have been in some sort of battle. 
How did the student body feel about the de­feat? Almost to a. man, it welcomed home the team with a heartier greeting than would have been given, ha4 we won•. 
For,. win or lose, Notre Dame is behind her teams. And defeat, occasionally, is inevitable.

Drake 

Dusk was descending about the colorful cotil­. lion crowd, when the official in the white golf­
trousers banged his toy pistol to indicate that hos­
tilities between Notre Dame and Drake had offi­
cially come to an end. 
Coach Ossie Solem's, Drake Bulldogs were un­defeated before this game, but they were unable to unloose anything to match the strong Notre Dame attack, which functioned so smoothly, mainly be­cause of a boy, named Larry (Moon) Mullins. 
Mr. ~ockne, had been testing everyone in sight in his effort to find a full-back who could with­stand, at the same time the rigors of pounding a hostile line to shreds, and of stopping the efforts of the· enemy backs at, or nearly at, the line. of scrimmage. And with that marvelous intuition that is p·eculiar to him, «Rock" called Larry Mul­lins, who was a. half-back, and gave him instruc­tions: uNow, Mullins, when Tim Moynihan passes you the ball, you put your head down and gallop. \Vhen the other team has the ball, stay close to the line and help the boys toss the ball carriers backwards." Larry Mullins· carried out Coach Rockne's instructions to the letter. He smashed, 'pivoted and drove his way through the Drake line consistently.. Once, when he momentarily fum­bled the ball, he reached out and rccover:ed it, while he was in the grasp of a half-dozen Drake tacklers. Needless to say, the search for a full-back who IS a full-back . ended today. For Notre Dame has «Moon" Mullins. 
32 6 

But Notre Dame also has the Niemiec-Colrick combine which was responsible for the first touch~ down. 
Jack Chevigny smashed through center for ~ touchdown, just before the close of the half. Frank Ca.rideo crawled through a mass of blue and ·white_ jerseys for a third counter. 
Then Dinny Shay helped the cause with a tally. Mr. Dinny Shay is a real full-back, too, like Moon Mullins, the only thing against him being his weight. He is a bit light to absorb punishment for a whole game. But'he is a mighty valuable man, this ·~ninny" Sha.y. 
For the final Notre Dame touchdown, Joe Nash, who plays center, and who is as fast as a half-back; sprinted fifty yards after intercepting one of the passes that King was tossing about the premises. Nash had dropped back to help catch some of those throws, after King had completed a beauti­ful pass to Seiberling who eluded the Irish safety man for .the lone Drake score. It was the most spectacular play of the game. If Larry Mullin~ and Dinny Shay became incapacitated, we should suggest Joe Nash at full-back. He behaves like one when he gets a chance. 
The Irish line worked with the back-field and gaping holes were usually opened for the Notre Dame backs to crash through. And the lad who was crashing through most of the time was Larry . Mullins the converted half-back.

Mullins Flashes Great Form for Fighting Irish 
By HARRY MAcNAMARA 
NOTRE DAME, IND., Oct. 27-Knute K. Rockne's battered Notre Dame warriors recovered their football poise, sense of direction and deception long enough today to crush Drake University's heretofore undefeated Bulldogs, 32 to 6. 
The Irish have not been defeated on their own historical battleground, Cartier Field, for thirteen years and the startling reversal of form uncorked by Mr. Rockne's charges enable them to uphold this football. tradition. 
Notre Dame, beaten by Wisconsin, held to a 7 
to 0 score by a mediocre Navy team and vanquished by Georgia Tech, came out of its coma with vengeance against Drake, a. team that came here keyed to the limit and expecting to win. 
Mulli11s 11t Stellm· Role 
The Bulldogs played good football against Notre Dame, but the fire and the spirit of the great Irish teams of the past were burning in the hearts of Rockne's crippled but inspired army, and it would not be denied. 
Larry Mullins, a rip-roar­ing sophomore youngster from Pasadena, Cal., con­tributed more individually

His personally con­ducted slashes through the line mixed ·with an occasional pass, swept the ball . down the field and over the goal line, eighty yards away for Notre Dame's -first· touchdown, a 13-yard pass, tossed by Johnny Niemiec and received by Colrick produced the score, but Mullins battering at the line had caused the Drake secondary defense to move in, in an effort to stop his march, and the completion of the pass was a simple matter.

Mullins kept right on pounding away at the Drake line in. the third period. Eventually Capt. Miller recovered Barnes' fumble on the ·Drake 11..; yard line. Chevigny got six yards ~n his first attempt, a wide end run, and Mr. Mullins drove through center to the 6-inch line on the next play.·

Mullins, Chevigny, Niemiec and the rest of the Notre Dame regulars were yanked out of there by Mr.. Rockne ·a little later, and the shock troopers were given a chance to show what they could do. 
They did well enough at.that, in the final period, which saw them score two more touchdowns while Drake was scoring one, its only one. 
King _flipped a 25-yard pass to Seiberling from Drake's 20-yard line and the big Bulldog fullback outsprinted the Irish secondary defense to put over the enemy touchdown. . 
The pass was good for an advancement of eighty yards, a spectacular but desperate piece of business.

They taped and bandaged his wrist 'till it appeared as if he might be conce~ling a length of iron pipe under his jersey. Then Mr. Rockne sent him and ten other fighting Irishmen loose against a hungry Nittany Lion. The lion was no match for the Irish. 
The score does not indicate the superiority of the Rockne clan; Penn State was badly outplayed, and with the exception of a. few times, when a fellow named French got loose, the Notre Dame goal was never in danger. 
The first points came after a sustained march. down the field by Messrs. Niemiec, Chevigny and Collins. \X'hen the Penn State goal was qnly a few feet away, Frank Carideo ·crawled through for the touchdown. John Niemiec obliged with a placement kick for the extra point. The oth<:r

rrA_rmy Pities No~re Dame/" _ A shot in.the Rev<?luti<?n~ry \Var may have been heard 'round the world, but the cry of «Army Pities Notre.Dame," was more than heard around the Notre Dame campus. First seen in a news­paper article voicing the attitude of the Army · coaches about the game, the cry was taken up and challenged mightily. The campus was aflame with torch-flares, and the cold autumn night was filled with the war cries of three thousand aroused stu­dents. There were pep meetings every night, the week before the game. The entire school was afla"me with the fires of v~ctory. The residence halls vied with each other in taking up the chal­lenge of the haughty Army. It was the greatest show of enthusiasm ever seen at Notre Dame. \'{Then the team left for the East, the student body to a man, wished them «good luck," and sent them away with the cry of «Beat Army," ringing _in their_ ears. 
Then came Saturday morning. Two thousand 

Notre Dame men knelt in Sacred Heart Church and p·ra.yed that, God willing, the Army would be humbled. Father Hugh O'Donnell, remembering other years-paid the highest tribute possible to ·the men of Notre Dame-by telling them that it was undoubtedly the greatest show of real Notre 
Dame spirit he had ever seen. 
Saturday afternoon, the Fighting Irish, rose to 
great heights and humbled a po:werful Army team. 
Sunday night, five thousand people welcomed back 
the triumphant Irish. 
Army, you may well fear Notre Dame, and 
fight against Notre Dame, and try with all your 
might to humble the Fighting Irish-but never 
again «pity Notre Dame." For Notre Dame will 
never be pitied. Not even by the greatest Army 
team in history. And the same Notre Dame spirit 
that guided George Gipp in his immortal, vic­

He ran like a demon, over the white chalk-marks to the shadow of the Notre Dame goal. But he too succumbed to the power of exhaustion. To say the least, he had not had a pleasant afternoon, and dejectedly and wearily, the great red-head trudged from the field. A minute later, the game was over.

The first quarter was·hardly over before Steffen's 
men again were menacing Notre Dame's goal. The goalward march started when Harpster caught a punt on his 28-yard line. It didn't end until Rosenzweig planted the ball behind the line for a touchdown. It was an end 'round play with Ros­enzweig .carrying the ball that brought the score. That play had been fooling the Irish all the way. Harpster kicked goal and when the teams left the field for the half, Carnegie was out in front, 20 to 0. 
That score would have discouraged almost any 
band of athletes. But not Notre Dame. The team's indomitable ·fighting spirit made it appear for a moment in the third quar­ter like it might come back. 
·Moon Mullins, a substitute 
half-back, on the third play · of the third quarter, scooped up the ball which Karcis had let slip from his hands and . sped 1 0 yards to the goal. Niemiec kicked the extra 
point. 
Mullins, a moment la.ter, fell on another fumble and Notre Dame started amarch down field that seemed to have continuity. It ended on the 25-yard line in a vain 

attempt to score thrc:>ugh the air.

Ca.rnegie's final touchdown was the result of a wide pass, Harpster to. Letzelter, that ·caught Rockne's.men napping. Letzelter had a clear field in his 23-yard sprint to the goal. · . 
Elder, sprinter, who replaced Bray in the Notre Dame lineup, added a final thrill by breaking away for a 65-yard run ·shortly before the game ended. Johnny O'Brien, who caught the pass that beat the Army, was ·rushed into the battle in time to snare 
a. toss that put the ball on Carnegie's 2-ya!-"d line. 
Here.it was that Carnegie showed its defensive strength. Reilly fumbled and recovered. Elder was held for no gains. An attempted pass was knocked down and Notre Dame's last chance to score ended when a pass sailed straight into the arms of Harpster, who downed it b:!hind the goal line for a touchback.

Fighting Irish. That's what they arc. And they look just as great in defeat as they do in victory. 
Although the powerful Trojan team was abl~ to outscore the scrappy Notre Dame squad, they'll never forget the great stand made by Rockne's men. A heavier and more powerful team than the Blue and Gold, Coach Howard Jones' aggregation had to give everything it had to finally eke out a victory. 
Twice the Irish line held for downs within the two-yard line. And during that second half, with . twenty points rolled up against them, the Rock­men launched a desperate drive that shattered the Trojan dream of a one-sided, decisive defeat, and made them thankful for their victory. 
It was a bitter, unflinching battle every inch of the way.. The vicious play made injuries frequent and several men· on both teams had to be carried from the field. 
And although there is nothing but praise for the great team of Trojan warriors, the courage and splendid spirit displayed by the Fighting Irish made them as glorious in defeat as they would have been in victory. 

Although outscored, not once was Notre Dame outgamed or outfought. For these reasons and be­cause after all, a Notre Dame team is a Notre Dame team, we feel proud indeed of Capt. Fred Miller and his courageous, splendid team. 
For U. S. C. Don \X'illiams and Russ Saunders were the luminaries. It was this duo that carried the ball sixty-seven yards for the first Trojan touchdown, and it was their splendid .play through­out the game that kept U.S. C. on top. 
For the Fighting Irish, every man in the game battled to exhaustion. They all fought 'till they could no longer stand. Niemiec, Chevigny, Tim Moynihan, all aquittcd themselves nobly, even de­feat. · 
Thus closed the 1928 season, spotted by four defca ts at the hands of four of the greatest teams in the nation. The record of Rockne's fighting team is one of which all Notre Dame men are proud, for though they went down in glorious defeat, they kept high, the traditions of Notre Dame.

Trojans Battle Way ThrOugh Fighting RockneTeatn to Win

LOS ANGELES, CAL., Dec. 1-A Notre Dame team that was gallant, resolute, tricky and alert collided with a University of Southern California team that was just as .gallant, resolute, alert, and that was a bit more tricky and powerful, and the result goes into football history as a 27 to 14 victory. for the team from the far west. 
It was a game that no Notre Dame rooter, keyed to the recollection of two past one-point victories over strong U. S. C. teams, need feel apologetic over losing. Two indomitable .stands, with their own goal posts at their very

Moon Mullins at full-back tried a forward pass, but Steponovich, Howard Jones' running guard, tore in and batted the ball in the air. He juggled it frantically in an effort to hold onto the pigskin, which finally decided to nestle in his arms, and Steponovich romped 18 yards to the goal, with his intercepted pass. Hibbs place-kicked his second successive goal, after missing the first.

Early in the second period U. S. C. put over a second touchdown. This was on a pass from Don \Villiams to Marger Apsit, after Notre Dame had stopped one series of line plays on its four-yard line, but could not restrain U. S. C. from rushing back up· a second time. But when Notre Dame's line because ironclad, \Villiams arched a basketball lob to Aspit on the two-yard line, and Jack Chc­vigny was just out of reach where he might have prevented Aspit from lazily stepping' across the goal. 
The third Trojan touchdown was carried across by Tony Stcponovich just two plays after Aspit 
ifornia.'s 3 0-yard territory, little Chevigny took the ball on a fake reverse and sped right through the field 51 yards to a touch-. down. It was a great display. The stands had waited for just such a. display of the unusual by one of Rockne's blue-jcrseyed horde and Chcvigny gave them a thrill every step. · 
After several exchanges of the ball ncar mid-field, Frank Caridco took a punt and returned it fifty yards from his own 25-yard line to the U. S. C. 25-yard strip. A little fellow named· Albert Gebert went in for Carideo at quarter-back. Half-back Elder and full-back Mullins wrestled and banged their way to the five-yard mark, aided by a five­yard penalty for off-side imposed ·against the Tro­jans. Nearly everybody on the South Bend team had a try at the touchdown opportunity, and on a fourth down Gebert, who is a slight fellow, evi­dently proved too small for the burly U. S.C. for­
. wards to grab, and he slipped through the center of the line for a touchdown.

Freshtnan Football 
Throughout many a long, weary, autumn after­
noon, . a squad of grecn-jcrseyed a.thletes went through their paces on Cartier Field-contributing their bit toward the making of the great varsity eleven which represented Notre Dame on the gridiron this fall. Forever striving to check the varsity's onslaught in scrimmage, charging val­iantly against a mighty blue wall, running the ·gauntlet through lanes of determined varsity. tacklers-that is the lot of the freshmen football 
player. 
The famous phrase, ..To the vi~tor belongs the spoils," coined by a certain distinguished Tennes­see gent_lcman, never bore greater significance than it does in the case of freshman football. What­ever honors are won in victory; whatever plaudits arc merited in glorious defeat; whatever distinc­tions arc achieved in the national acclaim of sports critics-these arc bestowed upon the varsity, re­flected of course, to a minor extent, upon the Re­serves. But no one ever thinks of giving the freshmen credit for their contribution to the big team's success. Nobody, except those intimately connected with Notre Dame football," ever seems to appreciate the fact that the freshman team con­stitutes an important cog in the university's foot­ball machinery. 
To serve as cannon-fodder, day after day, for heavier, more experienced varsity teams; to for­get old plays and learn new ones with the advent of each additional enemy on the varsity's schedule, that is the lot of the freshman. And in general, to suffer the abuse and scorn which are the lot of every freshman who ever ripens into a genuine upperclassman-these are ordeals which only those who have experienced them ca·n fully understand. 

OFFICIAL FOOTBALL REVIEW-1928 
But the men in· green do all those things for a pur­pose. They realize that no outstanding feat which they individually may perform ever fails to escape the attention of their supreme coach, Rockne. Many an athlete earned his monogram indirectly during his freshman year. 
But the ideals which guide the average fresh­man player are not alone ·subjective. He realizes that he is rendering material assistance in the build­ing up of grea.t N otrc Dame elevens. He knows that the very men who knock him about daily make up his team, that their victories are his vic­tories; and for this purpose, he is willing to exert his greatest effort.s in order to help produce a super varsity. 
Early in September a small army of some two or three hundred ambitious yearlings responded to Coach Poliskey's call for candidates. By a gradual process of elimination, the multitude was reduced to the neighborhood of forty players, and approxi­mately this number will receive their well-earned reward in the form of the coveted .. 1932" nu­merals, blazing forth upon their manly chests. Poliskcy encountered considerable difficulty in ar­ranging the various individuals of the mob of can­didates according to their athletic talents. As usual, a large number of ~igh school stars, prep school captains, and others of the scintillating spe­cies were represented, most of whom had widely di­vurgent ideas regarding the proper procequre in the game of football. But order soon prevailed;. the principle known as the survival of the fittest was given free rein; and before long a substantial frosh team was ready ·to take the field. 
Until a few years ago, it was customary for the 
freshman class to hold a formal dance called the 
.. Freshman Frolic." But it seems that certain 
frosh became too frolicsome; and thereupon the 
university ~uthoritics definitely legislated against the formal frolics of freshmen. Thereafter, in order to furnish an outlet for the store of surplus energy lying dormant in their anatomies, it was decided that the freshmen should annually 'indulge in a friendly game of football with the varsity, the week prior to the regular opening of each season. -It was in this year's .. frolic" that the freshmen showed their greatest power, holding the varsity to a scoreless tic during the first quarter. Of course, ultimately they were crushed under a bar­rage of touchdowns, but this fact can hardly dis­
color their firs.t-quartcr achievement. 
In the course of the frequent scrimmages during 
the season, quite a wealth of promising material 
was uncovered from the freshman squad. Among 
the ends, Mahoney, Isoe, Host, and· Lagura were 
outstanding. Conners and McNamara showed up 
best at the tackle positions, with Van Roy and ·Malloy excelling as guards. At center, Abe Zoss gave promise of a bright future, while Bloemer and Rogers alternated with him a.t the pivot post. Swartz peformcd brilliantly at quarter-back, with Murphy as his understudy. Of the half-backs, Brill, Kaplan, and Kokcn were the most prominent. Great things are expected of Marty Brill who formerly was one of Lou Young's ball carriers at Penn. At full-back, Cahill and Sheekcski both manifested inclinations to take Freddie Collins' place. 
Much of the credit for the success of this year's frosh team is due to Coach Poliskey :who labored tirelessly to develop a representative yearling squad. Poliskey himself served three years on the varsity in the capacity of right tackle; and by virtue of h:s handling of the freshmen squad,-he has proven that those years were not spent in vain.

Interhall Football 
The Football Review would not be complete if a resume of the Interhall season were not presented. Long before the varsity teams were organized to represent the university on the athletic field, the students in Carroll and Brownson battled for the championship of the Main Building. The trophy, tradition tells us, was a barrel of apples awarded by the Prefect of Discipline to the victorious eleven. The interest aroused in the earlier days is still in bution to the success of the league. Most of these coaches have learned their football from Rockne, Mills and Keogan. Others have played Varsity ball in other institutions. In every case, the hall teams are under the supervision of leaders who are competent to handle men and are willing to give their afternoons to make the league function smoothly. Such a system must of necessity pro­duce results and the type of football played in the 
evidence. Today, Notre Dame fosters an Interhall League of which Notre Dame men justly feel proud. 
From the beginning with the Carroll Brownson rr.em­bers, the development of the league has been in keeping with the spirit of the Uni­versity. Sarin, Corby, Badin, (Old St. Joe Hall) were added to the circuit, and to­da.y there are two divisions of six teams each. Freshman halls make up one division while the upper class halls are included in the second division. During. the past season, over four hundred and twenty-five players have participated in regular Inter­hall games. On Thanksgiv­ing Day seven ·hall teams

past few years has been of the highest. The listless playing that characterized Interhall games a few years ago is no longer in evidence. Hall enthusiasm is excellent and clean play and. real foot­ball has marked every con-.· test. 
.We point with pride to the success of the league un­der Fr. Mooney's direction. He has done much to raise the standard of Notre Daine , foo.tball. The student body recognizes the services ·of co-operation of Physical Ed­ucation and Boy Guidance students, Varsity Men, and Varsity Coaches. \Yfc a-rc not unmindful of the fact that the spirit of Notre Dame has· played its part. We re­
invaded foreign fields to bring to a close the most successful season in the history of the sport. 
In former years, Interhall competition was not so well organized as it is today. Practice periods, dai.ly workout, and Coaches were not looked upon as essentials. Officials were drafted from the crowd on the side lines and the equipment con­sisted for the most part of stray bits of uniforms discarded-by the varsity. 
Looking back on .the past three years, we find a new order of things, and we feel certain that no other .university provides such a wholesome, rugged type of activity for its student body. 
Three years ago, Father Vincent Mooney, C.S.C. 
· was selected by Father \Yfalsh to take charge of the Interhall situation. He appuinted students ma­joring in.Physical Education and Boy Guidance to coach the Interhall teams. First-class equipment was secured and playing fields and faciliti~s provided. Competent officials arc appointed from the Var­sity squad and these men have made a· real contri­alize, too, that the players themselves are con­vinced that because of their participation in Inter­hall football they more clearly understand the Sportsman's Code. 
Keep the rules~ 
Keep faith with ~your comr.ade. 
Keep your temper. 
Keep yourself fit. 
Keep a stout heart in' defeat. 
· Keep your pride under in victory. Keep a sound soul, a clean mind, and a healthy body. 
In the play-off for the championship of the Intcrh_all League, Lyons defeated Howard by a. score. of 6-0. The game was played on Cartier Field and drew a crowd of five thousand persons · who watched the contest. This game was a fit­ting climax to the most successful season m the history of the League.

Managers 

AUGUST GRAMS 
Student Manage~ 
The proverbial one-armed paper hanger was never busier than A ugic Grams. There arc so many details that demand his attention that it is indeed a wonder how Augic docs such an excellent job of it. Tix:nc of de­parture, place of residence, time of return, distribution of student tickets, and a million other things arc some of the reasons why Augic never has a minute to spare. And yet he manages to take care of everything most satisfactorily. 
uRock" leaves everything in the way of details to Grams. And to see that everything goes right for every game, at home or abroad, to provide for housing, and care of visiting teams, is in itself a big job-but not too big for Augic Grams. · He'll find time for lots of other things, too. 
So when you think that it's a soft job-managing a Notre Dame football team, just think of a few of the things Augie Grams has to do. And if after thinkin'g, you ·still think it's easy-just follow Augic around during the course of a week-end during the season-and it's ten to one you'll not stand the gaff.

VERYBODY has his favorite football hero, and the choice depends on the generation, the sector or the games that one has seen. There are those who will quarrel when anybody disputes the assertion that Jim Thorpe, the Indian, was the greatest individual player. In the Middle \Y/est it was \Y/illie Heston. In Army circles it always will be Elmer Oliphant. At Harvard they will point to the mileage covered by Eddie Mahan. Then we pass the Four Horsemen and come down to Red Grange. :Nlr. C .. C. Pyle, who managed him as a professional football player, never once denied that young Mr. Grange was the greatest of the great. 
This being near the annual Army-Notre Dame game puts me in mind of the greatest individual football player I ever saw, and that is as near as anybody can come to answering that question: "\Y/ho was the grea-test football player?" It always will have to be a matter of individual opinion. 
I am not going back very far in this instance, merely back to 1920, when .the Army-Notre Dame game was one of those minor affairs. There was no difficulty a.t all about getting tickets for it. The cheering section consisted merely of the cadet corps held at the post; whatever garrison and com­missioned personnel there happened to be and per­haps a few thousand of the wandering Notre Dame alumni and their frie~ds, which since have become legion. 
The game was held at the Point, and at that 
time the football field was near the parade ground. 
It consisted of the regulation field, surrounded by 
wooden stands running only a few rows back. 
The trains to \Y/est Point were not overcrowded 
and they were running no specials. In fact it 
was "just one of those fo'otball games," one of 
the perfunctory contests through which the Army 
ream had to run in the course of "pointing" for 
the Navy-game. 
In those days the games at the Point were nice, 
homey affairs, apparently signifying nothing much 
as far as uAll America" teams and football at large 
were concerned. Colonel Koehler, who always in­
sisted that Oliphant, of \Y/est Point, was not only 
the greatest football player but the greatest all­
around athlete in the world, used to be host to the 
handful of experts and inexperts making the an­
nual pilgrimage. 
I do not know of any return game ever having 
been played at South Bend, where the Notre Dame 
teams stay when they stay if they do stay. Bur­
this is neither here nor in South Eend. \Vfe had a 
pleasant tiine chatting over athletics and other matters with the colonel and then strolled out to .see the football game. 
As we understand it, it was to be something. in the nature of an exhibition or work-out for the Army. There were rumors of a weird sort of genius named Rockne, who had worked out some great theories on ~he new game of football, but this did not . seem to swell the crowd or increase the interest. 
Today they tell me tha.t nobody can buy a ticket to the Army-Notre Dame game Saturday. This may be true, because I have tried myself; but then I am not particularly persistent about these mat­
. ters. It is what the boys interested in the finan­cing of sports would call a sell-out. 
That day on the Plains, if I said there were 8,000 spectators I exaggerated. Saturday there will be 80,000 watching the Army-Notre Dame game. 
But they will not see what we saw squatted on the wooden sea.t of the "stadium" at \Y/est Point. \Y/e saw in action Gipp of Notre Dame. Always, I am willing to be convinced, but I do not ever expect to see on a football field as swift, as sure, as dynamic, as colorful a figure as this George Gipp, of Notre Dame. 
A Game of Actio11. 

This is only one impression, formed by only one game, but it seemed to me that Gipp of Notre Dame was the greatest "triple-threat" man I ever saw in action. I have heard of Galloping Ghosts and Four Horsemen running wild. But I never saw more action in a football game than I did in that one. 
It was all Gipp. He ran ragged through that Army line. He would worm through the sec­ondary defense. I say that it was all Gipp, for the Army seldom had the ball. The figures of the 
· score I do not recall. f can hold only the impres­sion of that spectacle. He was a slight figure, it seemed to me, no bigger than Eddie Mahan, but when. he drove at the solid Army line it !:>ent. or gave way. Understand that I do not believe that any man single-handed can play a. football team, but if ever there was a player who seemed to do it, that player was Gipp of Notre Dame. And it was no weakling or badly drilled Army team that faced him. · 

I say that he was a great triple-threat man. He was more than that. He could punt, he could pass and he could run. More than that, he knew how to receive a pass, which is harder than throw­

OFFICIAL FOOTBALL REVIEW-1928 
King Knute 
By FRANKLYN E. DoAN, Sports Editor of tbe South Bend News-Times 
I
F SOME renowned Italian painter could escape 
the grave which holds him, and run up the 

ladder of four or five centuries, he might choose 
to visit South Bend and sketch a canvas that would 
be half a portrait and half an allegory. The alle­
gory would typify Speed, Power, and Spirit, while 
the portrait would set off the features of a. squat, 
bald-headed man who is known as Knute K. 
Rockne. 
This American football public, which lets its pulse beat in staccato movement once autumn has come around and which stampedes the thresholds of thousands of stadia the land over throughout the autumn, would acclaim the canvas. of the Italian master for it would be an ~nusual one. And the name-plate which the ~rt galleries would tack on the picture would be: ..Notre Dame Foot­ball and Rockne." 
It wasn't so long ago-seventeen years to be exact-that a young fellow came down to Notre Dame from Chicago, tried out for the band and showed the chemistry profs that he knew his stuff. But playing in the band was not in the sphere of Knute Rockne and. he decided to try for the foot­ball. team. Apparently. that was his element, for within a few years the whole football public grew to know him and to love him. 
Rockne was one of the fellows when he was at Notre Dame, but he was not an ordinary fellow. He lived in Sorin ..Dungeon," took part iri a. few mock murder trials and did a little pole-vaulting for the track team. But once he was on a· foot­ball ·field he was an inspired rob~t, prancing down the greensward. un.der punts, boxing a tackle until he couldn't move, or grabbing a pass out of the air. to run .through the opposition for a touchdown. 
It has. been just 17 years since King Canute first played on the Notre Dame varsity. '\W'ay ~ack in 1911, when football was as nationally unknownas archery. is now, Rockne played on the first great team of the Irish. \W'ith him were Gus Dorais, Bergman, Growley, Fillbrook and Feeney. They beat Pittsburgh, \W'abash, and Marquette thatyear, and, in the following season, that of 1914, knocked off the same opponents. Notre Dame football was. beginning to .amount to something. . 
And then in .1913:.._it just goes to show that .. 13" isn't such a'. tough number after all-these Fightin' Irish, who weren't known by that nam~ then, made the wiseacres sit .back. on their swivels and wonder: ..\W'ho in 'ell arc these upstart~ frollJ. the middle west and what .do they .think they~rc 
doing?'~· · · It was in that year that the. famous Rockne-
Dorais passing team-the first combination that ever attempted the forward pass in American foot­ball-and the canny Swede Rockne was proponent of the idea--it was then. that these two Notre· Dame athletes tramped east with a great team and swallowed the invincible Army team 35 to 13. The Army was surprised, the east was piqued, and the football country-at-large didn't know what to do 
about the whole thing. 
But the country soon found out what to do. Jess Harpster had. been coaching Notre Dame from 1913 to 1917 and Notre Dame numbered among its victims such established elevens as Penn State, Army and Indiana.. During Rockne's term as a player the outfit was not once defeated. 
\W'hen Jess Harpster returned to his far-western ranch in 1917, Knute Rockne, who had been act­ing as an ·assistant coach and chemistry instructor, became. generalissimo of the Notre Dame forces. If the country didn't know what to do about these young upstarts before, it was soon to learn that the wiser thing to do was to admit that a genius had pitched camp with an army of br:ain. and brawn, and had set out to do some tall surprising. 
For two years Rockne developed his team and won important games. Gipp, Kirk, Anderson and Smith were among the great luminaries turne.d out by the peerless coach. · In a period of three years from 1919 through 19.2l, Notre Dame lost one game and that to the Army. Ncbra.ska, Indi~na, Army, Purdue and Northwestern were engulfed in this football tidal wave that had become a· na­tional figure .. Such resplende~t st~rs as Roge Kiley, . George Gipp~ :Ed~ie Anderson, Johnny Mohardt, Chet \W'yiuie, Buck Shaw and Frank Coughlin ~ere pili~g up vict_ori~s fo~ old. N:otre Da:me and building a priceless tradition that was to 
·inspire Notre Dame teams of the future. 
\W'hen 1922 rolled around and the football fans set their eyes ·o-n.No~re Dame to sec ;hat the now renowned Rockne would turn out, the Notre Dame coach was facing a real test. He had lost 13 of hi~ mo~t depen~able stars and the squad which ca~c up was not. promising. yet the inyincible master won eight of. his ten games and ~is team scoreq 170 points that year.. · 1;'hc following year the Rockmen lost but one game and that to an .a.n<;:ient foe, Nehr.aska, by .a. close s_core.'

OFFICIAL FOOTBALL REVIEW-1928 

To See Or Not To See 
By wARREN BROWN 
Chicag_o Herald aud Examiuer 
Notre Dame, at. the time this space filling de­
vice is. being manufactured, has lost three football 
games, ·in one season. 
That sort of thing calls for much wailing, but 
doggone me, if I can find anything to squawk 
about, save that cage at the top of Cartier Field, 
that is called, for la,ck of other printable names, 
a press box. 
I can find no fault with the football team. I 
never could find fault with the coach. Even the 

cooking at Notre Dame appeals to me-but the ·press box! 
A reporter who has been drenched at a \Vfalker­
Hudkins fight, ·drowned at a Dempsey-Tunney 
fight, soaked at the closing game of a Washington­
Pittsburgh world's series, baked at a National Open 
Golf championship in \Vforcester, Mass., frozen at 
a · Michigan-Minnesota. game at Minneapolis, 
starved on any home-coming day at Urbana, Iowa 
City, Bloomington, Lafayette, or Madison, pop­
bottled at a crucial ball game in St. Louis, protests 
no more at conditions, if he can SEE what he is 
supposed to report. 
But out of that press box at Cartier Field, he 
sees nothing, after the top row of customers arrive, 
and begin to take an interest in proceedings. 
Mr. Rockne and his football men arc to blame 
for that. 
I can understand how a Chicago team, playing 

its usual run of opponents, on Cartier Field, would . permit a reporter to sec what it was doing, or rather what it wasn't doing. No one would be­come interested enough to stand up, or, if he did, his interest would not be sustained long enough, to keep him on his feet. But no .Notre Dame team 
can be watched quietly by any customer, no mat­ter what his leanings may be. . In the present season, I have been present at two games played on Cartier Field. 
I don't know yet whether it was Niemiec or Shay that scored a decisive touchdown against Loyola, of New Orleans. I might have known, if a lady with a large hat-and I didn't know there were such things any more (large hats, I mean)­rosc up and took me .out of the play, as well as Collins, or Miller, or any of the other MEN of Notre Dame, ever took out an opposing player. 
For the Carnegie Tech game, which I maintain, in spite of the visibility handicaps, was the greatest football game I have ever seen, it looked, at first, as if I might get a break. 
In the top row of customers, immediately be­fore me, there was an elderly lady, and a tiny one, at that. 
This lady announced, upon arrival, that the seat was comfortable, and she wrapped herself in a blanket, something after the fashion of a mummy. 
uwell, she's there for the afternoon," thought I. uAnd even if she does stand up, I can see over HER head." I sort of lorded it over the other inmates of the press ca.gc;who were contemplating fur coats, Mayor Thompson hats, late arriving customers, boy scouts, and other impedimenta. 
I don't suppose any of my readers have forgotten the game, or the start of it, any more than I have forgotten the finish, the middle, and the other sec­tions, if any. . 
Some gent in a red jersey flung a pass, and an­other one started down the field .... I heard after­wards that Carnegie Tech had scored. 
My friend, the tiny elderly lady, had arisen. She had climbed up on the seat. She had un­wound the blanket. She had begun to wave it. 
Try, sometime, to get a view of a football game, when someone is waving a. blanket in front of you. That may be great· stuff at a bull fight, but the presidential campaign is all over. 
The lady's escort was nettled. It seems that the elderly lady was a Notre Dame rooter. She waved the blanket at the wrong time. However, she had a defense that was a lot better than any Mr. Rockne's men were able to flash against a team that, on this particular day, was the greatest in the country. 
ui don't understand this game," she protested. uAnd if I don't keep on waving the blanket all the time, I'm liable to miss waving it when ·Notre Dame does something." 
And you just can't argue with a lady. As I checked back over my literary effort on the game, not only in the original report, but in a follow-up, I found that, of the Chicago corre­spondents, I alone had verged on . the hysterical. I thought it was a. heluva game, the greatest I had ever seen. But I was probably the only reporter who watched the game through a waving blanket. The point I would make, is that the press cage needs elevation, or Notre Dame football needs de­pression, arid I can't conceive the latter, with or without blankets. ·

ing one. He was accurate with his drop-kicks, and he kicked all the goals from placement. \X'hen a ­player can do those things they usually try to have him save himself on the defensive. But Gipp also was a great defensive back. 
\X'henever the ball was downed it seemed that the _announcer always was shouting through his megaphone, .. Gipp kicked, Gipp passed, Gipp through tackle. Gipp over for the touchdown." It always seemed to sound the note Gipp. Gipp, of Notre Dame. 
It could not have been that Gipp was in all the plays during the game, but somehow I seem to hold that impression .of this slender youth standing back of his line for an instant and then going rap­idly somewhere in the right direction. 
011ly 011e Sig1zal 
The story is that the Army team between halves was told not to watch the ball, but to watch Gipp. It amounted to the same thi~g, for where the ball was, there always was Gipp of Notre Dame. 
Ring Lardner, whose passi~n is football, was at this game. Said Mr. Lardner, ..Any dumb-bell

could understand the signal of the Notre Dame team. They ·have only one signal and one forma­tion-that is, to have the· team line up, pass the ball to Gipp and let him use his own judgment." 
They say of Babe Ruth that, whatever he has done outside, he never has made the wrong move or gesture on a baseball field. It seemed to me that Gipp was that way on the football field. If the intent had been to pass and his receiver was not in place Gipp would skirt the end and get through that broken field somehow. ·He seemed to be as hard to hold as an eel. 
The Hero of Notre Da11te 

Gipp died while he still was an undergraduate of Notre Dame, died from pneumonia, contracted while he was touring with the--"..Wandering Irish­men." I do not think that he even. was able to round out his football career. 
\X'hat manner of youngster he was personally, 1 never knew, but I imagine that he was of the type of Hobey Baker, of Princeton. I suppose that the· men of Notre Dame remember him with the same emotion with which the men of Princeton remem­ber Hobey Baker. They should, especially when the Army-Notre Dame games roll around. 
He was a great player,-that Gipp of Notre Dame.·

John Chevigny's Master Tackle 
By JOHN \Yf. KEYS 

Once in a great while a football star flashes forth with a dazz­ling play that lingers in the memory, like a pleasing melody, long after all else is forgotten. 
There is a young man in the game at Soldier Field this after­noon who made that kind of play one blizzardy November after­noon last year dowri at South Bend. He is John Chevigny, the lithe half-back of the Scrappy Irish of Notre Dame, and he made it in that bitter 7-to-7 tic the Irish fought with the Ghastly Gophers of Minnesota. · 
The play was a tackle, a startling, breath-taking, superhuman tackle that stopped the crashing Gophers three y;.trds from the goal and undoubtedly saved Notre Dame from a. defeat, in view of a touchdown that came later. Big Jim Braden, all-American full-back for Yale in 1919, saw it and said it was one of the greatest plays, if not the greatest tackle, he ever saw. And Jim saw a lot of them.

It came in the last quarter. The Irish were leading, 7 to 0. The ramming Joesting, Nydahl and Almquist had battered the Irish backward until, on fourth down, they were three yards from their own goal and it seemed as though nothing would stop 
a. tying touchdown. It was one of those trying moments that arise in the best of football families. · · 
The fighting ones had their spikes on their own goal line and for once it looked as if they were licked. Rockne barked some orders. Out on the field raced three or four blue-clad slender Irish. One was Chevigny, going in as full-back. 
The players crouched. The ball was snapped. It. shot to Nydahl and around his own right end he tore. Six steps for a touchdown. -His path was cleared. There was nobody to stop him ... nobody·... and then around the end of .the tangled mass of players there shot a blurry blue streak, a. flashing sky-rocket sort of thing that traveled like a hurled battering ram parallel with the ground and maybe a foot or two above it. 
·It was the outstretched, diving body of John· Chevigny. It struck the bounding Nyda~l squarely at the knees 'and he went down precisely at _the spot where he was hit, on the five-yard line. It was Notre Dame's ball.

Zooming along the skyline like the nervy riders of the Russian Cossacks, Stuhledreher, Crowley, Miller and Lay­den, with the help of the adamant· Seven Mules, buried ten opponents under a shell-fire of touch­downs. Army, Northwestern, \Visconsin, Car­negie Tech and Nebraska, all fell before the merci­less fire of Rockne's sharpshooters. 
In 1925, Notre Dame lost two games and tied a third while it was winning seven. In 1926, only Carnegie Tech defeated the Irish, while Minnesota, Northwestern and the Army were being trodden· underfoot. A year ago Army defeated Notre Dame and Minnesota tied the Irish in that great battle on Cartier Field, one of the greatest the venerable field has ever witnessed. .1\.nd 1928? \Veil, no one knows just what the result will be, but everyone expects the miraculous, which is al­ways the case with Notre Dame teams.

Ask Any Football Coach 
By GRANTLAND RICE 
\X'hen Roscoe Magee hit the trail into college There wasn't a coach who would give him a look, For he was the type whose collection of knowledge You'd think must emerge from a tome or a book; His brow was too high-so they cursed at their 
luck \X'hile looking for roughnecks who knew how to buck. 

Now Magee didn't weigh quite a hundred and fifty, But he was a dynamo under full steam; He was not only fast, he was wiry and shifty, And more than a wonder at driving a team; And then when the coach saw his work on the lot He offered three cheers till his tonsils· grew hot. 
The motal is-as they cry unto heaven For two-hundred-pounders to answer their search, A fast, heady quarter to drive an eleven Means more than a tackle as big as a church; You can always find use in the thick of the strain For a bundle of nerves that is hooked to a brain.
