The Varsity of 1904. 
[T was Avithout regret that another 
IS ^ page of Notre Dame's football '^ti^^^n history ^vas turned down on "^^fi*^^- Thanksgiving Day, for the record 

made b\' the VarsitA- of 1904- fell far below the standard set b\' the elevens of the past three A'cars. But the poor showing made this year does not reflect in any wa}' upon the abihtA' of Coach Salmon, nor upon the pluck or abilit}' of the men who made up the eleven. The Avhole cause ot the disastrous season can be set down to two causes—the lack of material and the frequent injury of the plaA-ers—neither of which Avas to have been foreseen by those in charge in time to have been avoided. Ot the championship eleven of 1903 Ave lost our entire back-held, both tackles, an end and one guard. This in itself was a serious obstacle to overcome, and it Avas seen after the first week of practice, that there was a woeful lack of material from which to 
>pick men to fill the vacant jDOsitions. Out of the squad of twenty-five there were but sixteen who were qualified by their classes to represent Notre Dame on the gridiron. Of the new men the majority were without previous experience and were very light, but Coach Salmon set to Avork to A\-hip his men into shape for the season. It was at this stage that the injuries commenced and kept up during the rest of the season. In quick succession, McNerne3^, Guthrie, Heal A', Silver, Shaughnessy and Church AA-ere injured so as to be forced to retire from the game. The lack of men forced Trainer Holland to ]Dut his cripples back in the game before thcA- had recoA'ered, and so our team ahA^aA'^s had one or more cripjDles in its line-up. And so AA'ith one or' moi-e of the best players in the college on the side­lines in CA^eiy game it is no AA'^onder that the Varsity Ax^as unable to .put forth its best game. The loss of the Kansas contest at least can-be laid to the number of cripples in our line-up, for it was not until after our subs had been put in the game that Kansas made their AA^inning. scores. 
Coach Louis J. Salmon had a hard task before him and the complications which arose as the season advanced did not tend to lighten liis burden. To his credit it must be said that he kept at A\'ork AA'ith the same spirit of perscA'crance that marked his x^laA'ing during" his four A-ears on I'Jotre Dame's teams and made his name famous in the annals of football from one coast to the other. The fact that the Varsity's team work and offensiA'C plaA- was developed to the speed and accuracy that AA'as shoAA'ii in the last few games speaks more for Salmon's abilitA" than the record of an ordinaiy team AA'ith good luck on its side AA-ould liaA'e done. It is the hope of the entire student body that Salmon AAHU return to Notre Dame next year, take charge of the team and bring Notre Dame back to the jDlace she occupied AA'hen he was the pride of Notre Dame and the West. 
FRAX'CIS J. Sl-TAUGHXESSA' (Right End). Ca^Dtain Shaughnessy A\^as unable to give his team the full benefit of his abilitA', as his broken collar-bone forced him to remain on the side lines during the greater part of the season. But AA'hen in the game his long, sensational end runs and his hard and sure tackling stamped him as one of the best men that has defended Notre Dame's ends. His pluclvA' AA'ork at Purdue, AA^hen, despite the doctor's orders and after being out of train­ing for 'oA-er tAA'O AA-eeks, he tore through the line for long gains and j)laA'ed an all-around star game, AA'OII him a AA^ell-merited place on the "All-Star" Indiana eleA-en. Captain ShaughnesSA' leax-es school in June, and if his successor at right end has the same amount of true Notre Dame spirit that our pluclvA' Captain has, then our 023ponents Axdll have to look to their laurels. "Shag," is 22 A-ears old, AA^eighs 175 pounds and is 6 feet aiid 3 inches in height. > 
PATRICK A. BEACGAI (Left Guard). 

"Pat Beacom, bigger and better than CA^er," is the stoiy of AAdiat our opxDonents ran up against AAdien thcA- attempted to gain through our left guard. "Pat " AA^as the mainstay of the line last season and more than duplicated his fine AA'-ork this A^ear., Besides j)laying his usual strong game on .the defense he suriDrised CA-eiwone bA^ his AA^ork AAath the ball. He AA^as first used at Columbus AAdien our backs AA-^ere tired out and unable to gain. Running low and hard he tore into the line and placed A'-ard after 
NOTRE DAMB SCHOLASTIC Zl'y 
yard to our credit until finally he had scored. Then to show that his feat had been no accident he did it all over again and made our victory complete. Beacom handles his 230 pounds easih' and is much faster on his feet than the ordinar3' lineman. He has been selected to lead the Yarsitj'- next season and should prove a caj)able captain. The rooters are already- laj'ing plans for the celebrations that will occur when the men under Captain "Pat " bring the coveted title of State Champions back to Notre Dame. Beacom is 22 3-ears old, ^\'eighs 230 pounds and is 6 feet 2 inches in height. 
N.\TE H. SiLVMR (Quarter-Back). During Captain Shaughnessj^'s absence from the game the responsilDilitA'- of running the team was given to Nate Silver,'and our speedx- little quarter-back kept up his record for fast and consistent work made the 3^ear before. Silver uses good judgment in direct­ing his plan's and has the faculty of keeping his backs working together at all times. His defensive work at Lafa3^ette and at Milwaukee .won a lot of praise for him. Nate has been chosen alternate captain for next season and wall return and plaA'- next j'ear. He was lighter than usual this fall, weighing but 150 j)Ounds, is 21 j^ears old and stands 5 feet 7 inches in height. 
CLARENCE J. SHEEHAN (Centre). 
"Bud" Sheehan kept UID his clever ^\''ork at centre -and proved himself the most consis­tent man Notre Dame has had at that posi­tion. He T\^as handicapped \>y injuries, but he ahvavs managed to secure an even break with his ojDponent. He is a fast man and a willing worker, and to his accurate passing is due the fact that Notre Dame had but few^ fumbles durins^ the vear. He w^ill return next season, and Avill give some of the aspiring candidates for centre honors in the West a merrv race. Sheehan is 21 vears old, w^eighs 190 pounds and is 6 feet in height. 
LAWRENCE MCNERNY (Left-End). 
McNemy w^as one whom the hoodoo picked out as its ow^n personal propertj^ Just before the trip to Milwaukee he w^as badly hurt in practice, but entered the Wisconsin game as,there w^as no competent man to replace him. In that game he w^as so battered and bruised that he w^as compelled to remain on the side lines until the De Pauw^ 

SCHOLASTIC. 
and Purdue contests. In these two games he showed his abilit\^ bv scoring a 75-vard run against De Pauw and putting up an excellent game at Lafavette. McNernv has had but two years of college football, j^et he is a valuable man for anj^ team. He is a brilliant offensive jDlaA'^er and a man v^'^ho can take advantage of auA-- "slij^ of his, opponents. He is a member of the 1906 La\A^ class and Avill return. "Mac" Aveighs 160 pounds, is 5 feet 11 inches in height and is 20 j^ears old. . 
MICHAEL L. FANSLER (End and Full-Back). 
"Big Mike" is the most versatile man on the Notre Dame. -team. During his three 3^ears of football he has been called upon to pla3^ nearty ever3'- position on the eleven; and in everv case he has given satisfaction. Earty in the season the injuries to "Shag" and McNern3'^ forced Salmon to look for an end. Mike was tried and made good. Later he was shifted to full-back when Draper was laid up, and at Purdue Fansler tore into the Boilermaker's line as though he Avere a sepiond Salmon.-Despite his good work this ykscc at eiid, and full-back, Mike is realty a lineman. If he retunis to Notre Dame for his . last 3^ear, which is to be hoped, he will be a great heljD to the team in the line. Mike is 23 vears old, weighs 170 pounds and is 6 feet 3 inches in height. 
ARTHUR FUNK (Right Tackle). 

Funk was late in re^jorting for practice, and had no real chance until he was tried at tackle at Columbus.. He at once jDroved that he v^-as the "find" of the 3^ear. From that time on he was kept on the regulars, and as he became accustomed to his place he shoAved the stuff that was iii him. He is short and rather light for a lineman, but is a hard fighter. His work wdth the ball gained inan3'' 3'^ards for Notre Dame, and next 3''ear when he has learned more of the fine points of the game he will jDrove a worthv successor of that other 'Art'— Steiner. Funk weighs 165 pounds, is 5 feet 8V^ inches in height and is 20 5'^ears old. 
DAVID J. GUTHRIE (Half-Back). 

Guthrie was another 'find,' but like other members of the team, he W^as severety hurt earty in the 3''ear and was unable to pla3'' Ms best game at all times. Dave is a hard man to down when he has the ball; he hits 
the line low and seems to be able to keep his feet until he has made his gain. His defensive pla^nng was consistently' good all A^ear, and before he was injured it was brilliant. Dave has three A'-ears ahead of him and should proA''e one of the strongest men in the back-field. He is 21 A'-ears old, .AA'^eighs 190 pounds and is 6 feet in height. RICHARD W . DONOA'AN (Right Guard). 
Coach Salmon decided that DonoA^an AA'ith his 195 jjounds of braAAni and bone AA^ould do better in the line than at half-back Axdiere busA'' doctoring his bruises and sprains until the De PauA\^game Avhen he, was laid up for good with a fractured collar-bone. "Bill" is one of the best punters Notre Dame has CA-er had, scA-eral of his kicks going OA'-er seventA'" A'-ards. His offensiA-e Avork Avas not consistent, although A\^hen in a pinch he could tear through for gains, as he showed against De PauAA^ This and his defensiA'e Avork Avill haA-e improA-ed greatly next v^ear AAdien he can be expected to do great things. This is his first A'car on the football team. 
THE LINE-UP. 
he AA^on his monogram last year. Although ncAv to the place "Dick" soon got onto the run of things and put up a creditable shoAv­ing all 3^ear. His AA'-ork is not of the brilliant or sensational order, but he plaA'-ed hard, and kept improAang all the time. DonoA^an has tA\^o more years to plaA^ He is 21 years old and 5 feet 11 inches in height. 
WiLLLOi A. DRtVPER (Full-Back). 

"Bill" Draper fitted in nicely at Salmon's old place, and his early Avork gaA^e great promise. But the hard luck "bugaboo" got busy with him also, and Draper Avas kept 
He is 21 years old, is 6 feet 1 inch in height and Aveighs 172 pounds. DuRAMT CHURCH (Half-Back). 
Church is another new man to the squad; he is playing his first year at half-back. Church-is a fast man, understands football thoroughlA", and in his earh' games won the rooters bj-- his headj- Avork A\dth the ball and his plucky defensiA'-e playing. Later  in the season his defensiA'-e game suffered,  and he failed to maintain the stan(Jard set  for himself earlier in the year. His injury at  Milwaukee, which put him out of condition, 
may in sorne manner account for this; and if he returns to Notre Dame next fall he should put up a creditable game. Church w^eighs 160 pounds and is 23 years old. 

THO^L\S F . HEALY (Left-Tackle). Tom played in hard luck all y^ear. He did not report for practice until late in the season, and w^hen rounding into condition he sprained his ankle and had to start all over. When in condition Heaty puts up an excellent exliibition of football. His best game of the vear T\'^as at Lafavette w^here he w^ent after Allen, Purdue's caj)tain, and more than held his owm until he w^as forced to give way^ to Murphj-^. If Tom comes back to Notre Dame next j'^ear in condition he will surprise some of the supporters of the team. Healy w^eighs 200 pounds, is. 21 years old and is 6 feet in height. 
ROBERT BRACKEX (Half-Back). 

"Peggy" Bracken w^as the lightest man in the back-field, but won his monogram hj his dash and earnest w^ork. - During' the 3^ear he plaA'^ed half-back and end, and his showing gives great promise for the future.. He is not as experienced as some others in the back-field, but if he returns next fall the candidates for end or half-back ^\dll have a hard time beating him out. Bracken is 20 years old, weighs 160 pounds, and is 5 feet 9 inches in height. 
RuFDs AV. WALDORF (Half-Back). 

Waldorf is another nian who lacks the experience that every^ Varsity" player should have. But his w^ork during the season \\^as hard and show^ed steady improvement every time he was put iii the game. His w^eight, too, w^as against him, but if he can put on a few pounds during the vacation he ought to be able to put up a creditable game next season: Rufiis is 20 years old, weighs 155 
pounds  and  w^on  his  monogram  for  the  
first  time this  year.  
DANIEL  L. MURPHY  (Tackle).  
Murphy  w^as  one of the  new^ men  of  the  

squad, and w^hen given a chance did all that could have been asked of him. He has had practically no experience before the present year, and consequently was at a great disad­vantage w^hen playing against older and more seasonable men. Still, he is a game and hard player, and always gave the best he had in stock. Another year w^ould go a long w^ay towards developing "Murph," but as he graduates in June he may not return. He weighs 172 pounds, is 5 feet 10^^ inches in height and is 20 years old. 
RICHARD COAD (Sub Ouarter-BACK). "Dick" Coad took Silver's place as the baby of. the team, and, like Nate, w^on all fi*oin the start by his brilliant w^ork. His defensive playing, is as clean-cut and as sure 
as that of any player Notire Dame has had 
in years and was a feature of every game 
he took part in. His generalship and ofien­
sive plajnng lacks Silver's dash and sureness, 
but Coad gave entire satisfaction while on 
the squad. Parental objections forced him 
to leave the squad before the Purdue game. 
Dick is 19 years of age, weighs 140 pounds 
and is,5 feet S inches. 
Besides the above-named gentlemen, all-of w^hom won their monograms, the squad consisted of Keefe, O'Neill, Langtry, Sud­heimer and Murra3'-. Keefe, O'Neill and Sudheimer were in the Varsity line-up at some time or other, but did not play the length of time required for a monogram. This lack of men for a second team w^as one of the greatest obstacles Coach Salmon had to contend with, and it is to be hoped that a school that has forty-five candidates report for a haU eleven vsrhile fourteen or fifteen men, some badly crip'pled, are serv­ing as first and second teams for the Varsitj!^, will see that next j'^ear's squad will be large enough to w^arrant the for­mation of at least two ftdl teams. The few^ men w^ho did stand the bruises and knocks on Cartier Field deserve the credit for showing a great deal more loyalty than nian3*^- of the fellows w^ho moan so about the lack of true college spirit at Notre Dame. 
Trainer Holland had his troubles from the first day of practice, w^hen Sheehan hurt his foot, until he gave his men their last attentions at Lafayette. Tom w^as wdthout a sufficient nuniber of competent assistants all y^ear, but he did as w^ell as could be expected under the existing circum­stances. Besides looking after the physical welfare of the men, he relieved Manager Daly during the latter's absence from Notre Daihe in October. No one can criticise Holland for the lack of condition of the men. His work in the past shows that if conditions are the least w^ay favorable to him, his boys will go into the games fit as the proverbial fiddle. 
Manager Byrne M. Daly had more than the usual number of complications, both great and small, to overcome, and it w^as but to be expected, after his record of the past three years, that he w^oiild come through with flying colors. By his tact and personalitj'^ he has placed Notre Dame on friendly terms with all the colleges of the West, and what Mr. Daly has done for athletics at Notre Dame would make his place especially hard to fill. 
In conclusion, the - SCHOLASTIC desires to congratulate Coach Salmon and every member of the squad for their loyalty to Notre Dame in the face of overwhelming odds, and to wish them all a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year!
