Tribute from Our Leaders 
\Vhat is success? To some minds, anodyned by too many victories, even a close score is failure. Other minds, rendered soft and non-combatant by the. many refine­ments of civilization, holding opponents to a low score means success. From my point of view success materially probably lies some,vhat between these two extremes. 
A series of events occuring o-\rer. a number of years are harided down from student to student and become traditions. Heroic individual efforts, deeds of sacri­_fice, unselfish denial, inspiring team play: stubborn defensive stands where a team plays until eX~lausted, are never forgotten but are handed down by Written story and -word of mouth until they become a standard. A standard by which every .year we gauge. the merits of the present te1;1m. 
No one who saw the thrilling come-back at l\Iinnesota aft~r the disastrous Army game: no ~me who saw the painstaking offense slipping over the slick Georgia red 
lclay, the heart breaking fail~re to score in the rain against Penn State, the supet'b defense against Carnegie Tech and, most hair-raising of all, the superb come-back against Northwestern. in the second half, can help but say that this year's team 
j
has lived up to every one of our fine traditions. And, according to every common sense definition, tliis season ha? been a distinct success. The team has played to­
1 
gether wonderfully as a unit. Not a discord has ever arisen to mar the perfect har­mony of feeling. In every game·I am convinced that the team did absol~1tely all that any one has any right· to ask any·group of boys to accomplish. The.' Nebraska game was lost in the schedul~ making. It is humanly impossible for any group of boys between the ages of eighteen and. twenty-two, after a terrific schedule, to play two games in five days. 
Every;;Notre Dame inan· should feel justly proud of the team that has repre­sented tl1e.University of Notre·-Dame in the Fall of 1925. 
K. K. Roci\:NE. 
·Somewhere in these United States· there may be a better football team than Notre Dame but nowhere in the world is tliere a team of fighters such as I had the honor o~ leading this_ fall.' Anyone who had the pleasure of seeing the Northwestern game will attest to the ver[!city of this statem.ent. 
I 
:Many thought the Army game this year, ,.V_hich ended so disastrously for us, I i.vas the beginning of the end, but instead, it was only the beginning of brighter days. :Minnesota and Georgia Tech surely showed what a tonic defeat can be. Penn State and Carnegie Tech gave us plenty of opposition but the boys were not 
I
~
to be denied. Then came Northwestern in the last home game on Cartier Field, the I 
grid_iron ,\rhere so many old N. D. boys gave the best that was in them. The Purple 
l I 
outplayed and out-lucked us in the first half to the tune of len big points and then what followed will be tradition for N. D. teams of the future. How those boys rolled up tw·o touchdowns in short order was written idelibly 
~ 
on the soil of Cartier Field. They proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that they were worthy sons of the Blue and Gold. \Vhat a fitting tribute they were paying to the best coach in the land who sat watching the many weary hours of his efforts bearing fruit. To my successors, the two Reds, I wish the best of luck for they are 
j
leading the finest set of men that ever trod the turf of Cartier Field. CLEl\1 CROWE

THE LEADERS OF THE 1925 TEAM 
Football Rev.iew of 19f25 



THE TEAM 
Captain Clem Crowe 
Lafayette, Indiana 
Gold and Blue and Clem Crowe, hand in. hand down the "tough days" of the 1925 season, planning, ever alert, fighting, never com­plaining, giving everything that he had-that was Clem, a typical Notre Dame captain. At left end Captain Crowe put up one of the pluckiest fights that a Notre Dame man has ever carried on. Early in the season Clem was badly injured; a Lombard boy made a muss of the muscles and three lower ribs in his back, all of which ap­parently didn't bother Clem a bit; he was finally forced t9 withdraw from play in the Penn State game. \Ve all most assuredly wish we had had him in the Nebraska game-not discrediting "Ike" Voedisch's fine demonstrations at that post, but Clem's world of experience certainly would have helped. When a man attains the honor of captaining Notre Dame's football team he needs no further recommendation. You sure filled the bill, Captain Crowe, and Notre Dame· is indebted to you. 
Eugen~ "Red" Edwards Weston, West Vir~inia · 
"Gentleman Gene," that easy-going, neyer fussed individual who unhesitatingly climbed into the saddle left vacant by last year's All-American Quarterback, Harry Sthuldreher, put the spurs to his horse and was away in a cloud of glory~ Taking the reins from the 
· renowned Harry's hands, Edwards "called" ten games of the best possible football. The writer had occasion to sit near Coach Rockne· during seven of those ten games and when the Notre Dame club got into a tight hole "Red" unfailingly selected the play that brought a smile of satisfaction to the face of the world's craftiest coach. Gene will have a wonderful year next f·all. He is· a punter of no mediocre quality; an accurate passer, a good ball canier, a good interferer and second to none when it comes to calling the: right play at the right time. All of you folks just keep your eye on Edwards next Fall. He's going. to be right up there at the top when ·the "all teams" are picked. 


Thomas "Red" Hearden 
Green Bay, Wisconsin 
Shades of "Jimmy" Crowley! Loads and· loads of halfbacks run and pass their way to recognition. Tom Rearden has done more than. run his way into thousands of . hem·ts. Some of his ancestors certainly must have been subway guards for that boy sure can block. Notre Dame would have gained far fewer yards this season if Tom hadn't been out there in the interference· knock­ing the defense's end for a series of loops. A small body, chucked full of a million dollars .worth of fight and cleverness is all that Tom has to offer the Hon. Mr. Rockne or the 1926 campaign. This is Rearden's second season with the Rockmen and it looks to the sages as tho he's going to be one of the biggest rackets that "Rock" will have next Fall. Modern football fans are beginning to give the credit deserved to .the men who get out there and knock the de­fense down so that the man with the ball can get away. "Red" Rearden certainly has got a lot of credit coming to him for his work this season. 
[14] 
Football Review of 1925 
Christopher "Chris" Flanagan Port Arthur, Texas 
The boy with the Gulf Coast tenor, the best pair of shoulders I've ever seen, the big smile and the makings of the best halfback that the world has ever known. When "Red" Grange was a Sophomore down at Illinois he didn't get a bit more recognition than "Chris" has in his first year of competition here at Notre Dame. Mentioning the fact that he was high point man in the Mid-west this season only begins to tell about this lad from Texas. He has just gotten started-everything lies before· him, and if he has the least bit of luck, just mark my words that by the time he has played his last game of collegiate football he will be up there in the Football Hall of Fame sitting right along side of Grange, 'Vilson, Crowley, Mahan, Gipp, Heston, Coy and the rest. It's going to take the best bullfighter known to stop this "longhorn." "Chris" was chosen by several critics when they selected their All-western teams. 


Reginald "Rex" Enright 
Rockford, Illinois 
Snowplows, ti·actors and the like take seats in the rear of the house. "Rex" Enright, playing his final year of collegiate football at Notre Dame, filled the heart of his coach with pride, tickled the student body to pieces, gave the .w. k. football ·public their money's worth and added another name to the long list of Notre Dame heroes. Enright's plunging and defensive work caught the eye of every football expert that saw him perform, arid each was highly complimentary of his form and consistency. In the Nebraska game, which Notre Dame lost 17-0, Enright failed to gain just two tim.es·in his attempts at the "Husker" line. Student opinion· places Rex in a class with Livergood, Layden and Castner when it comes to straight line bucks and cross bucks.. "Nice goin', Rex, old boy." Enright was the only Notre Dame man whom Rockne gave a place on his Ail-western mythical eleven. · 
I 
t 1 John Wallace 
I 
! Gary, Indiana 
l 
I Crowe and 'Vallace, Hoosiers and ends. This fast stepping . l running mate of Capt. Crowe's played tackle last year. Any good I coach will admit that a man who can play tackle one year and be 
shifted to end the next and master end_:-play as John 'Vallace has in
~ 
that short space of time is one boy who hasn't any leather.nickels _in. his pockets. 'Vallace is one of those big rangy fellows, fast and al­t ways on the alert. He· has the mean~st pair of hands since Eddie An­derson, and there isn't a tackle he has met this year who will forget
~ 
1. his afternoon across the line of scrimmage from Big John. A worthy successor to Eddie Hunsinger, Gene Mayl and Roger Kiley. John leaves a good record behind him. 
[15] 

Football Re7)iew of 1925 

Arthur "Bud" Boeringer St. Paul, Minnesota( 
If you want to know who was the scrapin'est, talking'est man on the Notre Dame club this year, mostly anyone whom you ask will tell you: "\Vhy, 'Bud' Boeringer, of course." "Bud" came to "Rock" from Joe Brandy's camp up at St. Thomas, in Minnesota, and he sure proved to be a Godsend. Last year "Bud" was the brains of George Koegan's Freshman outfit, but for some unknown reason he didn't -make much of a hit with local backers. That merely shows theh~ bad judgment, tho, and now lends all the more to "Bud's" almost flawless work in the center of the Irish line. A 
c. power on defense and the old can-opener himself when it comes to the business of opening up holes for Enright, Bdwards and Co. "Bud" isn't through with football yet and we're glad of it. 
Joseph "Joe" Boland Philadelphia. Penna. 
Here's a boy about whom I h.esitate to launch forth on his ability as a football player. As many another man has said: "He's too smart for me." ·well, anyway, Joe is one of the best linemen almost any place. \Vhen "Rock" calls his va·rsity around him next fall Boland will be the best left tackle in sight. Tipping the scales at 220 and getting down under punts generally don't go .hand in hand, but they do in Joe's case. Big, fast and "slick as a whistle" 
-sizes him up only fairly well. His work resembles that of "Fat" Henry, All-American from Washington and Jefferson in 1919, his physical makeup is somewhat the same, and I wouldn't be a bit surprised if he made a better mark in football than .Henry did. I hope you do, Joe. 


John "Stonewall" M'Manmon 
Lowell, Massachusetts 
As John \Vallace would say: "He's· the best tackle in the dioceses." Lots of times you'll see some athlete who impresses you as a· real man. That's 1\fcManmon. "Big Jawn" has just wound up his second year under Rockne and he's smarter, faster and better than ever. He and Joe Boland certainly make a pair that are hard to beat. McManmon is going to cut apretty.figure between the end of September and Thanksgiving of 1926. The proteges of "Wally" Steffan and Glen Thistlewaite can't say that "Big Jawn" is any dub without giving evidence of a whole flock of very violent blushes. "Doc" Spears' "Gophers" will also stand up and shout to the world t~at McManmon is a bear, if they're only fair about it. "Rock's" gomg to say. to "Big Jawn" some of these days: "What a fine stone wall you turned out to be, McManmon." 
[16] 
Football Review of 1925 
Richard "Dick" Hanousek 
Anti~o, Wisconsin 
"Yohnnie Yonson came down to Soud Bend to blay fout ball. He vas one tough bohunk, dis boy from de Nort \Vouds." The tim­ber lands, like the Sunny South, the Golden \Vest and the Busy East has sent the South Bend school representatives. Dick is a contribution to the Irish line from \Visconsin. Playing his final year part time at full back and part time at guard somewhat handi­capped this youngster, nevertheless he acquitted himself nobly at both posts. "Punishment" is Dick's middle name and no odds are 
.too great for him. to try to overcome. Old timers see traces of 
"Hunk" Anderson in Dick and the versatility which· he has dis­
played this fall cannot go unnoticed or unrewarded. 


John "Clipper" Smith 
Hartford, Conn. 
If Hanousek were "Moon Mullins" "Clipper" Smith would be the kid brother "K. 0." Just like two peas, the two of them, only John is a newcomer in Irish lineups. No Notre Dame guard ever displayed such genuine ability in his first year on the Varsity, and the Lord alone knows what he will be doing by the time he is ready to graduate from football. "Clipper" is still smaller than Capt. Harvey Brown of the 1923 squad, and almost identically the 
.same type. He was held up quite a bit this Fall by a dislocated shoulder, all of which detracted from his season's record noticeably. Rockne can do wonders with a boy who has the brains and pure unadulterated "guts" that John Smith has. John is doing all he can to keep up the standards set by the famous "Mawrie" Smith. 
1­
John "Ike" V oedisch 
r South Bend, Indiana 
Another new face in the Irish camp, and something that thel neighbors brought in. Sixteen different committees are going right over to "Ike's" place on Portage and thank the neighbors, f01~ they sure .brought something nice, plenty nice. Like "Clipper" Smith, 
"Ike" has shown a wealth of stuff in his puppy days of Notre Dame
I football. \Vhen Capt. Clem Crowe was injured Voedisch :was first in line and all .that he needed was a chance to show his stuff, which he did, much to the enjoyment of South Benders as well as the Notre Dame boys. A third party was pleased, if we know anything about Knute K. Rockne. Ike's going to be a. big leaguei· around· here some day soon, as he has got two years to play. 
[17] 

Football Review of 1925 

John "Big John" M'Mullen 
Chicago, Illinois 
The essence of "the Fightin' Irish spirit" simply sticks out all over "Mac". Although laid up for some time with a bad sh'oulder this fall "Mac" got in on several occasions and went so far as to get one or two mighty 'good tumbles from the esteemed ·walter Eckersall. John McMullen's absence is going to be felt very much next Fall, and it will be with difficulty that Rockne will be able to lay hands on another tackle like John to alternate with Joe Boland in the left side of the Irish forward wall. ·when it comes to "sockin' 'em and rockin' 'em," "Big John" was the boy who qualified. 
Frank "Horse" Mayer 
Glencoe, Minn. 
Frank has played good ball in this his last year at Notre Dame. He worked hard, never quite knew when to· stop · fighting, and helped mightily towards filling the gap which was left vacant when Noble .Kizer graduated last year. Everyone was glad to see ·Mayer come through in this manner and down deep in his heart he thinks more of the monogram that he has won than he.does of Minnesota. A bad knee didn't help him any during the season and it is ·only fair to him that such a handicap be mentioned to the public. 


John "Bull" Polisky · -·I 
Bellaire, Ohio 
I just wonder what "Rock" is going to do to keep Flanagan, IJohn Smith, "Ike" Voedisch and this Polisky lad from tearing the _, football world to pieces about the beginning of the 1927 season? "Bull" is another Sophomore in the Irish ranks and is putting in i a bid for top honors which is second to none. He's Joe Boland's 
!
type and has shown an improvement in his first time out that has caused quite a lot of comment. He's got the almightiest knack of getting thru' the offensive line and spilling things for a general 
·loss that a first year man has shown for a long time. You folks who saw the Notre Dame-Princeton game last year will remember how Joe Boland broke things up-well, that's the way John "Bull" Polisky has been getting along. 
[18] 
Football Review of 1925 
John "Cactus'' Roach Appleton, Wisconsin 
"Cactus" is a player and a punter who simply made things rosy under conditions that were in the least bit of a way unfavor­able, and no mean hand when it came to ·hurling the pigskin into the outstreched hands of a team-mate. It took men like Crowley and Miller to keep Roach out of the first line-up ·last Fall and anyone who is sane will not hold that against John. One occasion which ·I remember very well occurred last Fall when Notre Dame put the "Badgers" down. John got loose on an end run and there wasn't a man on the ·wisconsin outfit that didn't get a good healthy look at the heels of the flying Roach. "Cactus" will re­turn for his last year under "Rock." 


Francis "Lew"' Cody 
LaSalle, Ill. 
"Lew" made just one mistake in his collegiate career-he donned Varsity mole-skins two years too late; his first year with the "Fightin' Irish" was his last, and "Rock" therefore lost the services of one terribly smart boy. "Lew" had the Inter-hall halfback's cornered for ·three· years and he nearly did the same thing \vhen he moved up to Varsity competition. "Lew" can do more "cutting" than a Pittsburgh Tong war, and with about as disasterous results to the foe. It's a shame that "Rock" can't use Enright and Cody next year. They'd certainly boost "N. D. Common" and "Preferred" quite a few tens of points. 
Elmer "E" Wynne Oronoque, Kan. 
Elmer's football. days have been just like the days of .his world-wide heralded brother, "Chet," who gave Notre Dame op­
. ponents various and assorted fits in 1920 and 1921. He started slow and is finishing up like a house afire. I'd like to have a few minutes with the sports writer who has been riding Elmer about fumbling; said individual sui·e would get a nice ·piece of my mind. It ·will be seen next Fall that "E" Wynne will be one of the best running and plunging fullbacks in the country, and I don't mean perhaps. This lad has had plenty of competition in the last two years. For example, Layden, Livergood and Cerney last year and Enright this year, but you just watch him hit the holes in the oncoming season and if he doesn't cut "Elmer Wynne" deep in the sod of Cartier Field, Yankee Stadium, Forbes Field and other lots that Notre Dame will play on, I don't know a thing about football.

Raymond "Ray'' Marelli ·Rockford, Ill. 
Last year's wealth of mate1:ial kept "Ray" out of things quite a bit, but he,has had a chance this Fall and has done exceptionally well at guard in the Irish ranks. Graduation does not· take "Ray" away, and it's a good thing. Guard play is a tough piece of work to get down to a fine point, and an experienced head like "Ray" is going ·to .be appreciated when things start popping in 1926. "Ray" is a fellow-townsman of Rex Enright's, and like Rex, "Ray" has brought nothing but merit to Rockford. He's a big boy and n~akes a tough argument for any opponent. 

Richard "RedJ' Smith 
. Combined Locks, Wis: 
"Rough, tough, nasty and redheaded." Another Sophomore with two years to play. Holy smokes, what a vair "Red" and John Smith are· going to make. This fast-stepping guard is one of those old boys who's plumb full of fight, talk and smart· guard play, and if that crimson thatch of his is any ·omen of good ·luck he's all set for one peach of a caree-r in. football. '"Rock's" Smith Brothers, the Shaved Ones,· made quite a hit throughout the country this -last season and will bid strongly for the regular guard berths on the Fighting Irish squad for the next two years.· "Red"· nearly got a leg torn off up at Penn State and i_t took the combined efforts of Rockne, two trainers and a corps of student-managers to keep him off of the gridiron for the remainder (_)f the season. 


Harry O'Boyle. 
Des Moines, Iowa 
· ·. One of "Rock's" fleetest halfbacks: with an arm and ari eye to forward pass throwing, that are hard to beat. Harry's coming around in good shape and is going to be one whooping good half before he finishes up at Notre Dame. '\Vest High, from whence Harry comes may be justly proud of him for he is as perfect an athletic type as has been seen on practice and playing fields in years.. ·O'Boyle has a wonderful lot of speed, blocks fairly well, 
· and is a defensive ace of no mean· proportions. He has one more year· with "the grand young man of football" and we're· all looking for him to do 'a lot with Tom Rearden, "Chris'.' ·Flanagan, Elmer ·wynne and Gene Edwards next season.

Anyone who bats Joe all over any lot, or just knocks him down a couple of times in an afternoon is going to know just how it's done, and it will take a mighty smart man to do that.

Notre Dame, 41: Baylor, 0 

The eyes of the football world were focused upon Notre Dame. "'ould the "l\firacle l\Ian" live true to form and mould a football team worthy of the name Notre Dame around the relics of the \Vonder Team of 192•1·? Baylor was scheduled to inaugurate the football season on Cartier Field. The Bears from \Va.co had been Southwestern Conference Champions for the past two years :mel were said to have an organization that the great state of Texas could well be proud of. Out of the South they came-these Bears of Baylor-with the honor of Texas and the South to uphold. Back to \Vaco they straggled a day later-a puttered, bruised and tired lot of Southern youths. Everyone sighed a· sigh of ·relief. Rockne had produced· another great team! 
Rockne used a whole herd of "mules" and "horsemen" against the Bears. The game revealed little as to what the final make-up of our first contingent would. be, for all the boys played, and all the boys played equally well. Captain Crowe and his "Crew" in the line made it comparatively easy for the backfield men to gallop around at will. Edwards, Rearden, O'Boyle and Enright constituted the backfield that started the game but subsequent combinations performed just 
·as brilliantly. The prancing of Prelli and Flanagan in particular delighted the spectators. Ray Dahman, Harry O'Boyle, Flanagan and Joe Prelli all mude touchdo,vns and Tom (Red) Rearden scored twice to bring our total for the day to 41. 
Baylor's Bears proved to be mere Cubs. They were very easy to subdue. Those counting upon the \Vaco boys to defeat the Fighting Irish were sorely dis­appointed. The Irish Terriers were altogether too fast for the Texas Bears and although Bridges' men fought all the way, they were completely outclassed. 
The noise about Baylor's strength turned out to be merely a "bear" story!

Notre Dame 1s Headed Toward Another· Crown 
By KENNETH S. CONN 
Shades of the "Four Horsemen," of Notre Dame, hovering over Cartier field yesterday afternoon, saw their lances carried on to vic­tory by new knights of the pigskin, promising to surpass even the valiant deeds of the 1924 champion riders. 
The ride was at the expense of Baylor uni­versity, whose eleven-twice champions of the Southwest conference-was smothered under the ignominious. score of 41 to 0. The lances were used to pierce even larger holes in the enemy's .ranks than the capable hands of the "Four Horsemen" were able to accomplish. 
In place of the "Horsemen" of yesteryear there rode eight capable and masterful gallants to the cheers of some 13,000 football fans. The debut and the ride could not have been made more pleasing, more picturesque or more sur­prising had it been

While Miller, Stuhldreher, ~Crowley and Layden were missing from the lineup their places were amply filled by Christopher Flana­gan, Prelli; Dick Hanousek, Eddie Scharer, Rex Enright, Harry O'Boyle, "Red" Rearden, Riley and two or three· others. \Vhile these men lacked the polish. that comes with experi­ence, yesterday's game showed that by the·time \Vest Point is encountered Notre Dame will be proclaimed as having another national cham­pionship team. · · · ·

The break in the play came after Notre Dame had been penalized for holding, putting the ball on the 40 some yard line. Edwards then tossed a nice pass to O'Boyle which was good for 25 yards and the fight was switched into Baylor territor-y. Enright tore off 10 yards through tackle and Rearden followed with three more, placing the ball on Baylor's 10 yard line. After O'Boyle had been thrown for a yard loss Rearden tore around left end with his red head darting here and there, dodging tack-; · ler and tackler, and finally falling· over the goal line for the first Notre Dame touchdown to put a perfe"ct kick from placement between the

Notre Dame, 69: Lombard, 0 
Coach Bell brought his red-jerseyed Lombardians up from Galesburg with fond hopes of accomplishing that at which Baylor so miserably failed-trimming Notre Dame. The Irish recalled the 1923 affair with Lombard and they were determined that another such bomb would not be thrown into our camp this year. Rock let the boys ride fast and furiously all afternoon and when the play was over Notre Dame had accumulated 69 points while Bell's men were not able to ring up one single marker. 
Harry O'Boyle first crossed Lombard's goal after ·he had, with the a~d of Prelli and Enright, pushed the ball down the field to Lombard's ten-yard line. Just as the first quarter ended California Joe Prelli ·stepped off a fast fifty-yard dash for the second touchdown of the day, J olm Roach was our third man. to score, when, with perfect interference of Dahman, Hanousek and Scharer, he cavorted twenty-five yards to make the score 20-0. And thus the Cavalry rode all after­noon. There was no stopping .at 21. or even ,11 points, but the boys just had to have 69-and 69 it was! Edwards, Scharer, Rile·y, l\IcNally all operated at quarter; Flanagan, Dahnran, O'Boyle, Roacl1, Prelli, Coughlin and Cody all · pivoted and skirted for substantial gains at half, and Enright; Hanousek and \Vynne unmercifully plunged through the gaps in Lombard's fonvard wall. In the line ."Big John" l\Icl\Iullen was a demon and l\Iaxwell showed·· tlu! old fight· at center. All the boys, however, played well. It was more of a track meet than 
.a football game and consequently Crowe's "Crew" was pretty ·tired after the brawl was over: \Vhen the furies had subsided and accounts were taken, it was found· that our boys had rung up ten touchdowns against Bell's charges. Cigars were doled out as follows: Roach 2, Hanousek 2, Flanagan 2 and Prelli, Cody, Dahman and O'Boyle one apiece. . 
Lombard's death knell was sweet melody t.o Notre Dame's. ears!

Galesburg Outfit is Unable to .Cope with Rockne's Men By BERT V. DUNNE (South Bend News-Times) 
. The "slaughter of the innocents" was re­enacted on Cartier field Saturday afternoon be­fore an estimated crowd of 10,000 fans, when Rockne's "Blue Devils" swept like a hurricane over the prostrate forms of the Lombard "Red Birds" by a score of 69-0. 
The crowd mingled tears with cheers as they gazed on the massacre perpetrate.d before their eyes. 
The game opened rather tamely. Notre Dame fumbled constantly and Lombard's hud­dle system of calling signals ate up time. It ap-.
l peared at first that the score would be low and
, 
the game exceeding tiresome. The attack opened. · i A black-haired youth, by the name of Prelli, skirted Lombard's. right end for twenty yards.

touchdown. The Irish 
lust for touchdowns 
had been aroused. 
The first quarter
I was just about over. Notre Dame shifted. "Flash" Prelli grab­bed the ball. The gun barked suddenly, but
I he kept on his way.
! He looked as if he w e r e running o n glass, s o deceptive were his moves, so 

c u n n i n g was his 
change of pace. One misstep would have marred 
. the supreme effort, but the dark-skinned Ital­ian, running carefully behind massed interfer..: ence, swung easily on his way. As he stepped acros·s the chalk line for the second touchdown of the day he was the only man .on his feet. Notre Dame's interference had cut down the Lombard secondary and tertiary defense and· the field was a picture of. strewn players. A bit of sadness crept in when "Prelli made his touchdown. Rex Enright, the dashing full­back was hurt. A monster roar broke from the stands as Enright was· carried to the bench. He looked to be in great pain and was taken to the gymnasium where his .injuries 'vere found to be only of a temporarily sedous nature. He will be ready· again when the Irish strike Beloit. The .second quarter opened. "Speedy" Roach, who had been begging for a chance,· was sitting on the sidelines praying. that he . might be injected into the fray.· Rockne must have read· his r,tind for he ordered him in. Roach romped out onto ·the gridiron with his · heart on fire. For three arduous years "Speedy'' 
had been fighting with the courage of a fron­tiersman for a real chance to show his true worth. . 
As he took the ball on his first play over right tackle there was a smile playing on his face. 
Roach cruised behind the same remarkable interference which had been prevalent all aft:. ernoon, cut quickly to the left and put the third touchdown on the score board. Saturday, John Augustus Roach of Appleton, Wis., launched an attack on the left.halfback position that will bear fruit before the season is over. 
Lew Cody was "Speedy's" running mate at right halfback. Cody, strutting along behind the same superb interference, eased his way for three great runs, the last of which terminated in a touchdown. Cody is made. 
L o m b a r d now· 
took the ball. Their attack was just a match lit in a wind­storm. It died almost as soon as it lived. 
Once more Prelli, H a n o u s e-k a n d O'Boyle, guided by Edwards again ap­proached the enemy's position. Prelli c u t through a b r o k e n field for a long gain, O'Boyle wiggled thru right tackle· for ten yards, then the crush­er, Hanousek; smash­ed the Lombard cen­
ter trio to bits for the
CltR 
fourth marker. 
The attack started again. The Irish, offen­sively, were a~ smooth· as satin. Notre Dame's pygmy guard, 'Clipper" Smith, urged on by the universal spirit.of freedom which was infesting Notre Dame's attack cut his larger opponents to ribbons. Smith played viciously-he did not give an inch-he rode his man out of the play with such ease that it looked like effortless work. on his part. . 
The fifth touchdown was the same old story. First Prelli, then O'Boyle, then Hanousek-the try was co.mpleted. · 
O'Boyle swept over for the sixth touchdown after "Flash" P1~elli had again turned in one of his magnificent effol.·ts. Prelli ran like a quiv­ering arrow, shaking off Lombard's presump­tions tacklers with-.ease. · 
"Dick" Hanousek and Ray Dahman divide::! the honors for the seventh touchdown. It was momentous the 'vay .the Irish backs, aided by their line, clicked off the yardage. 
The next two touclido\vns · were due to Flanagan and Dahman.

Notre Darrie, 19: Beloit, ·s 
"\Ve did not look for much .trouble from the Beloit Vikings-btit Vikings have done many strange things in past centuries. Beloit, like true Pirates, did not seem the least· bit worried about our decisive victories o\'er ·Baylor and Lombard. They came to Notre Dame ·and 'neath the shadow of the Golden Dome fought a good fight~a fight which all our' boys will remembe_r for some time to come. 
Beloit drew first blood. It was a beautiful field goal fro~ .the thirty-seven yard line by Darling, the visitors' left guard. The Vikings, however, gloated over their lead for only a short time. After · the kick-off,~ Prclli~ O'Boyle and Hanousek pranced like true steeds to Beloit's one-yard line. Then. the quarter ended. On the very first play of the second quarter Harry carried the ball over.. He con­verted for the extra point .a minute later and the score was seven to three. Prelli broke away in the third quarter fQr a sixty-seven yard sprint and our second score. It was ·a beautiful run and brought back fond memories. of the· never-to.:.be-for­got.ten "Horsemen." Harry O'Boyle failed to annex the extra point. Our third and last score. was made by Lew Cody. Lew intercepted a Viking pass and . "Crowleyed" for forty yards and a touchdown. Here Roach failed to convert· · and we had our fill for the day-nineteen points. 
The Belo'it game proved that there were many rough spots in Notre Dame's play that would need a lot of sand-papering and polishing before the real season began. John Mcl\Ianmon looked like the John of '2•1 at tackle. He broke through the Vik­ing line time and again and squelched p'otential gains in the bud. Captain Clem, of course, played his regular, good, consistent game. and Joe Benda had his eye on the ball all afternoon. The boys from Beloit trcaded on enchanted ground on their way home; they rejoiced in their defeat for they had held Notre Dame to a low score; they scored on Notre Dame. On the other hand, we realized everything was not rosy · and the Army game a week hence !

Army was Army at its very best. Notre Dame was the same Fighting Notre Dame, hut merely a little stage-struck, perhaps. Army had the better team that day. There is no doubt about it__:_but do 'not overlook the fact that Notre Dame made the :Mules fight every minute of the fracas. 
Bud Boeringer seemed to lend the fight for Notre Dame, but all our boys battled hard. To lose to Army was no disgrace. The crowd at home expected St. Joan of Arc to carry the team through but, as one sage remarked, St. Joan of Arc lost battles to the English, so surely there could be no stigma attached to defeat at the hands of real .t\.mericans. 
'Ve must simply re1ri"~mber again and again that our boys went down fighting­they fought as. only Our Lady's can fight. Notre Dame was not down~ Jiearted. She was glorious. in defeat.

St. Bernard wrote: "'Vhen you see yourself humbled take it as a sign, and even as a certain proof that some great grace is drawing near to thee." Let us hope St. Bernard is correct. Philosophers and saints of all ages have urged men to accept humiliation cheerfully. Humiliation reveals the man-virtues and vices. Then these vices may be medicined and the result will be a new and better indi­vidual. The same will hold true. for an organization-a football team. Notre Dame suffered complete humiliation at the hands of Uncle Sam's 'Vest Point Cadets on October 17. But following St. Bernard and Rockne, we will have to admit that the defeat was a good thing for the boys. 
Army waited nine years for this. It was a dreary Saturday afternoon. 75,000 people·were there. The Y:nikee Stadium in New York City. The Cadets at home on the Plains. But eleven of them down there on Y nnkee Field fighting mad! Tiny Hewitt, 'Vilson, Harding and Yoemnns! Notre Dame and St. J onn of Arc bewildered! Final score 27-0!

80,000 See Army Beat_Notre·Dame 
By HARRY CROSS 
An Army football· team which is not only powerful but also smart and alert defeated Notre Dame at the Yankee Stadium yesterday afternoon, by a score of 27 to 0, to the cheers of 80,000 spectators, New York's greatest foot­ball gathering. ·West Point has been waiting a good long time for a chance like this, for Rock­ne's gridiron pupils have handed the Cadets many an unhappy afternoon in by-gone years. 
In t}:le vast gathering which was banked on all sides of the stadium gridiron were thous­ands who had come expecting to see Notre Dame take away another victory. The reputa­tion of Rockne and his Notre Dame elevens has aroused interest in college football among spec­tators who have never had the opportunity to watch it before. · 
But Rockne did 
not have one of his . great teams this time. He can hardly be ex­pected to have them 
·all the time. West Point has a superior eleven, one w h i·ch promises to give a great account of ~­self when .it clashes with the Navy at the season's end. 
The Cadets scored four touchdowns, two in the second period and two in the fourth. The line of soldiers rpde rough shod over the Notre Dame wall 
of forwards through-. out the game, outplaying them so thot:oughly that "\Vest Pointers were charging through the line upsetting ·Notre Dame backs before they could get started. . 
Rockne groped about all afternoon trymg to find some. surprise to spring on the Cadets but he also found them watchful. He rushed in reserves by the score. He shuffled up his big squad like a pack of cards and hoped that at some time or another he might draw another four of a kind as he held last year with his talented Four Horsemen and other quartets which have carried his fam~ over many a ·foot­ball field. · 
Army had the satisfaction of scoring the first touchdown on speedy businesslike football tactics. As the linemen opened great gaps in the Notre Dame forwards, .Wilson, Yoemans at quarter and Hewitt, who had succeeded Buell, worked the ball down to the four yard line where big Jack Smith, the Hoosier left guard, unceremoniously shoved "\Vilson out of bounds.· 
"\Vhen the teams lined up on the four-yard mark; ·wilson, taking the ball faked his· run toward Notre Dame's right end, which was in the path to the goal posts. The wfiole Notre Dame line leaned to that direction when Wilson hurled himself through a big hole which Spra­gue and Captain Baxter had made for him. 
The unusual crowd had looked upon the proceeding up to this point with much surprise. They had expected the Hoosiers to turn loose volleys of aerial passes and had expected evi­dences of the close compact team-. work for which the Notre Dame elevens have ever been· noted. 
There were only a· handful of Cadets at the game, just a few score who were fortunate to get the week-end away from the Point. There were, however, many army officers there and they had plenty of their friends with them. All­the Notre Dame alumni in the east enlisted 
t h e i r friends, but 
they could make little impression with their enthusiasm compared with the demonstra­tion the Army folks ·started after the first touchdown and con­tinued throughout the 
game. 
There w a s some 
hard grueling scrim­
maging in · the . third 
period. The prayers 
on both teams . got 
many hard k n o c k s 
which necessitated 
m a n y delays and 
brought the rubbers 
and trainers scurry­
ing from the side 
lines with their water buckets. The Army tack­
ling was quick and decisive and the Notre Dame . tackling was heavy but slow. 
Notre Dame made frantic efforts to get an 
overhead attack going in the fourth period. 
O'Boyle and Scharer was one combination 
which tried in vain, and Roach and Voedisch 
was another.· The alert Army ends and second­
ary defense were usually outguessing the Hoo­
siers-in' their efforts to exe'cute their forward 
passes. , 
·Early in that fourth period Hewitt's at­
tempt to kick was thwarted by Jack Smith, who 
blocked the kick and· recovered the ball. Prelli 
jammed through the Army line for a couple of 
yards, but another attempted forward pass fail­
ed miserably, the Cadet line smashing through 
to upset the combination. O'Boyle was tired· 
again. and Roach came-back· into the game. 
When he attempted to punt; Saunders, Army's 
right tackle, broke through, blocked the kick~ 
and Born, who was at. his side, clutched the 
bounding pigskin on the first bound and raced 
down the field to the one-yard mark before he 
was overtaken and spilled in the mud. Hewitt 
then wiggled through for the touchdown.

Notr~ Datne, 19: Minnesota, 7 
The Army game hurt. The boys were fighting mad. The least little flare ~\'O.tlld incite the Irish fury. They were deteri~ined to crush everything that beset their progress in regaining their lost prestige. Not a team in the country could beat Notre Dame in that frame· of mind. The Gophers tried valiantly to reopen the wound but failed. The score was 19-7. 
Edwards,· Rearden, Flanagan and Enright marched down the field for the first . touchdo~vn, Rex carrying the ball across on the first play of the second period. In 
· the fourth quarter Christie Flannagan contributed a touchdown after pretty runs of twenty-five and fourteen );ards. Then Red Smith of Combined Locks, 'Visconsin; recovered ·a :Minnesota fumble on their twenty-eight yard line rind Christie was again good for twenty-three yards. Rex Enright annexed the necessary five yards to make our total 19 points. A word must be said fQr Joe Boland who blocked t'~o :Minne~ota punts during the fray. The most dazzling play of the afternoon, however, was Parisien's recovery of a :Minnesota fumble on our own two yard line and his race down the field for "eighty yards before being brought down by a Gopher. 
52,000 spectators filled the :Memorial Stadium in 1\Iinneapolis this particubr af­ternoon. They saw some remarkable football-perhaps the best ever exhibited in the N ortliwest. 52,000 people saw the Gophers go down fighting. 'Ve_ repeat again it was a useless task to attempt to defeat Notre Dame that day, an impossibility, in fact. Over 5500 Notrc Dame boys and the band travelled to the Twin Cities to cheer the Irish on. Their trip was not in vain. 'Ve proved to. the· world that we might have been down but we ,\•ere never out; we proved that we could and would come back. Rockne smiled !

Flanagan Rides as Horseman; Irish Win, _19-7 
By JAMES CRUSINBERRY 

MINNEAPOLIS, MINN.-For three-quar­
ters of an intense and thrilling gridiron com­
bat today Minnesota's ~parkling but green foot­
ball team had 50,000 folks screaming with joy. 
·Then an Irish boy, Chris Flanagan of Corpus 
Christi, Texas, decided it was time to become 
.a horseman and Minnesota was ridden down 
to defeat by Notre Dame by 19 to' 7. 
The Notre Dame team of today was by far 
the best of the p1~e3ent season. It wasn't a team 
such as rode every opponent to earth a year 
ago and won a national championship, but it 
was a much g'reater machine according to 
Knute Rockne than the one which was wrecked . .a week ago in New York by the Army. 
In the crisis of the battle, Minnesota fell 
down in its punting· game after displaying a 
weakness in that department all afternoon, and 
right in that crisis 
Flanagan rode. t h e 
enemy to earth. 
When that final 
quarter began w i t h 
the fight even, Notre . 
Dame· had the ball on 
the enemy's 35 yard 
line. Minnesota's line 
stopped Joe Prelli and 
then stopped 'Rex En-· 
Tight with a gain of 
one-half of a yard. 
Gene Edwards punt­
ed cleverly kicking 
the ball out of bounds 
on the Minnesota 7­
yard line. Immediate­
1y from behind his J oesting hit the middle for three yards and then for two and then the ball was snapped to Shor­ty Almquist, who fumbled and a Notre Dame· man fell on it on the enemy's twenty-eight yard line. · 
Right away Flanagan mounted his steed and the ball was tossed to him. He rode a couple of tacklers to earth and broke loose again for another dash around the right end for 24 yards, planting the ball on the Minnesota four yard line, where, in one smash off tackle, Enright carried it over the goal line. Again Flanagan missed goal, but it mattered not, for the score was 19 to 7 and there were only three or four minutes left to play. In that brief time the Minnesota team rallied gamely and, with the aid of a nifty pass after getting the ball in Notre Dame territory on a fumble, the Gophers 
were down close to the goal when the fin.:. al pistol shot. ended the game, b u t it would have taken two touchdowns t o have won. 
It was some rip­ping .runs by Flana­gan coupled with a deplorable punt by Minnesota that gave the South Benders their first touchdown in the second period. 
The Texas lad got loose ~or a thir~y-five yard run near the close ·of the first quar-

Ascher punted b u t . . · · . the ball went only to his 28-yard line, where it was downed. 
On the first play, Flanagan was given the ball, and with some fine interference by En-right and Prelli, he got loose around the right end for 24 yards to the Minne·sota four yard line. That: seemed .to assure: a· touchdown arid victory but on the ·next-play, Enright was stopped ·with only a two yard gain. Notre Dame was off side and penalized five yard. That put the ball b~ck on the nine ·yard line and Notre Dame decitled to send Joe Prelli ·around the left end. He \vas nailed from behind and thrown 
for a loss :of. six .yai·ds and the hall was on the fifteen yard line; It was third down· with the goal line to gain. 
Flanagan was called to carry the ball~._arid again his mates knocked two or three danger­ous men out of his way and broke loose around the right ;end for a fifteen yard run and a touchdown. He missed·his attempt at goal and the score stood 13 to 7: 
Notre Pame kicked off and Bob Peplaw ran the ball back to his own 20 yard line. Herh

ball · on Minnesota's 12 yard line. Here the Gophers made a gallant stand and took the ball on downs on their own four yard line, but in kicking it back Capt. Ascher· punted out of. bounds on his own 13 ¥ard line. Rearden m-ade nine yards as the per­10d eiJ.ded; and on the first play of the second 
· quarter Enright went over for a·touchdown. 
rt·was only a few minutes later that Minne­sota tied the count, and 'it was largely due to splendid running by Harold · Murrel, Capt. Ascher, and Shorty·Almquist. Notre Dame kick­ed off and Murrel·retUl;ned to his 32 yard line. J oesting mashed through center for nine yards

Notre Da:m.e, 18: Georgia Tech; 0 
Our boys never had any fear for big, black, .bleak, biting tornadoes and as for Golden ones-why, they just eat 'em up! The "Golden Tornado" of Atlanta­the Georgia Tech team--:--proved to be only a soft and gentle zephyr. It was the day of the "Big 'Vind" in Atlanta but the Irish from Notre Dame were not the vi<;tims. "'Vinged with red lightning and tempestuotis r:ige" they stormed through the Georgia Tech "Yellow J ackcts" for two touchdowns and their fourth consecutive victOr)~ over the Southerners. 
-The game was played in a steady drizzle; umbrellas and slickers were in vogue; the crowd was small. The great 'Vycoff and his assistants kept the Tech bench dry. Coach Alexander must have realized the funeral prospects for the day so he used only his "shock" troops against our boys-truly.they were shocked. Only two touchdowns were scored by the Irish, but that was one more than necessary to inter the Atlantans. 
In the first quarter Gene Edwards intercepted a Tech pass and raced to the Georgian's twenty-five yard line. Then Rearden, Enright and Flanagan crashed the line and circled the· ends to put the .ball· on the one foot line. . Christie carried it across but failed to add the extra point by placement. Our second touchdown came early in the second quarter. Flanagan tore off twenty yards to start a march from mfdfield and with the aid of the two red heads and Rex Enright he finally planted the ball behind Tech's goal. Gene E.dwards con~ verted for the extra point. This finished our scoring· for the afternoon, the tally being 13-0. · . . 
The Georgia Tech. game was our second rally' after the Army disaster. Cer­tainly our boys had benefitted by the New York affair. 'Ve are beginning to find_ ourselves now and the wound of the Army sabre is healing fast.

Notre Dame, 0: Penn State, 0 

The game .might have been better played on skiffs or in row-boats. At uny 
rate on a field of mud and in a drenching rain the Fighting Irish and the Nittany · Lions of State College, Pennsylvania, fought a scoreless tic. Twenty-five thousand Penn State Homecomers braved the elements to see ·their boys perform aga~nst Notre Dame. They were drenched to the skin when they left the stadium, but they left the· stadium luippy. Tl~e Nittany Lions had shown their mettle. T·ltey had 
held Notre Dame to a scoreless tie. 
It might have been a different story if the field were dry and. all that,. but we 
will not argue this point. Suffice to say that Flanagan, Bearden, Enright and 
Edwards tore off yardage before the State wall but just when the ball would be 
placed inthe shadow of the Penn State goal, the Lions would growl, stick fast their 
claws and displ!'te any further passage. Thus the ga~e carried on all a~ternoon. 
The sad feature of the afternoon-was Captain ·clem Crowe's injury. Clem 
tore a. muscle in his back and this killed him for the rest of the season. It was 
a· tough break for us. \Vallace played a smashing game at end· as did Voedisch 
who substituted for Crowe. Ike at one period beautifully stopped one of Edward's 
punts on State's ·one-yard line. Joe Boland and l\Icl\Ianmon, l\farelli and 
l\Iay~r and Bud Boeringer stopped all things coming ·in their directions. 
Notre_ Dame made much more yardage than Penn State; they held State to 
three first downs, in fact, outplayed the Lions in every department of the game, but 
nevertheless that 0-0 score blazes forth and offsets all other considerations or · 
alibis. The Nittany Lions must receive due credit for the great fight they showed; 
especially in their own territory. It was the "Day of the Big l\Iud," and upsets 
were preval~nt all over the country. Notre Dame's· stock depreciated not a whit 
on account of our scoreless tie with Penn State.

·Gray's Mighty Toe Stops·R?ck's Clan in Drizzle of Rain 

STATE COLLEGE, Pa.-Butchered by the Army in its first invasion of the East, the Lochinvars of Notre Dame in the vestments of football came back to the terrain of the effete East today to battle a scoreless tie with the cubs of the famed and mythical Lion of Old Nittany. 
Twenty-two thousand sat through a drizzle and downpour that changed the velvet turf of Beaver Field into a morass and quagmire to see Penn State, a fighting clan, dauntless in spirit, if unsuccessful in quest, fight the foes from .the land of the Hoosier to a stalemate. 
Eleven years ago the College that sits atop that hill in South Bend sent its warriors here to overthrow and spoil a triumphant season of the Blue and ·white. Since that day the defeat has rankled in the hearts of the Lions' cubs, the iron has

As the ball came to him the Indianan dropped . f back several yards to throw a forward pass. He swept the field with his eyes, selected his eligible man, but tarried too long. Through the line came a thundering end, Weston of .the Lions. He bore down upon Edwards like a Hussar in a charge. He chased the Hoosier backward, and as Edwards drew back his arm to fling the cowskin, '\Veston tore into him, flung his· arms around the Notre Dame man's knees. Down he went in the slime and muck of a morass. Twenty yards had Notre Dame lost on this thrilling feat by '\Veston. 

As the ·State cohorts broke into a roar that resounded over the hills tinged with autumn foliage, their plaudits died in a groan. For as Edwards tried to forward pass again to

Notre Darrie, 26: Carnegie Tech, 0 
The driest story ever told is the one of the Scotchman and the Irishman 'vho wen't into a saloon to drink and the It:ishman didn't have any money. The Scotch are usually considered to be pretty "thin" about. their worldy goods, but we know "twenty-seven Kilties from Pittsburgh who were completely outdone in this respect by some Fighting Irishmen. ·Not a single score did the Irish allow the Carnegie Skibos to register during the 1925 Hom_ecoming fracas at Notre Dame. On the other hand, Notre Dame amassed a big twenty-six-a twenty-six sickening to the hearts of the Kilties. 
Coach Steffen brought a squad of twenty--seven and a band from the _Smoky City. These men were led by the much-feared Captain Beede, who, by the way, never had a chance during the fray. The Scotch had very I.ittle kick. Notre Dame had become accustomed to hard "mule" three weeks previously ·and nothing less than dynamite could affect. the Irish on this afternoon. The Scotch was easy to take. 
It is sai4 that the whippet is the fastest creature on legs. But you couldn't make .the Homecoming crowd believe this. One Christie Flanagan from 'Port Arthur, Texas-, proved to the satisfaction of all that whippets and greyhounds are back numbers. Of course, the old reliable Red _Hearden-good old silent Tom­featured prominently in the accumulation of that twenty-six score. Enright, too, hammered the Kiltie line to a pulp. Charley Riley scored our final touchdown in tli.e last few minutes of ·l)lay when he outguessed the .. Skibos for ten yards .and a touchdo"~n.

Notre_ Dame, 0: Nebraska, 17 
Nebraska! Each year our crux! Here was our only obstacle for clear title to a \Vestern Championship. And ·we couldn't get over it, under it, through it or around it! \Ve were stopped. . 
The boys marched to the Cornhuskers' territory with Crowe and Flanagan on the hospital list. Just think-Crowe and Flanagan! Two men we certainly couldn't afford to be without. But even at that we were slated to win. Nebraska had lost two games to :Missouri Valley teams and had been tied by the \Vashington eleven from Seattle· after that team had made the two thousand mile trip to the Capitol City of Nebraska. In all the forecasts, however, une thing was overlooked. Nebraska, as in previous years, was pointing to the Notre Dame game. They rested on the Saturday before while Notre Dame was straining every nerve to trim the nails of the Northwestern \Vildcat. It was the psycho­logical moment for Nebraska's victory; they were ready for Notre Dame. The ·· Irish were travel-weary, tired, and broken, but, nevertheless, still fighting. 
The Cornhu;kers~ s'cored. twice in· the very first quarter. These touchdowns were made against Rock's second team and they -\vere too much for the first string boys to overcome. Then in the third quarter Big Ed \V eir, Ottr persecutor, placed the ball between the uprights for the three points that made the score 17. There is not much of a story to the game. Notre Dan1e -showed bursts of brilliant football and, in fact, we outfought Nebraska for the last three periods. ·The battle was ferocious throughout, but in spite of all the score stands: Nebraska 17, Notre Dame 0. 
The curtain falls. The first act of the .·career of another \Yonder Team is over! Hold fast to vour seats and watch Rockne and Notre Dame. The play is young. The coronation of another Champion Football Team at Notre Dame is not far off. \Vatch Rockne! \Vatch Our Lady's Team!

Huskers Take Early .Lead and Retain It 
By "\VARREN "\V. BROWN 
LINCOLN, Nebr.----:-The spirit of Thanh:giv­ing was abroad in the Nebraska stadium today and 45,000 spectators, the largest crowd that ever assembled in the gre~t open spaces be-between the Mississippi and the Sierra Nevada Mountains that guard the Pacific slope, saw the Cornhuskers give the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame a 17 to 0 trimming, for "'hich most of the 45,000 were duly thankful. 
Both of the touchdowns that Nebraska 
. scored were gained in the first quarter, before the "shock troops" had a chance to get on sociable terms with scarlet jerseyed, cream-helmeted Cornhuskers, and after that the Irish had never a chance, though they did come back and out-rush Nebraska for the last three periods. 
At no time during the game were the visitors within scor­ing distance, and if it hadn't been for a 26­yard placement goal booted across in the third quarter by Ed "\Veir, Nebraska's great tackle, the two touchdowns· charged against the "shock troops" would have ended the tallying. 
N o t r e D a m e couldn't score at all and wouldn't let the Cornhuskers s c o r e any mor!'!. And .that was the way it ended.

· \Ve don't know who furnished· the turkey for the Irish, Thanskgiving, but Nebraska certainlyprovided the trimming_. . . · . Incidentally the Huskers made true Coach Rockne's early season prediction that his team would lose two games· this year. Nebraska, which has had a season of ups and downs, closed brilliantly today as they opened bril­liantly several weeks ago against Illinois. If it hadn't been for weir's goal" the scores in both 
games would have been the same. So some­thing can be said for Cornhusker consistency. 
The running attack of the Irish didn't amount to much and the absent Christy Flana­gan, who viewed proceedings from the bench, was sadly missed by his mates. Once in awhile O'Boyle, Prelli, Rearden arid Endght would get going for marches, but sooner or later they banged into the fine Nebraska line and stopped. 
Noti-e Dame's passing wasn't' worth much to the Irish, though it helped Nebraska considerably, three of O'Boyle's tosses being 
intercepted, two by Daily. But one pass out of twelve was completed and it gained about a dozen yards. . 
Nebraska paid little attention to passing, trying but three, two of which connected for fifteen ya~ds each, and the last, a toss from Brown to A. Mandery, was "turned into the second Husker touchdown, the fleet back reel­ing off the final twenty yards before Notre Dame tacklers could lay hands upon him. 
The first touchdown was the result of the Huskers' taking full advantage of the high wind at their backs and the "shock troops" in .front of them. · 
Nebraska received the kick-off and on the first play from scrimmage Ed \Veir kicked and the ball carried to the Notre Dame four-yard line, where it bounded up in the air and stayed 
in the field instead of 
going over the goal 
line.

The Prospects 
Notre Dame lost two games out of ten this .year~the Army, pointed on October 17th, defeated the Irish by 27-0, after Rockne had predicted that the team was too inexperienced 
. and green to stave off the Cadets. Nebraska, also worked up to a fighting degree, suc­ceeded in administering· a 17-0 beating at Lincoln on Thanksgiving Day. Two defeats in one season for Notre Dame! That is the worst year Rockne has eve~· experienced since he took the coaching reins from Jesse Harper in 1917, and ,'ve doubt if this record can be approached by any other coach in the country.. 
Of the twenty-six letter men this year, but six ·will be lost to the team for next year. That means that Rockne has twenty men of experience to answer l1is call next September 15th, and anyone who analyzes the fact that "Rock" lost but two games this year after losing the complete eleven of the National Champions of 1924, plus half of the second arid third teams to boot-twenty­two men in all-and then turn out a team that just mis~ed gaining the \Vestern Cham­pionship by the Nebraska defeat, after turn­ing back Northwestern, a team that tied for the Conference leadership with l\Iichigan; those twenty men appear likely material 
to duplicate their predecessors of '2,1. 
Captain Clem· Crowe and \Vallace, ends, will be replaced by "Ike" Voedisch, "Chile" \Valsh, (a brother of Adam \Valsh), Joe Rigali, Benda, and \Vhite. l\Ic:Mullen, who alternated with Boland will be the only tackle lost, and word comes that the Fresh­man squad. have wonderful prospects of pro­ducing candidates that will provide l\lcl\:Ian­mon, Boland, and Polisky stiff opposition next year. At guards, we still haye the clean­
. sl1aven "Smith Bros.", "Red" and "Johnny", with l\Iarelli and l\Iayer to help continue the work set by Hanousek who is graduated. Boeringer, the sterling center of this year's squad has a fine chance of again reappear­ing at the pivot position, '\vith Fredericks to aid him. The quarterback berth will again be well handled by "Red" Edwards, Parisien, Riley and l\IcNally; so no cause for any worry to Rockne about directors is apparent. Rearden, the other "Red" who 
will be alternating captain with Edwards, looks strong for another great year at right half, with assistance from Prelli and Dahman~ The left halfback position. will s·ce a wealth 
. of material with "Chris" Flanagan, Harry O'Boyle and John Roach emulating the Four Horsemen of 1924. The graduation of Rex Enright leaves a gap in the fullback berth, but Elmer \Vynne, a brother of the famous Chet \Vynne, seems capable of handling the job, 'with Freddy Collins~ l\IcCabe and Quinn pushing him. 
The wealth of material is apparent, and with such clay in the hands of the great Rockne, another team of championship calibre should be molded for 1926. \Vatch the glory of the '2,1 team be matched . by the "Fightin' Irish" of next year. \Ve predict a very success£ul season, . and extenp our deepest sympathy for those who have carded Notre Dame on their next ye~r's schedule.

Press Comments 
CRITICS BELIEVE NOTRE DAME WILL HAVE SECOND CHAMPIONSHIP ELEVEN 
That Notre Dame has another great football .team in the making, probably another aggre­gation of champions, is the opinion of many of the expert football writers assembled here Sat­urday to cover the Notre ·Dame-Baylor cont~st. 
According to Charles \V. Dunkley, sportmg -editor ·of the central division of the Associated Press, who covered the game for that great or­ganization "Rockne not only possesses one powerful t'eam, but has two of equal merit." 
Herbert Reed, staff correspondent for the Universal Service, in his report of the game, stated "Rockne apologized for his team before 
the game, and should have retracted it after­wards. These players know football from the ground up." · 
As Seen by Associated Press. In summing up the game Mr. Dunkley says: "The successors of the 'four horsemen,' ·charged· with reckless fury on Cartier field Sat­urday leaving no doubt that Knute Rockne, Notre' Dame's football genius, will develop an­other eleven that promises to make a desperate bid for the 1925 gridiron championship of America. "Notre Dame, undefeated· in 1924 and proud bearer of the na.tion's gridiron. title, made its season's debut with a 41 to 0 trmmph ·over Baylor University, of \Vaco, Texas, a vet­eran team that has not lost a game in the .Southwestern conference in three y'ears. "The southerners were completely smother­·ed in a brilliant attack that made Notre Dame's football reputation outstanding l_ast season. 
Two Powerful Teams. "The green, untried teanr that Rockn.e sent -onto the field, with only one veteran m the lineup, was the strongest on defense that has represented Notre Dame in several years and ·on the offensive revealed the speed and the :spirit of the 1924 squad. Rockne not only pos­·;sesses one powerful team, but .has two of equal strength. If he misses the noted ·quartet of Miller, Crowley, Layden,_ and Stuhldreher, he ·has another quartet in the making of Joe Prelli; Christy Flannigan, O'Boyle, Hearndon, half­backs, Enright and Hanousek, fullbacks, and Edwards and Scharer, quarterbacks." . 
Praise by Reed. 
Mr. Reed's analysis of· the game, copyright by the Universal News; is as follows: . 
"Notre Dame is still very much on the foot­ball map. Despite the exodus led by the famous four horsemen of a year ago, Knute Rockne still. has a flock of first-class football players. Of course they do not yet suit the exacting Rockne, but if their sho'\ving Saturday when they piled up 41 points against Baylor Univer­sity is any indication of what is to come, then .a lot more good football is coming out of South Bend. \Vith the exception of the center Notre 
Dame showed the making of a line that prom­
ises to be stronger than the forward wall of a 
year ago. 
"Notre Dame's forward passes from run­
ning formation went as well as the rest of the 
plays, and the little deception put ~n before 
thrusts into the line were also effective. Rock­
ne apologized for his team before the game, 
and should have retracted it afterward. These 
players know football from the ground up. 
Baylor's forward passes were '':ild heaves .be­
cause the passer was unmercifully hurried, 
while the Notre Dame passer in every case took 
his own good .time. . 
"Notre Dame is an eye-filler and no mis­take and one doesn't have to forget last year's tea~ either in oi·der to say so. It is a smart · bunch of football players, and Rockne has proved that he can keep right on his sound football path. It is a great coaching system, and this was a test of it. There are harder ones to come and although the team may be beaten later in' the season, it will take a lot of high 
class football to do it." 
His Four Horsemen scattered to the four 
winds by graduation, his "shock troops" whisk­
ed hither and yon in the same inevitable up­
heaval that comes to every college eleven, great 
or small sooner or later, Coach Knute Rockne 
of Notr~ Dame surveys the situation for 1925 
_;_not gloomy, but grimly determined. It is said 
he even smiles, occasionally. · 
Notre Dame still has the Irish. Notre Dame 
still has the fight. It is Rockne's hope to be able 
to· put the two together. He is not pessimistic. 
He couldn't be and be Rockne. But his feeling 
is far from one of optimism. 
By \VARREN \V. BRO\VN 
"You know, those boys surprised me," ob­
served Knute Rockne, after his new Notre 
Dame squad whaled the Baylor Bears in most 
thorough style. . . . 
\Veil maybe they DID surprise him, at 
that. Surprise because. they didn't score fifty 
points instead of forty-one. 
Rockne gdnne~ when he said it. The same 
sort of a grin you'll' notice on the face ·_of 
Houdini after he makes the elephant dis­
appear before your very eyes. 
There is something of Houdini about the 
Rockne system. There is no doubt of that. 
· The most interesting phase of th~ play of 
the new Notre Dame team was its smooth­
ness. 
· Remember that it was this team's first 
appearance as a team, and that after a matter 
of two week's practice. · 
Yet the performance was mid-October in 
its efficiency. ·Each man did his duty as he 
saw it, and each man saw his duty as he did it. 
All. in all, it was quite e1].tertaining .

SOUTH BEND, Ind.-The ghosts of the four horsemen of the gridiron rode Cartier Field to­day in the wake of the 1925 Notre Dame foot­bail team as it went into battle against Baylor University of ..Waco, Tex.

ARMY AT THF. START REGARDED NOTRE DAME A MINOR RIVAL (Special to The New York Times.) 
'\VEST POTNT, N. Y.-How the .Army came into relationr-::hip with Notre Dame was re­lated today by Captain Reel O'Hare, former West Point star, who has returned to assist in the coaching of the linemen.· It appears that in 1!)12 or thereabouts. the schedule-mnking was left to the graduate manager, and Daly, who was then coach, requested that an effort be made to get a ~ood strong team for the mid-season date. Efforts were made to schedule Yale, Harvard and other big Eastern elevens, but without success, and finally the manager signed up Notre Dame. The South Benders were little known in the East at that time and Coach Daly was'considerably put out when he returned in the Fall of 1913. He dec:;ired 
a heavy game, and he didn't think that Notre
i,
::.. 
Dame had sufficient strength. As it turned out, however; it was 1 heavier than he looked. for, and the Westerners have been winning from the Army regularly ever since. 
(By the Associated Press.). NE\V YORK.-A determined Army mule turned two menacing. hoofs on the annual Notre Dame football invasion in an effort to stem a triumphant march which has crushed all opposition for more than a year on the gridiron. · 
. Eleventh Meeting. 
The meeting of these two major elevens of East. and Middle vVest in the Yankee Stadium marks their eleventh struggle. Only two of these contests have been won by the cadets-the games in 1914 and 1916. .In 1916 the Army piled up its highest score, a total of thirty points, all made by tlie hard-running Gene Vidal. 
Eight of the other nine games were won 
~ 
by Notre Dame, while the battle of 1922 was a scoreless tie. 
Notre Dame brought East a scoring ma­chine of high power, as yet untried against powerful opposition. The game presented the first big test for the new Rockne .team, a line-up made ·conspicuous by the absence of the famous "Four Horsemen"-Layden, Crowley, Stuhldreher and Miller. 
Army. Strong. Army, on the other hand, had a veteran macliine, heavy and powerful-an outfit claimed to be even stronger than the line-up which was· beaten in a close game a year ago by Notre Dame, 13-7. An attendance of 65,000 was expected, but the Cadet Corps was not perm~tted to come to New York. 
A PAST GLORY. 
\Vith the "Four Horsemen" out of college and with another football season lying ahead, there is greater interest than ever in the do­ings of the Notre Dame team. Having de­feated the three-time Southwestern cham­pions, Baylor, by a convincing margin, the fans are certain that Knute K. ·Rockne is on the road to turning out another wonder team. Probably not as speedy, capable or co-ordi­native as the national champions of 1924, but still able to bowl over .most opponents. That .J habit of Notre Dame teams-attaining mid­season form in October-will pile up early season wins and the result should mean a 
·fine morale for the last spurt. 
The terrific jolting given the Bears of Bay­
loi· by Rockne's Remnants, in the opening of 
the Western football season, was the most in­
teresting event of the day. of days. 
That ·41 to 0 plaster the troops of Notre 
Dame attached to the bedraggled hides of the 
Bears was the official notice to all interested 
parties that if RQckne hasn't another team at 
Notre Dame this year, then Paris ·hasn't a

IRISH GRIDDERS FORGOT POINTS OF GAME, SAYS NOTRE DAME'S CLEVER COACI;I. 
(This was one of a series of articles by Davis J. Walsh on some of the leading football teams of the East and Middle West.} ·· 
lly DAVIS J. WALSH 
(1. N. S. Staff Corr'2spondent.) 
NE\V YORK.-Having mastered the trick ·of losing one football game, Notre Dame quite possibly will contrive to drop several· more before the end of the 1925 season, ac­cording to. a statement made to the writei.· by Knute Rockne, master coach, following the Hoosiers' defeat by the Army. It was their first defeat in two seasons but Rockne didn't think it would be their last. 
"\Ve are in for at least one more lacinoo within the next three weeks," declared Rockne~ "Next Saturday we play-Minnesota; the follow­ing week it will be Georgia Tech, apd then Penn State. Every one of them is a traveling date-Minneapolis, to Atlanta, to Bellefonte, Pa. · 
"It would take a first class football team to get away with that schedule and mine is far from that. They may say I'm only crying 'wolf,' but, really, I'm only. making a .state­ment of fact. I called the turn of the Army game, didn't I?" 
Forget Everything. 
. The writer assured Mr. Rockne. that he had. Four days before the game he intimated that Notre Dame would finish ·second. It did, but the thing was a gratuity. If they allowed three teams in one and the same contest, Notre Dame would have finished third. 
It proved to be the weakest Notre Dame outfit, by many yards, the East has ever seen although it probably was showing its worst and Rockne seemed to enter this idea. 
·. "The boys forgot everything they ever knew ~nd that was none too much," he said. ·"This IS the way of green teams since time im­memorial and. mi~e is nothing if not green. Only two sel!wrs m the outfit, Hanousek and Crowe. Incidentally, our early games were too easy. They gave the boys the idea that they were good when they weren't. · Army outplayed us from the first jump and deserved every one of their 27 points." 
Thoroughly Outplayed. 
"Brains/'. said Mr. Rockne. "Brains, that is the answer. \Ve had brains in there last year. I don't mean to say th~t' these boys are dumb. They just don't know. The·y may be good football players by the end of the season. Right now, ·they are little more than high school players." . · 
NOTRE DAME STUDENTS MEET ·DEFEATED PLAYERS TODAY (Special Service of the News.) 

. NOTRE· DAME,· Ind.-The Notre Dame student body, most of which was not fortunate enough to ·get to the Army-Notre Dame game to give moral and .vocal support to the team, will give the most elaborate.wel­come ever given. to a returning team here today. · 
The students witnessed play-by-play reports of the game on a gridgraph in the gym Satur­day, hardly believing what took place before. their eyes. The walls and rafters rocked from the cheerings and pleadings that continued up to the last· play. At the end of the game a deafening cheer ·was given for the \Vest Point warriors, followed by an even greater one for the defeated schoolmates. 
The rooters here were confident of victoi·y up_ to the third touchdown. As the Cadets marched down the field for the .first touch­down, there .were continuous cheers of "Hold 'em," many minds evidently .reverting to the Leland Stanford goal-line ·stand last New Year's Day. \Vhen the ball was· rushed over the line a groan went up followed by a minute of indefinite grumbling after which there was spontaneous cheering and applause for the ones who .drew first. blood. From then on to the end of the game the students put up probably as interesting a fight as the Notre Dame team itself. 
It appeared evident that the best of feeling exists between both teams. and their immediate followers and the sentiment many times ex­pressed by individuals after the defeat was, "Well, if we had to be· beaten, I'm glad it was Army rather than any other team." 

NE\V YORK.-The Notre Dame eleven in its .•'. play against a powerful and punishing Army outfit Saturday was nothing more than a com.:. bination in the process <?f makin_g. 
Rockne -has been building very carefully and deliberately. and the chances are that November games will see his work bear~ng fruit. As the writer pointed out more than three weeks ago, Rockne lacks players of natural ability such. as he has had in the past three yea·i·s. 
This applies to· the backfield more than to the line where one· may expect very radical improvement .in a short time now that the forwards have had their blooding, their short­comings-due chiefly to inexperience-re­vealed to . the coaches, as well as to them­selves.. 
· Rockne told the \vriter· sori1e time ago that Notre Dame· "\vould not be· hurried out of its ·stride for the Army game mid in this contest there was nothing to indicate'that it had beei1. 
[47] 
Footbazz·n·eview of 1925 
The range of plays was narrow indeed and even so· the backfield worked them more with the mood .and mien of men working out a lesson than of players proceeding with the sanction of belief in their stuff and confi­dent in the knowledge in their strength and ability. 
Now that Minnesota has been disposed of in a handy fashion Notre Dame can turn her attention to countering a tornado at Atlanta, Ga., this Saturday. The Minnesota victory goes a long way to effacing the defeat handed the Rox by West Point ·a week ago 
'· .last Saturday. The team and the students who made ·the trip to Minneapolis returned yesterday. A cele­bration of some kind will probably be held tomorrow night as the students were unable to get organized in time for one tonight. The game displayed one thing, that is, Rockne has the material and it is just a ques­tion of time until it can be polished to.· the finish and lustre displayed by the 1924 cham­pions. Enright for the first time this season gave a very, creditable performance at full­back. He exhibited that leg drive that hm; been so lacking among this year's backfield men. By LAWRENCE PERRY. 
CHICAGO HERALD AND EXAMINER 
Mingled with ·the roar .of the Nittany Lion will be the battlecry of the. Fighting ·Irish of South Bend. as-Penn State and Notre Dame Rtand embattled at State Colleg-e on Saturday. This is the . first appear:mce of Knute Rockne's dashing-henchmen on the soil of the Keystone State this season, perhaps it marks the first invasion of the successors to the Four Horse­men in this commonwealth. 
Neither of these rivalc::. meetinl:; in battle for the first time in football, has had the stelhn· season that marked their gridiron achievements in other and better years. Georgia Tech, over­thrown by the Hoosiers from South Bend. de­
feated the Lion on the Polo Grounds. Syra­cuse, ranking among the undefeated elevens of the country, also caused the surrender of Hugo . Bezdek and his minions. 
Meanwhile the Army is thP. onlv team that has triumphed over Rockne's battalionc::. That game came when West Point was on the crest of its wave _of glory. and Rockne was trying to polish iJ. green eleven into the customary efficiency that rules at Notre D~me. 
Since that time this eleven has gone con­sistently forward, tpe same dashing, ~laghing: ~ort. of outfit that Knute always gends from Indiana to compete ag"ainst the gridiron bat­tlers of the East and the West. Minnesota succumbed to the Hoosiers and the Golden Tornado .was as timid as a whisper, as the Hoosiers rode as roughshod over them as did their predecessors in the saddle of Notre Dame. 
CHICAGO HERALD AND EXAMINER Knute Rockne has long been heralded as­one of the football geniuses of the generation. Until Saturday we had never seen a Notre Dame eleven in action. Hence our knowledge of the Hoosier coach was obtained second-hand. But when one sees Notre Dame play, it is easy to conceive why Rockne is so successful as a coach. His team is so grounded . in fundamental football that it does the right thing at the proper time through sheer in­stinct. · Somebody has characterized genius as the ability. to .concentrate on the _details of life, a problem or a situation. Rockne has done this t(} such an extent that his team, equipped with brains, does the manual plays of football just instinctively, as a fighter borne to the canvas: comes up fighting. . Let us amplify on this Rockne capability. Saturday the battlefield at Penn State College was a morass. The day overhead was as in~ clement as yesterday, the going slimy, the arena a bog. It \vas a day when bad tackling could be excused, when fumbling was not to be too harshly treated and when blocked kicks. could be condoned. · Yet in sixty minutes spent in watching Notre· Danie we did not see one poor tackle by· the Fighting Irish. The thought smote us, sitting in· the press stand at Beave1~ Field, was that every coach in the East could well afford to attend a game played by Notre Dame on an off day for. his own college eleven. 
INTERFERENCE PERFECT. 
Take the fundamental of interference. N(} Notre Dame back should ever bump into his interference. He is drilled too well for that. The backs against State had timing and pre­cision -down to the nth degree of perfection. The interference formed automatically-and perfectly. It formed with such a minute at­tention to timing that the backs were promptly in motion. 
Opposition coaches say that they are to(} prompt, that they get into motion before the ball is snapped. But no penalty has been in­flicted on the Hoosiers for ·starting before the ball is put in play. Hence they must have per­fected that start so that they "can beat the gun" and get away with it. 
That is purely a question on which we have no opinion. But· we know that the timing, the formation of the interference and the start are such that when THE BALL IS SNAPPED THE \VALL OF INTERFERENCE KNOWS WHERE IT IS GOING AND IS ON-ITS WAY. 
Plays are co-ordinated, too, so that line and back-field inove as one machine. In other words, it is cohesive football that counts and that shows the marked influence of a coaching· system which stresses .fundamentals. Folks who watched the Villa Nova eleven against. Dickinson and saw them afterwards against St. 
[48] 
Football Review of 1925 
Joseph say that Stuhldreder, patterning after his boss, has brought the Main Liners to this !Same smoothness. This gloss and finish comes too, only because the men have been so ,grounded in fundamentals that everything they <lo is a natural and proper act. 
'With this eleven so smoothly polished in fundamentals, it is easy work for Rockne to teach them his ·system of offense. The system, too, is varied and diversified. It has speed, deception, and power, but is not one that essentially requires beef to execute. Thus "Ro.ckne chooses backs that are lithe, lean, and fast, durable without being unwieldly. 
To watch Notre Dame in action, is to see the finished ·product of a coach who has that faculty which enables him to teach funda­lnentals in such a manner that the knowledge js never lost by his pupils. 
They recover rapidly, these football teams. 
There's Illinois, beaten three times in the \Vest, returning to glory by slaughtering the 1nnocents of Penn. 
· There's Notre Dame, trampled on by Army, -coming back, Saturday after Saturday to play better football. 
It's all very interesting. But it's also very 1ntricate. 
· Notre Dame's case can be explained. Illi­nois' has been. 
At the start of the football season Knute "Rockne declared that he expected to lose two :games. 
He had Army in mind and said so. He has not designated the other, ·but probably bas in mind Nebraska, now, tho thought~ of Northwestern, before· injuries overcame the Wildcats,· must have made Knute's knob a little balder. 
It will be the seventh time these rivals have met on a football field. Notre Dame has won four games, Northwestern one and the other -ended in a scoreless tie. The ·wildcats are -conceded an excellent chance to beat the Irish tomorrow. · If they do, it will be the second time in the history of Cartier Field that the Irish have lost on their own battle ground. Wabash holds the only victory, achieved in 1905, that has ever been registered against "Rockne's men on their own field. · 
By \VA~REN ·w._ BRO\VN. 
· NOTRE DAME, Ind.-=-Knute K. Rockne's football army, 1925 edition, passed in review before a critical mob of 27,000 home-comers, the largest that.ever assembled at Cartier Field here today. The review was a. great. success and the fighting IriEh crushed Carnegie Tech 
26 to 0. 
Great players come and go at Notre Dame. It is doubtful, however, if any of them ever disported themselves better than Christy Flana­gan did today. Elmer Layden of .the famous 
Four Horsemen and many other former Notre Dame stars saw Christy do his stuff. Flanagan · played a marvelous game. 
It should occasion no surprise if the Notre Dame team went through the rest of its sea­son undefeated. 
Mr. Flanagan and the supporting cast seem to be able to find their way around Minneapolis, Atlanta and those kind of places, if not as spectacularly as the late, Four Horsemen, at least in a manner that looks satisfactory when it is set forth in score-board numbers. 
By HARRY MACNAMARA; 
One hundred and thirty-five candidates re­ported for first day's Freshman football prac­tice at Notre Dame. 
Coach George Keegan strung the troops out in line. "All of you who want to try for center, step 
forward," he invited. About half a dozen left the line. "Ends?" Perhaps fifteen more stepped out. "Guards and tackles?" A dozen moved· forward. 
· "Backs?" The line, still nearly 100 strong, jumped forward; 
That condition may be peculiar to Notre Dame, and may not. The backfield of 1924, Crowley, Layden, Stuhldreher and Miller, designated the Four Horsemen, undoubtedly gathered in more praise, oral and written, than any other set of backs in football history. So Freshmen, who aren't supposed to know much, in a football or any other way, ac­i cording to a sophomore :friend of ours, cannot be blamed for wanting to make a bid for glory·, and make it by a short cut, if necessary. 
Later on it will come to those youngsters il at Notre Dame that Adam \Valsh, a center, ;I '! drew his share of praise for his valiant deeds on the football field that "Chuck" Collins and Joe Bach, an end and a tackle, are names not easily forgotten. , 
Those freshmen are victims of the belief that the world watches the backfield, the lads who carry the ball; that the world doesn't 
.give a whoop about the linemen. · And the 
,,
sad part of it is that the the freshmen are not e~tirely wrong. If this be treason, sophomore friend, then make the most of it. 
:.I'· 
Getting back to Notre Dame's problem, Coach Keegan, if he cares, might recite to his troops the truth of the famous struggle with Stanford last New Year's Day. 
It is a matter of history that the Notre Dame backs, especially Crowley and Layden, won the game. 
But it is equally a matter of history that the Notre Dame line, battered and bruised weary and worn, SAVED the game. '. 
So there IS honor for a line-· and USE for. it: frP.shmen. By WARREN .\V. BROWN

ROCKNE PASSES OUT SUGAR­TWO LUMPS TO EACH PLAYER REPLACES TRADITIONAL HASH 
· At least one of the myriad of legends, some true, some ridiculous, to which the foot­ball coaching tactics of Knute Rockne, Notre Dame athletic director, have given rise finds sound basis in modern dietetics. 
One of football's ever-recurrent mysteries to spectators is what really transpires in dress­ing rooms between halves of any game, but especially at the intersectional combats which for several years have been the weekly task of Notre Dame gridiron squads. 
The canny individuals who, after a first half not so brilliant as is the team's wont, accompany with a knowing wink their con­vincing conjectures of "I'll bet Rockne is lay­ing the lash on those guys" would be some­what surprised. They would see the Notre Dame mentor filing in and out among the benches of the dressing room, bestowing a paternal pat on the back here and a friendly suggestion there, but invariably handing his perspiring athletes, whether they be illustrious "Horsemen" or the veriest tyros, a couple of lumps of sugar. 
The methods of company commanders in reviving tired troops after long marches by judicious use of sugar, milk chocolate and con­centrated carbohydrates have been trans­planted by· the intrepid Rockne to the foot-. ball dressing 1·oom. The results are effective. 
Strict, sensible conditioning of good mate­rial, expert field generalship, inst!intly' formed interference behind perfectly timed plays, con­stant maintenance of a triple threat, and, not the least important-two lumps of sugar be·­tween halves-seem to be the components of the Rockne mystic poti~n for gridiron pre­eminence.

HUSKERS PLAN GREAT WELCOME FOR IRISH SQUAD 
LINCOLN, NEB.-The Nebraska student body, daily becoming more aroused in anticipation of the big football contest of the year, that with Notre Dame on Thanksgiving Day, is planning a monstrous rally for Knute Rockne and his Notre Dame footballers on the eve of the Turkey Day clash between the two schools. 
Rockne and his teams are favorites· with Nebraska students, who delight in giving a rousing welcome to the Indiana gridsters. They _ now are planning to make their 1925 reception outdo that of former years. 
The rally, which will start on the university campus, will gain momentum until it comes to a halt at the Lincoln hotel, the home of Rockne football men while they are in this city. A torchlight parade will be held and Notre Dame will be cheered as Nebraska will 
-r
be cheered. 
ROCKNE LIKES IRISH SHOWING­NOTRE DAME COACH NOT DOWN­CAST AFTER DEFEAT BY NEBRASKA 
Coach Knute Rockne of Notre Dame,·here yesterday for· the Loyola-Haskell game, wasn't a bit do'\vncast over the result of the meeting between .the Fighting Irish and Nebraska on Thanksgiving Day. 
"The boys were pepless," he said. "I guess they were tired after the strenuous season they had been through. _ "We did pretty well this year, though, when you stop to consider .that we played. through a hard schedule without a punter or a passer." 
SOUTH BEND, Incl.-Northwestern's wild­est troupe of Wildcats will collide with the Rockne troops of Notre Dame at Cartier Field tomorrow in what promises to be the most brilliant western football game of the season. 
The greatest throng that ever assembled within the portals ·of the ·historic playground of the.

B,lJ 'VAnnEN ,V. BnowN 
Sporting Editor Chicago Iferald and Examiner, and proud father of Bill Brown, Notre Dame 194-8. 
'Vhat's_ this, a review of 1the _football season? 
Take a large gob o-f mud, a· dash of rain, sprinkle with snow, garnish with fumbles, and season with upsets. pse well bef~re shaking. 
If General Sherman thought war was what he said it was, he should have covered the 1925 football season. 
Before taking up my reservation in the nearest daffy house, I'd try and run through some of the things that took place on the gridiron this fall, and endeavor to make better progress than a lot of the boys did in this, the Yea·r _of the Big :Mud. 
The best come-back any team showed, I think, was that of Notre Dame, which returned to glory after a dismal day against the Army. The season was largely an experimental one for Coach Rockne, and, as far ~s I know, he was still doing laboratory work with his backfield and his line in the final weeks of the season. Incidentally, neither you who read this, nor I· who write, will have a beard down to his knees before the day arrives when Rockne will take an­other Notre Dame team against Army and make Army wish that. the Cadets who licked the Irish 27 to 0 had never been born. I :...m not given to making football predictions. But this one, I trust, will be excused, all things considered. 
The qest line I saw all year, was :Michigan's; and the funniest-n~xt to Bugs Baer's which is All-American-was the one that Illinois sent against Nebraska. 
Incidentally, Coach Zuppke whipped that line of his into· shape in wonderful style, and wl1en it faced l\lichigan it was almost perfection. Against Pennsylvania, it was perfection. On that day, Illinois was the finest team in the United States. This statement will not draw cheers from the Dartmouth alumni, but it is an honest opinion, nevertheless. 
Thebest end I saw all season was Benny Oosterbaan, of l\Iichigan. There wasn't a yard 
made around his end all year, and his catching of f~rward passes was marvelous..He made 
some impossible g_rabs of tosses from Benny Friedman, and he must have set a season's rec­
ord for intercepting passes from the enemy. 
The best line plungers I saw were "Five Yards.. :McCarty of Chicago, and "Battering 
Bo.. Molenda, of Michigan. 
·Ed 'Veir of Nebraska continued to be all that I craved in a tackle, though Tom Edwards 
!lf l\Iichigan, in the one game I saw him play, against Ohio was a pip. 
The biggest disappointment to me was Chicago's defeat by Penn. It didn't seem possible, 
and after the Illinois game, I was more at a loss, than ever to lmderstand how Chicago lost. 
The most sensational performance, of COllrS e, was that of "Red.. Grange against Penn. 
When he took Penn in hand, he wrote football history the east will never forget. 
So much for that part of the review. Now for the more important statistics. , 
The game that put most snow down the back of my neck, and froze my toes most, was Illi­
nois vs. Penn. · 
The rainiest day was Illinois and Chicago. The muddiest was l\Iichiga~ and Northwest­
ern, with Illinois and Chicago, Chicago and Penn, and Illinois and Penn tied for second place. 
x-The happiest day was the day after Th-anksgiving. · 

x-Any renders who want to. know why may reach me at the Chicago Herald and Examiner. But iC I happen to be out or the office when you write, or. call, the nnsw.er is: Because that's all there is, there is no more. 
Deo gratias, as we Latin scholars or St. Ignatius University, San Francisco, are wont to say, as we learn that the wrestling match betw.een Strangler Ed Lewis, and Oscar Vladivostock Pumper­schmaaltz, the Bolivian champion, has been called off on account or perspiration. 
It wasn't the heat, this football season. It was the bromidity.

Chicago, Ill., Dec.____ 1925. 
1V1R. KNuTE RocKNE, 
Notre Dmne Unive;:sity, 
South Bend, Ind. 
DEAR RocK: 
No doubt you are now figuring out a schedule for yo\.1r 1.926 football team and will appreciate some help and suggestions. It has been my belief that in the past your team has been too much at home and in that way the players have had their minds taken off of football because of the interrup­tion of class room work. I know when I was down there last .fall I noticed that all of your men were carrying books under their arn1s and rushing from one class to another during the day. Naturally they can not read text books and keep their minds on football at the san1e time so I have figured out a prospective schedule of eight games for next year that should eradicate this trouble. 
I would suggest that you open the season in early October with some easy game, say a contest at home against Mr. Yost's Michigan eleven. That 
. will give the students a chance to see what·you have. The following week, you might have a game booked at Palo Alto, Cal., against Leland Stanford and that would just top your team off f01~ the annual game against the Army the next week in New York. 
For your fourth game, you might take the boys out to Berkley, Cal. for a soft game against the University of California and then for the fifth con­test, I should like to see you stack up agaipst that University of Alabama outfit which raised so much Ned this year. After you had given them a les­son in the game, your team would be well· primed for a coi1test against the University of \Vashington at Seattle. From there, I would suggest you take your gang to Hanover, N. H. and tackle that champion Dartmouth aggre­gation. I would just like to see if they can shoot those p~sses agaii1st your boys. · 
After that combat is over, you should bring the fellows back to Notre Dame for the final and homecoming game and perhaps it should be against some easy team, say like Nebraska. In myopii1ion, such a schedule not only would keep your players thinking of little else but football, but it would enable all of the experts to get a good line on the relative merits of eastern, far-western, southern and mid-western football. 
Respectfully yours, . J at;nes Crusinberry 
P. S.-Say Rock, you can see that by winning all the games of such a sched-·· ule, your team would in all probability be in afair way to clain1 some kind of a champions.hip. ··

The Reserves 
\Vhen the last lingering echo of the punt­er's spank against the pigskin has been wafted away, the curfew gun has cracked, the crowd gives one .last cheer for. the victors. There's praise for the satillites, for the men who played· the opposition on that field that Saturday; but never do we stop to think of the men who keep those stars in shape; those who slave that others may perform; the men who "play the game" every other day of the week so that the more favored may be victorious. These men are the Reserves~ 
Night after night until the darkness has cast it's long fingerlike shadows from the church steeple over toward the east these men are working out, taking the hardest knocks; learning; fighting. ·when the cleated shoes clank, clank, over the wooden floor toward the showers there are bruised bodies; evidence of their faithfullness, slaving that when their school calls them they may be ready. This is the material from which wonder teams are molded. This is the championship stuff; these are the men. 
The Reserves inagurated their season by travelling to Albion and handing the collegians there the short end of a 40 to 20 tally. East Chicago presented their next opposition but the Reserves blanked them and when the dust of 
·the. battle was cleared away the score boards read: Reserves 18, East Chicago 0. Straight football won the game easily for the reserves when they faced the Kokomo American Legion team and turned the State Pro Champs home­ward with a 13 to 7 count. The next tangle was way down south in D~xie. The Reserves ac­companied the Varsity t~ A~lanta and th~n penetrated two hundred miles mto the Geor~Ia hinterland to meet the strong Camp Benmng aggregation. This jaunt was longer than most conference teams have ever taken and the squad reported a great time. Smythe, a form~r All-American and several ex-Army stars flashed as the Soldiers downed the Blue and Gold 27 
to 6. -It was all that St. Ambrose College could manage to do when it nosed out the Irish at Davenport by a 16 to 14 pointage. 
The roll call of the stars of this year's re­serve outfit gives promise of a wealth of first­rate material for next years varsity squad. From reserves-to rotogravures is the path that most of these men will follow. Just between ourselves you can watch for these to perform in peerless fashion next fall. At the wing posi­tions "Dog" White, Dan Moore, Tom Byrne and Frank Keefe will be up among the best. McAdams Graf, and Joe Reidy turned in about / the best 'account at tackle. In the guard's shoes it's hard to beat George Leppigg, Harry Ryan or Kelly. At the pivot post Big Frank McCarthy has the call over the field and much can be expected of this huge Irish­man as September rolls into sight. Hieing back into the ball-carriers territory we find a ple­thora of material. Probably Joe Morrissy will look best in the signal calling_ job although McDermott runs a close second. Halfbacks are always important and we'd pick Chevigney and Ed ·walsh as the best in this post..Both should be good for a great season. Fred Collins is the boy that is expected to "go up" fast next fall. There will be a need for a first class fullback and it is doped that this white head is the man for the.post. We should also give Eddie Collins mention. Eddie played a great game of foot­ball but was injured at the start of the season. However, he is looked upon as one of the best bets for the 1926 team. These are the men that 
should go up with the big guns next se~son with a capital G. There are a great many more stars in the Reserve ranks. It has been especial­ly hard to make these predictions because of the wealth of a class A material. Every man of the Reserves deserves a world of credit. As a team they have had a very successful season. 
·when passing out· credit don't forge't that these are the men.

Football Review of 1925 

Freshman Football 
A WEALTH oF MATERIAL for next year's. varsity will be gained from. this year's Freshman squad. Under the able tutelage of George Keogan and \Vilbur Eaton, the coaches, these men scrimmage the varsity day in and d~y out, and all they get for their pains is liniment. Each week they are assign.ed the· task of changing their style of attack and defense to conform with the· opponent next listed on the varsity schedule. Signals are always temporary, and ·it takes a smart lot of boys to perform in a manner that will afford opposition and practice for the strong varsity regulars. These fellows are unappreciated, yet the condition and keen diagnosing of the opponents' teams by the varsity is due to them. 
True, a few trips sen·e to lift the burden and repay in a sm·all way for. their efforts, sacri­fices, and trials, but they suffer untold hardships in the way of carrying injuries throughout the season because of inattention; and with everyone a newcomer, fighting against the man at his side for a glance or word of approval from Rockne. The lo-t of the freshmen is . a hard one, but they grin and. bear it and in their sophomore year 'they look back upon their fresh­man football days and smile. There were almost two hundred freshmen who answered the first call for candidates and although most of these men· were cut before the end of the season there were many who stayed and who acquitted. themselves nobly. 
I 
. r
They were out on Cartier field every day and learning something new all the time. First it was practicing the Army plays, then the famous :Minnesota shift, then the Georgia Tech hop and so on .until the varsity had a good idea of how these plays worked. 
\Vhen one looks at the freshmen football record and sees one game won and three lost, they will say that the freshmen must be a pretty poor bunch this year. But such is not the case. The freshmen are so. busy learning and unlearning the different modes of attack that they have no time to. perfect an attack of their own and thus must face other teams with only . a defense to rely on. The freshmen lost to the powerful Lake Forest Acadeniy football team . 6-0, but one glance at· Lake Forest's record will tell that they were the best Prep football team in the country. Lake Forest defeated the best Princeton team in Princeton history· 13-0 so Notre Dame showed great strength and pro mise in holding them to a 6-0 score. On the next day an entirely different team went down to defeat before the· strong Kalamazoo Col-. lege team, one of the best of the small college teams in :Michigan. The squad won their first victory over Valparaiso College 19-0 and showed wonderful spirit and form to defeat this strong team. In 192•1 Valparaiso had held the great Centre College team to a 0-0 score. The freshme.n showed wonderful promise in this game and in Cohick, a splendid end, :Miller, a fine taclile, Reilly, a fast .halfback, :Monahan, a center, and J anecki, fullback, unearthed some future 'varsity material. 
The final game of the season was lost to the strong Kokomo team by a 13-9 score. The freshmen showed some splendid playing in this game and only for some bad breaks would have emerged with a victory. The Kokomo team was composed of former college stars, and i they marvelled at the strength ·of the freshmen team. So we see the freshmen season, accord­-1 ing to a percentage·rating, wasn't so good, but on the basis of experience it w~s a complete i success. The team received much valuable coaching and also a touch of the famous Rockne .l

Some of the men who showed up bett~r than the average during the season were 9olrick, Vesey, Snell, l\Iurphy, \Veibel and Duperier, ends; l\Hller, Cameron,.

,. The 1925 freshmen football season is over and the world is none the wiser but there were 
i 
many good men and before some of them leave Old Notre Dame their marks will have

Football Revie·w of 1925 
Notre Dame's Football History 
Notre Dame started football in 1887, when they played Michigan· in the only game of the year.. Michigan was victorious, 8-0. In 1888 Notre Dame played three games, losing two and win­ning the other. Michigan again repeated by a score of 26-6. In the next three years Notre Dame was undefeated, and since have been on the top or near the top of the football world. From 1894 to 1902 Notre Dame had fair teams, but in 1903 Red Salmon blossomed out with an undefeated year, and since then the Irish have had eight undefeated seasons. The 1909 team is famous in Notre Dame history and is known as' the Michigan goal post team because of the traditional playing of "Red" Miller and Pete Vaughn. The team of '13, captained by Rockne, and with Dorais as quarterback, started that string of amazing· victories over the Army, and first brought Notre Dame to the attention of Ea.stern fans. That uncanny forward passing comqination of Dorais to Rockne literally stood the army on their heads, and resulted in a 35-13 victory. · This game is regarded as the greatest upset that ever occurred in the East, and showed the potentialites of the forward pass as an offensive weapon. In 1914 the team lost to both Army and Yale, but in 1915 the Army again tasted defeat by a score of 7-0. In 1917 K. K. Rockne· appeared as coach and George Gipp began his· fa­mous career. The next four years, with these two as mainstays, established a great record in the gridiron sport. Gipp's great playing against the army and Nebraska in 1920 established him as one equal to Heston, Thorpe, and other All-Time All-Americans. In 1921 Notre Dame had a wonde1:ful team, but lost an early-season game to Iowa, 10-7 in a great battle, then proceeded thru the rest of of the season undefeated with one of the great­est lines ever on one team. Since 1921 Notre Dame has been blessed with good· material and in the hands of the capable master, Rockne, proved to be· consistently one of the best i~ the country, their greatest achievement being reached in 1924, when the far-famed "Four Horsemen" garnered glory and a national cha :npiom:hip, a rare distinction in these days of startling upsets, and muddy fields.

[lootball Review of.1925 
Rock's Greatest-Team 
·wherever Notre Dame fans gather and whenever Notre 'Dame students talk football, the question as to which of .Rock's teams was the best is asked. The 1919-20 eleven of Gipp's, Ed­die Anderson's outfit in 21 and ·walsh's National Champs of .'24 are Rock's outstanding teams. The teams of '17 and '18 were good but football in these years was not of the quality of foot­ball played after the war. The '22 and '23 teams were good but were only stepping stones to the 1924 outfit. Let us look over the records of the '19, '20, '21 and '24 teams. The 1919 team led by the immortal Gipp, swept through undefeated, crushing Nebraska, Army, Purdue and Indiana on the way to an undefeated season. The 1920 team also led by the immortal Gipp crushedNebras­ka, Army, Purdue, Indiana and Northwestern for a second straight undefeated season. Gipp's performance at the Army when N~ D. won 27-17 was wonderful. The Notre Dame team of these two years was built around Gipp and were more of a one-man team than any of Rock's outfits before or since. However we can safely .say that the 1919-20 team produced Rock's and Notre Dames greatest individual star with all due respect to "Red" Salmon, "Red" Miller, Eicken­laub, Rockne, Layden, 'Valsh and others too numerous to mention. 
The 1921 team composed of a line that included Kiley, Hunk and Eddie Anderson, Ed. Garvey, .Buck Shaw, Dooley, Larson and Merhe and a hackfield of "Chet" Wynne, Mohardt, Castner and 
Grant swept aside .all opposition except Iowa and despite its one defeat was generally recog­
nized by critics as the best football team in America; Purdue, Nebraska, Army, Rutgers, In­
diana, Haskell and Marquette were included in their victims. A great Nebraska team fell 7-0 and 
inside of four days Army and Rutgers fell by 28-0 and 48-0 score respectively. The critics in 
the. east were amazed by the play of the Notre Dame line and Kiley, Ed and Hunk Anqerson and 
Buck Shaw were picked on practically all the all-star teams. Kiley and Anderson were heralded 
as the greatest pair of ends eve·r gathered together on one team, and Buck Shaw and Hunk An­
derson were granted to be great linemen. 
Fans are still trying to explain the Iowa defeat, but in this game Notre Dame gained five yards to Iowa's 2 and were right on Iowa's goal line when the game ended. The line this year was considered as Notre Dame's greatest line, a1nd Nebraska· and Army will sadly second this motion. The East hasn't recovered ·from the shock yet, of seeing Army and Rutgers trimmed in such a short time and in such a decisive way. The Army lost 28-0 and the periods we're cut to ten minutes each. 
The record of the 1924 team is too fresh in our minds to need recounting here and it is enough to say that they swept the country from 'end to end and there ,\>as nary a team to say them nay. From the Atlantic to the Pacific, from the Northwest to the sunny south, the seven mules and four hoursemen smashed everything before them and climbed to the undisputed title of national champions.· 
. The Notre Dame backfield of Crowley, Miller, Layden and · Stuhldreher was unsurpassed in all football history and their deeds will live forever in the hearts of Notre Dame men. Grant­land Rice 'famous words "The Four Horsemen"·aptly described this quartet and they will be. for­ever known as the four horsemen. How we would like to see the four horsemen ride· again. In describing the Army game of '24 Rice starts off with "Outlined against a blue, gray October sky the four horsemen rode again." What would we do if we could see them ride again? The 1924 team had Notre Dame's best backfield, so take your pick, folks. Would you pick the 1919­20 team with the immortal Gipp, the '21 team with its wonderful line or the '24 national cham­pions with its incomparable "four horsemen"•. 
Ever since football started there has been one continuous debate as to whether a backfield, a line or a star makes a team. As far as Notre Dame is concerned the debate is a tie. Rockne has had a wonder ·team with one superman on it,a marvelous team with an all-star .line and a national championship team with the immortal pions 'vith its incomparable "four horsemen"? 
In the near future Rockne will probably turn out a team combining all these three essentials and then, I'll leave it to the reader's imagination. . 
The 1925 team can't be considered in a class with the aforementioned teams but the 1926 team has a splendid chance ·to be classed with "Rock's" greatest teams and may be. "Rock's" greatest, greatest team. ·Practically the entire team will be back intact and we may see an­other championship team. Clem Crowe, John ·wallace John McMullen, Rex Enright, Hanousek and Lew Cody will be the only monogram players to be lost by graduation and there remains 
20. letter men returning to be moulded by "Rock" to offer opposition for the Army, Indiana, Penn State, Southern California, Minnesota and Northwestern.

Football Re·view of 1925 
The Boy. Wh_o Held the Reins 
Halfbacks sweep around ends to glory; full­backs crash through human walls to the same goal and student managers toil and rest not till the final curtain is rung down-and then these boys take the final curtain down and pack 

· it away in moth balls, with the other tons of equipment, for the next year. 
John J. Ryan, of Ro­chester, Ind., a Senior in the College of Commerce and Student manager of Football for the season of 
· 1925 has just wound up his end of Notre Dame's latest ten games. And that task was no small one. l)uring this last sea­son, John and his corps· of assistants have handled one of the most strenuous . campaigns that a Rockne squad ever went through. And he handled it well, due mainly to his fine sense of organization and an uncanny eye for de­tail. The comfort and safety of the thousands 
who saw the games played on Cartier Field can be traced back to John. He safely led the Gold and Blue's warriors over some eight thousands of miles, and into foreign territory, where they 
·enjoyed all of the comforts and cheerfulness of home. John is to blame for that too. 
Few people realize just what ·a lad has to show to become the "right-hand-man of Knute Rockne." And just as few are capable of real­izing how few lads have that necessary punch and initative in them to land the job in ques­tion. For the last few years Rockne has had much older men as· his Student. Manager of Football, and in all fairness it must be said that Ryan has come ·up to the standards set by such men as Eddie Lennon, Jim Swift, and Leo 
'-..._. Sutliffe. Ryan was assisted by "Chuck" Mooney, of Cleveland, "Bill" Reid of Brooklyn and "Andy'' Sleigh of Weston, West Va. Ticket sales at games, ushers, traffic, police, ticket-taking, su­pervision of daily practice, . and a hundred other duties were divided among these men; each being responsible for his own end of the job to Ryan. A student manager takes a lot of abuse from everybody in general but to those on the· inside he is as indispensible as the pigskin oval that bears the name of the game. Somebody has to take care of the little things. Doff your hats then to John Ryan, and pat him on the back the first time you see him and tell .him just as you would say to McManmon. as he runs from the field after one of his customary brilliant performances-say to Ryan: "Nice goin' Johnnie". 
The Cheer ·Leaders 
I: ! ~ 
One of the most notable. advances made 
during the past football season was the re­
markable improvement of the cheering section. 
Led by Cheer Leader Abrott, of Berkeley, 
California, and his assistants, Gilmore Salmon 
and Bob Manix, this year's rooting section 
proved a distinct·success. 
Notre Dame has long needed concentrated 
cheering and this year an excellent step was 
made in this direction. A few new cheers, in­
troduced at the beginning of .the year were 
executed so successfully that Abrott has prom­
ised that a few more will be tried during the 
basketball season. 
The fifty thousand spectators who witnessed 
the Notre Dame-Minnesota game were treated 
to a rare spectacle when five hundred .Notre 
Dame students silenced a much larger Minne­
mta rooting section, expounding their various 
cheers so snappily that they_ drew a great hand 
from the huge throng in the stadium. In the 
history of the .§chool there has probably never 
been a demonstration so successful as ·the re­
ception given to the Carnegie Tech team before 
our Homecoming game, and will not be readily 
forgotten by those who were present. The 
Scotchmen carried home with them the memory 
of a real Notre Dame welcome, made possible 
by the spirit for which our school is famou.s. 
The welcome accorded the returning· war­
riors from the Army game was probably proof 
of the way in which Notre Dame backs her 
teams-win or lose they are always behind them to a man, even tho' one has to rise at . 5:30 a. m. to prove it. In the darkest moments of the Northwestern game it was the fine spirit displayed by the· student body that aided, along with Rockne and "Cap" Edwards, to bolster up the com'age of the team. fighting against a ten point lead, and led to the greatest victory ever 
achieved on Cartier field.

Football Review of 1925 
·I lJIMMY POWERS 
~------------------·----------------------------------~ 
Jimmy Powers lived.· He died a death which was the first of its kind that ever occured at Notre Dame. His death came as a result of a broken neck which was suffered unto him when he tackled one of the varsity players during scrimmage. 
The fatal accident, itself, on Cartier Field, was a peculiar one in that it was the first of its nature to happen; but his death at the Saint Joseph Hospital was not peculiar. He died exemplifying the ties of homage and adoration that he bore towards this institution and Her, Our Lady.. Not once, during the time that he was there, did he un­loose that tie! · 
The affects of Jimmy. Power's ·struggling and the result of his passing will set an example for the years that will follow ..He made a sacrifice whence he strove to better himself, and did what he thought was his duty to the football squad. No one could ask or portray more; and there was no notoriety coming out of the splash of printers' ink attached to his deeds, for the latter were written in the Book of God, with a clear and true and simple hand as representing the most per­fect love of a student toward his Alma Mater. 
In words from his own h_eart, Jimmy Powers penned: "It is need­less to say that my college life will be still more difficult; and when my course at Notre Dame is completed, I expect to be a man more developed--mentally, morally, and physically". That was the trend of Jip1my Power's thoughts. He died after only a short time here; 
. but while here he interpreted the mental, moral and physical charac­teristics of a developed Notre Dame man. His deeds will always serve as an inspiration to these who remember his struggle. 
Jimmy Powers was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Powers, of Chicago, Illinois. He. was educated in the parochial schools attached to the Saint Philip N~ri Church, at 72nd Street and Merrill Avenue. He first attended the Quigley Seminary, but later transferred and was graduated from the Mount Carmel High School, where he was; in­deed, popular with his classmates. He matriculated at Notre Dame, and made many friends here. Thence, he obeyed the beckoning hand of God. ·

Football Review of 19~5 
Spread of the Notre Dame System 
~ 
Perhaps nothing emphasizes more the greatness and sup~~iority of the Notre Dame sys­tem of football than the demand of schools and cqllege&> throughout the country for . -coaches who have had their training at ~ otre Dame. 
Nor has the success of tl{e Notre Dame method been confined to Notre Dame. Every 
team that has employed it has found it to work wonders. So much so tha~ the system 
lws been .adopted by many of the big elevens of the country. It is only natural, however, 
that such a successful method would win the respect of. other colleges. They realize,· 
too, that no better teachers of this particular system of football can be found than those 
·who have been taught by Rockne himself; hence the great demand from coast to coast for 
-coaches who. have played on Notre Dame elevens . 
. The Notre Dame system reached its highest point of perfection in the 1924· t~am when 
the National Championship title was annexed. A place on that varsity was a guarantee to· 
n coaching job. The team of 1924 made a Notre· Dame football monogram synonomous 
with a place on some coaching staff. The entire first team have joined the army of coaches 
produced at Notre Dame and gone forth to spread the systr:m that has wrought wonders 
·wherever it has been used. 
Here follows the personnel of that great army which, with perhaps a few exceptions, r.epresents the complete list of coaches Notre Dame has given to the football world:

Football Review of 1925 
Football. in the Various Sections of the Countty 
East 
In 1924 Dartmouth and Yale were the lead­ers in eastern football; 1925 finds Darmouth · still at the head of the list while Yale has fallen from her throne. Dartmouth, led by the fiery Oberlander, and ably seconded by Tully, .Lane, Parker and Diehl, swept to an undisputed east­ern championship. No team could stop the fa­mous passing attack of Oberlander and Tully; and Lane's running placed him as one of the outstanding half-backs of the season. 
Pittsburgh and '\Vest Virginia were except­ionally strong and Chase of Pitt and Mahari of West Virginia were two of the ranking linemen of the country. Princeton, Colgate, and Lafay­ette experienced successful seasons with one loss and one tie each. Princeton garnered the Big Three title, Lafayette defeated Lehigh and Pittsburgh, while Colgate forced Princeton and Syracuse to bite the dust, mainly through the · efforts of_the great Tryon. Fordham had one of her best teams, and Georgetown has but Buck­nell's victory over her to mar a good record. 
In. general,-the game continued at the high standard set by former years-guards, tackles, and halves .were plentiful, but good quarter­backs_ and .ends were lacking. · 
South Alabama · held undisputed championship glory in_1~24, but this season was forced to share the 'honors with Tulane. With a strong defensive. lfne, and Brown and Hubert in the back~eld,: Alabama survived the hectic season without a blemish; whereas Tulane was tied once with Missouri, the champs of the Missouri Valley. Tulane was a well balanced team and had a .greater backfield than any other in the south~ but defensively she was not as strong · as her rival, Alabama. ._ Georgia Tech, Georgia, Tennessee, and Vanderbilt were erratic performers-one week. they would flash ·great football, and the fol­lowing week would play like high school boys. Of the four Tennessee probably. had the strong­est team with Dodson, a half-back, and Lowe, an end, ranking with the best. Virginia, Washington and Lee, and North Carolina had powerful teams, and they show a better record than Vanderbilt or Georgia, but they did not play as high cali~red teams. 
West Michigan probably had the strongest team in the Mid-'\Vest, but don't tell it to a North­western student. The Michigan line was prob­ably the strongest in the country, and with an exceptional quarterback succeeded in trouncing every team except North\vestern. The forward passing combination of Oberlander to Tully of Dartmouth was duplicated on the Michigan squad with Friedman to Oosterbaan. Second in ranking must be accorded Missouri who were the Missouri Valley champions and were un­defeated until their last game when Kansas did the trick. Notre Dame's loss to Nebraska mars 
her otherwise spotless western record· ~and should be given third consideration, with Illi­nois, ·wisconsin, Northwestern, Nebraska, and Drake claiming attention because ..of· causing some startling upsets, as Michigan, Notre Dame, Chicago, and others can-testify. An1es, Kansas Aggies, and Minnesota turned in good accounts of their games this fall, and Minne­sota will be heard from in the next two years, as most of her men were Sophomores this year. 
Grange was, obviously the outstanding man _ of the west, but in Marek, Kutsch, Molenda, Flanagan, ·wilcox, Heardon and Joesting. all remaining for another season he will find a successor. 
Due to the muddy season and hard·. sche­dules not a single team in the .mid-west has a perfect record, but the standard was every bit as high as in former times, and the forward pass proved to be a factor in this· section as well as in the east. 
Far West 
After five years as leader of the Pacific Coast football, California finds itself supplant­ed, not by one team, but by two, and possibly three. Both '\Vashington, the undisputed cham­pions of the coast, and Stanford, ·with Glenn Warner as coach, rate ahead of California through victories over Andy Smith's men, and St. Mary's, although defeated by California has a better record and this is a team fast coming as one of the stronge-st of the coast. 
Washington had one .of the strongest teams in the country and with Wilson and E. Tesreau had the two best defensive backs in the game. Wilson was unstoppable with his running and passing, and rates with any halfback in the land. I 
Another All-American of the Pacific Coast is Ernie Nevers, captain and fullback of Stan­ford, whose plunging and playing stamps him as one of the greatest, as he alone is an out­standing player on the team that defeated California for the first time in 20 years, and is second only to Washington on the coast. 
St. Mary's had a powerful aggregation and lost only to California by a lone touchdown. In O'Rourke, an end~ and "Red" Strader the full­back, this team can look for positions on the All-American .teams. ·. 
California had no outstanding player~ who merit special consideration with the exception of Carey, the best guard in the country. 
Southern California~s poor showings . this 
year are unexplainable as they were conceded 
to be the stro'ngest team in pre-season dope. A 
new system instituted probably could not ac­
complish much in one year. 
Montana, 'vith one of the weakest .of.. coast 
teams; had the flashiest back in. Kelly_ their 
quarterback, who, according to Glenn' .warner, 
is one of the greatest quarters he has ever seen. 
Kelly did not fail to star in every game, and 
played against some of the best on the coast.
