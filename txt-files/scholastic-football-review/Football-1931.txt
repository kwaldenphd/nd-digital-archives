memory of KNUTE K~ _ROCKNE 

MEASURED beat I hear you1· tearns rnarch by, Dim ghosts of yesterday, whose wor]\ is done; And where young April's glow should llght the 
s~y 
'There is a shadow now across the sun. 0, spirit brighter than the flaming ship 'That d1·ove you downward on life's final trip. 
And now the curtain falls. Yes, other teams · .Upon rententbered fields ·will hold their sway; But will they bring the sante for lasting dream.s 'To span the sunset of an older day? What master brush will. paint for weary eyes After a flante rode down the western sl{ies?

®HEPAS'T season lias been characterized by the wonderful spirit of the players, their in.. te1·est in their wor1{, and their willingness to help one another. 'They were always on tin1-e fo1· prac.. tice, there .was no ill.. will because a man was de.. mated from the first team to the second or third teant. Everyone apparently was glad when a sec.. ond or thi1·d team man was good enough to come up and beat a first teant man out of his job. A great deal of this was due to ou·r Senior Coach, "Hun1(' Anderson, who has the same re.. ­sponsibilities as the head coach at other schools~ Never have I seen a squad li~e and respect a coach ntore than the 1931 team. did Anderson. And he was fortunate in having the assista1tce .of Junior -Coach Jad{ Chevigny, End Coach I1{e Voedisch~ and Center Coach John F1·ederic~. Our relations with all our opponents were de.-· lightful and not once has a visiting coach or teant ·had anything but praise for our men on .the teant and for the treatntent received at Notre Dame. 'This was due largely to the wo1·~ of o~tr efficient grottp of student managers, headed.· by John Grants, who was assisted by Joe E. McKean and Charles Weiss. 'They played their part in the success of the football teant and also .in-the enter.. tain1nent ·of visiting tednts. We can say truthfully that our treatntent from and associations with all of inn·. opponents wl1ont we played on their own fields was all t1ui.t we could. asl{. -}ESSE C. HARPER.

~O'TRE DAME has just passed through · one of the hardest athletic seasons in. its history, but the CO"Operation of everyone con.. cerned made it a successful one. I want first of all to than~ the players for the great spirit and willingness they showed both. in practice and in games. ·_'They were always prompt at practice and never questioned .anything the coaches had to tell them. In games they fought theit hearts out wee~ after wee1{ li~e true sons of Notre Dame. 
'The university administration and the athletic 
_board has co.. operated at all /times with the coaches to ma~e things as easy as possible. Much credit for the season should go, too, to the other coaches who were of great help to me and who wor~ed untiringly. with nte. A word of thanl{s to the. student managers for their great efficiency and 
wor~. 
Finally, I want to thanh, the students, faculty, alu~ni, fans, and our opponents for the way they. received me in my first year as coach. I felt that 
.·I-'had the support of all Notre Dante supporters · ~~ all times and our re_lations with ou1· ·opponents we~e of the finest.

6't[}-AM GLAD of this opportunity to than~ the members of the 1931 team for their confidence in me in ma~ing me captain, and for the wonderful spirit of co,operation they showed. In the na·me of the team, I want to than~ . "Hun~" Anderson and the other c~aches for the lessons they taught us and for the way they gave themselves up to wor~ for the success of the team. The students showed their true manhood by standing behind the team, win or lose, every day of the year,-and the football men want me to than~ them for this support. Our defeat was the real test of their loyalty which had not been tested in the previous two years. And let me say that they too~ it li~e real Notre Dame me~. The best of luc~ to next year's team, and to the reserves, ai1d freshmen who helped the varsity --so greatly this year. .: _·THOMAS YARR.

.J 
OFFICIAL FooTBALL REVIEw-1931-UniversilJ) of Notre Dame 

Varsity Coaches 
JESSE C. HARPER 
Director of Athletics 
When Jesse Harper left Notre Dame in the spring of 1918 he thought he was through in an active way. with the university. He had spent five successful years as head coach of football, baseball, and basketball and he had· handled the athletic administration of the university commendably. , 
He had left young Knutc Rockne in charge of football and track. He looked around his little office for the last time and left for a ranch in Kansas. He :had turned out football teams that lost only five games in five years. His basketball and base· ball teams were not far behind. He had scheduled games in all sports in all sections of the country but the far west. 
He was content to look on at the rapid rise of his young pro· tege-his captain and star left end in 1913-now and then to 
advise him, always to take pride in the way his ·chosen successor was carrying on his work. 
Then last spring Knute Rockne crashed to his death and the situation was reversed. · Harper was the une man the university could turn to with confidence and ask to replace Rockne. He responded gladly, putting aside }lis duties as the president of the Live Stock Growers' association in Kansas. 
At Mr. Harper's request, let us say that he has had nothing to do with actual coaching-he has left this up to "Hunk" An· derson in football and to the other coaches of other sports. 
The university is glad to welcome Jesse Harper back to its fold. He has proved himself one of Notre Dame's greatest friends­may relations between him and the university in the future be as pleasant and as mutually satisfactory as in the past! 
HEARTLY W. (HUNK) ANDERSON 
Senior Football Coach · 
. "Rockne built for the future and his greatest heritage t<;> No· trc Dame was Coach 'Hunk' Anderson." These words, scanned in a newspaper last fall, tell more eloquently than. we can the story <;>f the successor to Rockne on the coaching field. 
One of Rockne's greatest lineman back in the days when the lamented Notre Dame leader was getting his first recognition, "Hunk" was content to move along in the background as Rockne's line coach for eight years. Once, in 1928, he left the university for two years and became head coach at St. Louis, Mo., university. But this was not to his liking and ~e returned in 1930 to mold the line of that year's national champions just as he had provided the Four Horsemen of 1924 with an ad· vance guard for their devastating rides. 
As a player, "Hunk" was quiet and modest. Asked to ad· dress a pep meeting, he blushed and muttered, 'Tll do the best we can." As an assistant coach, he was equally backward; that is, in everything but coaching. And now that he's the· head-man for Notre Dame, he's the same old "Hunker." Without know• ing it, he has inspired the men of the 1931 team to go out and fight as they fought for Rockne, to die if necessary. The boys on this team love Anderson-he talks their language, he shows them how to play buf doesn't ride them; he doesn't belie.ve much in pep talks and inspiration because his team is good enough to beat the average good team without artificial stimu· Ius. He's with the boys; they feel that they are close to him. 
His results? Six victories, a tic with the best team in the Western Conference under impossible.playing conditions and two • defeats to what were the best teams in the country the days they met Notre Dame-not bad for a starter, when you are playing. top·notch teams every Saturday of the year. 
"Hunk" will carry on for Rockne; he'll do it without any fire· works; he'11 do it thorough!y, and/you'll like him. He's that kind of a guy. 1 
JOHN E. CHEVIGNY 
Junior Coach 
Two plays sta~d out '·in. our mind among the greatest in foot· ball history. In one a green·jcrsied halfback is throwing himself bodily over a mass of struggling linemen and shouting, "There's one for the ·Gipper!" The other is this same player the fol· lowing week with his team behind him, 27 to 7, lunging furiously at a 200·pound fullback who is driving through a gaping hole in the beaten team's line. He hits this charging mas~ of muscle, grasps at his mud-covered. socks, and falls to the ground limp, exhausted. 
J 
In the first play, Jack Chevigny is leading Rockne's weakest but most courageous ·team-that of 19 28-to a 12 to 6 victory over a powerful Army team at New York. In .the second, this same Chevigny is showing himself to be as great in defeat as he :was in the previous week's victory when Carnegie Tech beat Notre Dame at Cartier Field. In both games, Chevigny played his heart out and came· back for more like the thoroughbred. 
Rockne liked him so well that in 19 29 he made him coach of his backfield. In ·three years, Chevigny has turned three all· American stars,. Carideo, Brill, and Schwartz;. Playing with the same three teams, Chevigny undoubtedly would have been all· American himself. This year, with characteristic thoroughness, he replaced all the lost backs of those two national championship campaigns of 1929 and 1930 and from nowhere: brought out a new set-or was it three sets?-of horsemen. · 
JOHN (IKE) VOEDISCH 
Assistant Coach 
It's hard to say anything· about "Ike" Voedisr.h because he DeVore, and if you can beat that combination of ends any• never says anything about himself. The quietest man on the where, we'll quit right here. "Ike" starred at end himself up to practice fie~d, he is equally quiet and likeable outside of coach· and including the 1927 season. He has been turning them out mg hours. This year he turned out Kosky, Host, Mahony and nearly as good as he was ever since. 
JOHN FREDERICK 
Center Coach 
Johnny Frederick got his first look at Notre Dame football as one of Notre Dame's greatest, although more or less unsung, center on the freshman squad m 1924 when the Four Horsemen varsity centers. This year he brought Tom Gorman and Ben used to condescend now and then to run through the frosh in Alexander along at a fast clip. They'll be varsity next year scrimmage. The next two years he played under all-American and we'll leave it up to you then whether or not Frederick knows 
Arthur (Bud) Boeringer. In 1927, he developed himself into his line play.

CAPT. TOMMY YARR 
Center All,American=!: 
Combining all the fire of a Dublin,born father and the stolidity of an Indian,blooded mother with the courage of both, Capt. Tommy Yarr proved himself· during the 1931 season worthy of a niche in the hall of fame reserved for Notre Dame football captains. 
After playing third string ball in 1929 and making a wild but not so costly pass against Northwestern that year, Tommy gathered him, self together and played the most brilliant defensive ball of any man on the squad the next y.ear when he went up to the varsity. 
As captain, he was given a chance to bring out his ability as a leader. Never did he rise to greater heights than in Notre Dame's two hardest games. When Northwestern held the Fighting Irish to 
. a scoreless tie in the mire of Soldier field, Tommy played perfect ball, despite the fact that his left hand was in cast, broken in practice that week, and a finger in his right hand was cut to the bone. Every pass he made was perfectly timed and placed-five of them were to Marchy Schwartz kicking from behind his own goal with a heavy wet ball and 75,000 pairs of eyes watching for him to slip. On defense he was equally brilliant. ' 
Against Southern California, in the heart,breaking last quarter when the mighty Trojan attack unleashed. itself, Tommy never lost heart and he didn't let his teammates lose their spirit. When South, ern California led Notre Dame, 16 to 14, with a minute to play, Tommy was still in there, giving everything he had, as he had been taught to give by great Notre Dame captains before him. 
They don't make men like Tommy every day. Let him know No, tre Dame apprec_iates hil)l and loves him. He woq't be forgotten as long as people meet to talk football and to reminisce. 
MARCHMONT SCHWARTZ 
Left Halfbacl{ All,Americant 
Class! This word, possibly not the best possible choice·, sums up better than any other we know, the most brilliant of many brilliant left halfbacks in Notre Dame history. When Rockne told his teams to "Be classy!,, he wanted them to be like Marchy Schwartz has been in his three years as a Notre Da~e player. 
He wanted them to do things well, to know from experience and hard work what they were trying to do, to fight like fury, in short, not _to "go out and die, but to go out and win!." And this, without show, ing a great deal of emotion, too much confidence, or a "hero complex." 
After going through the 1930 season as the man directly responsible for nearly all of Notre Dame's victories, Schwartz returned during the past season to rise to new heights. In every hard game, he came through like a master. He averaged five yards a trip against Northwestern and averaged 46 yards on his punts with a wet, heavy, slippery ball. 
His two passes to Melinkovich and Jaskwhich put the Pitt game away before the half; he ran 59 yards against Carnegie Tech to score; he aver, aged five yards against Southern California and kicked and passed like a demon all afternoon because there was no one to replace him; he ran 16 yards to s~ore . against Navy and then threw two passes for other touchdowns. 
He was named all, American unanimously and many writers called him the outstanding gridiron star of the year. He was the perfect football player in every game. He was just as perfect a gentleman on and off the field. 
Marchy is through with football now, although· he will return to Notre Dame next year to complete his Law course. He is another whose name· will go down in a brilliant history of Fighting Irish football men:

After one brilliant season, Kurth came back during 1931 to establish himself as the first all· American tackle in Notre D.ame history in a sys· tern that does not giye the tackle much chance to play in the open. Kurth was great enough, however, both in courage and ability, to per· form the ordinary duties perfectly and take on additional burdens. He played longer than any one else in the Northwestern game but 
never got credit because he wore a different jersey number the second 
half. He opposed Pitt against doctors' orders when injured because the second and third string men were not able to play; he spent three days of the next week on a hospital cot and was back the following Saturday. to carry on against Carnegie. ·Against Southern California, though, he was superb.

FRANK NORDY HOFFMANN 
Right Guard All·Americant 
This is probably the only publication in the country to spell Nordy Hoffmann's name with both "n's," but we asked him· and it's right. He's all German-with a spark of Irish picked up by association. 
Frank Merriwell came to Notre Dame in the fall of 1928 in the form of a robust blond lad of some 200 pounds, who measured something like six feet two inches in height.. He came under a different name but it was Frank Merriwell, all right. 
He hadn't played football at St. Martin's of Seattle but he liked to watch the game and went out as a freshman manager. When track season came along; he was told to toss the weight back to the shot-putters. He tossed it so far that Coach John Nicholson spotted him and measured him for a suit. He was pretty good-he was ru11:ner·up for the state championship the next year. As a track ·man, he met a lad named Marty Brill, a right halfback, who told him to try out for the team. 
He did; he made the third team at right ·tackle and came back the next . year to make the third team again under Joe Kurth and Art McManmon, who had got the juinp on him by playing in high school. 
Pressed for material, "Hunk" Anderson shifted him to right guard last fall and he rose to the heights of stardom, even getting considerable all· American mention as a real varsity player. 
Aggressive, fast, brainy, and fortitudinous, he played brilliant all-around ball in every game, although badly injured in the Southern California and Army contests. This wasn't revealed at the time because he could take no chances on receiving further injuries. 
Now he has finished his career, a shining example of what hard work will do, an inspiration to a host of not•so·good high school stars, and a hale fellow if there ever was one.

OFFICIAL FooTBALL REVIEW-1931-Vniversil.Y of Noire Dame 
ALVIN CULVER 
Left Tac~le 
Long perhaps after his name is forgotten-if-it is ever forgotten -people will talk about the big tackle at Notre Dame, who for almost three complete seasons wore the same old bent, short· rimmed, brown felt hat. 
It wasn't an ordinary hat. It was Big AI Culver's Victory Hat and he said, 'Tll wear it until we get bumped." No fault of Culver's-nor anyone else's on the Notre Dame team-was it that Notre Dame did "get bumped" in the last two games of its three greatest seasons. 
Known around the carppus as a quiet, philosophical sort of fellow who liked books more than anything else, Al was called in 1930 the most "under-rated player of the season." Not the fiery type who runs up and down the scrimmage line shouting and ex• horting his mates to greater efforts, he was just another lineman to most of the public. He couldn't even pose naturally for an action picture. 
He was content to do his job and let someone else be the _spark plug of the line. And he did his job. You don't play with a No­tre Dame team for two years under Rockne and another under "Hunk" Anderson unless you are doing your job .. Al could stop a power play, he could block a kick, break up a pass, block and tackle with the force of a ram-anything yoU: asked for, except make a hero of himself. 
Injuries last fall slowed him and for a while he lost his position to· another man. But with all his Scotch· Irish tenacity he hung in there, and by the end of the season was back up with the var· sity where he belonged. His loss to next year's team and to the campus will be sorely felt-and this is not just a pla_titude. 
GEORGE MELINKOVICH 
Fullbac~ 
Out of the West rode George Melinkovich one day in the fall of 1930. We were going to say he pulled up rein at Notre Dame, but in the interests of truth, we'll admit he stepped from a Pullman platform. He wasn't wearing chaps and spurs, but a neatly pressed suit of late mode with all the trimmings. He didn't carry his clothes wrapped in a bandana at the end of a stick, but had a few of them in a neat leather suitcase and the rest in his wardrobe trunk. 
In fact, he made a mighty good appearance for a far westerner, who for the benefit of our eastern trade is supposed to be far cruder than even the middle westerner. His frank eyes had a. friendly twinkle in them. This was deceiving to the Notre Dame national championship varsity of 19.30 because George immediately made good as a left halfback with the freshman team and he had no scru· ples when it came to running the champions ragged in scrimmage. 
Last spring, he was among the 300 candidates out for spring football. He was among ·them for a· while but in two weeks he was 'way ahead of them. With Schwartz and Koken back and with LaBorne, -Banas, and Lukats available at left half, it looked like George might never get a chance to strut the stuff which won him a Frank Hering medal for pass receiving and made him runner up for passing and blocking proficiency. Then the fullback jinx went into action and took Banas and Lukats, who had been shifted to that position. 
George was shifted over and in two weeks won his way to the varsity. Well that he did, for Banas was hurt the day George started with the regulars and he stayed in there until Banas was able to return three weeks later. Then he _got hurt in the Navy game, ending his 1930 career. He has two.. more years to go and we're asking you to paste this in your respective hats-here's all­American talent~ Can he smack a line! If you didn't notice last year, watch him in the next two seasons.

OFFICIAL FOOTBALL REVIEW-1931-Universit:y of N olre Dame 
EDWIN KOSKY 
Left End All·Western 
One distinction Ed Kosky will have held by the end of next 
season, barring injuries, famine, anc~ pestilence, will be that of 
playing varsity end for three consecutive years: He now has 
two to his credit and was ranked all·Western by nearly all the 
experts last fall. Another distinction to his credit will be that he is in that :ii great class of under-rated players. Much as we wish to avoid 
':.,,
any approach to an alibi for the Southern California game-for none is needed-if little Duke Millheam had been able to get 
' ;~ 
off that pass on the next to last play, Notre Dame would have 
...-l
been the victor. Kosky, if you were not there or at your radio, 
was a good 25' yards from the nearest Trojan at the time the· 
pass was due to sail-and .he never misses if they're in the same 
county. Kosky came into his own last year with the great line of 1930, 
called by experts the greatest in Notre Dame history with the 
possible exception of last fall's. He had dribbled around a sea· ,~v:-.~.r,~:s~ 
son with the reserves and was not looked upon with any great 
degree of hope for the future. He and Hunk Anderson got 
together, though, in the spring of 1930 and, with the capable 
tutelage of Ike Voedisch, end coach, .Ed's great potentialities 
began to be realized. Never a grandstand star, Kosky is typical of the Notre Dame lineman; cool, composed, and efficient. Watch him next year! 
CHARLES JASKWHICH 
~uarterbacl( 
Last year Charlie Jaskwhich, who made various plain and fancy records in high school, was groomed by none other than Knute Rockne as the successor to the great Frank Carideo. · 
Campus ""experts" .and down town coaches were of the opinion that for once Rockne had erred. After all, he was only human for all his genius. True eno.ugh, Jaskwhich came to Notre Dame after winning all-state honors in foot· ball and basketball and establishing a state pole vault mark which still stands at Kenosha, Wis., high. He had been captain in these three sports and was sup· posed to be, in the vernacular of the campus, ""quite the hot shot., 
But somehow, he seemed to lack tl~e stuff needed for college football. It wasn't courage, maybe it was confidence, it wasn't brains for he was and is an honor student, it inight have been experience. At any rate, he dropped a couple of punts and got off a bad kick,and when somebody didn't catch a. pass when he was supposed to, Jaskwhich was given credit for a bone-head play. 
Now, as you've guessed, it's all different. For a while a couple of other lads gave. Charlie a battle for his position. Then he put on steam and pulled away so fast it made them dizzy. He was established as a first string man in the Pitt game, the fourth· of the season, and never after was there any doubt as to his status. 
He handled his punts with the coolness of a movie star before a news camera; his own punts drilled down the field 5'0 and 60 yards at a crack, he would call his own number and then go out and snag a pass that made you strain away from your seat; he seldom missed a point after touchdown, and his kickoffs went sailing into the end zone more often than not. We'll take the coaches' word for it that his blocking was on a par with his more open play, and the way he took that club down the field for ""them touchdowns," as Roundy, the sage of Madison, would say it, vouched for his generalsh_ip. We like to remem· ber the Pitt game as the unfoldi1~g of a new success story. Next installment, 1932.

OFFICIAL FOOTBALL REVIEw-1931-Umversil.Y of Nolre Dame . 
JOSEPH SHEEKETSKI Right Halfbac~ ' 
For one man to replace three such bearcats as Marty Brill, "Bucky" O'Connor, and Clarence Kaplan all in one season and without batting an eyelash, is slightly breath-taking. But Joe Sheeketski, the guy Rockne was always asking to give a yowel to George. Vlk~ has just done it and without 
leaving any doubt that he has done it well. 
Joe played only a few minutes in 1930 against" Navy, Pitt, and Penn after Messrs. Carideo, Schwartz, Mullins, and Brill had seen that the game was safely on ice. Then he showed mai'nly as a snake-hipped open 
field runner. But the right halfback for Notre Dame is and must be a blocker. So Notre Dame was supposed to be weak there this year. 
We don't know much about a reverse body block, but one day last spring we watched Jack Chevigny, backfield coach, drilling a b~.mch of prospective backfield -greats. Sheeketski was the model and he was. showing about 50 other fellows the fine points of how the reverse body block should be exe­cuted. That was enough; if he was that good, we could go over and worry 
about the ends or so~ething. . . And if Joe can't block and tackle quite as destructively as Brill, it's be­cause he is not as heavy, but he can run faster. If he can't run as fast as O'Connor, he's trickier. And if he's not as slippery as Kaplan, he's a better blocker. In short, he combines the desirable traits of all. three. He scampered through a. surprised Indiana team in the opening game, 70 yards for a touchdown, the first of the season for Notre Dame. Thereafter he made several other point-scoring excursions over shorter distances. And we'll leave it up to Marchy Schwartz how far he would have gone at right end if Joe hadn't been in there driving out those ends. He played himself to exhaustion against U. S. C. arid then returned to· the lineup for more. Joe has another season in which to rise to still greater heights. 
RICHARD MAHONY 
Right End 
Like his colleague on this same page, Dick Mahony had lots of shoes to fill at the beginning of the past season. Capt. Tom Copley, all-Western star wingman, and George Vlk of the 1930 team were both gone when "Hunk" Anderson looked at the remnants of his 

squad not lost by graduation. 
A couple of his best freshman players were lost. A right guard did 
not return to school, Metzger was graduated, a right tackle got his 
diploma and three right halfbacks and fullbacks were gone. It looked 
like the whole right side of the Notre Dame team would be weak. 
The results of the season show that you can't go by what you read 
in the newspapers at the beginning of the season. Especially with 
men like Dick Mahony lying around ready to tackle any job-or 
any fullback of any size traveling at a given speed in any ball game. 
Dick is one of those care-free boys who likes to throw himself head­
long into a flying wedge on a kickoff, who labors under the impres­
sion that he is always in swimming and makes beautiful div~s into 
the areas of most concentrated action time after time. 
With utter disregard for the welfare of his neck, Mahony stepped · into Tom Conley's place, got rid of the responsibility with a shrug of his shoulders, and said, "When do we start the slaughter?" Lest you might think his only stock in trade is a fighting Irish spirit, a bloody eye, and a good physique, let us put you right. 
If you ever watched him break up a la:teral pass combination on which some poor coach stayed awake nights figuring, or if you ever saw an opposing back run for the sidelines when he saw his inter­ferers dive one by one at the twinkling Mahony feet and get left, you'll get the idea. Dick has everything it takes-and he uses every­thing he has. Right end is one position Coach "Hunker" won't worry about next year; we don't think he was worrying abut it last spring, either.

JAMES HARRIS 
Left Guard 
The main difference between ·lightni.ng and. Jim Harris is that lightning doesn't strike the same place twice, except in a few remote instances which have been covered by Mr. Ripley. 
He combines the finer qualities of a knife and a pile driver. How he gets those stumpy legs of his to work so fast, we can't tell you. How he gets those 185 pounds of bone· and muscle through two shoulder-to-shoulder opposing linemen, we can't understand, either. But he does it and does it fast enough more often than not to nail in his tracks the fleetest of halfbacks. 
Jim got his early training at Linsley Institute of Wheeling, 
W. Va., where he was captain, all-city, all-state and whatever else there was to be. His presence at Notre Dame is best accounted for perhaps by· the fact that his home is in Bellaire, Ohio, a No­tre Dame hotbed which produced 'Johnny Niemiec and "'Bull" Poliski of the 1927 team. Joe Sheeketski, from Shadyside, Ohio, two miles out of Bellaire, was also making good at Notre Dame with the freshmen when Jim finished his high school career. 
He and Norm Greeney of Cleveland-will someone please stop· us before the governc;:>r of Ohio presents us with something­fought it our last year with the shock troops under Tom Kassis. This year when Greeney was injured against Carnegie, the duel 



ended in .favor of Harris, at least for the season. There was nothing at that time to choose between them and we'll leave it to the coaches whether there is next year when both come back. 

EDWARD KRAUSE .Left 'Tac~1e After the Notre Dame-Southern California game last year at Los Angeles, sport critics who witnessed the fracas were loud in their praises of the Irish left tackle, AI Culver. This fall came, footballs were inflated, and another great season began. Before long Culver found himself with his hands full; and the .difficulty was not opposing linemen, but a young sophomore on his own team who persisted in ousting Al from his berth. That young gentleman was Ed Krause. Time after time his name, in place of Culyer's, appeared on the first string lineup. It seemed an inconceivable thing to those who the previous year had judged Culver the last word in tackles. But there was the incon­testable fact staring them in the face. "'What a man,, they said, "'this Krause must be!" What a man he is, to be· sure. He stands six feet three inches tall ·and weighs 21 0 pounds. He has the largest hands of any man on the team. He is a first-rate basketball player and handles the big oval like a baseball. On a practice field he can throw 60-and 70-yard forward passes with a football. Being a lineman, there is no likelihood of his being called on to demo~strate these prodigious heaves, but they are a sight to see. He and his teammate, 
George Kozac, stand with almost the length of a regulation field between them and loft those long passes to one another with the ease of small boys tossing pebbles. 
Krause was the man who recovered that blocked punt in the Northwestern game. Hoffmann had broken through to knock it down and Ed fell on it inside Northwestern's 20-yard line. That a muddy field and a stout Purple defense prevented a score was no fault of his. 
He and Culver have waged a nip and tuck battle for their position this year. But Culver has played his last game, and Ed should have undisputed first string rating next year.

OFFICIAL FOOTBALL REVIEW-1931-UniversilJ) of Nolre Dame 
PAUL HOST 
Left End 
Perfection can not be beaten, and 'Paul Host is perhaps the closest approach to perfection ever seen in a Notre Dame end. This is a big statement but it carries its own freight. 
Host has combined the ability of a natural athlete with the mind of an honor student and the spirit of a real warrior to make him­self outstanding as the most effortless player on the squad. In his two years of competition we have yet to see the tackle that could get to his body and drive him out of a running play. His feet move with the rapidity and lightness of a pianist's fingers. 
On offense, he is equally a threat to the opposition. He carried the ball three times on an end-around play this year and averaged 20 yards a trip-no back on the squad can approach this mark. Once, he caught a kickoff and returned 35 yards before he was forced out of bounds. He scored against Pittsburgh and Pennsyl­vania on goal line passes, short quick flips over the center of the line, neither of which seemed to be within reach. 
His greatest defensive performance was probably that against Southern California when he time and again threw back thrusts at his position when he was in relieving Kosky. On four distinct occasions, he piled up the interference on power rushes so that the ball carrier had no place to turn. On other plays, he was in there fast, sometimes stopping plays at the other side of the line before 
they could get started. On any team but Notre Dame's, he would be first string mate­rial. As it is, he alternates with Kosky and at the end of two years, it's not for us to say who is ahead. Both are back next year. 
EMMETT lv1URPHY 
~ttarterbac~ 
One of the greatest things said for the late Knute Rockne is that he, more than anyone else, developed the open game. As a player back in 19f1 to 1913 inclusive, he was short and light himself. He over· came his handicaps by working out a pass combination in which speed and agility triumphed over brawn and muscle. 
To his influence in thus opening up the game, such diminuative stars as Emmett Murphy owe much. Weighing only 153 pounds, Murphy, for all his strategy and courage, would have been laughed at had he gone out for the Notre Dame team of, for example, 1904 when ..The Mighty" Lou Salmon was establishing himself as one of the. game's greatest fullbacks. 
Now the axiom that a good big man is better than a good little man has . come into use. But Murphy is better thari about a dozen other bigger candidates for his post on the Notre Dame squad. \Vith both Murphy and Jaskwhich available, Coach ..Hunk" Anderson has a combination more satisfactory than any one man could possibly be. The answer is brains and coolness under fire. If one makes a slip, the other goes in and rectifies the error. 
You almost feel sorry for Murphy when he is back to catch a punt with a half dozen murderous linemen bearing down on him. We felt sorry for him at Pittsburgh under these conditions, until we saw what happened. With a Carnegie Tech lineman coming at him from each direction, pointing for the kill, it looked as if he would be annihilated on the spot. We shuddered and looked away. We looked back. He had sidestepped them and gone out of bounds. One was knocked out and the other was being carried away on a stretcher with a broken arm. 
So what? So write your own ticket. He'll be back again next year.

OFFICIAL FOOTBALL REVIEW-1931-Universit.Y of Nolre Dame 
.-BERNIE LEAHY 
Fullbacl{ 
After the annual Freshman-Varsity battle in the fall of 1929, the late Coach Rockne made the statement that he had discovered a great halfback in Bernie Leahy. Bernie's playing couldn't be surpassed that day. He excelled in every department of the game-passing, punting, backing up the line, and carrying the ball. He moved among the Frosh like an irresistible cyclone wreaking havoc. He was a "find.'' . 
In practice he continued to play sensational ball but when sent into a regular game, Bernie tightened up. He couldn't loosen up, couldn't relax. The responsi­bility of playing his position weighed disastrously upon him. His emotional mechan­ism was so keyed up, that he was stiff, taut and practically useless. : :All the psychology in the world did Bernie no good and he had to yield to other rtien. Fighting this emotional handicap, he went through last season playing steady ball, gaining .experience, and winning -a monogram. 
With this year came his big chance. He has made as fine a comeback as was ever staged. At the start of the season he was shifted from left to right half. Then the famous jinx assailed the fullback post. Lukats and Banas were out because of ·injuries. Leahy was shifted again. He began playing a smashing game at fullback, and no sign of his old trouble appeared. He was substituted regularly into games and has been a consistent ground-gainer. His best performances were against North­western and Carnegie Tech. In the rain and mud at Chicago he showed himself a great defensive back. Against Tech he scored two touchdowns. 
Bernie lives in Chicago. He is five feet 10 inches tall and weighs 175 pounds. He prepped at St. Mel's. His coach, Paddy Driscoll, said he believes him the great­est high school player he had ever seen. 


CARL CRONIN Right Halfbac~ Last year it was Carl Cronin, quarterback and monogram man-even with Carideo, Jaskwhich, Murphy, Christman, Vejrlr and some others after the job. Carl's lack of size, which is so obvious that they call him '"Stumpy," hasn't slowed him up a bit in gaining recognition with Notre Dame. He has an indomitable fighting spirit and it's hard to keep a good fighter I down. I; ,

f' >.! 
Cronin was shifted to right half because in his 165 pounds, com­
(
pressed into five feet seven inches of height, there is dynamite. When he blocks, they stay blocked. And those short legs of his can pump­
J even when some burly giant. of a tackle has him by the neck, they keep pumping and he goes around in a circle trying to get extra inches out of what is usually a substantial gain. 
Cronin started out the season with the third string gang which at the time of the Indiana game included Pivarnik, Leonard, Wunsch, LaBorne, Vejar and a few other Fighting Irish. Cronin was the best battler of them all, though. They tell, in more or less clandestine way, the not very nice story about how a certain all-American fullback became riled in the heat of scrimmage, after Cronin had cut him down with a bullet tackle, and called Stumpy a bad name. Stumpy, until then going about his business of being a football player, '"hung one on,, the 200-pounder and laid him out. When he came to, the managers helped him to the gym. He didn't say anything more to Cronin. 
To get back to the Indiana game, Carl went in with the third team and, after a 15-yard penalty, climaxed an 8 5 -yard touchdown march by sprinting 35 yards for.: a score. He made some other longer and shorter runs during the season and some other touchdowns. He shifted around from the third to second team off and on during the year. But he never quit fighting. ·

MIKE KOKEN 
Left Halfback.. 
Introducing-the 1932 varsity left halfba~k for Notre Dame, the·suc· cessor to Gipp, · Crowley, Flanagan, Niemiec, Elder, and Schwartz;. The lad who has played second string ball for two years and on many occasions out·Schwartz;ed Schwartz;. 
There's no one better you could ask for to succeed Marchy. Koken is one of the niftiest open field runners on the squad. He· doesn't run; he scoots, dodges, squirms, kicks for the extra inches when he's down, shows 'em his legs and takes 'em away like ··Rock, told him to. 
He.passes almost as well as Marchy and many of Notre Dame's touch· downs which he didn't make himself were brought about by his' passes last fall. He can punt with the best of them-55 and 60 yards con• sistently and well-placed. He can back up a line, cover on passes, and he can block. This gives you a fair idea of Mike's talents. . 
But he's not the type that does these things in practice· and then folds up in a game. He goes. into any game cold and starts off as if someone had released a spring. One of the many reasons given, from the Notre Dame side of the picture, why the Iri~h did not win over Southern California was the fact that Mike was in jured the week before and could not play. Schwartz; had to stick in there for 60 bruising, nerve-wracking minutes of play. Had Mike been able to go in at the end, fresh and rarin' to go, the Irish might have won. All credit, how· ever, to the Trojans. 
Here's your 1932 backfield: }ask which, Koken, Melinkovich, and Sheeketski. Try to stop them. 
GEORGE KOZAC 
Right 'Tack,.le 
It will be a great disappointment to many to learn that big George Kozak will not be eligible for football next year. Unfortunately ••Koz;y•• had played two· years of college football, before coming to Notre Dame, at Marshall college in Huntington, West Va. His home is in Cleveland, Ohio, and it was ,with Holy Name high there that he first started playirig football. He had always wanted to play on a Notre Dame football team, and finally made the break from Marshall and came on. He took a chance, did this big fellow, with only one year's eligibility, of ever making a Notre Dame te~m. But he thought he had the stuff, and soon was able to prove himself. 
Last spring at football practice, George and his running mate, Krause, were the surprise of the sessions. Apparently novices, fresh from the yearling team, they nevertheless seemed to take especial delight in smearing veteran tackles who had been regulars for two years. Carrying that same energy over into the fall, Kozak won a place as second string right tackle, Uf!der· studying Joe Kurth. 
Despite a bad knee that has been a considerable handicap to him all season, George has seen a great deal of action and has kept Notre Dame·s first string all· American tackle hustling to hold his position. · 
He is as strong offensively as defensively. He can knife his way through an opposing line to make tackle after tackle behind the line of scrimmage. On sweeps around end he crashes through, piles up the interference, and if he doesn't get the ball carrier, at least he leaves him unprotected. On offense he 

charges like a demon, and makes possible many a gain through his position. 
George is big and fast. He is 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 198 pounds. It is too bad that he will not be seen in action next year. He has given yeo· man service.

NORMAN GREENEY 
Left Guard 
Up until the Carnegie Tech ga~e Norm Greeney gave Jim Harris, his fellow Ohioan, a merry fight for the varsity job at left guard. They had battled it out in 1930 for the second string berth under Tom Kassis, sort of a lower berth. 
They had even that expert diagnostician of front line ailments and curer of all guard ills, ..Hunk" Anderson himself, puzzled. One week would see Norm with the varsity, the next week Harris was up there. But in the Carnegie Tech game, Ander, son's problem was solved,.· although not in a very satisfactory way. 
They carried Norm off the field that day with a torn ligament. The job went to Harris and Norm was more or less in the back, . ground; never, because of the uncertainty of who was first string, having received. his proper recognition anyhow. But Norm was back out for practice by Wednesday, not in uniform, but smiling . and waiting immediately for the injury to heal. He wasn't really right the rest of the season, but he played. ..Still faking,,, he 
. would say with a friendly grin as he limped about the field. But both he and his rival and pal, Harris, will be back next year for more dueling. Lest you misjudge Anderson, let me say that it was not his order that Greeney play and scrimmage when not in the best condition. It was N arm's own idea . ..That's what I like about coaching at Notre Dame," Anderson said one day while squatting on the sidelines as his boys rolled up an easy victory over a hitherto undefeated team. ..Look at them (the opposition) .. They fold up when you block them. They don't like it. They want ·to get out of there. At Notre Dame they all WANT to play." Norm Greeney, let it be said, is one of the strongest proofs to back up this statement. 
BILL PIERCE 
Right Guard 
When a lad comes all the way from Sherman, Tex., to play foot, ball at Notre Dame, he means business. That's what little Bill Pierce,· the only ..watch,charm" guard, strange to say, on the first three teams this year, did and means. 
He and Bob Terlaak played with the shock troops last year and got plenty of chance to watch little Bert Metzger in action. Ter, laak did not return to school so it looked like Bill was a cinch to play with the first string. But then, Nordy Hoffmann d_ecided he would have a better chance at guard than at tackle-and a good big man is still better than a good little man. 
You'll hear from Bill next year, though, unless Coach Anderson finds out he has another year to play and goes in there himself. There'll be no denying Bill next year. He's not quite as small as Metzger was-five feet seven inches the same as Bert but he weighs more, 185. He fights the same way. 
One of the tragedies of the Southern California game was the fact that Bill received a· broken right arm the week of the classic battle and when Hoffmann's bad knee gave out, Anderson had only Harry Wunsch, a more or less inexperienced sophomore left guard, who played remarkable ball, considering everything, to send in. 
Bill, by the way, is a buddy of Big Joe Kurth's and Joe in turn pals around with Dick Mahony. Reading from right guard to right end, you will have Pierce, Kurth, and Mahony in the 1932 Notre Dame line. Right!

OFFICIAL FooTBALL REVIEW-1931-Universil.Y of Notre Dame 
THOMAS GORMAN 
Center 
This is the man who in all likelihood will be first,stdng center next year.· Stepping into C~pt. Tommy Yarr's shoes' is a man,sized job; but ..Kitty, has been coming right along, perfecting himself· in pivot play, gaining valuable experience, and developing into a fit successor to this year's captain. 
. Gorman has. seen action in nearly every game. That he is a sure handler of the ball and an accurate passer was demonstrated by Coach Anderson's confidence in trusting a wet, muddy, and exceed· ingly slippery ball to him in the Northwestern game. · 
He is big, powerful, and fast. He can open up holes in the line, and on defense seems to be everywhere at once. He is quick to sense a pass, and has broken up many an aerial attack by his speed and alertness. In the Indiana game he intercepted a Hoosier pass I' and raced ,30 yards to a touchdown. That earned for him a new monicker. ..T. D.,, they call him now-··Touchdown, Gorman. 
Gorman is another who hails from the mid,western. metropolis. He made quite a reputation in high school playing ball with St. Phil· lip's, in the Chicago Catholic league. , 
Gorman weighs in at 187 pounds and stands six feet even. Com· petition for center on next year's team will be keen with Ben Alex• ·ander, John Rogers and others giving ••Kitty, a good race for the position. The Fighting Irishman will be ·right in there with the best of them, however, and a thrilling fight should result. 
HUGH DEVORE 
Right End 
_Almost unanimously the critics rise to aver that DeVore is the most vicious tackler on the squad; and as an afterthought add that he is one swell blocker, too. A hard tackler is noticed. There is a distinct thrill felt even by the witnesses of a sure and deadly tackle. Last year in the opening game with Southern Methodist, Joe Kurth made a meteoric rise to cinch a first string tackl~. berth. Outstanding in the great game he played that day was the smashing tackle he made of Mason, fleet ace of the Mustang backfield. The crash made as they came together was heard in the far corners of the Notre Dame stadium. That tackle was remembered and the story of it is oft,rep~ated. 
Then along_came Sophomore Hugh DeVore this year to attract atten, tion by the same method-savage, ruthless smearing. _He gives no quar, ter. After the Navy game sports writers who had attended agreed on one thing at least-that in all the football they had seen there had never been anything to compare with the fierceness of one of DeVore's tackles. 
Davis, the Navy quarterback, had gone back for a punt. He caught it, tucked it away and started forward. But he hadn't gone far when a green,jersied right end, charging like one of the Furies, met him head, on. The right end was DeYore and the ~rack of that impact still re, . sounds in the Baltimore stadium. 
His blocking is equally fatal. He turned in the neatest trick of the year in the Pittsburgh game, where on one play he made two blocks, cutting down three men. Pitt punted and DeYore blocked a tackle. Jaskwhich caught the punt and was chased by the Panthers. When the Notre Dame quarterback reversed his field, DeVore had tim~ to go back to give interference. Two Pitt men running one behind· the other were his objective. With a single hard reckless block he piled both of them out of the play and sent them flying. In the next two years Hugh should develop into one of the best wingmen ever seen on the campus.

_. ·znm 
STEPHEN BANAS 
Fullbac~ 
Mr. Injury Jinks, who travels around from one football camp to another every fall, dropped in at Notre Dame the week prior to the opening game for an extended stay. It e~tended to the Army game, the last of the year. 
Mr. Jinks went out for the team and showed all the tenacity so vital to success on the gridiron. He didn't quite make the team-there was a lit· tie too much competition. But he did make the fullback post, ·doing his best, of course, to break it. 
At first he was fresh and he blocked. Nick Lukats one day,· breaking an ankle and utterly ruining any chance Nick had of playing all fall. Steve Banas, the ultimate subject of this piece, had been playing ~econd team ball under Lukats, so he went up to the varsity. 
He lasted just three weeks when this hard-hitting Jinx person came up from behind and twisted his right hand until it broke in the Drake game. Subsequently he got to Steve's successors, George Melinkovich and Bernie Leahy, although the latter was only kept from practicing for a couple of weeks with some bad muscle bruises. Melinkovich was lost for the South· ern California and Army games. 
But our friend Jinks was outnumbered finally-he should have tried a more vulnerable spot or a less versatile coach. Every time ·he cut down a star, a new one would shoot across the football firmament and into place. Banas went down against Drake. Melinkovich was badly injured in the first period of the Navy game a month later but Banas went back into the lineup and played better ball. than the first time he appeared. Against Southern California and Army he looked like a million. 
Outside of the fact that he wntes poetry and plays the piano on the side, he's a pretty swell gent-and they'll probably break him of these an· noying habits during his next two years. 
FRANK LABORNE 
Left Halfbac~ 
Competition made things pretty easy for Frank LaBorne 
. last fall, or pretty hard, depending on how you look at it. Coming in as a sophomore, he was faced with ·the job of land· ing on the third team; there _was little hope that he would rank ahead of Schwartz or Koken. 
Trying for the same position on the frosh team were Melin· 
· kovich, Banas, and Lukats. Bernie Leahy was . to be back and there were a couple of other pretty good men who want· ed to play with the varsity when Schwartz and Koken got through. This made the ·outlook bad for LaBorne, even though he had been all-state with the Brooklyn and New York City championship Brooklyn prep team of :1929. 
Then competition at the fullback post and the subsequent loss of one plunger after another, caused the coaches. to move first Banas and Lukats, then Leahy, and finally Melinkovich over to this spot. LaBorne won his spurs and a monogram 
. at left half. He did a bit of fullbacking himself for a couple of weeks and showed enough adaptability to enable him to make some long gains against Notre Dame's three foes from Pennsylvania. 
Where competition made things easier for Frank will be shown next year. At practice sessions, you could see him back on defense standing with Marchy Schwartz. Marchy . had already played against Notre Dame's 1931 opponents and he knew pretty well_ the various strengths and weaknesses of the opposition stars. Between plays there was a constant 
tions and Marchy telling him the answers.


When there is that feeling of co-operation between rivals for a position, you can hardly expect anything but success.

REGIS McNAMARA 
Left 'facl{_le 
With only Al Culver and Ed Krause to compete with, Regis McNamara, who would rather be. known as ""Mac," should have been first team choice. Culver was only a two year veteran and the ""most under,rated player of 1930." Krause was just captain, all,city for three years, and all,state his last year at De LaSalle in Chicago. It took him two college games to get the experts talking him up for an all,American berth. 
Well, Mac, that's what you have to expect at Notre Dame. Rockne built up such a reputation that everyone wants to go there if he thinks there is any chance at all even of making a reserve team. '~Win a m~mo, gram and get a coaching job,, became the slogan last fall when 12 out of 15 .lettermen from 1930 started carrying on Rock's work as mentors. 
And it would be asking too much for you to beat out two fellows, either one of which might very logically have been picked by the all, America board. Someone had to play. third team ball and you did it in a way that was a credit to you and your school. 
When a fellow goes out and wins a monogram with the third team his sophomore year, he figures ""Well, the worst I can do is the secoQd team next year and the first team my Senior year.,, That thought probably passed through your .head, and you must have been disappointed at the way the breaks went for you. 
But more power to you for sticking up there ahead ofthe other competi, tion, for going about your monotonous practice routines so quietly and willingly, for going in there and playing your heart out every time you got the chance, for your friendly attitude toward the other fellows, many of them younger in years and experience than you. Y0u're too modest' to think that you'll even be missed next year, but you will, and this is from the heart! · 
LAURIE VEJAR 
~uarterbacl{_ 
The first game of the year with Indiana, Notre Dame leading, 19 to 0, last quarter, the third team goes in. That's the situation. A guard pipes up, ""Good thing for you guys we didn't start this game." The teams line up. The ball is Notre Dame's on its own 15,yard line. 
A stocky little quarterback who looks like a carbon copy of Carideo, slightly smaller, squats behind Center Ben Alexander. He surveys the Indiana defense and picks out a lineman who looks groggy. He chants his signals, a shift, the ball is snapped, two lines clash, and Left Half, back LaBorne is away for 2 5 yards. 
The same process repeated and Fullback Leonard dashes to the Indi, ana 20,yard line. The next. play draws a 15,yard penalty for holding in the line. The lineup again; will Notre Dame's third team lose its punch; will it come back like the varsity always does? The quarter, back calls the number, the shift; Right Halfback Cronin is away for another 3 5 yards and a touchdown. A hundred yards in three plays. 
A field general who can get those results with a third team, a leader who·can inspire a group ranked just a step ahead of the reserves to these heights, a planner who can pick· the flaws out of a defense and capitalize on them, a blocker who can pave the way to make his own choice of plays click-this boy must be good and he will go places in football. Laurie Vejar, whom we have just described, fills this order and that's~~~~~ enough said. 
Only one other thing: he is not a one,play or one,game man. He showed the same excellent qualities to Drake, Pennsylvania, and Car, negie Tech. Watch him go next year!

OFFICIAL FOOTBALL 
RAY BRANCHEAU 
Right Halfbacl{ 
Number 12 is going to be a hard one to forget if you happen to be a Notre Dame football ·fan-and why are you reading this if you're not? In 1929 and 1930, Marty Brill showed the stuff he was made of by mak.. ing good in a large ~ay at right halfback after being cut from the varsity and placed with the reserves. at Penn. . 
He played with two national championship teams and was picked by the All..America board his second year. Both years he figured an even dozen was a pretty good number to have. 
So impressed was Ray Brancheau by the feats of this m~n who made good, that he packed up his suitcase after· being graduated from Monroe, Mich;, high school, squared his jaw, and set out for Notre Dame. ..Give me number 12," he told the equipment dispensers. Last fall saw him starring time and again with the second and third teams, although in com.. petition with more experienced Notre Dame right halfbacks. 
He saw action in nearly every game as soon as the varsity had done its work and left for the showers. And he gave both Joe Sheeketski and Stumpy Cronin something to worry about. He is better equipped physically for the wear and tear of the blocking position than either of his rivals and, with a year of experience behind him, will give Sheeketski a real run for his money next fall. Cronin will not be back. 
Ray's favorite activity, next to blocking, is backing up a line. He doesn't care so much about carrying the ball, even though he is one of these tricky stop and go open field artists who comes to a halt or slows down to a crawl long enough to slow up his would..be tacklers and then spins away like a rabbit before they can get up steam. If you will recall, Jack Chevigny, now backfield· coach, and Brill were both famous for the way they could drive those powerful shoulders into a fullback coming through the line and slow him up for the afternoon. That's what Ray loves. 
Unless we're sadly wrong, he'll be doing plenty of this sort of thing .in his next two years, so look out you line smashers! 
BENJAMIN ALEXANDER 
Center 
Lack of experience is all that kept Ben Alexander from great.. ness during the past season. Equipped with an ideal build·for a center and a spirit of do-or..die, he fought his way up to the third teani, dropped back to the reserves, and then came back up stronger than ever. · 
Only Capt. Tommy Yarr.and Tom Gorman were ~head of )lim. Two or three veterans were lost in the shuffle when he really started to fight. Next year, it. will be up to Gorman and Ben to carry on Yarr's fine work. 
Ben came to Notre Dame from San Marino, Cal. He didn't get into the Southern California game because Yarr played the full route, but the sting of that defeat cut him almost as deeply 
. as if he had been in the heat of battle. He had played high school ball with and against some of the Trojans and he naturally could not feel any enthusiasm over the way they came back in the last quarter to trample his present mates. 
Well, he has two years to help avenge that beating and to help build up a new victory streak for Howard Jones to shoot at~ 
Ben is a good student in journalism and otherwise proves him.. self a nice sort of fellow by not talking too much about the Cali.. fornia weather while Indiana's notorious rainmaker is doing his worst. Ben will go far with Notre Dame-he came a long way to play. football under Coach ..Hunk" Anderson and he didn't mean interhall football. ·

HARRY WUNSCH Left Guard' . "'Local boy makes ·good,,, the downtown sport scribes can truthfully say­as they point with pride to South ·Bend·s fair-haired boy, Harry Wunsch. He is the only South Bender on the roster of Notre Dame·s first three. teams. And he is the first to achieve honor in his own country since John "'Ike, Voedisch, famous end now coaching the varsity wingmen, was grad· uated in 1927. · · Harry came to Notre Dame to play a backfield position.' At Central high in South Bend he had been a good fullback. He could buck a line, pass and block. And he could run. For his success in the dash and broad jump events he was awarded high school monograms in track. The coaches considered his speed, size, and strength and decided to make Harry over into a guard. The conversion was a success from the very start. In spring practice last year Harry served notice to all and sundry that he meant to have a guard·s berth with the reg~lars and dead bodies were no obstacle. He got it. In his first year of competition, too. When Pierce was injured, breaking an arm in scrimmage before the Southern California game, Wunsch was shifted from left to right guard and moved up to the second string. In the Southern California game he replaced Hoffmann when Nordy was hurt and had to be removed. So smashing a game did he play against seasoned California veterans like Baker and Williamson that in all probability he will be kept permanently on the right side of the line. He appeared in most of the games . this fall and always acquited himself welL He is the ideal type of Notre Dame guard, smart, fiery, and fast. He is especially adept at pulling out of a line and run· ning interference for the backs. He is a hard blocker and a savage tackler. In appearance he is short and fat, but there is not a superfluous ounce of tissue on him.. He is rugged and can take a~ well as give punishment. 
JOSEPH PIV ARNIK 
Right Guard 
Another 19 year old sophomore besides Krause who showed lots of class and promise this year is Joe Pivarnik. He plays right guard and has been understudy all year to N ordy Hoffmann and Bill Pierce. 
In the last quarter of the Indiana game, .Coach Anderson substi· tuted an entire third string team. The right guard who was inserted lined up and said to the opposing linesman, "'It's a good thing for you guys that we didn•t start this game.,, The ball at the time was on Notre Dame·s 15-yard stripe. Making good the word of their right guard, the third string proceeded in three plays, suffering meanwhile a 15·yard penalty, to score a touchdown. Leonard, LaBorne and Cronin were the backs carrying the ball, but it was the linemen who cleared the way. The right guard of "'It's a good thing for you guys, fame is Joe Pivarnik. · 
Joe hasn•t seen much action, but has been in often enough to gain 
valuable experience. He has two more years in which to develop. 
Next year he will fight it out with Bill Pierce and probably .Harry 
Wunsch for the varsity position. This being Nordy)-Ioffmann·s last 
year, his place has to be filled. · Pivarnik has played against Indiana, Carnegie Tech, Drake, Penn· 
sylvania, Navy, and Army. He played most of the Navy game and 
played well. All afternoon the Navy offense was bottled up. Not 
once did the reserves allow their goar to be threatened. 
His high school football career was sensational. He played with 
Harding high in Bridgeport, Conn., his home town. · ·When ready 
for college, Notre Dame attracted him more than any of the . Eastern 
schools, and he came west. After going through the usual bruising 
season with the Freshmen team, he came up to the varsity and won 
recognition. ·

JAMES LEONARD 
Fullbacl{ 
In each one of the N 6tre Dame-Drake games during the past four years some unknown Irish back has burst into the limelight, copped all the honors and set tongues to wagging with the account of his deeds. Three years ago it was Larry ..Moon" Mullins who ripped and tore the Bulldog defense to shreds and covered · himself with glory. Two years ago big AI Howard pulled a game out of the fire when the fighting Drake aggregation surprised everyone by leading that year's national champions· for three quarters, 7-6. Then last year Dan Hanley made a name . for himself by his spectacular ball­. carrying, opening the eyes of the critics by the brilliance of his long, 
shifting, stop-and-go broken field runs. 
This year a new star appeared on the horizon in the person of 
Jim Leonard, -w~o cavorted up and down the field against Drake, 
twisting and squirming for long gains in a broken field and punch­
ing great holes in the line. Strange, that in every case the discovery 
was a fullback. It was a propitious beginning for Jim. And if tradi­
tion means anything, he should go places in the next two years. 
··The Drake game was not his first appearance. He had appeared 
in previous games, notably against Indiana when his 25·yard run in 
the last quarter paved the way for a touchdown by the third stringers. 
The Drake game, however, was the occasion for by far his best per­
formance. 
Jim prepped at St. Joseph's high in his home town, Pedricktown, 
N. J.· He is a sophomore, 20 years old, stands six feet even, and \veighs ·190 pounds. He already has the reputation of being one ·of the toughest men on the squad. He has risen this year from a fifth to a third string position, and will give Banas, Melinkovitch, and Lukats a fine race for their jobs. With the experience he has had this year, he has improved remarkably. 


NORBERT. CHRISTMAN 
~uarterbacl{ 
If any medals were handed out for perseverance, for dogged de­termination and absolute refusal to quit trying, Norb .. Swede" Christ­man should receive first honors. He is of Swedish extraction and hails from Green Bay, Wis. He played football with the East Green Bay high school team and achieved a fine record as both student and athlete. He is tall, well-built, blond, and handsome.. He is 21 years old, weighs 172 pounds, and stands five feet, nine inches. 
His career at Notre Dame has been an inspiring one, not so much from the standpoint of achievement, but from that of spirit and moral courage-:-what Notre Dame's beloved Knute Rockne called .. intes­tinal fortitude~, For when the going was toughest, ""Chris, fought his greatest battles; when his star sunk lowest, he rose to the heights. This was his last year of competition, his last chance to prove him­self. For three years he has been an in-an-outer, alternating between the varsity and the reserve ball teams. Just when he seemed to be hitting his stride, holding his own in the competition provided by great quarterbacks such as Carideo, Jaskwhich, and Murphy, some­thing would slip and ..Chris" would drop back to the reserves. Then began the struggle, always crowned with success, to win again a reg­ular berth. 
Early this season he was making trips with the reserves. They went to Buffalo and Christman showed himself the class of the field. So outstanding was his play in this game, attracting so much atten­tion, that he has been with the varsity ever since. He is a smart field general, and a fine leader. He can handle and return punts well, can block, kick, and pass. He has won the Hering medal award for accurate passing. And, above all, he has never said die. He has fought till the fin<;il whistle and given his best for N otrc Dame. No­tre Dame is proud of him.

OFFICIAL FooTBALL REVIEW-1931-Universily of Notre Dame 
JOSEPH FOLEY 
~uarterbacl{ 
Competition for the quarterback position will be just as keen next year as this, perhaps more so, with all the regulars excepting Christman returning for another year. There will be Charley Jaskwhich, Emmett Murphy, Laurie Vejar, and Joe Foley. Foley has two more years to play. He is only a sophomore, but has managed to break into the lineup on several occasions this season. 
When his chances did come, he gave a good account of himself. His play against Northwestern on Soldier field was especially commendable. Battling in the rain' and mud to a nothing-nothing deadlock, each team waiting for a break and the chance to convert it into a score, good head,work was needed to ward off danger. Foley, when inserted, played safe, conservative football and learned the valuable lesson of when not to gamble. The experience he has gained this year should serve .him in good stead for ·next season. But he has. his job cut out for him. Any advantage won over Jaskwhich, Murphy, or Vejar will cost plenty of hard, bitter work. · 
Foley has the requisite qualities, :which with a little more seasoning should land him in a regular position. He can block, pass, and carry the ball. He weighs a mere 158 pounds, and stands only five feet seven inches, but he makes up for his small size with a world of fight and amazing self,confidenc.e, a valu­able and necessary asset to a quarterback. When calling signals in a tight spot, he can rely on that soft and delightful Southern drawl to throw his opponents off guard. He hails from Jacksonville, Fla., and prepped at Robert ,E. Lee high school there. On request, he will furnish mimeographed information, explaining why a certain town in Florida is named Foley. You see, suh, Colonel Joe comes of an old and distinguished family. 
CURTIS MILLHEAM 
Right Halfbacl{ 
Notre Dame two years ago had a great halfback, Jack Elder, possessed of a world of speed that enabled him to out-distance any man on any gridiron. And before that Notre Dame had a great quarterback, Art Parisien, whose chief attribute was his ability to drop long southpaw passes into the arms of sprinting ends and backs. Twice, once against Northwestern and once against Southern California, Art left, handed Notre Dame to seemingly impossible victories in the closing minutes of play. 
. Now Notre Dame has a Jack Elder and an Art Parisien all rolled up in one useful individual. And the name is Millheam:-Curtis (Duke) Millheam, weight 156 pounds, height five feet seven inches. He is fast. Those who witnessed his amazing speed in runs against Drake, Penn, Navy, and Carnegie Tech were reminded of the swiftness of Elder. And, they said, Millheam is shiftier than Elder, harder to bring down in a broken field. He can kick. And, wonder of wonders, he is an uncannily accurate left,handed passer. · 
This specialty of his was not uncorked until the Southern California game, when with less than a minute to play, Duke was sent in to snatch 
· · victory from the Californians, who in a brilliant last,quarter rally had scored 16 points to take the lead. Gathering in the kick,off, Duke raced 30 yards and was stopped on the 35,yard line. On_ the first play, Mur, phy calle.d a pass. The ball was handed to Duke, who faded back and to the left. Ed Kosky, left end, maneuvered into the open and tore down the field. Duke's left arm shot back, prepared to unleash a victory pass. But the fates did not smile on Notre Dame that Saturday as they did in 1926 when Parisien's toss to Niemic staved off defeat. The Trojan forwards crashed in, brushed aside interference, and smothered Millheam before he could get the ball off. One more play and the game was over.

OFFICIAL FooTBALL REVIEW-1931-Universil.Y of Notre Dame 
JOHN ROGERS 
Center 
He is no respecter of p~rsons, this John Rogers. Nor of the size of persons. Nor of circumstances, however un, favorable. Only a sophomore last year on the national championship team, playing major opponents, he never, theless succeeded in winning the coveted monogram. And he had to contend with tremendous odds. John's chief handicap is his small stature. He is only five feet, eight inches tall. Then he weighs only 175 pounds. Playing a position where height and weight are important, where· six foot; 200,pounders are regarded as average, his lack of size was keenly felt. 
But if not a physical giant, he proved himself berserk in spirit. What inches and poundage he lacked, he made up for by the fire of his attack, by a fierce, defiant aggres, siveness that withered opponents twice his size and gave new meaning to the time,honored but sanctioned adag~ that the bigger they come, the harder they fall. This year he suffered a reversal of form. His charges were missing fire, his defense was. sluggish-he' had slowe? up. Bigger men like Gorman and Alexander, more smted to center playing, were getting the call over him. He was before long out of the varsity lineup and playing ball with the 
reserves. 
·He realized that he had slumped and determined to make a come,back. With all the old dash, he began to play rings around his opponents. He is a sure and careful passer, a deadly tackler, and fast going down u?der .punts . . When playing roving center on defense, he 1s· qmck to diagnose plays, and small as he is, is an alert defender against passes. He is still fighting and coming back strong. 
JOHN FLYNN 
_ Right 'fac~le 


It has been a battle of the giants this year for the right tackle position. Kurth, Kozak, and Flynn-to the death. Kurth, of championship caliber, was outstanding. But there ·is no doubt that the relentless and savage competition with Kozak and Flynn kept Notre Dame's all,American tackle continuously on his toes, inciting him to his best efforts. Kozak does not return and Flynn is prepared to step into his shoes as a second,stringer, ·assurance to followers of Notre Dame that this position will be ably taken care of. This 19,year,old sophomore tackle shows all kinds of promise, and if looking forward to 193 3 is not carrying prognosti, cation too far, we might say that Jack seems a sure bet for a first string position in that year. 
He is tall, good,looking, well,built, and has blonde curly hair. His height is six feet even, and he weighs 196 pounds. In high school he was big for his age and starred with Quincy high in his home town, Quincy, Ill. Opportunity was not ·tong in knock, ing at his door at Notre Dame. Fred Barstow, regular third, string tackle, was suddenly stricken with an appendicitis attack . four days before the Pittsburgh game, and, after an emergency operation, was declared unfit to play any more during the season. 
Coach Anderson, looking for a likely successor to Barstow, chanced upon the big and powerful Flynn, and gave him a trial. Though only a novice, Jack, whenever called upon, has vindicated Anderson's judgment. His best performance was against the Navy. He played a great part of that game, and it was his sterling defense work that had much to do with the way the Middy at, tack was kept in check all afternoon.

'''They will also serve Who only stand and wait." 
T
HE RESERVES do far more than stand. True it is they will serve . . . but not those who stand and wait. For the path of the unsung hero is not the path strewn with glory. It is the path strewn with hard knocks. But knowing they will also serve, these so called ..Ham, burgers" throw themselves into their daily task with a zest that is remarkable. Their job is to give the varsity workouts the next opponent's plays, and what workouts they are! Striving always to push themselves up a notch, with the varsity as their ultimate goal, the reserves some, times execute the plays of those they are emulating even better than they are executed by the originators. The varsity never find it easy to push these boys over the field; on the contrary, the reserves give them a tough time of it. 
But the .. Hamburgers" look forward to the end of the week, when every Saturday they doff the colors of the varsity's opponent and become wearers of the coveted blue and gold to take their place against the best teams in their class in the country, as standard bearers for Notre Dame. 
Four victories in eight games played is the record of the reserves for 1931. Not an impressive record on its face value, but 1n consideration of several outstanding facts, it is a commendable record. 
Two of the three defeats suffered by the team, came when the squad was split up, consequently the strength of the outfit was divided. The reserves kept their four, year record intact by never being defeated when their full strength was on the field. · 
The highlights of the season were the triple,header played on October 17, and the first intersectional game in the history of a Notre Dame reserves schedule. This took place on November 7, when the Notre Dame boys traveled to Buffalo, N. Y., to give the Buffalo university varsity a 33 to 6 shellacking. Two games were scheduled with Northwestern this year, the first of which went to the Blue and Gold by a 14 to 6 score. The second con, test, scheduled for Cartier field on November 14, was called off due to the conflict in the schedule of the Evans, ton combine. 
Starting the season off on the right foot, the reserves trampled the Indiana ..B, team, 2 5 to 2, while the varsity ~as running up a like total of points against Indiana varsity. The reserves showed plenty of speed and decep, tion plays in their opener, and' clicked well for a first game. The game was played at Cartier field, the only homes game on the list· for the Hamburger's this season. The Hoosiers were the first to sc'ore, getting two points in the first quarter when the Notre Dame quarterback made a safety. But directly. after that play, the reserves started a sustained drive down the field, k~eping the ball in their possession most of 'the half; the half time gun halted their chances of making a touchdown, ·when they had the ball on the three yard line. The second half was all Notre Dame, with long runs by Vette!, Hagan and · Witucki featuring the attack. Leo Cronan scored the first tally when he plunged over from the two yard line. On the play following the kickoff, Vettel weaved his ~ay through the entire Indiana team to scamper across the last stripe after covering 65 yards. Witucki counted the next score, when he intercepted a pass and slipped through . for 45 yards and a touchdown. Hagan finished the scoring for the day, when he plunged across fro~ t~e three yard stripe, after racing 71 yards on the previous 
play. · Evidently night football·· is not to ·the liking of the re' serves, for the following Friday night they traveled to . Kalamazoo, where they dropped atough battle to the Kala, mazoo college varsity g~idders by a 19 to 7 score. The Ka, .zoo aggregation presented· formidable opposition, and smothered most of the Blue and Gold's attempts to tally. Weakened by the fact that many of the players had been left in South Bend for the Northwestern trip the next day, the reserves nevertheless put up a· fine fight. Joe McCabe, quarterback and outstanding Notre Dame player, made the only tally on a sneak in the first quarter. Schrenker kicked goal to give the reserves a 7 to 0 lead; · but the Kazoo lads came back strong to knot the count before the end of the first quarter, and then to push over two more tallies before the end of the half.

as his name implies, was the big gun iri. the winner's game, and tore off long gains consistently. 
The triple header was the next lap on the schedule, and resulted in a win, a tie, and a loss. Considering that the' teams were split up in such a manner, this was not a bad record. The victory· was over the Northwestern ""B" team. The reserves had been pointing for this contest all season, ·and played a bang·up game to eke out a 14 to 6 victory. Determined to show the Evanston fans what a 
.Notre Dame team could do on a perfect football day, the Fighti~g Irish played with a snap and zest that could not be thwarted. Leo Dilling scored both of the touchdowns, one on a long ~nd run, and the other when he took a 15' yard pass and raced 30 yards to score. Western State Normal's varsity downed the second. reserve team when they ran roughshod over a stubborn, fighting Notre Dame combine to take a 27 to 6 victory. The Blue and Gold re· lied on a passing attack, but several of the passes were in· tercepted and converted into touchdowns after long runs. ·Notre Dame's lone tally came after a 48 yard pass from Dehooge to Levins had placed the ball on the one foot line, from whence Jim Bosco plunged over for the score. 
The third game of the day resulted in a scoreless tie, when Ypsilanti battled the wearers of the Blue and Gold to a standstill in a game marred by frequent fumbles. Both teams presented strong defensive combinations, and this produced play in midfield during most of the game. In the last half both teams resorted to a passing game. An attempt at a field goal by Simmons, Normal full back, made late in the game, was short. 
Purdue's ..B, team was .the next opponent for the Irish reserves and once again, shorn of their strength by the splitting of the squad, the ·Irish were forced to bow in · defeat. However, the downstaters were outplayed throughout the contest, first downs showing Notre Dame team to be leading bv 2 to 1. The play almost throuf!hm!t the game was in. the winners' territory, and the Irish were forcing the playing at all times. Two long passes, which were good for touchdowns, and a blocked kick, which was later converted into six points, were too much for the Blue and Gold to overcome; ·however, and they had to be content with the thought that if first downs won football games, they would have been returned the victors. Acers and Dillings were the touchdown makers for the Irish, the former sprinting 52 ya:t:ds for his tally. 
The big game of the season, that against the Buffalo university varsity, found the Irish clicking on all sixes, and with their full strength on the field, they breezed through to a one· sided win. The final score was 3 3 to 6. Christman, heady quarterback of the reserves, ran the team in commendable shape, and it was mainly through his work that the Irish were able to run up such a large score. Dilling, outstanding Irish back, reeled off several long runs during the course of the afternoon, and was responsible for two of the touchdowns. Dilling gave the crowd, which numbered more than 5,000, a real after.. noon's treat, with sensational broken field running that gave the Buffalo team plenty of trouble. Grundeman, who played a stellar game, scored one of the touchdowns, also. The line play of Witucki, Schrenker and Rohrs, received considerable praise frmn Buffalo fans. 
Outstanding in the play of the reserves during the sea.. son was the work of several men who last year were members of a strong freshman squad. Together with sev· eral veterans, who played with the .. Hamburgers" last year, these men time after time, dominated the play of the various games. Roh~s, Robinson, Flynn, Witucki, Schrenker, and Carmody were towers of strength in the line play of the reserves, breaking up play after play when they were on the defense and shining on the attack with holes that gave the backfield men a chance to get away. The backfield stars, who played bangup games week after week, present names not unfamiliar to Notre Dame followers. ·Dilling, Acers, Hagan, Christman, Connelly, and McCabe were the boys who tore off so much yardage during the season, and who .were so ~argely re~ponsible for Notre Dame's great p9int scoring record.

The lnterhall System 
By ]AMES McFEELY 
N
OW the Harvards and the Yales have installed the system of intra.. mural sports and are herald.. ing it as something new in this country, as some.. thing which they have imported directly from the dear old sod at Oxford or Cambridge 'or somewhere. And all this in spite of or because of the plea for the .. deemphasis" of football in our native .land. 
While the Eastern gentlemen fall all over themselves patting each other on the back about the splendid intra.. duction of such a noteworthy system in which everyone gets a chance for development, we of Notre Dame slink away into our corners and wonder whether we are recog.. nized as a university of merit. 
Ever since the good Father Sarin signed up the second student at Notre Dame, this school by the shores of good old St. Joseph and St. Mary·s lakes has had some form of competitive athletics in which the students battled among themselves for supremacy and didn't give a hang about the Harvards and the Yales. 
Notre Dame·s system of intra.. mural athletics grew up with the school. There was no attempt to pattern the methods employed after any other system then in exist.. ence. This form of inter..hall competition merely sprung up with the desire for exercise for the student body. 
The first teams that Notre Dame ever sent on the field against other schools in the surrounding reservations were in reality hall teams, those that had emerged from the scuffle and had beaten the other hall outfits. 
One has but to look at the often.. printed and as often laughed at· picture of the moustached boys back in the eighties who first took it upon themselves to die for dear old Notre Dame. After a glance at such an edifying study of the men of the day, we learn: that they, too, were often victorious. · 
And then must follow the explanation of the factors that underly the success of Notre Dame teams. From the physical standpoint there are two things that stand out as probable causes. They are these-interhall athletics and discipline. 
· These two may be linked together. It is not to be thought that interhall activities grew up as a disciplinary measure, but the intense campus rivalry tends somewhat to keep the boys• minds from more vicious pursuits and at the same time serves materially to aid in the upbuild· ing and the physical well-being of the individual. 
As the late Knute K. Rockne once said, .. They play on hall teams, corridor teams, class teams, and any kind of teams just so they play football." That is the situation. Some 400 students, besides the ~arsity and fre~hman play• ers, are given a chance to play' football through the em· ployment of the interhall system of sports p~omotion. A close check would reveal that nearly every one of Notre Dame·s 3,000 students indulges in'some interhall sport, whether it be football, basketball, baseball, track, hand· ball, swimming, golf, boxing, or: tennis. 
· The bill for expenses incurred in the outfitting of the interhall teams exceeds that for" equipping va.rsity players. The interhall system is more than a training for varsity competitiqn~ The well..being of the individual is held uppermost and an opportunity is afforded those who do not care to make the atte~pt for a varsity position. 

OFFICIAL FooTBALL REVIEW-1931-Universil.Y of Notre Dame 
To expound the disciplinary code that aids in the de­velopment of the men and keeping them in trim would be to utter platitudes to the student, but, to the outsider, the rules governing the actions of the student are exceed­ingly interesting, especially in this present day world of ours. 
The following is a resume of the activities of the Notre 
-Dame man from the time he hits the cold, hard boards in the early morning until he finally slides into his cot as the lights are switched off at eleven o'clock: rise-6 :00 o'clock; morning prayer is followed by breakfast at 7 :00; classes· begin at 8:00 o'clock; lunch at noon, and then come. more classes, followed by recreation or study as the case may be; dinner is at 6:00, and night prayer takes a few minutes at .7 :30. The remaining hours are given over to study. Lights in freshman halls are out at 10:00; the upper classmen have an extra hotir of grace. Then sleep, following which the man again rises and repeats 
_ the process. It is during the interim between the afternoon classes and the dinner hour that the student indulges in practice with his interhall squad. Regular practice schedules are drawn up and coaches are assigned by the department of physical education. Several practice fields are used by the interhall teams, and the campus usually seems littered with the enthusiasts as they run through their paces in the afternoon in preparation for the Sunday games. In football each hall is permitted to play one game away from home on Thanksgiving. Contests are usually scheduled with high school or other teams of similar caliber in the surrounding states. Several of those played this fall by the interhall teams were for the purpose of furnishing funds for charitable purposes. -Since the university is not co-educational and there are no fraternities, a system of interhall athletics seems natur­ally to result. This form of organized sport with a spirit of rivalry which springs up between the halls on the campus affords an outlet for the otherwise pent up fed· ings of the individual who seeks some form of recreation to lessen the monotony of pos~ible habitual study. 
The season just ended saw St. Edward's hall team emerge the victor from the pile of 14 teams which par­tic~pated in interhall football activities. In the past few years there have been but 12 aspirants but with the addition of Dillon and Alumni halls to the list the num­ber thereby mounted. 
The halls are div.lded into two groups, and the winners in each are pitted against each other in the last game of the season for the championship of the school. Walsh hall bounced to the top in its own league, and, in the final playoff against St. ;Edward's, fell by a score of 12 to 6. 
Not wishing to allow the St. Edward's boys to gail}. the honors without-a fight for it, Badin hall's entry ran neck and neck with St. Edward's in group one throughout the season. An extra game was necessary in order to ascer, tain the representative for the championship contest. Badin, although that team had downed St. Edward's in a previous game, threw away its chances for the laurel wreaths when it fell by the wayside on the short end of a 6 to 0 score. 
Interhall activities during the past season have been under the supervision of John Frederick, assistant foot­ball coach at the university. Coaches were appointed by the rectors of the various halls, and the officials were chosen by the department of physical education.

Freshman Football 
By GEORGE BELTING 

JACK CARBERRY CLARENCE KAPLAN 
W
HEN the first call for candidates for the Notre Dame freshman team was issued, ·236 stalwarts reported to Coaches Kappy Kaplan, Art Parisien, Jake Kline, and Jack Carberry. In that array of aspirants, whose sole aim was someday to play on the great Notre. Dame varsity,. there were former. high school captains, all-city choices, aU-state selections, coaches' most valuable players, and some men who had never even handled a football. Only a coach can appreciate ·the responsibility that is his who has to care for a team, be they varsity 
·men or freshmen players. Accordingly, the Notre Dame freshman mentors; realizing the importance of their posi­tions, took cognizance of the fact that the freshmen of today are the varsity of tomorrow. 
The weeding-out process required much time and de­liberation. All aspirants were given their chance to make 
JAKE KLINE ART PARISIEN 
cut from the squad; but a footba11 coach cannot consider fond dreams when he ·is picking a team that must some day replace all-Americans such as Schwartz, Yarr, Kurth and Hoffmann. When the three-quarter mark had been reached in the varsity schedule all the cuts had been made and 75 jubilant freshmen had weathered the storm of competition. 
After being drilled in the fundamentals of the Rockne system, the yearlings were taught the plays of the var' sity's opponents. . The aid that the freshmen afforded Senior Coach .. Hunk.. Anderson and his staff cannot be overestimated. And the precision and accurateness with which the first year men ran through the opponents' plays speaks well for~ the success of the ••Fighting Jrish', in future years. . . 
With the. passing of the \•Guiding Light" in Notre

or more Notre Dame men the secrets which spell sue; cess for the Blue and Gold on the gridiron. They knew the Rockne system, everyone of them having played on Notre.Dame elevens of the past. They took one look at the varsity roster of this year and saw the names-Hugh DeVore, Duke Millhiem, George Melinkovich, Jim Leon­ard,. Joe Pivarnik, and Ed Krause, all members of last year's freshmen team. Then they knew that a great task confronted them if they were to surpass or even equal the marvelous record established by Bill Jones and Manny Vezie, the 19.30 freshmen coaches. 
As usual, there was a large number of quarterbacks 
who ·wished to emulate .the all-American, Frank Carideo. 
A cousin of the former Notre Dame star reported for 
the team at the signal barking position. So don't be sur­
prised if in another year or two another Carideo should 
be considered as an all-American possibility. A 165­
pound lad named Bonar, who hails from Bellaire, Ohio, 
and who is a nice broken-field runner as well as an apt 
pass receiver, heads the long list of potential field gen.­
erals. Gaul, and Mettler are also pleasing prospects. 
"Be as good as Marchy Schwartz," was the war cry of the candidat.es for the left halfback post. There were several men aspiring to this position who would have cheered the heart of any coach. Costello is an excellent . passer and also knows how to run the ball. Digilef, Armstrong and another Carideo, a brother of the famous Frank, were other outstanding men at this particular 
berth. 
The right halfbacks were duly represented by a young 
man, Muddrey by name, who traveled all the way from 
Texas in order to receive recognition from the Notre 
Dame coaches. He excels in punting· and passing. Lay.. 
den and Young also looked good. 
A finer group of fullbacks than the one which reported 
for the freshmen team would be hard to find. Basan 
appears to be varsity material. Deal, Egan, Kreuz, Mc.­
Carthy, Martin, O'Neil and Urban are also high pow.­
ered, hard plunging fullbacks. 
The center position is always one which has been 
hotly contested by the freshmen candidates and this year 
proved no exception. Selarii, a tall, husky, hard.-fighting 
lad who tips the scales at 200 pounds, appears to pos.­
sess the main qualities of a good ball snapper. However, 
Nadeau and Tollini gave him plenty of competition, and 
with the accuratepess which comes with experience· they 
may also follow in the footsteps of the 1931 all.-American 
and captain, Tommy Yarr. 
Twenty-five green-jersied warriors applied for the guard 
posts. This is one of the most important positions in 
the Rockne system and competitors must be powerful, 
aggressive, and good blockers. Knappman and Shamla 
were promising at this position. Daemers, Garay, 
Lesko and Kelley may also develop into efficient guards. 
The tackle positions on the Notre Dame varsity have 
always been one of the strongest points. And if the 
freshmen warriors have anything to say about it they 
are not going to allow those berths to suffer because of 
a lack of weight. Two of the fastest applicants for those 
particular jobs were Pfefferle, who scales 210 pounds, and 
his mate, Becker, though weighing only 190 pounds, is 
just as fast. Other outstanding tackles are: Esser, Marek, 
Smith and Roccobono. 
There were also plenty of talented performers for the 
wing positions. Many people believe that all an end has 
to. do is to catch forward passes; but there is as much 
blocking, running interference and tackling at the end 
positions as there is in any other section of the line. A 
good end is considered a "find" by any coach, so credit 
the freshmen mentors with "finding" Rogers, a sterling 
six.-footer, weighing 185 pounds, who hails from Glenco, 
Minn.; also Quinlan, another strapping, powerful lad, 
who would be dangerous in any line-up. Albosta, Bow.­
dren, Brown, Davis and O'Brien are equally promising. It may not be out of place right here to mention that when a man trys out for a Notre Dame team, in what.. ever sport it may be, all his newspaper clippings, all his high school write-ups, all his monograms and service stripes are a thing of the past. He is just another dreamer .of heroic dreams to the coaches but he gets his chance 
to make good. If he fails, he has no one to blam·e but 
himself; if he succeeds it is his own glory. In other words, 
it is up to him to come through. It is not what you 
were or what you did, but what you are and what you 
can do, is the criterion by which the surviving 75 are 
chosen. 
There are many men who have carried the Notre 
Dame colors at home and on foreign fields, who had never 
played football until their freshman year, and who have 
developed into all.-Americans. Given their chance, they 
made good. Perhaps the most outstanding present ex.­
ample of this type of player is Nordy Hoffmann, than 
whom there are few better.

OFFICIAL FOOTBALL REVIEW-1931-Univ~rsily of Nolre Dame 
A Viking_ Goes to Rest 
By GEORGE TREVOR 
EniTOit's NoTE: This is reprinted from the April 6, ·l!J31, issue of the New York Sun through the courtesy of this. paper and the author. 
"SOFT landings, .coach" was the parting salutation of an acquaintance as Knute Rockne boarded the . plane that was not fated to reach ~ts destination. .. You mean happy landings,, Rockne corrected. Those the last words which the world was to hear from Rockne, · were typical of the man who hated the expression .. soft." 
It is almost impossible for one who knew Rockne in~ timately to write of his death without overdoing the sen~ timental side, but let us take our cue from the departed leader and avoid anything that savors of mawkish emo~ tionalism. He detested .. sob stuff., 
Rockne has gone, bequeathing Notre Dame a priceless legacy of. memories, and leaving to us outsiders some slo· gans, embodying his cree~ of duty, which may help us to play a more manly .part in the uncompromising game of life. He who was behind the door when fear went by had a message of courage for the ~verage man. 
More 'Than a Coach 
Rockne's career was interwoven with football, yet to 
think of him as just a football coach-albeit the greatest 
-is a narrow conception· which does scant justice to his 
many-sided character. It is as a leader and teacher, rather 
than as a football coach, that Rockne's fame will endure. 
The game has developed strategists of greater originality; · 
it has produced drill maste~s more exacting in technical 
detail; it has never known a leader~teacher who could so 
move the minds and hearts of men as Knute Rockne did 
through the sheer force of a compelling personality." 
Great · teachers are even rarer than natural· leaders. 
When these t~o qualities are blended in one man and 
quickened by that intangible something we call genius, 
you have ~ Knute Rockne. He belonged to Notre Dame 
first, but he belonged to America too. Not since Theo-. 
dore Roosevelt's gay has any single man so influenced the 
living habits of impressionable youngsters as Rockne did. 
Rockne took the curse off that faintly derisive phrase 
"'character builder." Among hard-boiled coaches it is the 
custom to refer to. an unsuccessful colleague as a .. builder 
of character., This sardonic cynicism lost .its ironic flavor 
when· applied to Rockne: He proved that the two objec~ 
tives were not incompatible by building character in the 
process of creating invincible teams. 
Building Character 
Rockne's elevens reflected the character of the individ~ · 
uals composing them, and it was he, in turn, who shaped 
the characters of those individuals. Thus each Notre ·Dame eleven, in a very· real sense, was a .. Rockne team,,_ a phrase which implied no intent on Rockne's part to seize the spotlight. . 
As a· matter of fact, Rockne didn't seek ~he personal 
advertising which his Notre Dame affiliation thrust upon 
him. He flatly rejected the proposal to call the new 
South Bend coliseum ..Rockne Stadium., That idea will  
now be revived as a fitting memorial to the man who did  
most to clothe this football dream in concrete, but those who reverence Rockne's wishes should vote down the  01  
propo~1t10n. ..There is only one fitting name for this  
arena," said Rockne, .. and that is Notre Dame Stadium .  
~et us ·keep our sense of proportion., He always did.  
Delusions of grandeur never touched this simple, ·solid  
man whose life personified those rugged, homespun quali~  
ties we admire in Abraham Lincoln. Indeed~ there is  
something Lincolnesque in the wealth of anecdotes, fla~  
vored with humor, which cluster about the unpretentious  
but ambitious Norwegian leader.  :  
Note Rockne's last phrase-..happy landings." That  
cheerful adjective symbolizes his coaching regime. Those  
were happy terms that Rockne fathered-happy without  
sacrificing a jot of determination. There was a joyous~  
ness quality in their play, a gay and gallant courage, an  
exuberance born of a real zest for football. It is· a trait  
vou miss in teams coached by hardbaked drill masters of  
the top~sergeant school.  
'The Understanding_ Heart  
Rockne was a stern taskmaster, yes, but his flinty veneer  
masked a sympathetic, essentially ge1,1tle soul. There is  
a world of difference between gentleness and softness.  
Rockne liked to convey the impression that he was .. hard  
boiled," but though none of his players ever questioned  
his authority and "got away with it," the kindly sym~  
pathy and paternal understanding which were Rockne  
attributes could not be entirely concealed. The lowliest  
substitute at Notre Dame, sensed this human touch, felt  
that it belonged to Rockne's household. That is why his­ 
Notre Dame pupils share in lesser degree the family's feel~  
ing of personal loss. Aptly has it been said, ..The bravest  
are the tenderest.,  
Rockne's elevens mirrored the man who fashioned them.  
They reflected his serenity, his mental poise, his love of a  
clean, hard scrap. They exemplified his favorite maxim:  
..When the going gets tough that's when we like it., It  
would be difficult to thinlq of a more effective slogan on  
which to pattern your life.  
Rockne often used that phrase between the halves of a.  
close-fought game. His men heard it for the last time  
from his lips during the intermission following the first  
half of the ·Northwestern match when defeat starer\  
Notre Dame in the eye. The comparatively light Irish  
line had been battered mercilessly by the Purple·jersied  
giants, though fumbling had averted a touchdown.  
Conley's men had that haggard look which presages  
defeat. It seemed that brute power would prove their  
undoing in the periods to come. Then Rockne .broke the  
pin-dropping silence of that locker room: Biting off his  
words almost savagely, but without raising his voice un·

Tl1e story of Rockne s ear y s ru g es e. ' 
withal for a college education has been told again arid 
again, but a little known one is the record of his :first few 
years as coach and no less a tale of hardship than his 
battle to get through college. 
Here he ·was, a young man in his ·first year of coach, 
ing, on trial before the football fans of the country. 
Notre Dame had first presented its_ case in Rockne's own 
time as a player and now it was up to him to drive home 
the clinching argum.ents. · . 
It was no easy assignment, as Rockne. discovered before 
he finally brought it to a successful conclusion. He re, ceived about $3,5'00 salary for that :first year, a sum mini, · mized by the fact that he was supporting a family. And if Notre Dame followers. of today think that Rockne was merely a football coach, concerned only with forward passes and off tackle plays; they don't know the story of 
his early coaching days. 
Yes, he did devote the majority of his time to the team, 
building up its offense and defense, but he went beyond 
that with a thoroughness and eagnerness that was typical 
of him. He was rubber and trainer, administering to 
the hurts and bruises acquired under his tutelage. He was 
his own freight department, overseeing the dispatching 
and arrival of uniforms on gam-es away from home. He 
was his own secretary, attending personally to all corre, 
spondence relative to the school's athletic work. He 
. coached _the track team and for two weeks, during 
the illness of Dorais, who coached basketball also, he tu, 
tored the cage team. 
There were a thousand and one details, such as would 
have supplied seven or eight of a modern athletic direc, 
tor's minions with work, but which Rock saw to himself. 
All of this was comparatively unknown to the average 
student, who had a picture of Rockne as a chemistry 
professor who coached the football team. That chemistry 
class was jus~ another illustration of his apparently bound, 
less capacity for work. 
What was the operating base for this almost endless 
campaign of activity? Just a tiny room on the second

It wasn t the mere domg of these chores that made 
Rockne's first few years difficult. There were other ob, 
stacles, such as the occasional cases of temperament 
among players which had to be ironed out. Still an, 
other point in Rockne's makeup which underwent a 
remarkable change with the passing of the years was his 
speaking ability. · 
He made talks at pep sessions which, while they were 
delivered with spirit,. nevertheless lacked the force and 
fluency of the speeches that later contributed to his fame 
as a radio and after dinner raconteur, not to mention 
his dressit1g room sermons.

to say about its makeup or play. If it's a flop, pan me. 
If it's a success,-well, let them say what they choose. 
I have worked around here as an assistant coach for four 
years and seldom have seen my name in print." 
That typified Rockne's philosophy of life. He wanted 
what was coming to him, nothing more. 
As to his philosophy on Notre Dame-that was con, 
tained in ·a talk with him shortly after he was involved 
over a coaching_ offer from Columbia university. This is 
what he said: 
..Don't ever pay any attention to rumors about me 
going elsewhere to coach. Notre Dame took me in as 
a poor boy years ago. It gave me the opportunity' for 
an education. It e,nabled me to make good .in a :field I 
have chosen for my own. I am indebted to the school 
as long as I live. Nothing ever will tear me away, no 
matter what the inducements. When I quit coaching 
Notre Dame, I am through with football."

Sports Editor, Chicago Herald and Examiner 

Rockne, like Rockne~s teams, got around more than the average. His contacts with coaches then, were apt to be more ex.tensive than might have been the case, 
. ordinarily. But Rockne wasn't satisfied with mere con, tacts. His relations with coaches went beyond that. He counted them as friends, and they looked to him not only for friendship,· but in some cases, for their very livelihood. · 
It is telling no tales out of school, to make the state, ment that there are coaches now on the job in this coun, try, who have been placed by Rockne, and whose stay where they were placed has been made possible by an occasional kindly gesture that Rockne t:nade their way. 
These coaches, I am sure, will lbok long, indeed, before they will find another to break their· falls, and do it, not had to be started, on the frequent occasions that the blue, noses decided football was being emphasized, when what they actually had in mind, was that coaches should be put in their places. And the place for coac~es, accord, ing to their theory, was somewhere between a plumber's helper and a janitor's caddy. 
In these counter,offensives, Rockne was at his best, in the way of repartee. No other coach could turn a phrase back at the '"common enemy,, like Rockne could. To start with, he had something that was valuable, in con, troversies of this kind. That was a sense of humor. Ob, viously the reformers had no sense of humor. With one, they couldn't be reformers. . 
On this score alone, Rockne's loss to the entire body of coaches is a tremendous one.

The Twinkle in Rockne's Eyes 
By PAT FLANAGAN, Sports Announcer WBBM · 
.HAT twinkle always meant that Rockne was using that rapid fire brain of his to keep the other fellow constantly on the defensive. Rockne's wit was used
T 
in exactly the same manner as were the plays he outlined and taught to the hundreds of men who passed through his tutelage at Notre Dame. As long as he could keep the other fellow guessing in football he had the upper hand and as long as he had hundreds of men for reserves he could always plan his attack. The same was true of Rockne's stories. He. 0 had literally thou­sands of them stored ..~o away in his memory and as a great many other men do who are constantly before the public, he used them to keep the other fel­low off balance men­tally. That is one of the main reasons why it was impossible to 
corner Rockne. As 
an example, the last 
time I talked with 
Rock it was of course 
about football and the 
subject was the 1930 
Notre Dame-North­
western game. 
He said, "Pat, what 
made those North­
western boys fumble

lines?" My answer was in . the form of a question because I wanted to trap him into some sort of an admission. So· I said, •T saw some arms flying with abandon. Did they really fumble?" Rockne's answer with that twinkle in his eyes was, ••I never did like double-breasted suits." .Now to ~ost people that would not have been the least bit amusing but it was Rockne's way of placing me again on the defensive and thus closing the matter. 
One of Rockne's favorite stories was about a substitute who had spent most of his college football career on the 
bench. Rockne was quizzing him one day to find out how well he knew the signals and asked him what he would· do when they called 31,22-16. The boy answered, •Td 
. slide down to the other end of the bench to see who made 
the touchdown., Another one about that same chap was told as Rockne brought to mind some of the incidents of a very rainy day at Soldier Field in Chicago. Rock had placed some pow­dered resin on the floor and told the fellows to rub it·on their hands and their jerseys and the front of their pants 
(Drawin!J by D. J. Coffin re]Jroduced tltrouuh courtesy of 11Iichiuan Motor News.) 
so they could get a good grip on-the ball. As the. team trotted out, Rockne saw this youngster seated in the resin and spinning himself around so he asked him what the big idea was. The boy answered, "Well coach, you don't . want me to slip off the bench do you?" 
Rockne could use humor to get himself out of a trying situation, too, sometimes when he had brought the trial upon himself. During the summer of 1929, he was driv­ing through the Southeast with Jack Chevigny, then just

the wheel and Chev­

ery time they tried to 
pass, the truck· ahead 
would swing into the 
middle of the road or

Rockne's Spiritual Side 
By LAWRENCE PERRY 
j!l ew 
When Knute Rockne on Nov. 25, 1925, was received into the Catholic church, receiving next day his first Holy Communion in the chapel of St. Edward's hall and later Confirmation from the Rt. Rev. John F. Noll, D.D., Bishop of Fort Wayne, he merely gave outward and tangible recognition of a side of his personality which those close to him-as the writer was through many years-had long understood and appreci­ated; his spiritual side. · 
In the way of spiritual outgiving it needed no affiliation with the mother church to establish and define Knute Rockne. Whatever he may have taken with him to Notre Dame as a fresh­man~ no one· may question that the institutional influences with which he was surrounded . there, its · sturdy faith, its sweet tolerance, its philos­ophy of life and living, its ordered formulae of religious thought, exerted in cumulative degree a subtle effect upon a life and a character funda­mentally susceptible to those things. 
His football elevens, sent forth year after year, reflected not only the envir­onment in which they had been developed but the man who had developed them. They were clean teams, sportsmanlike teams, cheery teams, whether the going was good or adverse. In all Knute 's relations with rival universities, with the public, he was stamped inevitably as a man of lofty impulse and · high idealism. Not that he proclaimed these· things; they spoke for him in his work, "in his applied standards; in all that he did. · 
He was an idol of the youth of the country, an ex• emplar long before he knelt at the feet of the Rev. E. V. Mooney, C.S.C., in .the his­toric log chapel on the uni­versity campus and received baptism. . And for Notre Dame it may be said that had he gone on in his accustomed way ~nd so entered upon the dissolution of his mortal body, hts name ~auld have endured there as a precious reliquary, as an ~ncen· tive to the continued prosperity of the school phystcally, morally and in ·education. . 
Why did Knute Rockne enter the C?atho~tc. church? The writer is a non-Catholic and so hts optmon upon 
·this sacred· matter, based though it may· be upon a modi~ cum of knowledge, must be very humbly, if not apolo­getically set forth. 
Knute Rockne, then, had come to a time when he could·_no ·longer-be as self-sufficient is he had been. He had given so much and he was tired. He needed a rock upon which he might be bulwarked and upon which open­ly he might erect his definite standard. He needed an inward solace and a knowledge of the way. 
Year after year in the early morning hours he had seen his players quietly leaving their hotels repairing to mass, and to one of his keen imagination, his penetrating intellect, his broad sympathies, no words were re· quired to advise him what their religion meant to these boys. And deep in his heart he must always have known what it could mean to him. 
Rockne was a man who thought deeply, who felt strongly, who was sensitive to things un• seen, yet at times ineffably palpable. He had given so much ·and now he himself must needs drink. 
There are, it is true, strong men who go for· ward in their careers and promulgate their achievements, all unmindful of the spiritual values in life. No one, at least no superficial observer, may look into a soul and tell what is there; but outwardly certainly these men appear self-sufficient. Why? Be­cause they are giving unto 
·themselves; ta~ing; commit· ted to processes of acquisi· tion, their religion is one of personal gain, the success of plan and project. 
Rockne's life on the con­trary was all giving. He ac· quired fame, to be sure, and prestige. But he never re· ceived financially or in any other way in ratio to what he gave out physically, men­tally, spiritually. And so the time came when he had to reach out a faltering hand for that help which he knew to be unfailing. 
Religious aspiration is best sought humbly,. as Rockne sought-and found-it. The consolations of faith abound in accordance· with what one makes of faith. Knute made of his faith something very concrete. After all his groping he had become definite and the writer can imagine what would have been .. the fullness of his ability to give in measure he had never 
· known had he not been called from this world. 
But we know that in that little log chapel Knute came into peace as he came into grace. Thenceforward the vistas lying ahead called to him with an assuring sig­nificance. Deep within him Knute Rockne had always the standards, the aspirations, the needs that in the end were resolved in his beautiful genuflection. 
And when he crashed to his death there were upon his person and .in his baggage those tangible evidences of the new life upon which he had entered.

somed out as a tour conductor. He both organized and cm~ducted a European tour which turned out to be one of the most successful individually conducted tours in history.· No one will ever know, however, the mental turmoil which he went through in order to keep himself in a pleasant and agreeable frame of mind. The nightly job of meeting the demands of all members of his tour for room with bath when only one room out of 20 had a bath, was sorely perplexing. At that he never lost his temper, found some way of satisfying everyone and could have signed up as a tour conductor for any established service for every summer season thereafter if he had wanted to but one season was one too many. 
Rockne's association with Studebaker began in Janu.. ary of 1928. He was employed to address sales meetings and, to use the vernacular, to "pep up, the selling forces. He :did a splendid job during that season, so satisfactory, in fact, that he was re-employed for 1929. Unfortunately his serious illness prevented his doing any work that year. In 1930 he had recovered sufficiently to permit his re.. surriing work. 
What a job he did! 
Starting in New York on January 5 and working his way -westward, with meetings held in every important city, he threw himself into sales work with the greatest enthusiasm and energy. He had made up his mind that his health might not permit his continuing in active coaching very much longer. ·He was trying out the sales field with the thought. of devoting more and more of his time to the work if he found that he liked it. As he studied sales problems; he became impressed with the close analogy between sales management and coaching and became tremendously interested. In March of 1930 he agreed to accept the position of sales promotion man.. ager for the Studeb~ker Corporation of America. 
Rockne would have been one of the greatest sales executives of all times had he lived. The same qualities· of character and p~rsonality that carried him to the top in football, would have made him a champion sales execu.. tive. Immediately oh assuming the responsibility of sales promotion manager, he embarked upon a course of train.. ing for Studebaker sales managers which proved emi.. nently successful. Notre Dame men. may enjoy reading one of two of the letters he wrote· these Studebaker Sales Managers. A great deal of his personality was written 
into each of them. 
"If ·you think you already know all there is about 
sales management; if you are one of. the type that starts 
out with a ·loud whoop and pooblah the first day and 
then slows down to a walk when the going gets tough; if 
you think this is going to be a de luxe excursion with 
attendant banquets, wassail and paper hats-forget all 
about me. You ·had better spend your evening listening 
to Rudy Vallee. You won't fit into the Rockne system. 
..If, on the other hand, you are willing to get ri~ht 
down to earth and dig; if you have the character to dnve 
yourself into mastering new ideas and putting them into 
play; if you are willing to start early in the morning and ·work until late at night, if need be, injecting new life into your salesmen-then send your entry in to me. 
.. I want to see every Studebaker dealer and sales man.. ager get out for the team. But I can't use any laggards who are satisfied with mediocre work. Better a few real men of championship caliber than a raft of candidates who will be satisfied if they make the scrub team.,, 
"Here is some inside stuff. The only reason we man.. age to win games is because we have worked and worked and WORKED to develop every man on the squad to his highest point of playing efficiency. 
··out at Notre Dame we have our ·control plan'-only we call it our ·chart of play.' If I had to coach football without it, I would probably quit coaching. This chart tells us everything we want to know .about what hap.. pened in previous games-and shows us just where we can improve on the individual performance of every man. 
··How many times did Schwartz carry the ball? How many times did Mullins carry the· ball? How many times did Brill carry the ball, and how much did they average on each attempt? How many forward passes did we try and how many were completed? 
··on the plays that failed, which inan is responsible, who failed to function 100 per cent? On forward passes, which man failed to block for the passer? 
••Every time an opponent made a tackle, which of our players failed in his specific assignment of taking care of his specific man? When we got on the goal line why didn't we score? When we got Schwartz loose in the open, why· didn't he score? What individuals fell down . in picking off the secondary and' safety men? Our chart tells. 
··sometimes we feel like tossing that chart away and saying, ·oh, well, we won again, we've g~t a good team and we ought to win again next week.' But we've learned, by sad experience, that in competition as keen as modern football we can't keep winning unless we keep improving-and we can't improve unless we have the FACTS-all the facts about every player and every de.. partment of play.,, · 
In conclusion, one of the interesting facts in reference to Rockne is the impression he made on leaders in almost every field of human activity. An eminent physician told me that Rockne should have been a doctor, that he would have been outstanding in that profession. A leading jurist told me he should have been a lawyer, that he would have been one of the greatest trial lawyers in the country. A prominent theatrical producer told me he should have been in that field. He had all the qualities necessary to make him a great showman. As a matter of fact, the Madison Square Garden corporation pleaded with him to accept the dictatorship of that institution. We in the business world feel that he should have started his business career earlier. We were all right. He would have been a great doctor, a great lawyer or a great busi.. ness man but fortunately for America, he entered the profession of coaching.-In that field he influenced mil.. lions. In any other more restricted field it would have been thousands, and millions would have been the losers.

Rockne and Eastern Football 
By BILL CuNNINGHAM Sports Writer Boston Post 
TS a long gaze westward from this plinth of erudition 
"'where the Cabots speak only to the Lowells, and the 
Lowells speak only to God,, and it's usually been 
pretty hard for an eastern sports writer to adopt other 
than a patronizing attitude toward those young but lusty 
institutions of the burly Central West. That isn't fair, 
of course. It isn't even honest, but then the spectacles of 
the Puritan were always covered with grease. He seldom 
saw, or sees, beyond the end of his schnozzle. Even an 
obvious fact has to knock him down before he sees it and even then some bystander usually has to explain just · what happened. Gridironically speaking, Rockne's Notre Dame teams were that obvious fact. Properly regulated and success, 
fully manipulated, football is a powerful educational 
force. It is a great and rapid arranger of values. It can 
deflate the most gaseous ego and build up the most woe, 
ful case of inferiority complex. In that conn~ction, if you'll pardon a personal experience, I'll attempt to elu, cidate. 
In my own playing days, I ~as the gallant centre,rush

eastern teams most folks out your way ever heard of are 
Harvard, Yale and Princeton. You probably pronounce 
it Dart~MOUTH, instead of DARTmuth, and think it's 
a tooth paste, or something because it's got a mouth on 
the end of it, but it's really quite a school and I wasn't a 
bad centre-who threw that?) 
But anyhow, we were playing some little club such as 
the New England College of Embalming or the Molar 
Tonsorial institute. Dartmouth had kicked them all over 
the lot, running up five or six touchdowns and generally 
grinding them into the sod. Near the close of the half, 
the coach looked up and down the bench and said, ··co

moment and there was a senior ahead of me on the. team. 
I shucked off my blanket, galloped up. and down the side 
lines for a minute while the stands tossed verdant wreaths 
of the wild raspberry like quoits, and then charged onto 
the field full of vim, vigor et cetera.

••Aw shut up, you big loud mouthed so and so. If you were any good, you'd ·have been in here at the start of the game.,, · . 
I don't mean to say that Rockne's teams were anything like that. The comparison isn't accurate because Rockne's teams were seldom on the losing end, but there's the mak, ings of a comparison in there somewhere. Notre Dame, under the leadership of that dynamic genius, did much

are measured) mid,western campus, with a group of players representing all territorial sections and most racial strains, Rockne invaded the native compounds of the southerners, the easterners, the far westerners in succes­sian and proceeded to demonstrate' that no one section has a monopoly upon brawn nor intelligence. And the fact that he occasionally got licked merely made the ap­
plication universal. . In his way, he was a great ~ervant in the cause of Americanization-of nationalization.

There was a more material contribution that can never be measured.. More than any other coach the game of football ever had, Rockne gave the spectator something he could see and understand. In some of their sacrosanct publications, the hoary historians of Harvard and Yale claim credit for prior use of the forward pass. And I believe it is a matter of record that some bewhiskered 
Harvardian in the dark ages did throw the· ball to some team mate who thereupon fled down the sward to cross the goal line, bu_t I believe that it is likewise true that some gent by the name of Icarus once fixed himself a

to lift him from the ground and therefore rates prior 
claim to Lindbergh as an aviator. ·. 
Never until the Notre Dame team Rockne captained 
in 1913 came east to play West Point and forward 
passed the Soldiers dizzy had the pass been anything but 
a piece of permissable foolishness. That score, 35 to 13, 
was real birth of the forward pass in American football, 
and was a discovery or at least a development, compar· 
able to that of the self-starter in the automotive field. 
It was the· death blow to mass play. It gave the spec· 
tator something to see. It threw the game into the open 
and jewelled it with thrills. Football as the great, com· 
pelling spectacle we know today came on exactly from 
that point. It became the idol of millions. The great 
stadia were thrown up around it. It becam~ a sports 
page subject of powerful proportions. 
It became, in brief, the game we know now. 
· Rockne's other contributions have been so glowingly· 
described in better words than mine, that a listing of 
them here would be superfluous. His teams became the 
symbol of the great fighting comeback. There was always 
a thrill to seeing them even in defeat. I don't know how 
he did it-the psychology of it is too profound to follow. 
The various ramifications of it may even root. back into 
something sociological, but in some manner and fashion, 
Rockne's teams became the teams of the non•college man 
and in the same breath, the teams of every college man. 
They became the teams of women-=---the mothers of 
boys and the teachers of children. . 
I'll never forg~t the day Rock was killed. 
I had spent the early part of the afternoon in the office 
of a young lawyer friend straight on down Washington 
street from Boston's Newspaper Row. I had been offered 
a job with another newspaper and was trying to get an 
outsider's view of· the possible change. We talked lazily 
along until the middle of the afternoon, and finally I· 
stepped upon a cigarette and started toward the door.. 
"What're you going to write about tomorrow?", he said, 
not that he particularly cared, but just in the matter of 
saying goodbye. 
"I don't know", said I, "'it's pretty thin picking these 
days. A real story hasn't come along in so long that I 
wouldn't know one if ,I saw it., 
I sauntered along through the street toward the office trying to chisel out the idea for a column. I suddenly became· conscious of shrill cries over in the Row indicative ·of extra editions. Turning absently in that direction, . I ran into Spider Murphy, a tough street butcher. His face· was as strangely set as if something serious had hap· 
pened to him. 
"Jeez, ain't that· tough?'', he· said in a strangely soft 
voice. 
"About what?", said I. 
"About Rockne", he said. 
"What about him?" I asked. 
"He's dead", said Spider in a tone that almost amounted 
to awe. 
."He's WHAT?", l gasped and then I snatched the 
paper. he had in his hand, and read the headlines with 
unbelieving eyes. 
Over in the Row, a throng that rapidly grew to thou· sands stood in front of the bulletin boards. It was a strangely silent throng. There was even something rev· erent about it. They paused and read, looked silently at each other for a minute and moved away. Yankees are undemonstrative folk, but their very silence was eloquent. 
Inside the paper the telephones were screaming until we had to send out for extra operators. It was .like the night of a big election or some tremendous calamity. 
"'Is it true that Rockne's dead?", they asked. 
"'Yes,, would be the answer. 
"'Oh ·my God!", was the response from the unknown 
inquirer more than once. Many of those voices-most of them-belonged to women. Not women who regarded Rockne sentimental· ly, but mothers to whose sons the clean, manly star·white figure of a great Christian-a great leader-was an in· spiration, was something real and fine and uplifting, something square with the old time virtues of decency, gallantry and honor in these days of gin, jazz and juvenile amatory experiments. And those telephones kept ringing far into the night, as we gathered the facts and tried to write our feeble: tributes to a subject, the majesty of which, we amazingly realized for the first time was in some fashion too big fully to outline in words. I can't realize yet that the man is gone. I'd seen him in Florida and again later in Boston some three or four weeks before his death. He was the same old Rock, back on his feet, ·full of the zest of living, kidding again, and apparently as good as new. I won't be platitudinous and close with any line about· his spirit marching on. Perhaps his spirit does, but if it does, it's because he made that spirit one, as closely as 
his human limitations permitted, with the Spirit of that other Great Teacher who once trod the shores of Gallilee. He was only·a football coach, God rest his gallant soul, 
but he, too led men and taught them the value of higher, cleaner things although his pulpit was only a playing field and his medium only a football. 
ROCKNE'S RECORD AGAINST EASTERN 
TEAMS 
NoTE:' This includes all games with Eastern teams 
from 1919 to 1930, inclusive. In his first year as 
head coach, 1918, Rockne had no Eastern team sched·

Dame did not meet during the rivalry which started 
in 1913 when Rockne was a player.

By FRANK ·E. HERING; '98 ChaiTman of Publicity, Rock._ne. Memorial Fund 
Early last spring, at a meeting of the athletic board of the University of Notre Dame, Knute Rockne again spoke informally about a field house. ·He knew that there were no funds for such a structure, nor could he see the day when there might be. But he liked to refer to the field. house as .. the next step.,. 
Now, within a year of that memorable meeting, plans have been perfected to make ..the next step,. possible. 
Six months after Rock was taken from us, Notre Dame alumni, friends and admirers were organized for a nation, wide drive to raise $1,000,000 to build and endow, in memory of Knute Rockne, the building that he wanted, above all else, as the next unit in the educational system of the University of Notre Dame. 
Perhaps the most important hours in a boy's life are those spent at play. 
.. I am not worried about boys when they are in school, in church, with their Boy Scout Troop, or when they are at home," Rockne once said, ..but I am worried about them when they are playing. Their recreation can be either constructive or destructive.,. 
Thus we see how well Rockne realized that constructive recreation builds better boys for today, better citizens for tomorrow.· 
Knute Rockne's most powerful contacts were with the American boy in his hours of play. And .. Rock" threw all the force of his dynamic personality into providing constructive recreation for that boy. This doesn't mean that Rockne had sentimental ideas on the moral values of games. There was nothing _of the sentimentalist in the man who said that inter.-hall athletics at Notre Dame "must be played in a virile, competitive way with a maxi, mum of color and interest, where both sides are trying hard to win and where it means something to win or lose. I don't believe that innocuous contests between the pancreas and the spleen amount to very much.,. 
Rockne believed in hard play and in victory. But he. 

The Main Entrance 
believed also in cleanness, and high purpose, and sports, 
manship; and he gave those intangible elements, a ~ivid 
realty for a multitude of Americans, and more especially 
for American youth. 
A great deal of thought has been given to the plans for 
the Rockne Memorial by a large number of Knute's 
friends both within and without the university. From 
their earliest consideration of the project, these men who 
knew Rockne intimately felt that a memorial raised in his 
name should meet three fundamental requirements. 
First, the structure should be a living memorial. A 
mere monument to Rockne is unthinkable. His memorial 
should be associated with life, with the constant sound of 
voices, and with intense activity. It should be a place of 
joy, not sorrow. It should be a place fundamentally apart, 
yet in the midst of men. 
Secondly, it should be closely identified with his life work. What was his first interest at Notre Dame? Was it the varsitY football player? No, it was the individual boy-:-whoever he might be-and the way in which he spent his hours of recreation. Rock wanted that· boy to have every possible opportunity to develop manly at, tributes through sports activities. He personally super, vised the system of inter,hall athletics by which the stu, · dent body of Notre Dame as a whole is drawn actively ,.. into healthful competitive sports. The fact that Rockne had a few stars on his first string football squad did not interest him half so much as the knowledge that 500 young men and boys were playing football-good or bad -every autumn. · · 
This inter,hall system that Rockne so ardently cham, pioned, and which dates back to the 'eighties. when Brother Paul organized a football team in Brownson hall, long ago pointed the way to what is now a major em, phasis in collegiate athletics all over. the country: intra, mural sports. This system of athletics for everyone-the spirit that it fosters and the character that it builds­was Rockne's real concern. 
And third, the memorial should be something that Rockne himself would have endorsed, ~omething that would have gladdened his heart. 
The Rockne memorial field house ideally meets these three conditions. It will most assuredly be a living me, morial, the daily gathering place of hundreds of young students, a .place to be remembered by all Notre Dame men long after their college years. The field house will be so much more a living memorial than, for instance, a stadium that is used, perhaps, for only five afternoons out of 365. 
As designed, the field house will be the very center of inter,hall athletics. Here will be the squash, handball, and basketball courts, the swimming pool, rooms in which to work with gymnasium apparatus, rooms for boxit:Ig, wrestling, and other sports. The field house has not been planned for the varsity men, but is intended primarily for the other students who are equally enthusiastic about sports, even if they are less skillful.

.. There is one school, however, which deserves that first mention, if any at all is given.

This Mount St. Charles college team not only walked away with the state intercollegiate football title of Mon... tana, but ended its season undefeated and unscored on. 
Bill Jones in his first year of coaching outside of Notre Dame prepped his team so well that they went through a tough six...game schedule, dropping each team as they went along, amassing a total of 192 points.

This year Alabama was nearly as successful, knocking off eight of their opponents and losing only to Tennessee, 25' to 0. Tennessee had an undefeated and untied· team until it met Kentucky on Thanksgiving day..The Col­onels tied them at six-all.

The only loss was a tough 13 to 0 one to Cornell. Previous to that encounter, Columbia had waded through Middlebury, Union, Wesleyan, Dartmouth and Williams. After the defeat, the team successively trampled Virginia and Brown, Syracuse holding them scoreless in the finale.

first honors in the Midwest Conference. Purdue's only 
defeat came at the hands of Wisconsin, with the Boiler­
makers on the short end of a 21 to 14 contest. 
. Meanwhile on the west coast Jimmy Phelan h<1;d bet­
ter than fair success with his Washington outfit, winning 
five games, dropping two and tying one.. Southern Cali­
fornia, conquerors of the Fighting Irish, were to meet 
Phelan's eleven on December S' in the concluding game of 
the season for the Seattle outfit. 
Attracting the attention of the entire country for their 
early-season upset of the Trojans, little St. Mary's (now 
grown to proportions of 5'00 or more) continues merrily 
on its way under the guidance of Edward ··slip" Madi­
gan, bowling over its opponents for a total of six wins 
arid two losses. ·one game remained. with Southern 
Methodist on the coast, Dec. 5'. 
Madigan's Gaels have compiled . the enviable record 
of 5'7 victories in 73 contests. His 'outfit last year was 
the first team to defeat Fordham in three years. Besides 
trouncing Southern California this year, the Gaels tripped · up California the week follo"wing, 14 to 0. 
Turning the spotlight from the west coast to the east­
ern end of the country for a moment, we find that Yale's 
impressive record of five wins, one loss and two ties was 
due in great measure to the efforts of Adam Walsh and 
Paul {Bucky) O'Connor as assistant coaches. 
Yale trimmed its traditional foes, Harvard and Prince­
ton, and tied Dartmouth in that 33-33 game which every· 
one will remember because of its freakishness, and Army, , 6 to 6, losing only to Georgia, 26 to 7. · 
. Georgia, incidentally, under the guidance of Head 
Coach Harry Mehre, assisted by Rex Enright and Ted 
Twomey, ,(a trio of corking-good N. D. men) bids for 
honors with eight wins, one loss and one game to go, 
that with Southern California on December 12. 
Getting back to Mehre's Georgia lads, the record shows 
they lost only to the undefeated Tulane outfit, 20 to 7. 
The wins over Yale, 26 to 7; Vanderbilt, 9 to 0; Florida, 
33 to 6; New York university, 7 to 6; Auburn, 12 to 6; 
and Georgia Tech, 35' to. 6, loom as one of the nation's · outstanding football seasons. 
Knute Rockne's teammate and football builder, Gus 
Dorais, had another successful team at the University of 
Detroit. Gus has won three-fourths of his games since 
he became head coach at De"troit. This year his outfit won 
seven, lost only to Fordham· in an upset, 39 to 9, and 
played Villanova to a scoreless tie. Such traditional rivals 
as Marquette, Loyola of New Orleans, Michigan State 
and Georgetown were taken in easy f~shion.

The Punch Back of Notre Dame 
By NEIL HuRLEY Editor, NOTRE DAME ScHOLASTIC 
T
HE spirit of Notre Dame, that etherial, intangible intrepidity that has received so much attention lately on the talking screen and on the sporting pages, will never be defined.
. I This rambling article, if it attempted to analyze that spirit, would fail as completely and conclusively as did the Hollywood producers or the newsmen who spent
I 
\yeeks on the campus in an effort to find out what wasI the fighting punch back of the Fighting Irish. .i I don't know what it is, nor does anyone else. But 
,! somewhere hovering over the shiny new stadium and clear back to the tower of Lyons hall, there is something in the air that makes you want to yell like the devil when the band thumps out the Victory March, or when capable little Joe Kennedy picks up that tremendously big mega-­phone and shouts for a bit of pepper. 
Notre Dame students, familiar with the method of feting grid champions, revived an old custom this season that was shelved three years ago, when a riotous student body gathered at the railroad station late in November to greet a vanquished football eleven. 
Not since a fighting, clawing Southern California eleven turned the tables in 1928 has a Notre Dame team trotted 
·,, 
i . t 
into the shower,room on the short end of a score. It was a new experience, both for the team and the student body . 
Previously, in the hey--day of the Fighting Irish foot, ball supremacy, the students had many' times vehemently pledged their loyalty to their grid warriors, when in the over,wrought atmosphere of the peP. rally, like ancient tribal braves, they chanted their gutteral yells of faith. 
They enthusiastically repeated their allegiance formula on the Friday night before the Southern California game, when assembled by the band, 3,000 of them wildly crashed through the slim portals of the gymnasium. There, in a blaze of red and blue flares, they roared their defiance and pledged again their loyalty to their team, who faced them on the straight, uncomfortable wooden benches of the speaker's platform. 
And just 24 hours later this reign of raging enthusiasm, they were called 1Upon to ·prove that loyalty they had so easily promised in their exultant mood of 'the previous evening. . 
Again one week later, when a dejeCted, strangely silent, and disappointed handful of 38 players straggled off their special cars in South Bend directly from New York, the 

<.\'• 
OFFICIAL FooTBALL REVIEW-1931-Universil.Y of Noire Dame 
students were once again called upon to show their colors. 
Defeat is not often mentioned at Notre Dame. It 
rarely happens. The victories had become so chronic that 
juniors had never seen their team trampled in defeat. 
But when it did come, when two powerful elevens piled 
up sufficient pointage to eke out hard-earned victories, 
the students proved their loyalty in a wave of spirit that 
induced 2,500 of them to walk seven miles to the Union 
station and back at eight o'clock in the morning to greet 
the players on their return from New York. Knute 
Rockne's jus~ly famous phrase rang through them: ..No 
team is great until it has been defeated at least once.,, 
Were this the only criterion of greatness they might 
well begin to chisel the memorial now to this 193 1 squa_d, 
for they were as valiant in defeat as they were when they 
smashed through opponent's lines for victorious conquests. 
There was no crying in the grid camp here. Students, ·assembled for dinner on both evenings, clapped longet• 
and louder than is their traditional custom. Disappointed 
and dejected, they nevertheless understood. 
The riotous march from the train after the Army game 
wound its way through the South Bend streets behind 
Drum Major Henry Tholen and the University band in a 
wild homecoming celebration. 
There was, too, the routine and orthodox campus en• 
thusiasm, but to me the spirit of a defeated Notre Dame 
student. body, keenly feeling the loss of two stirring 
struggles, is the keynote of the fall season, when one 
speaks of pep. 
As a matter of record, however, let it be said that 
there were the usual pep rallies, the same thrilling ora· 
tors, .and the customary nocturnal campus parades. Stu· 
dents, assembled by notes from the splendid band of Prof. 
Joseph Casasanta, sang as loudly and cheered as lustily as in former years. 
The undergraduates, furthermore, flocked unanimously to the stadium on the occasion of the Rockne Memorial game to witness a burlesque struggle between the varsity and the reserves 'way back in September, when. '"Hunk, Anderson's all· American prospects were a lot of rangy, untrained youths. 
The students, as a further matter of record, co-oper· ated sincerely with Chairman Herbert P. Giorgio and John Kramer of the Student Activities council, together with. Blue Circle Leader John Perone. They were be· hind the team from the moment of the Indiana clash early in October until the: time when the cadets of West Point marched off the gridiron in the polo grounds a few weeks ago. 
They crowded the pews of Sacred Heart church each Saturday morning, and 3,000 young chaps weekly knelt at the Communion rail, as the traditional football mass was celebrated. 
This is routine. This is what is expected. Notre Dame men traditionally have cheered long and loud. But to me, that dauntless spirit that rushed to the foreground following two whirlwind defeats characterized this much discussed spirit behind the team. 
There is a subtle sureness, you see, among Notre Dame men about their football teams. It's not a conceited smug· ness always confident of victory. It is rather a se• cure knowledge that a well-played, hard-fought grid· iron tussle will always result, and that if Notre Dame does not win, the best team will walk off the field on the long end of the score. 
That's the spirit of Notre Dame.

HILE the more ambitious are busy mulling over the reports of scouts, coaches, press agents, ot~er writers, and their own notes in an effort to ptck representative all-American elevens, we are attempting to complete as impossible a task in naming the eleven out­standing men among Notre Dame·s 1931 opponents. 
One of the best things about our job is that with a mere sweep of the hand, we eliminate several hundred thousands of worthy players who were not lucky enough to play against Notre Dame and thereby become ~ligible 
·for our humble consideration. ·. 
Another element which makes the task easier is the co-operation of the Notre Dame coaches, scouts, and play· ers (four of whom are all· American on one team and another) and the Review staff (one member of which, Joe Kurth, is a favorite of the gods who pick the my~hi­
cal teams). 
Notwithstanding this aid, without which we should be at an utter loss whom to choose, the job is a difficult one. In only four instances was a man so scintillating against Notre Dame and in other games that there was not lengthy consideration as to who should get the call. 
John Baker, left guard, the only man to repeat ·on ou.r team after having been named last year, was a unam­mous choice. After the reams of publicity that have gone his way as a result of his masterful "place-kick for Southern California on which the tide of that game ebbed from ·the Mississippi basin to wash up on the beaches of Los Angeles, the distinction we may give him is probably negligible. But he may get some satisfacti?n out of knowing that Notre Dame do:s not regard hun as a one-play star. We picked him last year whe1_1 No­tre Dame won, 27 to 0, as the outstandmg man 111 the Trojan line. We pick him again for the same reason. And you·re good enough for any all·American if you're the best in that great set of forwards. 
Ernest (Pug) Rentner, Northwestern's . versatile half· 
back, was another popular choice. He, l~ke Baker, has 
been named almost unanimously all·Amencan. Not es· 
pecially effective against the Irish, he can~e back i~'l. othct• 
games under weather conditions more smtcd to Ius great 
passing and broken field running to establish himself as one of the season·s two great backs, the other being, if you will pardon us, our own Mr. Schwartz. 
And this boy, Ray Stecker, of Army at the other half· back who missed the mythical teams because most of them were already in type before the Army-Notre Dame game, stood head and shoulders above all other contenders in the minds of those who helped us with these selections. He showed his true ability when he caught Brown·s pass and ran to the seven·yard line against Notre Dame and again on one of the most brilliant open field jaunts in the history of the traditional series after slicing through tackle to elude four secondary men. 
Ralph Daugherty, the backbone of a great Pittsburgh line, wins the center berth going away. A two-year veteran, he played brilliantly against Notre Dame and provided the spark for the greatest seven-cylinder ma­chine in the East in other contests. 
These four, we have said, were a quartet that simply could not have been left off. At the other positions, there was some doubt, but the team is representative. 
At left end, Capt. John Briley of Drake carries on ·for the Bulldogs, \vl10 have been represented in both of the last two years. .Even in an overwhelming defeat, his class was evident and he is given a slight edge over such other stars as Sparling of Southern California, King of Army, Hirshberg of Pitt, and Lyons of Indiana. 
Garrett Arbclbide, Southern California, right end, rose to the heights against Notre Dame after playing brilliant ball all season. He was injured early in the 1930 game and was removed; feeling that he had a score to settle, he battled nearly the entire time last fall, stop'ping every· thing sent in his direction. 
The tackles presented by far the most brilliant array of talent and were subsequently the hardest selections to make. Northwestern, Pittsburgh, Army, and Southern California. were all blessed with men of iron at not .only one tackle, but both. There had been some doubt which of the \Vildcat huskies really was the better, Jack Riley or Capt. Dallas Marvil. Marvil, we arc told, started slower but passed Riley as the season progressed. But

The Managers 

CHARLES P. WEISS 
Associate Manager 
A 
CRISP November afternoon ... A stadium over.­flowing ·with an eager audience ... An air of ex.­pectancy . . . Ushers at the point of despair be.­
:~ i! 
cause of Oh!.-fm,in,the,wrong.-seat patrons ... Chaos the theme and the master of the theme ... The gridiron dotted with hurrying figures, sorting sweatshirts, spreading blan"' kets, placing chairs for the coaches-doing a hundred and one other tasks ... A crescendo of ••yeahs" as the Blue and Gold trot out on the field-all these signify the ••big game", -the day of Football the King. 
The glory of the team has been blazoned by a thousand heralds. But when and where has a newspaper article been written on the business backbone of an eleven-the managers? Who are those hurrying figures? Who are the masters of the chaos? In reality, there is no chaos for a guiding hand is ever present. It is that of the managers. Why does each fan see the game from his properly or, dained seat? The managers are responsible for this be, 
,cause of their careful selection of the best ,ushers and gate, men that can be had. Practically every detail connected with the stadium is taken care of by the managers. Equip' ment is ~ared for by them, itineraries for tdps are made by these men, who have charge of trips. A volume of work, equal to that found in any big business house, is done by the managers. ' . 
Back in the good old days Notre Dame had its first foot .. ball team, composed of several tons of eye,gouging, rib, cracking beef. Such things as uniforms and equipment weren't thought of. Naturally, there was no manager's assoc1at10n. But when someone discove'red that the game might be made a little safer if the players wore some pro, tection, 11 hideous outfits called football suits were pur~ chased. The weight of these was so grea·t that it was then found that the men would wear out all their energy if they had to carry them on trips. As a result of this discovery, someone volunteered to act in a managerial capacity.

Various students were in charge until Brother Paul took over the job. In 1897, it became a part of the coach's duties. As time passed by and the number of players grew larger, the strain of being a mentor, manager, trainer, care· taker and almost everything else connected with an athletic association was too great for the coach. Consequently he had to relinquish a good deal of his work to some re· sponsible students. · 
The year 1919 brought about the big change. The .. lit· tie school near South Bend" was making itself known through the exploits of one George Gipp. ..Rock" realized the need for an efficient body of students to help him handle his teams. Accordingly, he organized that group which is now known as the Notre Dame Managers' asso·. ciation. His plans and methods for controlling such an · organization are carried out now because they are the b:::st possible. 
The manner of choosing the members of this organiza· tion gives another ~xample of .. Rock's" ingenuity. Every principle is aimed toward better co-operation. Each year 
· a call for energetic freshmen is issued. From the number who respond to this call, the 15' most diligent, personable, responsible, efficient and hard-working men are given numerals at the end of the year and appointed to the Managers • association for the second season as sophomore managers. For the junior year, seven of these are chosen carefully to fill a more important position. These seven are retained when they become Seniors and are put in complete charge of some sport, according to their respective merits. 
Again this yea·r, the Managers' association is one of the most active bodies Notre Dame has on the campus. This is due without a doubt to the efforts of the senior man· agers. John A. Grams is the .. head man." Those who appointed him made no mistake in their choice. His ex· cellent ability and work in the past four years are the rea• sons for his present occupancy of· this position. Joe E. McKean and Charles Weiss are the two associate man· agers of football. Joe, that genial southern gentleman with the cheery smile, has personal charge of the managers and the equipment as duties. ..Charlie" Weiss, a clear-headed organizer, takes care of the stadium. In addition to these duties, Grams is president of the Ushers' club, while Weiss is secretary-treasurer. 
Charles Spangenberg is basketball manager. John Ross manages track and John Colville takes care of the baseball team. 
But one may be inclined to ask, ..What is a manager's recompense? What is his reward for doing such a great amount of work?" The late C9ach Rockne gave the an• swer in a few words one evening at a testim::m!al banquet for the managers. ..A Notre Dame manager," he said, ''is, at graduation, approximately two and one-half years ahead of the other members of his class." ·The explanation of this is simple. During the time of his service, the man· ager has learned how to work. C~:msequently, he can make men work for him. He learns how to handle people and make them feel that they have been treated courteously. It is ·just the same as working on a job after graduation.

Your men of Notre Dame couldn't pull this one out of the fire, Rock. The boys just streamed through the players' ramp far below in this great stadium you built, and for the first time since 1928, Rock, they left with tears in their eyes. Your old rivals, Howard Jones and a stout.. hearted band of boys from far out in Los Angeles, turned the trick in as brilliant style as you yourself might have dreamed. There wasn't anything your boys could do about it, Rock. 
·It was the Trojans who took the chances, Rock. In a way they stole a leaf from your book when, with a min­ute to play,. they gambled on a goal from the field rather than another running formation. And it worked, oh, so beautifully. Young Johnny Baker was the fellow who put that ball over the cross bars at dead center. The score, Rock, was 16 to 14. 
But don't think those boys of yours threw you down. They were fighting for you as they never have fought before but these Trojans had a score 'to· settle. Remem· ber last season out· at Los Angeles. Remember how you let them have it. They've settled that score, now, Rock, and the books balance. They summoned all the power and strategy at their command. It worked arid perfectly. Hunk couldn't do a thing about it. ·Maybe if he had had more time he could have rallied the boys just once more. But there was only a minute to play when that ball sailed through those uprights.. 
It was a good game of football, Rock. The kind you would like. Remembe.r the Northwestern game last year, it was about like that one for the first half. Your boys went to the dressing room at the half with a seven-point lead,· thanks to a touchdown late in the second period. And when they came back, they came back like sons of Rockne. After getting the ball, they· scored a touchdown in exactly four plays, going 60 yards. This boy, Charles Jaskwhich, booted both ·goals after touchdown. Young Baker missed the goal on the T.t~ojans' first one. He made the second and I've already told you about that field goal. 
I can't aescribe it, Rock. ; It was sickening to most of these 52,000 people who filled 'your dream structure Sat· urday. Why long after the teams had left the. field they just stood there and waited. Couldn't seem to believe their eyes. But Hunk rushed. across the· field to ~ongratu· late Howard and after that was over, the crowd finally started for the ramps.

NOTRE DAME 25 INDIANA 0 
· Indiana each year, whether the team  be good  or  only fair,  
has one good game in its system.  It .has shown this to be true  
by registering some of the surprise defeats of the Big Ten con,

When Notre Dame went  down  to  Bloomington "with the  
eyes of the world focused upon it,, to open another football  
campaign, Indiana had not had time under its new coach, E. C.  
Hayes,  to  perfect its offense.  Its greatest game  was  to  come

Rain. 
This one word sums up better than a volume of terms about the contest itself the Notre Dame-Northwestern game of­1931. It wasn't an ordinary rain, none of your drizzles or light showers.

Roark Bradford probably would have called it a .. gully­washin, trash-liftin' rain." It beat on the tin roofs of the press coops, it streamed down the windows of the radio booths, it splashed and splattered on the cement steps, it trickled off umbrellas and slouch hats, it dribbled down people's backs like a dagger of ice.

Riding along at the peak of its early season form, the Notre Dame football machine rolled into, over, and past Drake with· out a sign of hesitation. The score, 63 to 0, was the greatest piled up by the Irish in the brief but brilliant series with the Bulldogs. 
'"The team I sent in there," said Coach Ossie Solem of Drake, '"was ~ better one than some of the teams I have sent against them before. Don't think my boys gave up, they did their best. Briefly, we were simply outclassed." 
In this simple statement there is food for thought.

··why I would be almost willing to bet that no team scores on that line this season," said Solem. This was a big statement to make, but Solem had grounds for it. Had Notre Dame been able to do the impossible and remain as defensively rigid, no one would have scored. 
One other thing must be taken into consideration. At this early stage of the season, Coach Anderson had practi· varsity, the second and third tearris fought on just as hard and brilliantly as the regulars. 

There was no stopping them-even in the late minutes of the game, they knew that the ·coaches would not re· lax their vigilant watch, that every move made on the field counted, and they went on 'ruthlessly to trample but not humiliate a typically fighting Bulldog team.

Irish Blast Pitt Panthers' Hopes 
Heroes of the Day 
Pitt's great fighting Panthers came to Notre Dame sure that they could avenge the licking handed them in 1930 by the national cham· pions. They had a veteran team and they would not be demorali2:ed by anything as they were by Schwart:z:'s 60·yard run on the first play last year. 
Charley Jaskwhich's great catch of Schwart:z:'s long pass for the second touchdown scored on Pitt last fall gave them an indication that they might be wrong. They were never completely convinced until the final whistle had blown, but the great defensive work of Joe Kurth at right tackle had them doubting their ability all through the game. 
Jaskwhich ran the team flawlessly. He caught punts and ran them back; he blocked like a demon, and proved himself great by calling his own signal and then going out to catch the pass that proved his judgment sound. 
Kurth, playing against doctor's orders, turned in one of the most brilliant defensive games of his career. He spent three days in the hospital as a result of the. game, but he had carried on as "Rock" would have wanted him to.

Carnegie, by winning only two games out of seven played 
with Notre Dame, has won itself the reputation of being the 
most likely. to topple the Irish when the latter are at their

11Hunk11 Anderson Aven_ges '28 Defeat 

Heroes of the Day 
Success is fast in coming to some, slow in coming to others. Bernie Leahy had played two years at left halfback for Notre Dame before he decided to shift to fullback. 
Against Carnegie Tech in· his third year of competition, Bernie got the break he had wanted and came into his own in no uncertain way. He scored the second touchdown of the day after his nine-yard run with Tech tacklers dragging behind him had left the ball on the two yard line. He came back later and with Mike Koken conducted a march to the 13·yard line where Koken lateraled to him for a third score. 
George Melinkovich is one to whom success was fast in coming. He showed his wares against Northwestern and Drake, but attracted greatest notice to the beautiful way he smashes into a line when Notre Dame played Carnegie. He went in after Leahy had scored twice. He proved just as tough as Bernie and was not long in establishing himself without a doubt as Notre Dame's 1931 varsity fullback.

Penn is Ground Under· Juggernaut 

Heroes of the Day 
There are two hard workers on the Notre Dame squad who have never received their full share of credit except from the players and coaches. Paul Host, who has played two years at left end under Ed Kosky, and AI Culver, who finished his career as varsity left tackle last fall, team together about as nicely as any coach could wish them to. 
In the Penn game, Host made one of the m~st brilliant plays of the season when he snatched an 11,yard pass from Mike Koken out of the arms of three Penn defenders and dragged one of them three yards across the goal line to score. Besides being the best pass receiver on the squad, Host is a wildcat on defense and· hard,charging blocker. 
Culver, injured early in the season, fought his way back up to the varsity over a ncar-all· American . rival time and again during the year. His was the spirit of a thoroughbred and his showing in the Carnegie game, when injured, proved this more perhaps than any game of the year.

Heroes of the Day 
Undisputed claims to all-American recogni­tion were made by two Notre Dame stalwarts who were greater in defeat, if possible," than they had ever been in victory. 
Marchy Schwartz went into the .Southern California game fully aware that he would be called upon to play the full 60 minutes because his understudy, Mike Kokcn had been injured the week before. But, without sparing himself, he ran, blocked, passed, kicked, tackled, and otherwise carried on as Notre Dame fans had come to expect him to perform. 
Joe Kurth played an inspirational game from the opening kickoff until Coach Anderson saw fit to relieve him in the late minutes.· Most of Schwartz's long gains were through his position, the Trojans failed to register a single advance through his position, he blocked Baker's first at• tempted conversion after touchdown, he recov­ered Musick's fumble on the three-yard line in the first quarter, and he was down on almost every punt to make the tackle.

It. was· justice come home to roost, for Baker's first at, tempt to kick goal after touchdown was blocked. It had seemed that for the fourth time in the six years of com, petition between the two schools, Notre Dame was to win by the margin of a point after touchdown. 
Southern California was thoroughly beaten until the 
_.. 
last few minutes of the third period. The Trojans had I' combined three penalties on Notre Dame to advance to ! the 2,yard line early in the first period, but they were outplayed over the rest of the route-that is until they gathered their. forces for their last surge which ripped Notre Dame's defense to ribbons in the final period. 
After: making first down on Notre Dame's 2,yard line 
in the first period, Jim Musick, South, ern California fullback, fumbled and the ball was recovered by Joe Kurth, Notre Dame right tackle, who played an all-America game until he was taken out in the ·final period. 
Notre Dame was halted briefly.· Schwartz punted out o~ California's 11,yard line. Mohler's return kick traveled to Notre Dame's. 45,yard line, and then the Irish began the sweep to their first score. · 
Steve Banas, Irish fullback, ripped off 13 yards. Schwartz passed 26 yards to Charley Jaskwhich, who was downed on the Trojan's 17,yard line. Schwartz picked up a yard. Ray Bran, 
cheau, reserve right halfback, gained five yards. Schwartz slashed off the Trojan's left side for seven yards and first down on the four-yard line. Then Banas plunged to the one,yard line. On the succeeding play, Banas dived over a mass of players for the touchdown. With only a min, ute .and a half left to play in the first half, Jaskwhich kicked goal and Notre Dame led, 7 to 0.

NOTRE DAME 0 ARMY 12 
At the close of the 1930 football season, the late Knute Rockne said, "We shall probably lose two games next year. You can't lose men like Carideo, Mullins, and Brill in the }:,ackfield and linemen like Conley, Metzger, and Kassis and not 
feel it.,, · As Notre Dame swept on through its early games, hit the toughest teams in the East in stride and won, and then went on only to lose by two points to Southern California, the critics attributed Rockne's statement to strategy. Even with Rockne gone and with "Hunk,, Anderson carrying on, everyone was confident that the Irish would bounce right back and push Army all over the field at will. They failed to take into consideration ma_ny things. First, the Army,Notre Dame series is the oldest traditional football series in Notre Dame history, at least when teams are consid, ered that are on Notre Dame's schedule consistently year after year and not those who are played for two or three years and then dropped_ for a decade and put back on. And anything can happen when tradition is called upon. What would the college novelists do if this were not so? True, Notre· Dame had beaten Pitt by two touchdowns and the Panthers ·had defeated Army by four seven,pointers. But 
the Irish had beaten Pitt through the air and Pitt had

Army Blanks Notre Dame 1n Upset 
Heroes of the Day 
Two boys from Washington, the only ones on the Notre Dame squad, closed their careers gloriously on the muddy turf of Yankee stadium against Notre Dame's most respected foe. 
Capt. Tommy Yarr, center, was in the game the full route and played the same heads•up game that distinguished him in 1930 in the opening game when he was first striving for recognition. He had been a wild, care•free sort of boy when elected captain, but the responsi· bilities of the position sobered him and brought him into a kind of manhood that all of us would like to enjoy. Rugged and genial, he in• spired the men to fight against Army until the closing whistle. His courage in his last game was typical of his play all season. 
And everything said about Tommy Yarr goes for Frank Nordy Hoffmann, who played right next to him. Hoffmann was slowed up in the last three games by torn ligaments in his knee. When the Army game came, it was doubted whether he would be able to play. But play he did until finally he was carried from the field.

AN APPRECIATION 
Knutc Rockne was the man who made the first Official Football Review possible. Not only did his great teams in the· early days of his coaching career arouse the interest that would make the sale of the book great enough to cover the expenses of production, but he conceived the idea of such a book and appointed the men to publish, edit, and manage it. · 
Now the Review, continuing without Rockne, makes its gesture or recognition, all too unworthy, to the memory of this great friend. In these pages, the staff has tried accurately to portray the many angles of Rockne's kaleidoscopic career. Others have written his life and his autobiography has been published. The Review has tried to sum up his activities at the glorious height of his career, at the same time doing him honor. 
Many friends of Notre Dame made this book possible. First, we want to thank the patrons, advertisers, and buyers of the book who made sacrifices during a time of depression to help in the financing of the book. 
Many of the country's best known writers and leaders in other fields gave willingly of their time and talents to make the editorial content of the book what it is. The Review. unable to give them anything else in return, offers them its sincere thanks and its appreciation of the time, effort, and trouble their contributions cost them. · 
Paul D. Hoffmann, vice-president of the Studebaker corporation which recently announced its new Rockne six; Ted Husing, Columbia Broadcasting System's crack sports announcer; Pat Flanagan, a member of the Columbia family with WBBM, Chicago; the Rev. Charles L. O'Donnell, C. S. C., president of the university; Jesse C. Harper, director of athletics; Coach "Hunk" Anderson, Capt. Tommy Yarr, and James E. Armstrong, Notre Dame alumni secretary, all willingly contributed to the success of the Review by turning their other talents to writing. 
Fcg Murray, United Features' great sports cartoonist, again responded eagerly to our· request that he .be represented with us again. Werner Laufer, NEA Service artist, made a like response. 
So many famous writers offered their services that we do not know where nor how to begin thanking them. Perhaps, charity beginning at home, we should thank Arch Ward, sports editor of the Chicago Tribune, Rockne's "first publicity man,· who sketched for the Review the picture of Rockne's early days on the campus. 
Warren Brown, sports editor of the Chicago Herald and Examiner, made his annual contribution, a resume of Rockne's relationship with other coaches in the country. Christy Walsh, head of the syndicate for which Rockne wrote, took time in the midst of his pressing duties of the late football season to show that Rockne could have been as great a newspaperman as he was in the coaching field. 
Lawrence Perry, whose previous articles on the spiritual something behind Notre Dame prompted us to ask him to write a special story for this year's edition, although not a Catholic, describes brilliantly Rockne's spiritual side. Frank E. Hering, a member of the fold at Notre Dame, chairman of publicity for the Rockne memorial fund, and past president of the Notre Dame alumni association, took time during the middle of the memorial drive to pen his vivid description of the field house being erected in Rockne's memory. 
_Rockne's connection with Eastern football is shown in most scintillating form by Bill Cunningham, Dart· mouth's all-American center of a few years back. George Trevor, another of the outstanding writers of the sea• board with the New York Sun gave permission to the Review to reprint his admirable article, written just after 
Rockne's death. 
Grantland Rice, unable to write a special story because of his many more exacting duties during the foot· ball season, gladly gave permission to reprint his brilliant story on the Army game and his introductory. poem. Two representatives of Iowa papers, no less able because of the fact that they arc not in larger . cities, are included for the interesting expression of their reaction to the Southern California game. They. are Bert McGrane of the Des Moines Register and Edwin Moore, Jr., of the Waterloo Courier. 
To the following writers whose stories we judged the best written on each game,_ we are also indebted for their kind permission to reprint their works: Alan· Gould, Associated Press; Francis Wallace, Notre Dame graduate with the New York Daily News; Harry MacNamara and Jack Elder, the latter a former Notre Dame· star, of the Chicago Herald and Examiner; Gordon Mackay, Philadelphia Record; Irving Va'!ghan, Chicago . 'Tribune; Harry Cross, New York Herald-Tribune; and George Kirksey, United Press. 
The following c~mpus writers, who show such encouraging promise of future renown in their Review articles, also merit our warmest thanks. Robert E. Gorman, editor, and Joseph Lopker, art editor, Notre Dame Juggler; Neil C. Hurley, editor Notre Dame Scholastic; John A. Kiener, director of public relations; William Carr, James McFceley, Walter Kennedy, George Belting, J. A. McElligott, and Edward Brennan compose our staff of loyal campus contributors. 
To the following athletic publicity directors we arc also indebted for getting from their. coaches and captains the statements which embellish the pages of the st>ction. devoted to games, as well as.-sending us the pictures of these men: Frank R. Elliott, Indiana; Walter Paulison, Northwestern; E. C .. Lyhon, Drake; Charles Kenny, Pittsburgh; Joseph T. Labrum, Pennsylvania; Max E. Hannum, Carnegie Tech; Lieut. Comm. R. L. Hall, U. S. C., Navy; Alfred F. Wesson, Southern California; and Capt. W. H. Wells, Army.. Needless to say, we thank the coaches and captains themselves for making these utterances when busily concerned with their next week's games. · 
We also wish to thank James Kearns, sports editor of the Notre· Dame Scholastic for ·his help during the season. -J. S. P.

Men Behind the Guns 
By WILLIAM CORR 
The cheering thousands who watch the Irish of Notre Dame play on the fall Saturdays rarely, if ever, give a thought to the men behind the guns. These other pea, pie are the men who make for the comfort of the team and the spectators and who assume charge of the many incidentals that crop up during the course of a season. 
The board of athletic control acts as a supervisory bodyover all athletic matters at Notre Dame. This group is directed by the Rev. Michael M. Mulcaire, C.S.C., vice,president of the university. The secretary is James 
E. McCarthy, dean of the college of commerce. The other members are the Rev. Raymond M. Murch, C.S.C., Rev. Thomas A. Lahey, C.S.C., Rev. Thomas A. Steiner, C.S.C., William Logan Benit:~, and Clarence Manion. These men pass on the athletic schedules of the various teams of the university and have charge of the awarding of monograms for athletic achievement. 
Notre Dame stadium is one of the greatest projects that the board has undertaken. All the planning and· financing of this structure came under the supervision of these men and the great bowl stands as a monument to their labor. 
When we mention the stadium, we cannot forget the business office located in the Administration building. 
· The staff, under the direction of J. Arthur Haley, han, dies all the finances of Notre Dame athletics. The dis, tribution of tickets in the stadium is taken care of by Herbert Jones, assistant business manager, while those coveted ducats to the press box are handled by Joseph Petritz, director of sports publicity. These men ·have the help of a remarkably efficient staff who take care of the innumerable duties such as the de, tails of a trip. Hotel and transportation reservations must be secured beforehand. Meals must be ordered. Plans for diversion on a trip must be carefully cared for. among the many other tasks that fall to the business office. Not the least of the. tasks that Mr. Haley and his staff find on their shoulders is the purchase of all the athletic equipment at the university. Football uniforms, basket, ball uniforms, unif<?rms for every form of athletics, and the necessities for every fprm of sport must be secured. Realizing that the athletic system at Notre Dame covers interhall sport. and freshman teams, this business assumes alarming proportions. · Even if the purchase· is a terrifying thought,· let your mind wander to the consideration of the distribution of this equipment. Anthony Schreiner is the man who has charge of this phase of the work. In a well,appointed room in · the gymnasium all these uniforms are stored. When the fall comes and football is at hand, some 300 youths must be outfitted in four hours. No, you wouldn't like the job any more than we would. But "'Tony, enjoys his work. He even enjoys the packing of trunks when a team goes away on a trip. The care of this equipment at all times comes under the eagle eye of the men in the equipment room. 
When the season is finished they must store away all the trappings that go· to make up the seasonal outfit. A gridmal} has three pairs of shoes in his list of equipment and these must be treated with oil before they can be returned to storage for the winter. That task falls under the domain of the equipment room. 
Added to all these duties is another one that calls for great care. Have you ever had the desire to praise a player right in the middle of a game? Anthony Schreiner has that opportunity offered to him every Saturday after, noon-with a penalty of ---yards attached to it. Yes! He's the water boy. Carrying water isn't the only part of that work since he must also act as the miracle man and revive a fallen warrior in less than two min, utes. First he must diagnose and then prescribe and final.. 
· ly cure. It's a pretty stiff job to complete in two min, utes, and you can't allow time for recuperation. All the miles of tape handled and used on Notre Dame men are not in the care of Mr. Schreiner, however. Eu.. gene Young, more familiarly known as ..Scrapiron,, has 

h 
i' 
Eugene (Scrapiroil) "Yourig 
to take care of the athletes before they ever ·look at the opposition. His work is done in the dressing room~ Rub, downs, liniment, alcohol, (no, not that kind), sun, lamps and similar paraphernalia are his equipm~nt. 
That the Notre Dame team is able to go through the · bruising schedule it faces without serious injury is due to the care of Young, and his assistants, headed by Ray DeCook. These ·men look out for limps, bruises, sprains, and the many other ailments that befall the football player during the course of a stormy season. 
Although these men receive. none of the publicity ac, corded to the coaches, the players, the band, and the other !. color attractions of intercollegiate football, they are an integral part of every good system and must not be for.. gotten when praise is offered for ·a successful season. They are truly "'the men behind the guns., Without these men the team might win games but it is doubtful if the season would be successful. 
All but the board of athletic control rose to high points of efficiency under the genius of the late Knute Rockne· and it" is for Rockne that they will carry on. These de.. partments were the outgrowth of necessity but they owe their development to the man who was a great leader.

A Viking Goes to Rest. 
(Continued from page 51) 
duly, he said: ··when the going gets tough-that's when we like it! Get that ball and go, go, go!" 
They went, s<;oring 14 points in the final ten minutes. It was just one of the many Notre Dame comebacks en, ginee~ed by Rockne's knack of stimulating an apparently beaten eleven. Next time fate pins you against the wall try. saying to yourself: ··when the going gets tough, that's when I like it." It may do some good if you have 
the  will power to  back  up  those  words with Rockne  
••fight."  
Power 'Through Restraint  

Rockne was not a ranter. He scorned the cheap tricks of the professional orator. Experience had taught him the danger of trying to ··key up" a bunch of impression, able boys via verbal fireworks. -He realized that a reac, tion inevitable follows a sustained effort to arouse young, sters through tongue lashings. His vocabulary was pun, gent but never profane. Sarcasm, a terrible weapon in ·his hands, .stung the laggard, the dilettante or the dull witted candidate more sharply than the oaths which movie directors regard as an· inseparable part of a coach's equipment. The reprimand delivered, however, Rockne would temper the sting with a smile. He never broke a boy's spirit. As one. of his players put it-..When Rock smiles you forget the bawling out and would ram your 
head into a concrete wall if he asked you .to., 
While Rockne steered clear of the traditional ••fight talk" he knew how to get an emotional ·response. A practical psychologist, Rockne achieved his effects by subtler methods. Sometimes he employed silence. 
Before the Northwestern game last fall, a contest which Rockne regarded as the season's supreme test, a tomb,like silence prevailed in Notre Dame's dressing room beneath the concrete tower of Dyche Stadium. Nobody spoke as 
· the Irish warriors, grim in their blue and ·gold war trap' 
pings, ·sat on the· wooden benches staririg at the shadows 
cast by the tall, dark lockers. 
That silence, commanded by Rockne, tugged at your ear drums. The creaking of a chair made you jump. Faint echoes of cheering, like sounds from_Mars, accen, tuated the stillness in that Isolated locker room. · 
On the whitewashed wall a clock ticked off th~ min, utes-eighteen of them, unbroken by anything save the soft shuffle of restless feet and the quick breathing of boys under h~gh nervous tension. · 
"Everybody Up" 
Just when you felt you must shout or go crazy, Rockne jumped to his feet: ••Everybody up!". His staccato voice, harsh but not unpleasant, cracked like a machine gun as he called out his starting lineup. ··shift slowly," he 
added.. · ••Keep that cadence down. Play clean and fight!" 
The tension, sustained for eighteen cruel minutes, had been snapped. Conley's men, physically relaxed but mentally on edge, clattered up the runway to face North, western. Silence, you see, can be more eloquent than oaths. 
Rockne had no use for shirkers. At the same time, he w~s more considerate of his players than of himself. He wouldn't permit the varsity to undergo those gruelling practice scrimmages so popular with many of his col, leagues, but he didn't conserve his own nervous energy, depleted though it was by a baffling illness. 
Warned by Father Michael Mulcaire that he ought to curb his ambitiou~ program of work, follow the doctor's orders and settle down to a sedentary, quiet life at South Bend, Rockne replied: ••Father, I'm not built for an in, valid's routine~ If you clip the wild duck's wings, he pines away and dies. I too must fly until I fall." 
His words seem strangely prophetic in the light of what happened on that storm,riven Kansas farm. As long as Rockne had to go, he would have wanted it this way-to die in harness at the flood tide of his success, 
· belqved of all sportsmen. They have buried Rockne's body. They cannot bury his spirit. It lives on in the hearts of all Notre Dame men and of thousands more who never looked upon the golden dome of Notre Dame du Lac. 
Ma-~chy Schwartz, all, American left halfback, led the team in scoring with five touchdowns. His passes led to several others, however, and all of his scores were important. 
Just before we went to press, the Studebaker Corpora, tion of America announced its new Rockne Six which will appear on the market soon.

The Twinkle in Rockne's Eyes · 
. (Cohtlnucd from page 56) . 
hts shoulders, he turned around and started to· climb back into his truck. .. See," exclaimed Rockne, loud enough so the driver could hear him, ..1 knew he was afraid to fight!" 
At times Rockne used his stories to bring very forcibly before his boys some point that he wanted them to re, member. Usually this was done on the spur of the mo.. nient but some times by a pre-arranged plan, where he apparently used one of his star players as the butt of the joke. With-this system he found that his point went home and at the same time, knowing the boys as· he did, he retained the admiration of the chap he had used as a 
· foil. Some times he would tell a story about Carideo. Again it would be about Gipp. But always it was with. the idea in mind of making his listeners get a point that would be for their own good. . 
Rockne told his stories just the same as he coached foot, ball. He told them as hard as he could. By that I mean that_other speakers could get up and tell a story at a.ban, quet and people would politely listen. Rockne would tell the same story and the very forcefulness made you a part of the story. In that way he was really not a story teller but a subtle dramatist. He drew every one to-ward him and .alth.ough ~hey knew they were on the defensive, they gloned lJ?. thetr own attempts to back him into a corner: and make him yell_ ··uncle.,, No one succeeded. · 
Can you imagine Rockne at the bedside of a friend or a companion who might be close to death? He might be in almost a frenzy of sorrow but to help the other fel, low keep his spirits up, he· had that story handy that would just fit the occasion but unlike most story tellers he knew how to tell it at that time. . · 
So much has been said about Rockne's humor that the majority of people. got the impression that he was a50; called funny man. That was not · true.· Rockne could turn a story with a humorous point to it into a barbed shaft just as quickly as he could tell the same story ·and_ ma~e you laugh until you-wanted to roll out ··of . your 
. chair. The whole point about Rockne's humor is the fact· that he knew wh~n, hO\y, and where to tell astory. . 
Now the question anses-what good was all this hu, mor? The whole thing was that it made him worth listen, ing to._ That brought men close to him and infected them · with his el)thusiasm and clear outlook on life. His stories never allowed _you to be down in the mouth. They kept you up on your toes. Men like that were the ones that Rockne wanted around. They became smart football play, ers. They took some of his stones onto the field and used. them on the other fellows to keep him on the de, 
fensive from two standpoints. · · · 
When the other fellow was trying to guess the answer to some quick sally and also trying to guess what the player was going to do next as a football man they were in a double quandary. ' 
Only -one man ever flagrantly disobeyed Rockne. That man was George Gipp. And. although Gipp's death was one of the hardest thirigs Rockne ever had to bear; when he talked about Gipp--. 
You should have seeri the twinkle in Rockne's eyes. 
They'll Be Missing You~ Ro.ckf. 
. (Continued from page 55) 
For a man who was apt to make a . sharp answer, Rockne had few enemies, among his fellow coaches. In; deed, it might be said, and defended, that he had . none at all. · 
In all my dealings with him, I know of but one coach that seemed to irritate him, and he refused to become unduly exercised over him, inasmuch as neither Rockne · himself, _nor Notre Daine, had any direct . dealings with this coach. · . 
. ·_. . (know of one coach, now doing v~ry well out on the Pacific Coast, who was one· of Rockne's -great friends, and one who could be counted upon, invariably, to get ~imself into any _fight that Rockne happened to be wag, mg-verbally, of course. . Through some unfortunate accident, probably tale bearing, this coach ·got the idea, last Fall, that Rockne didn't like him, any more, He was at a ·loss for ·any reason why, and was quite worried about it. · Why he didn't get in communication with Rockne · ·and find o.ut for himself, that it was a misapprehensio~,' I never did know. ·· -· All I can report, is that this coach communicated with. ·me, who happ~ned to be a mutual friend. It happened that, before I had a chance to try and untangle the unfortunate_ mixup, Rockne was booked for a radio interview, in Los Angeles, and Mark Kelly of the Los _Angeles, ..Examiner", and I were scheduled to· ask . him que5tions~ · One of th~m · had to do with Coast coaches: Rockne's· reply to' that was no less_ than a eulogy of the coach .who. had been worried because lie 
thought Rockne was ···off him.'' -. · I couldn't wait to get through with ·the interview arid calL the .coach up. . · · .. Did you hear the boost'Rock gave you?" I asked.-_ 
.. 1 never listen to radio programs,, said the· coach, which. must be something of a record, at that. ·. · . That same .evening~ ·-this coach called on Rockne, an-d 
for a great part of-.the time that he was on the ·coast, 
the· two were together: . 
When the news of. Rockne's death was flashed across -the country, one of the first letters I received, was from this coach. He mourned Rockne's loss as we all did and still do.-But he took some consolati~n, he wrote, 'from the fact that his death hadn't occurred before the chance was afforded for-the clearing up of that unhappy circum' stance brought about by tale, bearing. · · · . . 
This, no ·doubt, is a rather long yvinded incident. But ·-it_shows, I hope, the val~e place_d on· Rockne's friendship,· by. his fellow coaches. . · . . 
The coach in_volved, I might add, was one who had· been standing _on his own feet, and· recognized .. for his own ability, practically as long as Rockne· had. . So you can't· write the incident off as one of fear for what might happen, if a· condition ·actually existed, and continued to exist_, a condition in which Rockne was .. off him." 
,. Rockne .was no bargain for his fellow coaches,. if you an~ to consider that games won are a part of a coach's · existence.

And yet there isn't a one of those, who have sat up at 
. nights trying to figure out, and generally failing, how to stop his teams, who wouldn't trade in all the victory pos.. _ sibilities they ever conceived, to have him back. 
Rockne was more than a coach. He was THE coach, and recogni4ed as such by the very men who were unwilling, in all other cases, to cofl... cede that anyone else was ever more than all square with them, and orie to go.

It was a hard game on the nerves, Rock, and soon as I get this off Tm going to Chicago and eat lots of celery. Remember once you told us celery was a good nerve quieter. 
The Trojans started .off like they were going to make short order of things with a pair of scoring chances but your boys showed 'em that old stuff of fighting with their backs to the wall and the Trojans couldn't get it over. From that point until the third period it belonged to your boys. Then the Trojans, with Shaver and Mohler doing the work, took charge of the party and soon the score was 14 to 13 in your favor.; Then that field goal, Rock. You would be the first to say that it was a honey. 
They remembered you Saturday, Rock. Every person in the stands stood with bared heads in ·your memory as that band played ""Notre Dame, Our Mother." Even telegraph keys stopped clicking clear up here in the press box. And your pals, the newsboys as you c~lled them, managed to get up from their seats and bare their heads.

phoned him in Los Angeles and asked him to be my guest at the Army,Navy game. I wanted Rock to broadcast before and after the halves. He accepted, and came East. Because of recurring pains in his legs, he could not come to the broadcasting location and instead sat with Jimmy Walker in his field box below us. 
We ran a mike down to where he sat. Rock devoted his first chat to a discussion of my virtues, but I never knew this until after the game, as everything he said on the air went out without my being "in, on it. When my operators told me Rock was through speakin~, I'd j~st keep on. Between the halves Rock went on agam and dts'

cussed the game with intense severity, praising here, de, crying there and analyzing everything. Then he predicted that Stecker of the Army was the most dangerous man on the field, and would probably score the only touch, down of the game. How right he was! 
Directly the game . ended, he again bespoke his piece, and a rattling smart bit of radio chatter it was. The way I discovered this was a peculiar one. An upstate New Yorker sent me a dozen double,faced metallic discs on which were recorded my entire broadcast of the Army, Navy game, including Rock's analyzings. These records were such a wallop that I offered them to the Army, and they accepted them as a living memory of our great friend. · 
Rock knew the limitations of football reporting by radio and ~e oft~n sat and discussed for many moments, in such places as his office, the Notre Dame lunch roo?I, the Pittsburgh dressing room and countless other locat10ns, 'a 
· possible method of . stabilizing football revisualizations. He never feared giving me his entire catalogue of plays, his starting lineups, shock troops or not nor any other relevant information which he knew we had to have for immediate positive dissemination to the radio throngs tuned in. We needed all the dope, quite <11 while in ad, vance. He never felt that it was time wasted to run his plays over and over again for the radio announcer-for he felt that a good broadcast meant excellent public ac, ceptance of the famed Nomads of India_na. . .

mind. ·The first came when Les Quailey, my assistant, 
and I went out to the ,field to study: the Rockne system. 
Impetuously, I ran out through the teams to yell a big 
··Hello" to him. Quailey, formerly a collegiate quarterback, grabbed my arm and softly growled, .. Hey, you sap! A coach never wants to be bothered when .he's busy." Which incident.. ally is very true. But Rockne turned from his charges · for a moment and shouted a big .. Hello" in return and motioned that he'd be with me in a few moments. Reali~.. ing that I'd been a blundering idiot, and somewhat abashed at my stupidity, I felt quite .. hicky" for a moment, but when I considered that Rock would let very little perturb him, I felt a heap better. Rock, in the radio stations or at any place I ever saw him, never failed to enthuse over ineeting a new acquaint, ance. He was very patient under the most trying condi.­tions. He answered questions wheth.er plied by -intellec, tuals or morons, for he reali~ed that his reputation, in the mind of each person. he met, rested in the impression he gave. 
In the studios of WJAS in Pittsburgh one night, Rock was on the air. I was called ovet to ask him a question (which would be· called a time-filler in my radio Jan.. gauge), since the· regular set program had been exhausted and there was still time to go. I asked Rock, ..If you were appointed coach at ..Y" college, and saw your team for the first time, would you apply the system to them, or just apply them to the system?" · 
Rock flashed back-..If the team is· good, theri it's your 
system you can rave about, and if the team is bad, then the players are below standard." You can't imagine how this retort amused everyone present. Jock Sutherland was pressed into service to ask him a question and Jock asked Knute how many touchdowns would separate Pitt and N. D. Rock allowed as how two would be enough. The final score was 3 5, 19. · 
And that's that-Rockne was a terrific radio feature. I venture that 99 44,100 per cent of the simon.-pures in football listened in each week to his talks-and if you want a tip-off, hasn't there been a terrible let.-down in those weekly ..sport" chats since he went over the horizon? 
Yes sir! It needed a Rockne to make football a na.. tional riot, and it needed· a virile Rockne to make sport talks a verbal panic!

A lateral pass, Schwartz to Banas, put.the ball to the Trojan's three-yard line.. · 
Banas' 36-yard run was one ~f the greate5t of the . game, as he squirmed out of the arms of sever~l players and seemed to dodge every man on the Southern Califor· nia team ·before he was finally run out. of · bounds. Schwartz, on the next play, smashed over the Trojan's left tackle for three yards and a touchdown. Jaskwhich again kicked goal. · · 
A few minutes later Jim Musick, Trojans' fullback, was hurt and limped off the field. _Southern California players said in their dressing room after the game that this was the turning point of the game . 
..We really started to fight then and there,,, said. John· ny Baker. ..It was a shame to see good old Jim leaving the game and we said 'let's go after them.' , 
The Trojans did just that when they drove to Notre Dame's 10-yard line. But they were halted. Schwartz, of Notre Dame, chose to kick out to his own 48-yard line and then the Trojans began their first touchdown march. 
Mohler gained . two yards. His pass was ruled com· plete because of interference on Notre Dame's 40-yard line. . Shaver smashed through .for five yards. A lateral pass, Mohler· to Shaver, gained 11 yards and first down on Notre Dame's 24-yard line. Shaver hit the line for four yards. Mohler, stopped in his tracks th~ first time, gained five yards on the next attempt, carrying the ball to Notre. Dame's 15·yard line as. the third quarter ended. 
Ray Sparling, Southern California's left end, who played the entire game, swept around Notre Dame's left end for 13 yar~s. on an end around play, placing the ball on ·the one-yard line. 
Shaver was stopped without gai~1 on. his first attempt, but· plunged over on the next play for the Trojans' first score.. Kurth broke through ·and blocked Baker's attempt.. at goal, and Notre Dame held a 14 to 6 lead, which seemed safe enough with about 13 minutes to play. 
In five plays, Southern California· scored its second touchdown:_the fourth made on Notre Dame all season. 
Coach Heartly Anderson rushed in Murphy at· quar· terback and. Duke Millheam, a le(t·handed passer, but the game ended three plays later "?hen Clark: ~ntercepted a pass on Notre Dame's 40-yard line.

Carrying On the Rockne System 
(Continued from page OS) 
Harry Stuhldreher, along with Ed Hunsinger and Robert Reagan, didn't fare so well with their Villanova squad. While winning four games, they lost three con, tests and tied two. 
Returning to the Big Ten for a moment and stopping at Ohio State, the record book points to the spotty season of the Buckeyes, six wins and three losses. Don Miller is backfield coach and his backs blocked and tackled superbly in their 6 to 0 win over Michigan. 
Five wins, three losses, and one tie-a nicely balanced season-was the result for the former Horseman, Jimmy Crowley at Michigan State. A 100 to 0 win over Ripon caused much comment and partially wiped out the de, feats by Army, Detroit and Syracuse. Detroit was made happy because the Staters had tied Michigan, 0 to 0. 
Back to Ohio, Harry Baujan's University of Dayton gridders. ended a season of five wins, three losses and two ties, playing a 6 to 6 deadlock with the ..B, team from 
. Notre Dame. Bujan's buckers ran up 237 points. Head Coach Jack Meagher, aided by Johnny Niemic, saw Rice pile up five victories and drop three games. 
Other head coaches include Charley Bachman down at the University of Florida. His outfit had a rather disastrous record, losing five games, tying two, winning three and one to play. Navy carried on under the guid, ance of Edgar (Rip) Miller who had .considerable diffi, culty in breaking the Middies of their old habits and in, traducing to them the Notre Dame system. He was aided by Christy Flanagan and Johnny O'Brien in his work.

alty for holding drove the Irish back to their 19,yard 
marker. 
Notre Dame made four yards and a Tech penalty moved the oval up to the nine,yard line, froin which Leahy drove to the two,yard line. He then dove over for the second score. 
The third Notre· Dame score was a matter of time. 
Starting on his own 2 5 ,yard line, Schwartz, in three tries, 
tore off three gains for 14 and five, and on the third 
drive was downed on the 50,yard line. His work was 
done for the quarter, Mike Koken trotting on the field. 
Koken 's first attempt was good for 13 and his second for five yards. A lateral pass, Koken to Leahy, found the end asleep, for Leahy circled that spot for a touchdown.

Two more scores rattled off the Irish gat~ing gun in the final period, Leonard taking the leather over from the one,foot line after another . march down the field, and Cronin sweeping around the Quaker line for 12 yards and the final score. To add to their· class, every attempt for extra point from placement was good, splitting the unrights perfectly. 
While Schwartz again was the starting sparkplug of the Irish machine today, it was Sheeketski who reeled off the most yardage from the line of scrimmage. He lugged the ball seven times for 77 yards, or an average of 11 yards a thrust.

. Riley was better early in the season when Northwestern met Notre Dame and, therefore, gets ·the. berth. 
Capt. John Price:· Army's vete~an leader, ranks just a step ahead of the fi~ld on _the qther sid_e-of the line. Much of the credit for . the inspired · game the Cadets played at Yankee sfadium must goto his s_tirriulus. 
G. W. Underwood of Navy_ran.ks a.step or two ahead of his competitors at right guard. He had much to ~o with the brilliant Na\ry defense ·which received all too little credit the day Notre Dame.played at Baltimore. He is· a veteran who knows the ropes and seldom, if ever, has an off day. Summerfelt and Trice of Army, Joe Zelle~ of Indiana, Rosenberg of Southern California, and Milligan of Pitt were close behind. · 
Carl Perina, 200-pound Pennsylvania fullba~k, who showed the way to the East and then came to Notre Dame to play as brilliantly in defeat as ever he. did in victory, is· the class of the fullbacks. Gaius (Gus) Shaver of Southern California and Jim· Musick of the same. team are· of the first water, while.

(Continued from page 67) 
And, finally, this field house will be peculiarly fitting as a memorial to Knute Rockne because it will carry out a dream that lay very close to his heart. .It will fill a need that he realized more keenly than_ anyone else: the opportunity for the student to co-ordinate physical de.. velopment with mental training through recreation and exercise in indoor sports and games. In snort, the Rockne memorial field house will reinforce the entire educational program of th.e university by providing athletic and recre.. ational facilities for every· student. 
The site which Notre Dame has set aside for the Rockne memorial is a perfect one. The building, on the eastern axis of University road, will stand on old· Cartier field-ground sacred to many generations of Notre Dame athletes-adjoining the stadium and facing a wide plaza that will extend the width of the campus. The approach from the west will be magnificent in its sweep. 
The memorial, in modified English Gothic, will present a rugged and impressive outline, strong in mass and sim.. ple in ornamental detail. The exterior walls will be of Indiana limestone laid up in random ashlar. Three mas.. sive stone arches, closed with decorative grills and doors of aluminum, will form the main entrance. Above these, carved in deep relief, will appear the name, "'Rockne Memorial." Panels of figures representing the major sports will balance this on each side. 
On entering, one will walk through a great hall, beamed and panelled in oak. Here will be kept the Book of Memory, in whi~h will be recorded the names of those

who have made the Rockne memorial possible. Across the foyer, three arched entrances will lead into the trophy·

room, where the large collection of trophies of interest to the public will be kept on permanent exhibition. To the .}eft will be the Rockne memorial room, a lofty, oak.. panelled hall, 60 feet l~ng and 40 feet wide. A: deep stone fireplace, embellished with the seals of various uni.. versities, and the softened light streaming through stained· glass medallions set high in the windows, will help to make this a warm and friendly room. Here the pictures, papers, and mementoes pertaining to Rockne's life will be carefully preserved for ~he benefit of the public. 
The main wing, 90 feet long and 60 feet wide, will be occupied by the apparatus gymnasium for the Physical Education school: the corrective exercise gymnasium, and the medical examination rooms. The west wing will con.. tain the swimming pool for intercollegiate races. This pool, 75 feet long and 35 feet wide, will be lighted by skylights ·and equipped with the latest devices for filtra.. tion and for the sterilization of water by ultra.. violet rays. 
Other rooms will include offices for the business man.. ager, the director of athletics, and the coaches. The main locker room will provide for the needs for a thousand students. On each side of this will be located the seven handball and squash courts. Two exhibition courts will each have seats for a hundred spectators. Nearby will be the handball and squash courts reserved for the faculty; four basketball courts will occupy the second floor. Passage is arranged throughout the building so that vis· itors may inspect its most· interesting· features without coming in contact with the players.

But the South Bend assault could make no headway from ·either chance. It was always met by a counter~charge (Continued from page 05) of forwards and backs that wrecked any chance for an 
Notre Dame fought back bitterly after the first Army score, but her charge came too late. An inspired Army team had gotten the jump and an inspired Army team held the jump all the way through. On three occasions Notre Dame had the Cadets in a tough spot, threatening to score, but on each occasion a swarm of Army's charg~ ing defensive stars broke through to spill the runner for a loss. When any danger theratened, the Army defense was impregnable. 
After the first Army touchdown, the big crowd began to wait for the Notre Dame attack to get started. But human flesh can't force its way through a steel wall, and that was what the Army line was today. It never gave way. Price, Summerfelt, Trice, Suare4 and the entire lot more than held their own with Notre Dame's mighty force of forwards. 
And if one of these slipped, there was Kilday, Brown or Stecker blocking up the hole, barring the road, with some of the fiercest tackling the game has ever seen. No~ ·tre Dame was unable to get Schwart4 loose or to put on a passing attack that would stand up. There was always an Army man in the way, ready to bat down or inter~ cept the ball. 
Notre Dame had two fine chances to score. One on a recovered fumble deep in Army territory at the. start of the game, the other on a forward pass penalty for in~ terference which put the ball on Army's 12~yard line. 
advance. It has been seldom in football history that any Notre Dame attack was so completely halted, when Notre Dame's blocking system was so badly ripped apart. While Ray Stecker, one of the star backs of the year, was the outstanding feature of the day, his mates were 
not far below him. The work of the entire Army line was of the highest order. The defensive play of Kilday and Brown was outstanding. It so happened that Notre 
Dame in this game met one of the great football teams of the year, one of the strongest and one of the most alert.
