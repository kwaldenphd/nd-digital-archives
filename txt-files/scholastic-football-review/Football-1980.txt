'80 Overview 
Ask the Irish About Emotion 
By JOHN HEISLER Emotion. It wins and loses football games and 
seasons as much as talented athletes do. 
Look· back on the 1980 Notre Dame football season. Think of all the emo­tional situations in which this Irish team found itself. Think how many more weren't obvious to the average fan ~md only could have been experienced by sitting in the locker room every day with Tom Gibbons and Jim Stone and Scott Zettek. 
Ask John Scully about emotion. He looks so cool and collected most of the time. He answers the interviewers' ques­tions with logical, calm assurance. But he knows about the emotion as much as anyone. Ask him. 
For that matter, ask any of the Irish players. They all know about the love/ hate reaction when anyone mentions Notre Dame. They can't help but feel a part of that image from the minute they reach the campus. 
Ask them about the emotion of Fri­day, August 15, the night that Dan. Devine told the team this would be his last season. The surprise, the uncer­tainty and the timing of the announce­ment all added to the feeling of that moment. Exactly what effect it had from that night until the day-20 weeks later-when the Irish played in the Sugar Bowl probably never can be ac­curately measured. 
Ask them about the emotion of the victory over Michigan-the feeling that only can come from a win of that magnitude in that style. Harry Oliver won't be the only one to remember that 
September  afternoon  in  Notre  Dame  
Stadium.  
Ask  them  about  the  injuries.  Ask  

them what it's like to see people like Tim Huffman hurt the first day of prac­tice, to see talents like Phil Carter and Dean Masztak forced to spend more time off the field than on. Ask them how they feel when Robb Gagnon and Don Kidd play their hearts out, only to earn tickets to surgery. And ask them to explain the anguish to Mike Courey, who saw his final season finished by the crack of a bone in his hand. 
Ask them about that growing feeling that, hey, maybe this season is going to be something really special. · Ask them what it feels like to chalk up 302 yards on the ground against the best Ask Pete Holohan about the emotion he felt after grabbing a 10-yard scoring pass from Mike Conrey to give the Irish a 14-0 edge over Michigan. 


rushing defense in the country and realize maybe this Notre Dame team is as good as any in the nation. 
Ask the players about the human stories that made this season. Ask them about the special feeling between a Phil Carter and a Jim Stone and the rivalry and camaraderie that accompanied the roommates' relationship. 
Ask them about the emotion of being No. 1, that giddy week the Irish spent atop the polls. Ask them what it's like when it says officially, on paper, that you-for at least that week-are the best. And ask them about the emotion they ran into on Grant Field the next Saturday as Georgia Tech played the game of its season to tie. Notre Dame and knock it from that lofty perch. 
Ask the players about Birmingham, the emotion that accompanied that week and the kind of effect the previous week's tie had upon it. Ask them about that gleeful second when victory over Alabama became apparent. And ask them what it's like to hear you're going to the Sugar Bowl to play the only un­defeated team left. 
Ask them abo~t the emotion of play­ing in Notre Dame Stadium for the last time. Ask Jim Stone how long he'll re­member scoring ·a touchdown the last time he carried the football in a green jersey. Ask those seniors how long they'll remember the last time they walked out of that locker room and through that tunnel. 
Ask the players about the frustration that is the Los Angeles Coliseum. Ask them how it feels to see national cham­pionship hopes flutter away in the Cali­fornia sun. Ask them how it feels to get so close to your ultimate goal, and then .... 
Ask them about the anticipation lead­ing up to the Sugar Bowl, the thoughts going through Bob Crable's head of having Her~chel Walker in his grasp at long last. Ask them how it feels when you still think you're just as good as the other team after the game is over, but you just couldn't prove it on the field. 
Ask Ty Barber how it feels to see Jim Gruden in the locker room, how it feels to shake his hand and try to smile and say thank you and, yet, wonder what happens next. Ask them how it feels to go through those 20 weeks and know that now it's all over. Ask them about that look on Dan Devine's face, about that feeling that somehow it all should have ended better than this. 
Ask Gerry Faust about emotion. He kriows it as well as anyone-that's one of the reasons he's Notre Dame's next football coach. 
Emotion. 
It's triumph and despair, · life and death, all wrapped up in one. Ask the players. It's what makes Notre Dame football 
special, 1980 and always. 

Ask Phil Carter about the emotion he felt after his fourth-period scoring run staked Notre Dame to a late lead against the Wolverines.

The Experts Call It Perfectly 
By CRAIG CHVAL 
For once, the experts were right. 
They had said all along there was no 
way a freshman starting his first colle­
giate game, no matter how good he had 
been in high school, could get the job 
done in this crucial nationally-televised 
game. You just couldn't go against the 
experienced veteran quarterback. And 
the senior did beat the freshman, just 
like the experts said he would. 
Experts, meet Mike Courey and Scott 
Campbell. 
Courey, a senior, got the starting call for Notre Dame after winning a five­man derby that included two widely­heralded freshmen. Campbell opened for Purdue in his first collegiate game because widely-heralded three-year starter Mark Herrmann injured the thumb on his throwing hand during practice earlier in the week. 
In the end, it hardly mattered who called the signals for either team. Courey, quieting a bevy of skeptics, connected on 10 of 13 passes for 1~ 1 yards and a touchdown. Campbell amazed the 59,075 onlookers in Notre Dame Stadium with his 17-for-26 stats for 17 8 yards. 
And the Irish buried the Boiler­makers, 31-10, in the earliest season opener in history for either team. 
If there was ever a game with enough plots and subplots to make a good soap opera, this was it. 
Notre Dame coach Dan Devine started the ball rolling in mid-August by announcing that 1980 would be the last season of his six years .at the school. Then, from the opening of twice-a-day practice sessions, the big question re­volved around Notre Dame's revolving quarterback situation. 
Five players-seniors Courey, Tim Koegel and Greg Knafelc, and fresh­men Blair Kiel and Scott Grooms ­scrambled for the coveted position. All had their respective strengths and weak­nesses, and all had been prep All-Amer­ica quarterbacks. 
Devine played the uncertainty for all it was worth, rotating all five players in and out of practice sessions, and refus­ing to give so much as a clue as to the identity of his starter. 
When Herrmann jammed his thumb into a teammate's helmet on the Tues­day preceding the game, Purdue coach 

Irish senior quarterback Mike Conrey most certainly quieted the skeptics with his 
Jim Young was able to fight fire with leadership and efficient 10-of-13 passing for 151 yards against the Boilers •••

fire. Despite the fact the injury oc­curred on Tuesday, word did not leak out until Thursday. 
The outcome, though, was deter.:. mined on the line of scrimmage, just like football games were decided back in the days before Heisman Trophy winners, television cameras and point spreads. 
That was perhaps more of a surprise than any of the suspense and intrigue about the two quarterback positions. 
The single most overriding charac~ teristic about the Notre Dame offensive line was its youth. Aside from All­America candidate John Scully at cen­ter, the Irish didn't have one interior lineman who had started a single game prior to 1980. To make matters worse, the Notre Dame offensive line tradi-. tionally takes two or three games to get into the groove. 
But this young unit, with Mike Shiner, Randy Ellis, Bob Burger and Phil Pozderac flanking the veteran Scully, led the way for an Irish rushing attack that ground out 262 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Sophomore half­back Phil Carter, who unseated senior Jim Stone as the successor to All­American Vagas Ferguson, rambled for 142 of those yards, only three fewer than his entire '79 season total. 
"The key to this game was the per­formance of our offensive line," said Devine. "And, of course, you can't overlook the tremendous job that Mike Courey did for us." 
Devine admitted the work of his line, under the tutelage of assistant coaches Brian Boulac and Bill Meyers, was a pleasant surprise. And it turned out to be a harbinger of things to come, as that group enabled Notre Dame's rush­ing game to rank among the nation's leaders throughout the season. 
"The offensive line, for any football team, is usually the last unit to come around, but you really have to give the players and assistant coaches credit," said Devine. "I think that in this in­stance, our youth may have helped us. These players realized they had a lot to accomplish when spring practice began, and they worked very hard." 
After a Harry Oliver field goal opened the scoring for Notre Dame, sophomore fullback Rob McGarry gave the Irish a 10-0 first-quarter lead when he hulled over from the Purdue two after taking a· brilliant option pitch from Courey. It was McGarry's first-and only-carry in a Notre Dame uniform all season. 
When Carter smashed through from the Purdue one with 11:40 to play in the first half to cap a 46-yard drive, Notre Dame owned a 17-0 lead. The folks at ABC television, which beamed the game to the majority of the country, shuddered at the thought of a runaway. 
And on its next possession after a Purdue field goal, Notre Dame threat­ened to do just that. But sophomore fullback Pete Buchanan fumbled the ball away on the Boilermaker 32. A 41-yard tipped pass from Campbell to All-America tight end Dave Young put Purdue back in business, setting up Wally Jones' four-yard scoring run. 
A few people, Dan Devine included, were more than a little concerned about Purdue's second-quarter flurry after the Boilers went 19 minutes without a first down to start the game. So on the first play from scrimmage in the second half, Devine sought to rectify the situa­tion. 
He called standout split end Tony Hunter's number, and Courey delivered the goods. A picture-book 57 -yard pass put the ball on Purdue's 19. Six plays later, Courey found Hunter in the corner of the end zone, and the Irish were on top, 24-10. 
"I thought we needed something to regain the momentum," said Devine, whose Irish stood 11th in the Asso­ciated Press preseason poll. "That sec­ond-period drive helped Purdue, be­cause they got seven points. But it helped us, too, because that was not the kind of football that we wanted to play. 

"That pass to Tony Hunter was a pet 

play of mine, but we just put it in this 
week on Wednesday." 
Courey, who was selected by ABC as Notre Dame's most valuable player, capped the finest day of his career with a dazzling 14-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter to close the scoring. The Irish defense did the rest, allowing only 37 rushing yards to Purdue and making eight stops for 52 yards in losses. 
Devine tried to explain his quarter­back's performance to a few remaining disbelievers in the Notre Dame locker room after the game. 
"Courey is not exactly a novice at quarterback. He started two games for us last year and made some big plays as a freshman," said Devine. "I don't think you could ask anything more from him than he showed you out there today." 
And Courey was just glad to get the chance. 
"I've never really played a full game here, so nobody really kn~w my capa­bilities," he said to a mob of reporters afterward. "I think playing quarterback at Notre Dame is special. 
"The wait was worth it."

Michigan 

A Nifty Tw.ist by Oliver 

Michigan defensive back Jeff Reeves attempts to stop Notre Dame's Dean Masztak after one of the three receptions that 
day by the Irish tight end. ­
By BILL MARQUARD 

_ Team captain Bob Crable stood in 
the midst of a sea of green and gold in 
the Notre Dame locker room. His raised 
right arm held the spoils of the Irish 
conquest-the game ball. 
"We're gonna give this ball to Harry. 

This is the ball he kicked to beat 
Michigan!" . 
Harry · moved to the center of the 

huddle, by now used to the swarm of 
humanity that had been pressing closer 
to him for the last 10 minutes. · 
"I ... I love all you guys," Harry 

yelled through tears with an arm around 
Irish coach Dan Devine. 
"There's not a quitter in this room," 

exclaimed Devine. "This is the all-time, 
all-time, all-time, all-time moment." 
At that, Notre Dam~ president Rev. 

Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., pressed 
his way through the victors to Harry 
and Dan. . 
"I told you at practice that you repre­. ·sen ted Notre Dame," Hesburgh told the 
assembled players and coaches.· "And 
today you've added a new chapter." 
It would be a day and ·a game for everyone to remember, especially Harry. 
But Harry who? 
Funny, but 15 minutes earlier the capacity crowd assembled in Notre Dame Stadium had asked that very question. 
"Number three-that's Harry Oliver." "Oh, you mean the guy who missed that extra point in the third quarter?" 
"Yeh, that's him. There's no way he can kick the ball 51 yards-look how small he is!" 
Chances did look mighty grim for the Irish, especially after the Wolverines had erased a 26-21 I'rish lead with a 10-play, 78-yard drive in the waning minutes of the game. Cautiously_ guard­ing against the improbable, the Wol­verines had attempted but failed to make a two-point conversion with 41 seconds left that would have pushed their advantage to 30-26 and thwarted the effects of most any last-second 'Irish heroics. 
Eighty yards and 41 seconds away from the Michigan goal line, Devine sent freshman Blair Kiel in to engineer Notre Dame's last-ditch drive. 

Hopes began to wane as Kiel's first pass from the shotgun formation was a wobbler toward the outstretched arms of Tony Hunter, plus a variety of Wol­verine defensive backs. But a defensive interference flag was dropped at the feet of Michigan coach Bo Schem­bechler and the Irish were just past midfield with 31 seconds to go. 
Kiel's next pass to Pete Holohan al­most was picked off by Michigan de­fender Jeff Reeves, and his first pass that . hit its mark was bobbled and dropped by tight end Dean ·Masztak. 
Faced with a third-and-1 0 situation on the Michigan 48-yard line and a scant 20 seconds on the clock, Kiel found Phil Carter for nine yards over the middle, and stopped the clock at :04. with a· five-yard toss to Hunter at the Irish sidelines. ·

Irish linebacker Joe Rudzinski makes certain Michigan thrower John Wangler doesn't enjoy any more quiet time in the pocket than necessary. 
8 varsity game against Wisconsin, faced a 20-mile-per-hour head wind that had carried a Kiel punt 69 Y':lrds in the other direction earlier in the day. 

But as Bill Siewe snapped the ball to holder Tim Koegel, the wind stopped, the seas parted and 59,075 Notre Dame faithful glanced down from the heavens just long enough to see Oliver's game­saving, 51-yard prayer collapse over the crossbar. 
"I have to thank God and Our Mother -they're my strength," re­marked Harry with sincerity. "I just prayed that whatever happened would be the best. That was all I could ask for." 
Bob Crable: 'I didn't look up until I heard everyone screaming and I knew Harry had made it.' 
"I did nothing but say Hail Marys," said Crable, a classmate and teammate of Harry's at Moeller. "From the time Michigan scored, I came off the field, sat on the bench, buried my head in my hands and prayed. 
"1 didn't look up until I heard every­one screaming and I knew Harry had made it." 
Another Irish hero all but overlooked by the herd of reporters in the dressing room was John Krimm. Had it not been for Krimm's interception and 49-yard return for a touchdown when the Irish offense appeared to stall in the third quarter, Harry's heroics would have been meaningless. 
"We were in deep half coverage, and Michigan's receiver, Anthony Carter, read the coverage and went for the flag instead of curling," explained Krimm. "Their quarterback didn't pick up the change and I just stepped into the ball. 
"Since the play had come from the opposite side of the field, I had daylight from me to the goal line." 
The Irish had opened up an early 14-0 advantage, thanks to impressive marches of 70 and 51 yards. Carter carried 1 0 times for 45 yards during the initial drive (he also went six yards for the touchdown), and a Mike Courey-to­Holohan 1 0-yarder accounted for the second score. Two Michigan intercep­tions and a switch at quarterback to John Wangler produced a pair of Wol­verine scores before intermission. 

Krimm's return kept the Irish in the hunt after a 67-yard return of the second-half kickoff by Michigan's Carter had set up the go-ahead six­pointer for the Wolves. 
But the spotlight on this day be­longed to Harry. who still stood fully dressed in the locker room some 45 minutes after the game, shifting the game ball back and forth, from hand to hand as he talked to friends, reporters and teammates. The battered Michigan Wolverine hat he wore on his head told the story. 
"I knew right away that it was true and that he kicked it good," said De­vine. "Then I used a famous sign that I've used for a long time. It's called, 'In the name of the Father and the Son .. .' 

"I've never seen Harry kick one that far but it went through today and that's all I care about. He's a heck of a nice kid. 
"He was a nice kid even before he kicked it!" 
Harry who? 
Funny, that's the same question Michigan partisans have been asking ever since.

Spartans, Meet Phil Carter I 
I 
By FRANK LaGROTTA 
Twenty-four hours before his team kicked off against Michigan State, Notre Dame head football coach Dan Devine sat in the visitor's locker room at Spar­tan Stadium, deep in thought. 
"Looks like you're gonna have an easy one tomorrow, eh coach?" re­marked a security guard. Devine looked up and smiled as he shook his head. 
"There's no such thing as an easy one in this game," he responded. "I don't care what their record is. The Spartans will be ready to play Notre Dame to­morrow." 
And he was right. They were. 
"Our guys may not have a lot of talent but they've got plenty of spirit," pointed out former Michigan State coach Duffy Daugherty, who was hon­ored at halftime when the Spartans held a 9-6 lead. 

"It looks like they sure want to win lhis game." 
And they very well might have, if not for the running of Phil Carter. Notre Dame's sophomore sensation carried the ball a record 40 times and rolled up 254 yards-just one shy of the single-game mark set by Vagas Fer­guson.against Georgia Tech in 1978. 
"Phil's an absolutely superb athlete," said Jim Gruden, Notre Dame's back­field coach, after the game. 
"I can't tell how much potential he really has because only he knows that." 
It was Carter's third consecutive 100­yard game, tying a Notre Dame record held by George Gipp, Marchy Schwartz and Neil Worden. But, more impor­tantly, his performance served notice that he was a legitimate superstar in his own right-not simply a player trying to fill Vagas Ferguson's shoes. 
And he was only a sophomore. 
"But Phil doesn't play like he's a sophomore!" argued offensive tackle Mike Shiner, who also deserves some credit for Carter's yardage totals. 
"Phil reads defenses and follows blocking like a four-year veteran," Shiner praised. "And he's quicker'n heck. You don't have to hold a block long at all for him. He sees a little opening and-boom!-he's gone." 
The Irish needed every one of Car­ter's hard-earned yards to stave off a Spartan attack that was anything but indicative of their 1-2 record to that point. In fact, seventh-ranked Notre Dame trailed in the game until the nine-minute mark of the third quarter when Carter scampered in from the 12 to put the Irish up 13-9 after Harry Oliver's placement. After the game, Devine admitted that things indeed 

-made life easier for Phil Carter against the Spartans. . · 

Bob Crable's third-down stop of MSU back Steve Smith keynotes an important second-period goalline stand by the Notre Dame defense. Michigan State held a 9-3 lead at the time and threatened to add to it after managing a first down at the Irish 
six-yard line. 

would have looked bleak if his team had not scored on that particular drive. 
"We were in· a situation where we were moving the ball but we just couldn't get it into the end zone," the coach admitted. "I knew we had to score because I felt they would score again before the game ended." 
Devine also believed his halftime de­cision to replace starting quarterback Mike Courey with freshman Blair Kiel was a good one. , 
"At the time I just thought we needed a better arm in the game so I put Kiel in," he told reporters after­ward. "My decision in no way indicated that I thought Mike wasn't doing well." 
The rookie· responded with five com­pletions on 10 attempts for 56 yards. He also carried the ball-eight times for 45 yards, exhibiting a remarkable sense for avoiding the pass rush. 
"Blair has a lot of intelligence out" there," remarked quarterback coach Ron Toman. "He seems to know when to throw the ball, when to run and when to fall down and just do nothing. I think he's got a good foundation and he'll get better as time goes on." · With the score 16-9 after Oliver's third field goal of the game, Spartan quarterback John Leister led his team on a picture-perfect drive of its own. MSU breezed 59 yards in three pfays, · 
capped by a 13-yard touchdown run by Ron Ellis. Now it was 16-15.... 
But the fun was just beginning. 
Ty Barber returned the ensuing kick­off to the Notre Dame 41 where Kiel and Carter went to work once again. On the second ·play of the drive, Carter broke off ·left tackle and danced 53 yards to the Spartan one-yard line. Jim Stone took it in from there and Notre Dame led, 23-15. 
Leister came right back and engi­neered an 83-yard drive in only four plays to put the Spartans right back in the thick of things, 23-21 with 6:35 re­maining. But Oliver's 32-yard field goal, his record-tying fourth of the day on as many attempts, held off State and the Irish escaped with a 26-21 victory. 

"All I can say is I'm glad it's over," sighed middle linebacker Bob Crable. "They were tough . . . real tough. And they could easily have won this game. 
"But we knew we weren't gonna let them." 
Devine, too, was full of compliments for the Spartans. And he had a few nice things to say about his own team, as well. 
"They were good," he said, "no doubt about it. But I think we deserve a little credit, too. It isn't easy to come into their stadium and come from be­hind, then keep holding them off for two quarters. 
"I'm very proud of this football team. I think we have a lot of character and a lot of pride. 
"I think we showed that today." 

The 509 total yards, 405 rushing yards and 30 first downs proved to be 1980 season highs for the Irish. In fact, the Notre Dame running game turned out to be so dominant that in the first three second-half scoring drives of 51, 47 and 59 yards-the Irish did not at­tempt a pass. And they needed but one completion in a final 63-yard excursion. 
Carter's near-record yardage total made him the second-ranked rusher in the country, with his 166.3-yards-per­game average behind only Jarvis Red­wine of Nebraska at 166.5. No one knew at the time that the thigh bruise that sent him to the sidelines late in the final period would keep him out of ac­tion the next four games. 
"We've still got plenty of work to do in certain areas, but we've been tough in situations when we had to be. After playing these three Big Ten teams, I'll gladly take our 3-0 record," Devine added. 
"Not many people thought we'd be 3-0 right now." 
Not many at all.

Miami 



Hurricane Winds Subside 
By MICHAEL ORTMAN 

Prior to the 1980 season, it was easy for Irish football faithful to look at the Notre Dame schedule much like an Oreo cookie-two tough-to-beat oppo­nents on each end and a creamy crop of somewhat-less-difficult foes in be­tween. 
After all, big names like Purdue and Michigan at one end and Alabama and Southern Cal at the other just can't compare to the likes of Army, Arizona, Michigan State or Miami. 
Miami was determined to take. a big bite out of that theory as the Hurri­canes blew into Notre Dame Stadium with an unblemished 4-0 record and a No. 13 national ranking, not to men­tion the best defense in the country against the rush and the third best overall. 
But the Irish showed little respect for that glowing reputation. The upset­
. minded Hurricanes found themselves soundly beaten by four mor,e Harry Oliver field goals, 224 yards on the ground by halfback Jim Stone and a stifling Irish defense which did not yield a first down in the second or third quarter over nine consecutive Miami possessions. Yet the 32-14 final margin didn't ac­. curately reflect Notre Dame's utter dominance of the line of scrimmage. "Notre Dame's got a great ·team," said Miami's All-America candidate, noseguard Jim Burt. "That's definitely the best team we've faced this year," be added with emphasis, putting the Irish ahead of the previous week's. vic­tim, Florida State, who later made its second-straight Orange Bowl appear­ance. Burt sang the praises of Notre Dame's entire offensive line, especially the performance· of his head-to-head counterpart, Irish center John Scully, who clearly threw his name in the hat for All-America consideration with a solid performance against an equally talented foe. "Scully's an excellent center," Burt lamented. "He stays with his blocks really well-better than any center I've ever played against. In fact, the whole offensive line stayed with its blocks better than any other team I've seen. That was the key to the whole thing.". 
Notre Dame's offensive output was certainly a different dose of medicine 

I! 


than the Hurricanes had been accus­
I

tomed to taking. In four previous con­
i 
I

tests, Miami had surrendered just 15.5 
yards a game on the ground. The Irish I running backs surpassed that total just five minutes into the game, and finished I with a whopping 302 yards for the I afternoon. 
Yet Stone's performance that day perhaps typified the 1980 season for Notre Dame-a starting player going down with an injury, and an equally effective reserve ready to fill in. Sopho­more Phil Carter suffered a severe thigh bruise during the -waning moments of the victory at Michigan State the pre­vious week and would not see action again for several weeks. Yet there was Jim Stone, a talented senior who had been waiting patiently for his oppor­tunity. 
"It was a team victory," Irish coach Dan Devine was quick to point out after the . game. "I can't really single out any particular facet." 
But with a halfback who had just rang up 224 yards on 3 8 carries, in­cluding a 27-yard scoring burst on the second-to-last play of the game, Devine couldn't go without patting Stone on the back. 
"The players are really proud of Jim Stone," he said with enthusiasm. "Jim played in the shadows of Vagas Fer­guson and appeared to be the heir to the tailback position. Throughout his career he has never pouted. We knew he was there." 

He was there, all right, and just when he was needed most. Throughout the week, he had visited his good friend and roommate Carter in the infirmary where they exchanged encouraging words. "The big thing that stuck out in my . mind," Stone remembered, "was last night at the pep rally when Phil had to speak. He was really excited even though he wasn't playing. He told the crowd that it didn't matter who was playing, that Jim Stone would do the job." 
Stone did the job with a lot of help from his friends, both physical and moral support. "Before the game, the offensive linemen told me to follow the blocks and everything would be all right," he said recalling his first-ever start at Notre Dame. "That meant a lot to me. It told me that they believed in me, almost more than I believed in myself." 
His teammates were pulling for him right down to the wire. With less than 20 seconds remaining, the game well in hand 'and 197 yards to Stone's credit, Devine sent in freshman John Mosley for Stone. But the players wanted Stone to get his 200 yards, and pro­tested to the coach. 
"I've never before let a guy go like that on the last play. You've got the game won, and you don't want to get him hurt," explained Devine. "But everyone wanted him to get that 200 yards, especially the players. So I had to call Mosley back. I didn't know he was going to go all the way." 
Freshman quarterback Blair Kiel got the starting call, making him the first freshman to open at that spot since Ralph Guglielmi in 1951. He had all the help he needed from a defense that allowed Miami only 42 ground yards. Free safety Tom Gibbons delivered an extra shot in the arm with a 53-yard interception return for a touchdown with 11 minutes left in the game. 
A pair of fourth-quarter touchdown passes from Miami quarterback Jim Kelly prevented a blowout of the Hurri­canes. But those touchdowns would· be the last the Irish defense would give up for a long time. 
"You're not going to beat a team like that without any turnover help," said Miami coach Howard Schnellenberger. The Irish made none all afternoon. "This just wasn't our day."

Army 

A Day for Defense 
By BRIAN BEGLANE 

October 18 marked the first day of a week-long fall vacation for Notre Dame students. On this sunny after­noon when many students embarked for home, Irish fans could not keep from wondering-for the first quarter, anyway-if Notre Dame's offense also was on the Indiana Toll Road some­where. 
A plethora of penalties kept the Irish attack at bay for the first quarter against Army, which entered the con­test against the unbeaten Irish with a 2-2-1 record. Notre Dame was called for 51 yards in the first quarter and to~aled nine infractions for 117 yards in the game. Penalties, in fact, stopped all three Irish drives in the first quarter and played a role in thwarting seven drives in the game. 
Notre Dame's defense, on the other hand, needed no help from the officials in stopping the Cadets. Led by line-: backer Bob Crable, the stingy crew held Army to 87 yards in the first half and broke the game open with a touch­down to end the half. 
From there on, the offense got into gear and the end result was a 30-3 tri­umph over Army and the start of 23 scoreless quarters for Irish opponents. 
"Army played us really tough," said Notre Dame coach Dan. Devine. "They deserve a lot of credit. It's hard to evaluate your offense when you stop yourself as many times as we did. We tried to both run and pass the ball but we had an awful lot of drives· stopped by penalties. But Army" hit hard and pursued well. 
"Our defense did quite a job. They just seem to get better every time we play." 
So much better, in fact, that the Irish defense did not give up a touch­down in their next four outings. An­other service academy, Air Force, broke the string started versus the Cadets. 
"A big reason for the ineffectiveness of our offense was that we couldn't get the ball to our wide receiver, Mike Fahnestock," said Army coach Ed Cav­anaugh. "Our quarterback (T. D. Decker) just couldn't see him-their line is so big and Decker is so small. We tried some sprint-out passes, but we wouldn't have survived if we tried any more." 
Notre Dame started the game with a bang-an attempted sideline bomb from quarterback Blair Kiel to Tony Hunter. After it fell incomplete, the Irish took to the ground for eight straight plays and the strategy brought them from their own 25 all the way down to the Army 14. 
The two big runs came by senior halfback Jim Stone, playing in place of the injured Phil Carter, and John Sweeney. After the incomplete bomb, Stone broke two tackles for a 17-yard gain to the Notre Dame 42. He car­ried the next four times to break into Army territory, at the 38, before Sweeney charged up the middle for 17 yards, all the way to the Army 21. 
Stone brought the ball down to the 14 on the next play, but a 15-yard hold­ing penalty against the Irish negated the gain-and ultimately the entire drive­as the ball came back to the 29. Harry Oliver missed a 47-yard field goal as Army took over. 
The Irish defense, however, got the ball back two minutes later when Joe Rudzinski batted a pitchout by Decker and Don Kidd recovered at the Army 40. 
A 17-yard clipping penalty against 
the  Irish,  however,  brought  the  ball  
back  to  their  own  45  and  Kiel  was  
forced to punt two plays later.  
Army's  offense  seemingly  did  not  

want to hang onto the ball. Decker fumbled away a drive at his own 47 and Tom DeSiato's four-yard gain on the recovery gave the Irish yet another golden opportunity inside the 50 with 
5:08 to go. 
This time a four-yard holding call against Notre Dame on its first play from scrimmage nullified a 13-yard gain by Stone and the Irish punted away their last drive of the period. 


"The frequency of the holding calls told us we were doing something wrong," _said Irish center John Scully. "It took a lot of momentum away from our offense." 
B.ut the offense finally put some points on the scoreboard with 8:22 to go in the half. Kiel, target of some criticism because of his passing stats, hit tight end Nick Vehr for a 24-yard gain, down to the Army 20, to . set up the first touchdown. Stone took a pitch­out from Kiel four plays later ~nd the Irish offense, running its second pen­alty-free drive of the day, put Notre Dame on top, 7-0. 
The freedom from penalties did not last long, however. Two possessions later, Notre Dame was called back from the Army 27 to the 42 for yet another holding infraction. It appeared another drive was· going to be stopped. 
Oliver, however, made good on his second field-goal try of the day, a 49­yard boot with 1:25 to go, as Notre Dame built the advantage to 10-0. 
Army took over on its own 21, but two well-placed Notre Dame timeouts and a tough ground defense led to the next score-the touchdown that broke the game open. John Krimm blocked Joe Sartiano's punt attempt and Mark 
., 

"~~ 
Zavagnin recovered in the end zone for the score. Oliver's point from place­ment made it 17-0 at halftime. 
"That was obviously a key to the game," said Devine. "A big play like that, especially towards the end of the half, swings a lot of momentum your way." 
Army stopped the Irish on their first drive of the second half and received its best field position of the game when Kiel's punt was caught by Larry Pruitt at the Notre Dame 46. The Cadets did norwaste the opportunity, driving inside the Irish 20--the furthest they got all day-before a delay of game penalty 

on fourth-and-one brought the ball back 
to the 24. Dave Aucoin put the only 
points of the day on the scoreboard for 
Army with a 41-yard field goal and the 
score stood 17-3 in favor of Notre 
Dame. 
Notre Dame didn't need to score 
again, although the next two touch­
downs certainly pleased the sellout 
crowd on hand. The Irish defense 
dominated Army and did not allow the 
Cadets to march past the Notre Dame 
49 the rest of the day. 

Meanwhile, Notre Dame wore down the Cadet defensive line and effectively drove downfield with Stone, Sweeney and Ty Barber carrying most of the time. Kiel capped a 39-yard drive with a one-yard run with 35 seconds remain­ing in the third quarter for a 23-3 ad­vantage. 
Zavagnin came up with his se~ond big defensive play of the game to end the third period by intercepting Decker and returning the ball seven yards to the Army 45. Decker was aiming for his big target, Fahnestock, but Zavagnin was ready. 
"All week long Coach Yonto and Coach Kelly told us about Fahnestock," said Zavagnin. "They told us when Army was in trouble, they would go to 

that play. We knew they were in 
trouble, and we were ready for the 
play."· 
This time an Army penalty helped 
the Irish on the ensuing drive. An 
interference call on a Kiel pass intended 
for Hunter gave Notre Dame first-and­
goal from the nine. Barber scored three 
plays later from one yard out and Mike 
Johnston's point from placement made 
the score 30-3. 
Devine gave his second-stringers ample playing time for the remaining 14 minutes, but neither team threatened again. Senior Mike Courey replaced Kiel at quarterback and freshman John Mosley and sophomore Larry Moriarty took over the running game. 
The Irish outgained Army in total yardage, 418-169. Stone led the on­slaught with 122 yards-106 in the first half-while Moriarty picked up 49 yards, all in the final period. 
It was not the most proficient victory of the season, but it was the start of an awesome ·streak by the Irish defense. 
"We did not play our best game of the year today," Devine said following the game, "but we'll get better." 
The Irish, who would become No. 1 in the nation two weeks later, proved Devine a man of his word.

Kiel's Coming of Age 
By JOHN HEISLER 
As the Notre Dame football traveling 
party settled into its United Airlines 
charter for a Friday afternoon flight to 
Tucson, the United crew decided to 
hold a little contest. 
Your assignment, said the flight at­
tendant, is to guess the gross weight of 
the plane, including all passengers and 
contents. Should be simple for all those 
engineering majors, shouldn't it? 
Subsequent tabulations proved Blair 
Kiel to be the winner. He came within 
200 pounds of the correct figure. 
Was it simply a coincidence that an 
18-year-old made the best guess? Kiel's 
teammates thought so-and they sug­
gested in no uncertain terms (all in jest, 
of course) that freshmen shouldn't be 
allowed to win such contests. 
Then again, it might have presaged 

his performance on the field the follow­
ing evening against Arizona. The 20-3 
success for the fourth-ranked Irish cer:. 
tainly qualified as a coming of age, of 
sorts, for the first-year Notre Dame 
quarterback. 
Kiel's bare statistics displayed 11 

completions in 20 pass attempts for 152 
yards, the most passing yards by the 
Irish all season. 
In fact, Notre Dame's drive with the 

opening kickoff might have been the 
most impressive of the '80 campaign. 
The Irish went 80 yards in 14 plays 
while utilizing 8:06 on the clock. 
With Phil Carter still at home with a 

thigh bruise, senior Jim Stone again 
got the call at halfback, gaining 41 
yards on nine carries on that opening 
march and romping three yards for the 
touchdown. 
Yet, it was vintage Kiel throwing that particularly impressed the 56,211 fans in Arizona Stadium on that drive. On third-and-five from the Irish 25, he hit Pete Holohan for 16 yards and a first down. On second-and-nine from the Wildcat 46, he found Holohan for 19 more yards and another first down. Then, on third-and-16 from the Arizona 19, he hit Nick Vehr for 18 yards down to the one to set up Stone's scoring run. 
But, as impressive as Kiel looked in helping stake the Irish to that 7-0 mar­gin, he saved his best trick for the second quarter-just when Arizona ap­peared to be regaining some momen­tum. 


The 'Cats kicked a 21-yard field goal to make it 7-3 with 3:21 left in the half. Following the ensuing kickoff, the Irish could gain only five yards on three downs, and with 2:20 to go Kiel dropped back to punt. Only he never kicked the football. 
Arizona had a reputation for block­ing punts, having already smothered four in its first five games. Kiel made sure the Wildcats didn't make it five by taking one step forward, then darting around left end for 80 yards and an easy six points. A hand signal by Irish coach Dan Devine prompted the play. 
And, without doubt, it proved to be the play of the game, especially con­sidering Kiel's teammates didn't know it was coming. It simply wasn't the kind of thing you would expect from an 18-year-old freshman. 
Kiel's antics so disturbed Arizona that the Wildcats lost five yards on their next possession. They punted the ball away to their own 38 and the Irish worked their way into field goal range in the final 1:06. Harry Oliver's 28­yarder as time ran out made it 17-3 and sealed Arizona's doom. 
But, first, let's go back to Kicl's SO­yard game-breaker. 
"Tqere were only two people who knew about the fake punt, Blair and myself," said Devine, who won his 50th game as Irish head coach. 
"We talked about it before the game. I told Blair I would send word in with the center if we would do it, but I didn't get to him in time. 
"Blair looked over to me on the side­lines, and I made a motion for him to· go ahead. 
"We felt they were susceptible to it when their two outside guys come on the rush. It's a matter of recognizing whether they're set to try to block it or return it." 
Ironically, Arizona coach Larry Smith claimed the Wildcats weren't trying to block the kick. 
· "We were not in block coverage," he said. "We had the return on. The prob­lem was that both our outside men went for the ball instead of playing it smart. Their job is to be safety valves on the outside. 
"It was an excellent play on the part of Kiel. He just dodged the outside guy and that was it. Our other men had their backs to the play. 
"That play turned the game around, 
no question about it." For Kiel, it was a dream come true. "When I turned the corner, I could 

see one of their guys and about seven white shirts," he said. "All I had to do -was read the block." 
The second half turned out to be a defensive show for the Irish. Arizona managed only three first downs and 39 total yards in the final 30 minutes. Of the seven 'Cat possessions after the break, only once did Smith's charges cross their own 36-and on that one Dave Du-erson eventually intercepted a Tom Tunnicliffe pass. 

Arizona finished with only 166 total yards and didn't score a touchdown in a home game for the first time in 15 seasons. 
Notre Dame drove into Arizona ter­ritory three times in the third period, but an interception, a fumble and a missed field goal from 45 yards out kept the Irish from scoring again. The game's final points_.:._a 38-yard Oliver field goal-came with 3:26 to go in the game after Notre Dame foiled a fake punt attempt by the Wildcats. Oliver's boot left him with 13 for the season, tying Chuck Male's record 1979 total. 
"I thought our defense did a super job of holding them most of the time," said Devine, after watching his Irish win their sixth straight game. "Once we got into the second half, I thought we could count on our defense and then just keep from turning the ball over ourselves." 
For the Irish, the final 20-3 count was satisfying enough on the first of four consecutive lengthy road jaunts. And coming away from Arizona Sta­dium with a win (and as one of only six unbeaten teams left in the country) looked all the more impressive after unbeaten UCLA fell victim to the Wild­cats there the following Saturday. 
But when it was over, the play every­one still was buzzing about was Kicl's fake punt. 
"I couldn't believe it. I was looking for the ball downfield when I heard the crowd yell. I turned around and there was Blair headed right toward me," said freshman Daane Spielmaker, who lined up at end on the play and ended up making the final, key block for Kiel. "None of us had any idea what was happening." 
"We were waiting for him to kick, and all the sudden there he goes down the sideline," laughed Bill Siewe, who snapped the ball. "I thought something was wrong for a minute, but it couldn't have worked better than it did, as it turned out." 
A game-winning play? There was no question about that. 
A symbolic coming of age for a neo­phyte quarterback? It ju~t might have been that, too. 
The game had been billed by the Tucson media as a battle of freshman quarterbacks, with Tunnicliffe making his first start for the Wildcats. He didn't play badly, either, in hitting 15 of his 26 pass attempts for 95 yards. 
But there wasn't any doubt who won the battle.

A First-Rated Win 
By RICK CHRYST 
It was a day of firsts. 

Senior halfback Jim Stone became the first Irish running back to gain over 100 yards in four straight games. 
Junior Harry Oliver became the first kicker in Notre Dame history to boot 15 field goals in one year. 
The Irish defense recorded its first shutout of the 1980 campaign. 
But, most important on this first day of November was Notre Dame's 33-0 swamping of Navy, a victory which, coupled with losses by Alabama and UCLA, tossed the Irish to the head of its football class for the first time since the end of their 1977 National Cham­pionship season. 
Almost as surprised at the outcome of the game as George Welsh's Navy squad were the 76,891 fans who filled Giants Stadium· in East Rutherford, 
N.J. True, Notre Dame was a 10~­point favorite, yet the game had all the makings of a classic upset. 
Navy, 5-2 on the year, boasted the number-six defense in the country and was coming off a surprise 24-10 victory over the nationally-ranked Washington 


Notre Dame's first appearance in Giants Stadium since 1977 produced an impressive 33-0 success for the Irish against Navy. Nearly 77,000 fans viewed the Notre. Dame victory in the Meadowlands of New Jersey. 
Huskies. Notre Dame, on the other hand, though undefeated, had needed an SO-yard fake punt to sneak past a stubborn Arizona· squad the week be­fore. If Navy ever was going to break its 16-game losing skid against the Irish, it looked liked this windy, overcast Saturday would be the day. 
Unfortunately for the Midshipmen, someone forgot to tell Notre Dame about their battle plans. After an ex­change of punts, Jim Stone began his assault on Navy's vaunted defense and the record books when he sprinted 73 yards to the Navy nine. 
"It was a 37 seal, and Jimmy just cut it up inside of me," recalled sophomore tackle Mike Shiner about the play that set up junior Ty Barber's nine-yard scamper into the end zone. . 
Oliver's conversion was blocked, however, and memories of the not-so­d.istant Michigan game, and all the problems a missed extra point caused then, suddenly sprang to mind. Yet, as was to be the case all day, Notre Dame's front four quickly removed any doubts in the minds of Irish partisans. On Navy's first play from scrimmage after the kickoff, freshman Tim Mar­shall recovered an Eddie Meyers fum­ble to, give Notre Dame excellent field position. 
"It was their best game of the year," defensive line coach Joe Y onto re­marked . about his charges after the game, and the statistics certainly agreed with him. By . the end of the first half Scott Zeitek, Marshall, Joe Gramke and Hankerd had allowed the Midship­men a microscopic four total yards of offense. Before the day was out, thes~ four would account for seven sacks and over 30 yards in Navy losses. The Middies had a negative total yardage figure even late in the third period. 
"We've really improved as a unit," commented Zettek; whose team-high eight ·tackles and three sacks earned him· the AP Midwest Lineman of the Week award. "Because we're so young, we seem to get more experience imd more success each game we play." · 
The offense wasted little time taking advantage of Meyers' gift. Two minutes later fullback Pete Buchanan slashed off tackle from one yard out and, follow­ing a · missed two-point conversion, Notre Dame took a 12-0 lead into the second stanza. 
Following a Navy punt, Stone all but wrapped up the game with a fourth-. down, 13-yard jaunt to score at 12:40 of the second period. It was just one of those days for-the team from An­napolis, and Notre Dame's third PAT attempt mirrored just how frustrating that day was. 
Taking the snap from center, holder Dave· Condeni rolled to his right and, after doing a scrambling routine that would have put Fran Tarkenton to shame, proceeded to float the two-point pass to tight end Nick Vehr, giving the Irish a 20-0 lead .that never would be challenged. Oliver, the left-footed side­winder fx:om Cincinnati, rounded out the first half scoring with field goals from 41 and 50 yards. 
So thoroughly had Notre Dame dom­inated the game that many of the fans were heading for the exits and their tailgate parties even before the second half kickoff was in the air. They didn't miss much-save a punting match be­tween Notre Dame's Blair Kiel and Navy's Lex Lauletta, and a glimpse of yet another future Irish star at halfback. Freshman Greg Bell, from Columbus, Ohio, traveled 50 yards in just four carries during the fourth quarter, in­cluding a 27-yard carry down the left sideline for the final score of the day. 
"The team really pulled together to­day-! was proud of their perform­ance," said an obviously pleased Dan Devine after the game. And, in reality, it's hard to see how he could have felt any other way. 
Offensively, the Irish reached the 30-point mark for the fourth time in seven games (that didn't include 29 against Michigan), and for the seventh straight time this year Notre Dame's starting halfback collected over 100 yards rushing (Stone finished with 211 on 33 carries). Notre Dame topped the 300-yard mark in rushing yardage for the fifth straight week. 
Yet, the real key to the Irish victory turned out to be the defensive unit. The Middies could manage only 130 yards in total offense, the majority of them coming late in the game. Even more im­pressive was the fact that it marked Notre Dame's third straight game with­out an opponent touchdown being scored and the defense's 16th straight quarter without allowing a six-pointer via the ground. 
"We're coming along," smiled junior co-captain Bob Crable, who heads the Irish defense from his middle line­backer spot. "It helped that we saw Navy beat Washington last week-I think that helped get us ready. That's the way it's going to be each week, we're just going to have to take one game at a time from now on."· 
Zettek had his own thoJ.!ghts on why the Irish were so ready to play. "Last year, Navy physically dominated us in the second half. All week long, the coaches kept reminding us of that fact. Even last night, instead of watching a movie, we watched that Navy film from last year. It didn't really help us as far as specific plays go, but it sure got us in the right frame of mind to play a game."

After all, whiskey bottles and dead fish didn't stop Vagas Ferguson from rushing for 255 yards to lead Notre Dame to a 38-21 rout of Georgia Tech the last time the Irish ventured to Atlanta. 
That was in 1978, when Dan De­vine's fourth Irish squad was en route to a 9-3 season. Devine's final Irish team, though, had taken the nation by storm, and its number-one ranking entering Grant Field exceeded anybody's wildest dreams. 
Except perhaps those of rookie coach Bill Curry and his Georgia Tech play­ers. They had the audacity to dream, in spite of their 1-7 record, that they ac­tually could beat Notre Dame on a sparkling November afternoon in the Deep South. 
The Engineers' only triumph of 1980 had come at the expense of Memphis State, and Tech had been out­scored 200-88. Notre Dame, on the other hand, had run roughshod through the likes of Purdue, Michigan, Miami (Fla.) and Navy. 
The Irish brought to Atlanta a rush­ing average of 286.0 yards per game, ranking them ninth in the nation. Ad­ditionally, a Notre Dame back had rushed for at least 100 yards in nine straight games, dating back to 1979. 
But maybe Curry instructed his play­ers in gridiron history instead of the traditional Xs and Os. 
It was just four years ago that Notre Dame rolled into Atlanta to face the Yellow Jackets with Bear on its mind. The Irish came to Grant Field in 1976 the week before Alabama was to pay its first-ever visit to Notre Dame Stadium. 
The result-a 23-14 Georgia Tech upset victory in which the Yellow Jackets did not attempt a single pass. 
Four years later, the Irish were due to make their first pilgrimage to the Land of Bear Bryant the very next week. This was to be the game of all games. Even a 6-3 upset loss to Mis­sissippi State that knocked Alabama out of the top spot in the national rankings couldn't take any of the luster off this one. 
Georgia Tech? A mere formality. Just watch out for the whiskey bottles and keep your helmet on at all times. 
But there were no fish or whiskey bottles. All the Engineers could throw at Notre Dame were three points. And that's all Notre Dame could throw back. 
As is the case in most upsets, de­fense was the key. Georgia Tech's in­spired squad didn't give an inch. 
Halfback Jim Stone, who had set an all-time Notre Dame record the pre­vious week when he rushed for-over 100 yards in his fourth straight game, found no running room. Freshman quarterback Blair Kiel couldn't do much to help after the Irish ground game broke down. 
Notre Dame didn't manage a first 
down until after Johnny Smith had 
given the Jackets .a 3-0 lead on a 39­
yard field goal with 6:11 to play in the 
first half. 
For its part, the Notre Dame defense was typically brilliant. It held Georgia Tech to eight first downs and 140 yards of total offense. Middle linebacker Bob Crable had 20 tackles, including two 
. for losses. Defensive end Scott Zettek 
added 16 stops, five of them behind tlie 
line of scrimmage.

Surviving the High Tide 

By FRANK LaGROITA 
Late in the afternoon on the day be­fore the game, some Notre Dame fans met some Alabama fans in a parking lot outside Legion Field.... 
"Y'all· are wastin' your time down 
here." 
"We're here to see Notre Dame win." 
"Like we said, y'all are wastin' your 
time." 
"We're gonna win." 
"No, we are." 
(Long pause) 
"We're scared to death." 
"So are we." 
* * * 
These typical feelings surrounded 
what many called the biggest game of 
the 1980 college football season. It was 
Notre Dame versus Alabama-a chance 
to settle the biggest North-South rivalry 
since Grant met Lee at Appomattox. 
The two teams had met three times 
prior to their November 15 clash in 
Birmingham with the Irish emerging 
victorious on. each occasion. That irri­
tating fact was not lost on any member 
of the Crimson Tide roster or their 
coach, Paul "Bear" Bryant. 
"They've beaten us three times," 
pointed out halfback Major Ogilvie 
before the game, "and each time it cost 
us a national championship. We don't 
want that to happen again." 
Unfortunately for Alabama, that's 
exactly what happened. The Fighting 
Irish made it four straight with a 7-0 
win that yielded Notre Dame a Sugar 
Bowl invitation and dropped Alabama 
-you guessed it-right out of the na­
tional championship picture. 
"It is an understatement to say that 
the best team won," said Bryant after­-ward. "We never established anything offensively because they didn't let us. We're just not used to playing against 
a team that strong." 
Bryant went on to praise his de­
fensive unit for "not letting Notre 
Dame score more." Meanwhile, down 
the hall in the visitors' dressing room, 
Dan Devine was handing out similar 
compliments to his own defense. 
"I can't remember when I've ever 
seen a defense play better," Devine 
told reporters. "Time and time again 
we made the big play that kept Ala­
bama out of scoring position." 
In fact, it was the Notre Dame de­
fense that set the tone for this game 
28 

right from the start. On the very first play from scrimmage, Irish defensive end Scott Zettek trapped Ogilvie be­hind the line of scrimmage for a two­yard loss. The game became a punters' duel until early in the second quarter when a series of offensive miscues re­sulted in the only points of the day. 
Tide quarterback Don Jacobs, a question mark up until gametime due to a shoulder injury suffered earlier in the season, fumbled a handoff which was recovered by Irish defensive end John Hankerd. The turnover gave Notre Dame possession on the Alabama 12-yard line, but the Irish drive came to an abrupt halt when quarterback Blair Kiel dropped the snap, allowing· Alabama to recover. 
Jacobs immediately returned the favor, this time on his four-yard line and this time Notre Dame took ad­vantage of the opportunity. Two plays later, halfback Phil Carter plunged over from the two and the Irish took a 7-0 lead after Harry Oliver's placement. 
"I would have liked to have forced them to go more than four yards for a touchdown," sighed Bryant. "But I'm not so sure they wouldn't have done it anyway." · 
If was all defense from that point on, with each squad providing a clinic on how to shut down an opponent's run­ning game. Alabama invaded Irish terri­tory only three times for the remainder of the afternoon, coming no closer than a 37-yard field goal attempt that hooked right of the goalpost. 
On their next possession, the Crim­son Tide showed some signs of life, getting to the Notre Dame 37 before Irish linebacker Bob Crable stopped halfback Linnie Patrick· on fourth and one to douse Alabama's momentum. 
"That was a very important play for us because Alabama was driving and moving the ball well," cited Devine. "I expected Coach Bryant to go for it on fourth and short and I knew we had to stop them because in a close game like this, one play can make the dif­ference." 
Notre Dame also had its share of offensive problems, making it across midfield only twice after halftime. The Irish had an opportunity to raise their lead early in the final quarter, however Oliver's 19-yard field goal try was blocked by Alabama's E. J. Junior after the placekicker slipped on the soggy turf. 
"I don't know what it looked like to you people but this is what college football is all about," Devine empha­sized. "It was a clean, hard-fought game between two great universities and it was a thrill to be a part of it." 
Tight end Nick Vehr echoed his coach's sentiments. 
"It was a hard-hitting game, no doubt about it," he pointed out. "But every hit was clean, and that's what made it a great game. On every play guys from both teams would help each other off the ground. There was great respect out there on the part of both teams. For me, it made the whole game of college

Dame again," sighed Bryant. "Coach Devine simply had his team very. well prepared and they outplayed us today." 
* * * 

After the game, one of the u·ni­formed policemen responsible for es­corting visiting teams to and from Legion Field was talking to no one in particular. 
"I've been escorting Alabama's op­ponents in and out of here for eight years now," he said. "But this is the first time I've ever escorted a winner." 
A green-clad bystander who had overheard the remark was quick to make a point: 
"That's because Notre Dame has never played here."

football worthwhile." 
The 7-0 score marked the first time Alabama had been shut out since 1976 when Georgia blanked the Tide 21-0 in Athens. Bryant-coached Alabama teams had been held scoreless only three times before that; in 1970 when they lost to Tennessee 24-0, in Knox­ville; in 1959 when Penn State won a 7-0 decision in the Liberty Bowl and in 1958 when the Tide played Vander­bilt to a 0-0 standoff. The Vanderbilt game had been the only time an Ala­bama team coached by Bear Bryant was shut out at Birmingham's Legion Field until the Irish came to town.

A Finale to Remember 
By GARY GRASSEY The memory was very much alive in Jim Stone's mind. 
"I can remember Vagas Ferguson coming into the locker room after the Clemson ganie," said the senior half­back recalling the 1979 home season­ending 16-10 loss to the Tigers. "His (Ferguson's) last home game, and we lost. 
"He just came in here," Stone con­tinued from his spot in front of his own locker in a different kind of Irish dress­ing room, "and pointed to that sign on the wall." 
Stone gestured to the poster the Notre Dame football team passes every time it takes the field in the Stadium. 
What I gave, I have ' What I did not give I've lost forever ... 
Tom Gibbons remembers, too. 

"Last year we didn't win our last game here," said the senior Irish tri­captain following Notre Dame's 1980 home wind-up 24-10 win over Air Force. "You could see the hurt in the seniors' eyes. And you know, this is the one you remember over all of them." · 
Of course, when Notre Dame fin­ished the '79 home season against Clemson, there was no talk of national championship dreams around campus or around the nation. Those Irish had been saddled with three defeats prior to the Clemson game. 
However,. in 198Q there was promise of much greater things to come when the unbeaten, once-tied, and second­ranked Irish suited up for Air Force on their final home weekend. And this year's seniors-especially the seniors­who numbered so few (five starters and 21 total) on this young Notre Dame team did not want to make the mistakes of a year ago. 
There would never be another chance to win a game in Notre Dame Stadium and there would never be another chance to win a national championship. 
And yet, with all the obvious motiva­tion factors, there was cause for much consternation when an inspired Air Force team, with a mere two victories to date, took the field against Notre Dame. Just seven days earlier, the Irish had put' together the supreme effort in defeating Bear Bryant's Alabama Crim­son Tide 7-0 in Birmingham. Ancl it was apparent during the first half of the Air Force game that a Notre Dame letdown was in the works. 
"There was a little letdown knowing Air Force didn't have the players and the talent Alabama had," conceded sophomore halfback Phil Carter. 
"I'm sure the Georgia Tech game ran through a lot of people's minds at half­time," Carteradded, referring to Notre Dame's 3-3 tie with the Yellow Jackets two weeks before which had dumped the Irish from the number-one ranking in the nation. "But we weren't· going to let that happen again." 
Early in the contest, coach Ken Hatfield's Air Force defense played a bend-but-never-:break style to near per­fection. Notre Dame quarterback Blair Kiel had his problems passing during the first 30 minutes ( 4-of -14 for 44 yards), but. his stats were compounded by dropped passes and little protection from his offensive line. 



It was a short punt by Kiel from the Notre Dame 35 that set up the Falcons' first score. Air Force defensive back Dave Carraway fielded Kiel's 29­yard boot on the Falcon 46 and re­turned the ball to midfield. 
Two runs brought the ball to the Irish 43 and on third down, Air Force quar­terback Scott Schafer dropped back to pass. The senior signal-caller found run­ning back Charlie Heath alone in the right flat for a gain of 17 yards to the Irish 26. That first down would be the only one permitted by the Notre Dame defense until the midway point in the fourth quarter. 
When the Falcon drive stalled on the Irish 19, freshman Sean Pavlich came on to boot a 35-yard field goal to give Air Force a 3-0 lead with 1:06 to go in the first quarter. 
Notre Dame gained excellent field position, thanks to Jim Stone's 32-yard return on the ensuing kickoff. From its own 44, the Irish offense failed to move. However, Kiel's punt was mis­handled by Marty Louthan on the Air Force 20 and covered by Notre Dame's John Rice with one second remaining in the opening quarter. 
The Irish offense could not make a

first down, so junior Harry Oliver was called on to attempt a 31-yard field goal. Oliver's 17th three-pointer in 22 attempts split the uprights and tied the score with 51 seconds gone in the second quarter. 
Two possessions later, the Irish took advantage of a short punt by Air Force and began to move from the Falcon 48. Carter picked up 11 yards on a draw and Kiel hit tight end Dean Masztak for 15 and a first down inside the Air Force 25. Stone replaced Carter and sped around the left side for 12 more yards and the Irish were faced with first and goal at the Falcon 10. 
Three straight gives to Stone moved Notre Dame just six yards. On fourth and goal, Irish coach Dan Devine elected to go for the touchdown. Kiel rolled to his right, but his pass to senior tight end Nick Vehr fell incomplete. 
"There wasn't much to be said at halftime," said senior All-America cen­ter John Scully. "Coach Devine did some yelling, but we had a lot of good things happen in the first half. We just made costly mistakes." 
Devine said later, "I just decided to go back to doing what we do best." And what the Irish do best is run, run, run. 

With an awesome display of ball con­trol and power football, Notre Dame drove right over the helpless Falcons into the end zone. Of the 14 plays in a 76-yard drive, Phil Carter carried 13 times for 71 yards. The only. variation was a five-yard jaunt by fullback John Sweeney on the sixth play of the march. Carter went over from the Falcon two with 5: 17 left in the third quarter. Oliver's conversion made it 10-3. 
Air Force moved backwards to its own 14 on the next three plays and Jeff Kubiak's 27-yard punt was re­turned by Irish defensive back Dave Duerson to the Falcon 30. 
Marty Detmer: 'Watching the clock tick down, you think about everything that has happened the last four years and, in a way, everyone is happy, but still a little sad at the same time knowing it's all over.' 
The other half of the Notre Dame designated halfback duo, Carter's room­mate Jim Stone, took over and carried the ball on six of the next seven plays the Irish needed to get their second touchdown of the quarter. Again, Sweeney kept the Falcons honest by carrying once for nine yards, but it was Stone who put the ball in the end zone with a seven-yard carry up the middle. 
The Falcons went on to break the Notre Dame defense's string of not al­lowing· a touchdown for 23 quarters. Midway through . the final period a tipped pass was intercepted by Air Force safety Johnny Jackson and a subsequent pass interference penalty put the visitors at the Irish goal line. But the afternoon was not over for Carter and Stone. 
On third and four at the Notre Dame 26, Carter broke through the right side for 25 yards, ending his final home performance with 181 yards on 29 carries. 
From the Air Force 49, Stone took over for the final time in his Notre Dame Stadium career. The senior from Seattle, Wash., who had filled in so brilliantly for Carter for five weeks when a midseason injury wave struck the offense, carried on six of the final nine plays on the drive. He finished the surge with hands held high in the end zone after his two-yard touchdown run closed the door on Air Force. 
"I'll always remember my last carry in this stadium was for a touchdown," Stone recalled later in a postgame conversation. 
"Phil (Carter) and I are as close as two people can get and I feel we have the best one-two punch in the nation. In practice every day since last spring, we've tried to work and push each other as hard as we can. 
"What the coaches decided," he con­tinued with a pause, "well, that was best for the team." 
John Scully had his own reflections on five years of football at Notre Dame. 
"It has been five years of my life," explained the Irish co-captain, "and I'm only 22 years old. Anything you do five years out of a lifetime, it's hard to say anything except I knew this was my last one. It's a feeling you can't express in a few sentences." 
Senior reserve tight end and special teamer Marty Detmer had mixed emo­tions as he walked out of the Notre Dame locker room at the Stadium one last time. 
"You just look around and try to get all the sensations," he said. "Watching the clock tick down, you think about everything that has happened the last four years and; in a way, everyone is happy, but still a little sad at the same time knowing it's all over." 
Perhaps the most fitting words of all, however, found their place on a plaque authored by senior Nick Vehr and pre­sented to outgoing coach Dan Devine in the locker room scene immediately following the Air Force game: 
To Coach Devine 
What we gave, we have. 
what we did not give, 
We've lost forever. 
Thank-you for showing us 
how to give 
and for all we now -have. 
November 22, 1980 
Our last game together 
for Our Lady 
Senior Players 1980 ... 

Devine said, as he pointed to the plaque, "If there have been any heart­aches, this more than makes up for them." 
What the graduating seniors now have from their 1980 season is some­thing no one ever dreamed they'd achieve. And it's theirs forever.

Southern Cal 


USC's a Whole New Game 
By FRANK LaGRO'ITA 
All the gold in California, Is in a bank in the middle of Beverly Hills In somebody else's name. 
As the Notre Dame football team jetted across the country, bound for Los Angeles, singer Larry Gatlin's Country-Western hit, "All the gold in California," played over the airplane's stereo headsets. Appropriate, to say the least, for visions of sunshine, California style, danced in the heads of the 250 passengers aboard. 
Head coach Dan Devine, however, had other things on his mind. Like the Trojans of Southern Cal, for instance. 
"Do I think they're better than their record?" he smiled. "You. better believe I do." 
Ah, but he had to be exaggerating. The Trojans were but 7-2-1 at that point and had lost two straight to Wash­ington and UCLA. The UCLA game was doubly taxing because USC's start­ing quarterback, Gordon Adams, and tailback, Marcus Allen, both had suf­fered injuries that would render them unavailable for the Notre Dame clash. 
"You may say this is just coach's talk," Devine ·said ominously, "but I think we're in for our toughest game of the season on Saturday." 
Immediately after USC's 20-3 win over the Irish, Devine harkened back to that prediction. 
"I had a feeling that Southern Cal would be more than ready to play us," he told reporters. "All week I heard about their injuries and lack of depth and weaknesses at various positions. 
"I didn't see any of that out there today." 
What Devine, along with a national television audience and 82,663 in­person spectators, actually saw was one of the lesser performances by a Notre Dame offense in 1980. The Irish could manage only 120 total net yards-well below their season average of 349.5 yards per contest. Meanwhile the Tro­jans did not do much better, picking up 212 yards against a Notre Dame de­fense that tried its best to carry the entire load. 
And, were it not for some very costly offensive mistakes, it might have been successful. 
"Mistakes hurt us, no doubt about that," ·pointed out Devine. "A fumble, two interceptions and some very costly penalties led to all of USC's points." 
The Trojans' first touchdown came six and one-half minutes into the sec­ond quarter after Irish halfback Phil Carter fumbled on his own 26-yard line. Six plays later, Trojan tailback Michael Harper slipped in from six yards out and USC led 7-0 after Eric Hipp's placement. 
"Phil Carter is an excellent player," Devine said in defense of the sopho­more. "He's definitely the best sopho­more runner I have ever seen in my career. I know he feels terrible about that fumble but he's got a great career ahead of him."

.Sugar Bowl 
Irish Can't Figure the Figures 
By JOHN HEISLER· It easily can be transformed into a game of numbers, football can. And the Sugar Bowl football figures certainly seemed to favor Notre Dame. 
Georgia stood atop the wire-service polls. The Bulldogs came in 11-0, with the only unblemished record left in the country. And Vince Dooley had his share of all-stars on the roster-from kicker Rex Robinson to safety Scott Woerner to wonder-runner Herschel Walker. 
But Dooley was among the first to suggest Notre Dame should be the favorite. 
He admitted the superior Irish size up front would hurt. He admitted Notre Dame had played a tougher schedule. 
And he admitted Notre Dame's tradi­tion-rich heritage might even help. Irish fans pointed to their own list of figures. 
Six times in the nine previous Notre Dame bowl games, the Irish had faced an unbeaten and top-ranked opponent. The last five times Notre Dame emerged victorious, claiming the national crown for itself by beating Alabama in the '73 Sugar Bowl and Texas in the '78 Cotton Bowl. 
Five straight Irish bowl foes had been vanquished. Would anqther No. 1 bite the dust? 
Even the statistics compiled in the New Orleans Superdome on January 1 boosted the Irish cause. 
Notre Dame rolled up 328 total yards 
and 17 first downs, compared to only 
127 and 10 for Georgia. Even Walker, 
who had scooted for 95 first-half yards 
and two touchdowns, managed only 55 
on 19 second-half carries. Overall, the 
Bulldogs accounted for only 57 total 
yards after halftime-and 40 of those 
came as Georgia ran out the clock in 
the game's final three minutes. Georgia 

didn't complete a pass until two minutes · remained in the game. 
But by then it didn't matter-because 
the number that counted on the score­
board stood in Georgia's favor. 
Though Notre Dame maintained pos­
session of the football more than nine 
minutes than did Georgia, the South­
eastern Conference champions made a 
case for their first-ever national cham-

piortship in a period of less than three 
minutes midway through the first half. 
That's all the time it took for Dooley's 
'Dogs to reap a two-touchdown harvest 
from a pair of fatal Irish turnovers deep 
in their own territory. ­
Irish coach Dan Devine all week had · emphasized the way his defense had 
forced the opposition to go long dis­
stances for its points. 
"We have not been a team that turns 

the ball over deep inside our own terri­
tory," he lamented after the Sugar 
Bowl. "Ironically, .. some of the things 
that got us here backfired a little bit 
today." 
· The game opened auspiciously for 

Notre Dame. The Irish advanced the 
opening kickoff from their own 20 to 
the Bulldog 32 -before settling for a 
50-yard Harry· Oliver field goal. Then, 
on Georgia's ensuing possession, the 
'Dogs moved 16 yards in reverse before 
punting from their own six-yard line. 
This time Notre Dame zipped to the 

Georgia 31. But the 'Dogs blocked 
Oliver's 48-yard three-point attempt­
and suddenly the momentum swung the 
other direction. 
Georgia quickly moved into position · for a tying Robinson field goal. Then 
came the bobbles that the Irish never 
would overcome. 
With 1 :45 to go in the opening period Robinson kicked off to the Irish, who sent Jim Stone and Ty Barber deep to receive. Stone called for Barber to field the kick, but instead both players jogged forward as if to block. The ball bounced lonesomely down to the one­yard line and Georgia's Bob Kelly re­covered. 
"I called it forTy, but he didn't hear me," Stone said. 
"It was just the noise from the crowd," Barber said. "I guess he thought I had it, and I thought he had it. I think we were both too anxious to block." 
After Walker dove the one yard for the score the two teams exchanged punts-with Notre Dame taking over on its own 20 with 14:11 left in the first half. This time sophomore fullback John Sweeney carried up the middle and lost the handle on the football. Chris Welton recovered and, for the second time in less than_ three minutes, the 'Dogs enjoyed a perfect setup. 
Walker quickly picked up 12 yards, then went the final three for the six points a play later. That made it 17-3 in Georgia's favor. Though the Bulldogs didn't come near the end zone again, that margin proved to be enough. 
The Notre Dame defense gave up next to nothing the rest of the way. 
Only twice did Georgia puncture the midfield barrier--once when Jeff Fish­er's interception set the 'Dogs up at the Irish 37 (Robinson eventually missed a 48-yard field-goal attempt) and once in the final three minutes as Georgia played ball control after another inter­ception. 
But the story of the second half proved to be Georgia's bend-but-never­break defense. With the Bulldog of­fense almost completely shut down by Notre Dame, Georgia had to depend on its defenders to hold off the Irish time and time again. And it met that challenge masterfully. 
Time and time again the Irish tanta­lized their fans by marching into Geor­gia territory-but only once did they come away with any. points. 
First Devine inserted senior Mike Courey at quarterback immediately after Georgia claimed its 17-3 advan­tage. He quickly directed a 65-yard ad­vance (39 'of the yards on his own scrambling), only to have Woerner take the ball away from Pete Holohan in the end zone on fourth down from the 13. 
"I was just in the right position on that corner route their man ran," Woerner said. "I've been fighting the alley-oop pass in the end zone all year. 

It's a great offensive weapon, but I've seen a lot of it and I was able to handle that one. I just got up in the air as high as I could and that was enough." 
Next, after Courey suffered a broken bone in his hand, Blair Kiel directed the Irish from their 40 to the Georgia 13. After two incomplete pass attempts in the end zone, Oliver pulled a 30-yard field-goal attempt to the right. 
Next, the Irish stayed exclusively on the ground in penetrating to the Geor­gia 21. This time Oliver's 38-yarder missed left. 
In the last five minutes of the contest, Notre Dame again surged past the mid­field mark in search of the tying score. But Kiel's fourth-down pass for Dean Masztak was picked off by Woerner on the sidelines at the Georgia 34. 
· In between, Notre Dame did manage a touchdown on a drive in which Kiel completed all four of his passes for 38 yards. But the frustrated Irish simply couldn't solve the 'Dogs' defense often enough. 
"We were wearing down," said Geor­gia defensive coordinator Erk Russell. "We had guys out there dying. But that's typical of the kind of guys we've got out there. They were dying but they didn't crumble." 
Georgia won the football game by doing what it had done all year long­leading the nation in turnover ratio. Notre Dame's Sugar Bowl effort pro­duced five turnovers. Georgia had none. 
"If you had told me before the game that Buck Belue was going to complete only one pass and they'd stop Herschel 

Stopping Georgia's Herschel Walker kept the Irish occupied afternoon. 
in the second half, I don't think I could have said we'd win," said Bob Kelly. "But the difference in the game was we capitalized on their errors and hung in there." 
"I'd like to think we helped make our own fortune today," added Dooley. "We moved a lot and went after the football. This is the fightingest team I've ever coached. They're the greatest bunch of guys I've ever been around because they play as a team." 
Notre Dame generally agreed. 

"They came ready to play," said Irish captain John Scully. "They may not have been the best team we played in terms of talent, but that goes to show you talent doesn't always make the dif­ference at the end of the game. 
"They gave up a lot of yards this season, and they gave up a lot of yards to us today. But somehow when we got around that 20-yard line they just kept making those big defensive plays." 
For Devine, it was an unfamiliar end to a collegiate career that had made him the second-winningest active coach at that level. 
"I'm searching for words because I never like to get beat," he said. "I'm proud of our team effort, particularly in the second half. I thought we could pull it out. We gave it our best shot. But Georgia is by far the best football team we've played this year. 
"Anyway, there's an old football ex­pression that says statistics are for losers." 
Even Dan knew the right numbers simply didn't come up for the Irish.

Bob Burger 
Irish Guard M·akes the Grade 
By VINCE TURNER 

In the locker room, Bob Burger is the stereotype college football player, a 6-2, 240-pound man-child with broad shoulders and powerful legs. He wears a boyish smile under a mop of un­evenly cut hair and his body is dec­orated with assorted cuts, bruises and abrasions. 
Burger is a guard for the University of Notre Dame and in the trenches on Saturday afternoon he performs as an athlete. Monday through Friday, how­ever, brings a different kind of per­formance out of the Cincinnati native. 
Bob Burger the athlete makes a transformation into Bob Burger the pre-med student. 
It is a careful balancing act, com­bining the hours it takes to become a major college football player with the normal academic demands placed on any student. 
"More than anything else, you have 

to sit down early and take stock of your 
priorities," Burger says of his double 
life as an athlete and a student: "A 
football player who wants to do well 
in the classroom has to budget his time 
and discipline himself. It sometimes 
means accepting different priorities, but 
you have to decide on your own where . your life is going to take you." 
Burger has walked the tightrope well, 

shattering the theory held in some 
circles that a quality athlete cannot 
become a· quality student. 
The former walk-on does his football 

job . well, anchoring an offensive line 
that has helped the likes of Jim Stone 
and Phil Carter shatter several Notre. 
Dame rushing records this season. He is 
a scholar/athlete who happens to be 
playing for a team that is unbeaten and 
rated number-one in the polls. · 
Burger is equally impressive in the 

classroom, where he carries a 3.77 
grade point average (on a scale of 4.0) 
and has been honored by the National 
Football Foundation as an Academic 
All-American. 
"I try to take pride in anything I do 

-in the classroom, on the football field 
or anywhere else I might be," Burger 
relates. "I recognize the fact that aca­
demics is the main reason I'm here and 
it has to stay No. 1. Outside the class­
room I can devote my time to football, 
still working as hard as I can." 

Notre Dame athletic--officials point with pride to Burger and his teammates as proof that academic standards and quality athletic performance do not have to be in constant conflict. The school presents degrees to an unusually high number (99.5 percent) of its ath­letes and insists the trend will continue. 
"You don't have to · compromise yourself to produce a strong athletic program," offers athletic director Ed­ward "Moose" Krause. "A lot of coaches have been saying recently that you have to relax your standards to compete with everybody else. Bob has not relaxed his standards and he com­petes very well. 
"An education should be everyone's prime goal here-whether he plays football or not. It's something we take a lot of pride in." 
"First things come first and the first 
thing here has always been the student's 
academic life," adds Rev. Edmund 
Joyce, C.S.C., the chairman of the 
school's Faculty Board in Control of 
Athletics. "We have always placed our 
prime interest on that very thought. 
That's exactly what I tell every group 
of athletes as they arrive in the fall and 
they hear it over and over again for the 
rest of their stay at the University." 
"When athletes come here, they don't 
here a lot of promises about starting as 
freshmen or someday making the pros," 
Burger confirms. "What they do prom­
ise you is, if you work hard, you can 
graduate with a degree and get a good 
education." 
Studies have always been important 
to Bob Burger. He grew up on the idea 
that a good education is a vital tool in 
the cultivation of a successful life. 
"My father went to night school," 
Burger remembers. "He couldn't afford 
to do it any other way. He was even 
drafted before he had a chance to 
finish, but he came right back. He 
worked part time during the day and 
spent every night in school. 
"He always told my brother anq me a story about skipping classes one night. A friend convinced my father he needed to get away for a 'good time' and my father went with him. But while he was out, he said he kept ask­ing himself, 'What am I doing here? I should be in school.' He never did enjoy himself that night. He always tells that story to relate the value he sees in an education." 
Those lessons have not been lost on 
Robert Burger's oldest son. Bob gradu­
ated number-three in his class at Cin­
cinnati LaSalle High School and has 
never lost sight of his academic goals. 
"At first, doing well in school was a game we played," Burger smiles. "I re­member when three A's on a report card meant a trip to a ball game. I loved the Cincinnati Reds when I was growing up and I can remember run­ning home while counting the A's, fig­uring out how many times Dad would 
.have to take me to see them play. 
"That lasted for a few years, while I was younger. Later it was more pride than anything else. School was always a very positive subject in our house." 
Burger is majoring in chemical engi­neering at Notre Dame, but is gearing his studies toward a career in medicine and is taking. the required courses needed to enter medical school. He is, in effect, a double major. 
"I always did well in quantitative work in high school," the Irish senior explains. "I excelled in the math courses I took and I had a real interest in chemistry. All of that just kind of pointed me into the (chemical engineer-. 

ing) direction." 
Burger quickly changed his goals, 
however, after a year. A friendly, 
people-oriented youngster who can't 
walk four steps on campus without 
saying something to somebody, Burger 
says he wants to spend his lifetime with 
people, not with test tubes. 
"I tried to picture where I would be 
in four years and felt I'd like to do 
something on a one-to-one basis," he 
adds. "I think I can be a lot more 
satisfied with my life with medicine as 
a career. 
"When I think of satisfaction in 
medicine, I think about dealing with 
people. The reward in medicine is con­
tributing something to other lives. In a 
family practice, for instance, you deal 
with that every day." 
Life on the tightrope has not always 
been easy. Medical studies exact a high 
price for success and football com­
pounds the interest on the payments. 
"Football has set hours every day," 
Burger notes. "I've accepted the fact 
that those hours are booked and what­
ever time is left over goes into studying. 
"Surprisingly, football is the one that usually suffers when it comes down to a choice. Really, it's sleep that loses out and that indirectly hurts football. There are some days, after you've been up past midnight working on a paper or studying for a test, where you're not physically ready. It takes its toll in practice. 
"Sure, there are times when the studies take a back seat. If you get back from practice at 8 or 8:30 in the evening, there is only a certain amount of time left for you to budget. There are times· when you take a test the next day and you feel you might have been better prepared had you not spent three or four hours on football instead." 
Burger credits the Notre Dame coaching staff with promoting the scholarI athlete philosophy. Where some college athletic staffs push books to the back of the bus, the Irish coaches put them in the driver's seat. 
"It is never suggested that you take a certain course or drop another," Burger relates. "The only thing they suggest is that you put as many of your courses onto your morning schedule as possible. 
"Still, you see people coming in a little late every day in practice. Some of them drift out a half-hour or so after it starts because a lab ran late or they had an afternoon class. You won't see that very often in-most programs, but here it's just accepted among the coaches that you're going to. be a little behind. sometimes." 
One of Burger's instructors, theology professor Jim Tabor, admits he, too, is surprised with the athlete's ability to blend books and football. 
"I suppose I was like everyone else, looking for the stereotype athlete in class," the second-year instructor ad­mits. "You know how it is. You expect to walk into the class expecting to see all of the athletes grouped together in the back of the room. It's just not that way. 
"Bob's not the only football player I've had. Some of the others-Harry Oliver, Tim Koegel, John Leon-were also good students. Of the football play­ers I've had, they've all done B, A-or A work. I've never had any doing B-, C or lower. I guess you could say I've been presented with a pretty good im­age of the scholar/ athlete." 
"The opportunities are here," Burger adds. "All you have to do is take ad­vantage of them. I feel sorry for the guys who get caught in the trap think­ing they can get by on just athletic ability." 
Once in a while, Bob Burger lets the work ethic of his philosophy slip into the conversation. In the beginning, even Notre Dame made Burger prove him­self. Burger was a walk-on, a student who tries out for the team without the help of a scholarship. 
"It was really difficult at first, both mentally and physically," he remem­bers. "There were times when I won­dered just what it was I was trying to prove. I wondered if I belonged. But I told myself I was going to stick with it." 
Burger eventually earned a position 

· on the traveling squad and during his junior season, was awarded an athletic scholarship. 
"I think working for it (the scholar­ship) has made it mean a little more to me. Maybe that's the way it is in the classroom, too. For me, it's a matter of trying to be prepared . . . on the field and in the classroom." 
Burger is not alone on Notre Dame's scholar/ athlete rolls. In the past 31 years, 25 Irish gridders have been awarded Academic All-American status. 
"Sometimes people really shatter their lives by refusing to believe there is life after football. Sometimes people think they're going to get by all of their life on athletic ability. That's really sad. It disappoints me that people don't have the foresight to notice education is their only real edge against the future. 
"Football has been a very real part of my life, but it's important to re­member it is just that-a part of my life-and no more. I'm going to have some pretty nice memories someday, but memorfes aren't going to take me where 1 want to go."

Moose's Debt Paid In Full 
By VINCE TURNER 
One of the last vestiges of the l(nute 

Rockne legend at Notre Dame will be 
dimmed a bit next month. 
Edward "Moose" Krause, who freely admits his tenure as athl\!tic director at the University has been fueled by the Rockne tradition, will step down after 31 years in the position. Retirement is a natural part of athletic life, but Krause's decision to hand the reins over to somebody else is still a painful one. 
It seems as if Moose has always been a part of Notre Dame. It was only nat­ural to assume he always would be. Come January, however, a new name will be stenciled in at the top of the letterhead. 
"If I had any success as athletic di­rector here, it is because I have tried to follow the tradition of Knute Rockne in the operation of our program," Krause relates. "I have tried to build on what he left us." 
Moose never had the opportunity to play for the game's greatest coaching name. He was a member of the 1930 freshman squad, but Rockne was killed in an airplane disaster the following March. 
"But he is as alive today as when he was walking on campus," Kral.1se beams. "Some of the greatest minds in college football voted him the greatest coach of all time not too long ago. When I was a kid in my first year at Notre Dame, I thought I was meeting God. 
"The man was a master at motivating people. In that respect, he was 10 years ahead of his time. He was a philoso­pher, a psychologist and a great teacher, but he always had a very human side. to him. He could inspire people to con­stantly give 100 percent, which is a very difficult task, indeed." 
Krause's life at Notre Dame Is filled with accomplishments even Rockne would admire. He was a two-time All­American as a tackle in football, but made his real fame as a member of George Keogan's Irish basketball squad. A three-time All-American choice, Krause is a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame. His domination of the game under the basket helped ·bring about a rule change that remains with the game today-the three-second vio­lation. 
Basketball soon became Krause's life. 

Upon graduation from Notre Dame, he went on to gain respect as a coach. His first stop was at St. Mary's (Minnesota) and from there he proceeded to Holy Cross, which became a national power under his direction. Krause returned home to his alma mater in 1943, guid­ing the Irish to a 98-48 record in six seasons. 

There have been many men with many talents who since have surpassed Krause's basketball records, but few will enjoy one night he experienced in Boston. 
"I played for two professional teams -Boston and nearby Wooster. At the end of the year, both were unbeaten and were to play each other for the cham­pionship of New England. Of course, this put me in a spot. Each owner ex­pected me to play for him and the argu­ments got louder and louder as we dis­cussed the matter. 
"Finally we decided that I would play for each team~ I played for Boston in the first half and we took the lead, but then I switched uniforms and played for Wooster in the second half and we won the game. I made $400 for that game, which at that time was one of the largest payments ever made to a profes­sional athlete." 
Krause took another step up in 1948 when he was named an assistant to Notre Dame athletic director Frank Leahy. A year later he · succeeded Leahy. 
As he ponders his incredible list of accomplishments over 31 years, Krause hesitates little when picking No. 1. He remains proud of Notre Dame's aca­demic tradition, especially when it is associated with athletics. 
Again, Krause traces the roots of this philosophy back to his experience with Rockne. 
"I remember my first year here, when there were more than 300 men out for freshman football. My father had come down from Chicago for the first time to see my brother and me and he wanted very much to meet Knute Rockne. There we were, trying to ex­plain to my father how busy the man was when all of a sudden, Rockne starts walking toward us. The first thing he said was, 'Hello, boys, how are your grades?' Can you imagine a man like that recognizing us out of 300 faces and then the first thing he's concerned with is your schoolwork? 
"We (at Notre Dame) have always believed there are three parts to a good education. There is the intellectual, the spiritual and the physical. We consider that to be the full education offered at Notre Dame and we feel all three are equally important." 
Krause notes with pride the school's academic record, claiming 99 percent of all athletes who attend Notre Dame earn a degree. Every player who has played for basketball coach Digger Phelps has graduated and the same is true for every hockey player who has skated for Lefty Smith. 
"A lot of coaches today are saying you have to lower your academic stan­dards to compete athletically," Krause bristles, "and that statement makes me very uncomfortable. I think our record -on the field and in the classroom­proves you can have competitive teams and still . maintain high academic stan­dards. 
"Our coaches have to screen their re­
cruits very, very carefully. At the risk 
of s6unding a little pompous, there are 
a lot of athletes at a lot of schools 
today who would not be able to enroll 
at Notre Dame. 
"But there are athletes out there­
black and white, boys and girls-who 
do have the qualifications to compete at 
Notre Dame or anywhere else, for that 
matter. You can build an athletic tradi­-tion and maintain a strong academic tradition at the same time." 
Krause calls the athlete who fails to take advantage of his educational op­portunities "one of the great tragedies of all time." He says less than one­eighth of . one percent of all college athletes actually continue into the pro­fessional ranks and for the majority·, there must be life after sports. 
"When Vagas Ferguson (Notre Dame's all-time leading rusher) was· negotiating with the New England Pa­triots last summer for a professional football contract, he had a pretty good idea what he wanted," Krause relates. "When the Patriots ·offered him con­siderably· less than that figure, he sim­ply told them he may not play. 'I have an education,' he told them, 'and I want to get into banking. All this means is I start a little sooner than I expected.' Needless to say, it wasn't long before New England came back with a better 
offer. 
"We have 24 Notre Dame players on National Football League rosters right now. Every one of them has a degree. Every one of them has an education to help him after his football days are over. I think that is a great compliment to our University." 
Another source of pride for Krause is ·the Notre Dame football schedule. Once ridiculed for its "softness,'' the slate has been slowly turned by Krause into a tour of the nation's best-known football schools-Alabama, USC, Penn State, Michigan, Louisiana State, Flor­ida State and more. It makes being the football coach a bit more insecure, but has offered additional excitement to col­lege football fans. 
Once again, Krause echoes the teach­ings of Rockne. 
"Rockne always said you should play the best and he went out and proved it by scheduling trips all around the coun­try. In fact, he lost his life while he was on a trip to schedule more oppo­nents. He always said if you win, it's going to be that much better when you beat the best. If you lose, there is no shame in losing to the best. 
"I take great pride in a national schedule. You can use this year as an example. We went east agairist Navy, west against USC and Arizona and we went south to play Georgia Tech and Alabama. Of course, we also played some of the best in our own region, with Michigan, Michigan State and Purdue on our schedule.'' 
Perhaps the biggest step Notre Dame football · ever took came on Jan. 1, 1970, when the Fighting Irish broke a 44-year embargo against postseason bowl games and met Texas in the Cotton Bowl. 
"Our academic priority was the main 
reason we never went to a bowl before 
then," Krause explains. "Of course, 
most bowls back then were played on 
New Year's Day or very close to that 
time. We didn't have all the bowls we 
have. now. But the bowls came at the 
same time as our semester exams. We 
just didn't feel we could take the stu­
dents away at that time. The school 
calendar changed around 1970 and it was then we considered going to bowl games.'' 
Despite the money lure of a bowl game (a team can reap as much as $2 million with an appearance in a major bowl) Notre Dame has still been selec­tive. Seven of its eight appearances have been in one of the four "major bowls" -four in the Cotton Bowl, two in the Orange and one in the Sugar Bowl. Its only other postseason appearance was in the Gator Bowl. On three occasions since the ban was lifted, the Irish have chosen to stay at home. 
"When we look at a bowl, we want to choose a game that will give us a chance to win the national champion­ship or move us up in the polls. If we're not No. 1, we want to play the team that is, or we at least want to play a team ranked higher than we are. What we don't want to do is play in a bowl just for the sake of playing another game." 
Three times the national champion­ship has been decided at a bowl Notre Dame appeared in. Texas took the title in 1969 by beating the Irish in the Cotton Bowl, Notre Dame grabbed the national championship with a classic Sugar Bowl victory over Alabama in 1973 and won it again in 1977 by whip­ping Texas in the Cotton Bowl. The Irish will have another opportunity this year when they tackle No. 1 Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. 
Football is not alone at Notre Dame~ however. In tandem with popular Digger Phelps, the basketball program has become among the most respected in the country and has a schedule to match. Some UCLA-Notre Dame show­downs are now classics and the ACC, where the Irish play their home games, is nationally known as the "House of Upsets." 
Notre Dame won NCAA champion­ships in fencing in 1977 and 1978. The hockey program is on the upswing and several "new sports" have been added to the program in the past decade. Even the women's basketball program took a giant step into the world of Division I this season. 
"In the face of cutbacks elsewhere, we~re the only school in the country still adding sports to our program," Krause adds. "We recently added soccer and lacrosse to our men's program. We've also added basketball, volleyball, tennis, field hockey and fencing for women. We're confident about offer­ing a total sports program." 
Even the average student falls under 
the Krause influence at some time dur..:. 
ing his stay at Notre Dame. Despite the 
national l'restige of the· varsity sports~ 
Moose has continued to monitor the 
pulse of. intramural programs. 
"You don't have· to be on the varsity level to learn the lessons of Rockne," Krause maintains. "You can still ex­perience being part of a team, disci­plining yourself and responding to ad­versity. We estimate that at least 90 percent of our students are involved in some form of athletics, either by play­ing a varsity sport, a club sport or in in tram urals." 

In fact, Krause's contributions are as deep and meaningful as the Notre Dame tradition itself. The ACC, home for the Irish basketball and hockey teams and a total sports complex, was nurtured along by Krause in its early years. It was he who made countless trips across the country raising the funds needed to keep the project going. 
Still, Krause leaves his position at Notre Dame feeling as though he has a debt of service yet to be paid. 
"I've had a happy and fruitful life here. My two sons went to Notre Dame. My daughter went to St. Mary's. I've had a full life here and I've never regretted staying, even if it meant turn­ing down some pretty good offers. 
"The greatest satisfaction my job has given me-outside of the kids I coached -is the chance to witness some of the great legends of sports. There were Rockne, Frank Leahy and Ara Par­seghian. I played for George Keogan, one of the greatest basketball coaches ever. All of the great players you read about-Bertelli, Creighton Miller, Lu­jack, Czarobski, Leon Hart, Hornung­! had the chance to see. I could never repay anyone for those memories." 
Many are certain, however, that if Rockne were here today, he would mark the ledger paid in full. The legend who played such a vital role in Krause's leadership has been strengthened by Moose's dedication. 
"Moose will always be part of the spirit that is Rockne," Digger Phelps insists. "Those of us who were not fortunate enough to live with the man at least get a feeling of the spirit he brought to Notre Dame because Moose Krause certainly has carried it on." 
It's the People Moose Will Miss -Most 
Will Rogers used to claim he never 
met a man he didn't like, but the 
American legend of wit and humor 
has nothing on jovial Moose 
Krause. It seems Moose has. never 
met a man who didn't know who 
he, Krause, is or what he does. 

People have played a big role in 
Krause's 31-year career as athletic 
director at the University of Notre 
Dame. As he prepares to retire 
from his post next month, Krause 
says it was the people who kept 
him going. 

"I don't think I've ever been any­
where where people didn't know 
about Notre Dame," Krause smiles. 
"There are Notre Dame touchd~wn 
clubs in every st'ate and all around 
the world. This is truly a national 

University and that's a big part of 
the enjoyment I've had here. 
"When I say I've run into Notre Dame fans all ov-er the world I mean just that. We· were in Rome when my son was ordained and people stopped me there. It's hap­pened in Switzerland and London ... anywhere you can think of." 
Krause even has trouble finding escape in Panama, where he takes a yearly fishing trip. The arch­bishop of· that country always or­ganizes a Notre Dame club ban­quet and Moose ends up address­ing more· than 100 Latin American football followers. 
Krause says he can divide the sports world into three groups: Notre Da~e alumni (people who actually graduated from the Uni­versity), people he calls the "sub­way alumni" (fans who may never even see the school but still claim the Irish as their own), and . the 
people who root against Notre 
Dame. 
The "subway alumni" may be 
the most rabid followers of them 
all. 
"I was in New York one time in the 1950s, had lunch with some friends and we decided to see a Dodgers' game," Krause recalls. "Our car was stopped by some traffic near a construction site in Brooklyn. While we were stopped, one of the workers looked into the car and said, 'Hey, aren't you Moose Krause of Notre Dame?' When I said I was, he yelled to the rest of the workers and they all gathered around the car, asking questions about the team. 
"We were having a great time but the traffic jam was just getting worse because of us. Eventually, a police officer came by to get us moving, but it turned out he was a Notre Dame fan, too, and he joined right in. We must have been there 15 minutes and traffic got worse and worse. But we had a wonderful time." 
Krause believes the biggest rea­son for Notre Dame's popularity­and consequently, his own noto­riety-is the team's national sched­ule. In any given season, the Fight­ing Irish are likely to visit every region of the country. 
Despite the large · following, Krause says the numbers do not influence athletic decisions at the school. 
"The alumni have nothing to do with hiring or firing a coach here," he insists. "The University alone makes those decisions and has never once wavered from that posi­tion. We do not expect a coach to win the national championship. We only expect that to be his goal." 

Accordingly, Krause downplays the fans' role in the resignations of such coaching legends as Frank Leahy and Ara Parseghian. 
"Leahy resigned because of the pressures he put on himself. The pressures he (Leahy) felt were self­inflicted. The same was true of Ara. These men were so intense and had such a desire to succeed that they drove themselves to the point where they felt they had to resign. In the end, Frank and Ara left for the same reason-they were afraid for their health." 
Krause says the horror stories of pressure and success at Notre Dame are exaggerated as they pass from year to year. He prefers to point to the positive results of mass fan support. 
"When we were in Texas for our first Cotton Bowl in 1970, we were treated to dinner at a Hall of Fame banquet, where they were honoring all of the great Texas football play­ers. Here ·we were, in front of all those Te~ans, and coach Darryl Royal gets up and says 'what an honor it is for us to play Notre Dame, the most prestigious school in the country.' That was one of the greatest compliments I've ever heard. 
"People have made this a great school and a great job for me to have," Moose says, "and it's the people I'll miss the most."

Gerry Faust 


Those First Faust Impressions 
By FRANK LaGROTTA 
The basement of Stanford Hall is overcrowded with students waiting to see and hear and judge for themselves. The atmosphere resembles a classroom on the first day of a new semester. Everybody sits, chattering nervously, awaiting the arrival of the new pro­fessor ... waiting to see if everything (or anything) they've heard about him is true. 
At seven o'clock heads anxiously turn, checking the door, and the clock, at regular intervals. At 7:10 anxiety is turning into irritation. 
· "Hey, this guy is late and he better have a pretty good reason." 
He will learn, as his predecessors quickly did, that the students will be his toughest critics . _and his most devoted fans. 
* * * 
The rumors about Gerry Faust and Notre Dame had been circulating for more than a month. Ironically, his name was one of the first mentioned for the vacant position of head football coach way back in August. But noth­ing became official until the telephone rang in Faust's office on November 24. 
"I knew I was one of the candi­dates," recalls Faust, "and I knew the decision would be made that day. But until I got the call from Father Joyce, I was not sure I actually had the job." 
That call came at three o'clock, but Faust was not waiting anywhere near the telephone. In fact he was getting ready to show the films of Moeller High School's most recent victory-a 30-7 trouncing of the Massillon Tigers that gave his Crusaders a fifth state title in the past six years. 
"They called me from the office and told me I had a phone call," Faust re­members, getting excited as he retells the story for what has to be the ·hun­dredth time. "I ran down to the office and it was Father Joyce. He said the job was mine if I wanted it. 
"I took about two seconds to say yes." 
The five-hour drive to South Bend that day was. the beginning of a dream come true for the 45-year-old Faust and his wife, Marlene. It was a dream rooted in high school days at Cham­inade in Dayton, Ohio, when Faust wanted Notre Dame but the Irish weren't interested. 
"I was too small to come to Notre Dame," he admits, pointing out that he opted for the University of Dayton where he began a long relationship with the Society of Mary, whose priests staff the university as well as Moeller High School. Faust earned three letters as a quarterback at Dayton before, upon graduation in 1957, he returned to Chaminade as offensive and defensive backfield coach. 
"I wanted to coach and I wanted to coach at Chaminade because I wanted to work under my father," Faust says. The elder Faust, nicknamed Fuzzy, coached at Chaminade for 49 years. 
"And he was, and is, my idol," em­phasizes Faust. "Both as a coach and as a person. I think he is the greatest coach that ever lived and his records at Chaminade bear witness to that." 
After two years at Chaminade, Faust heard of a new Catholic high school in Cincinnati that would open with a freshman class in 1960. He was just what the new school was looking for so, in August of 1960, he left Chaminade for the head coaching job at Mo~ller High School and an appointment with destiny. When he left the Crusaders 20 years later, he left a 174-17-2 rec­ord, 12 Greater Cincinnati League crowns, eight regional titles and three mythical national championships. 
It's quite all right to tip your hat to a job more than very well done. But high school is high school and college is college.... 
And Notre Dame is Notre Dame. 
"I would have never left Moeller ex­cept to come to Notre Dame," says Faust, who claims he thrives on pres­sure. "I realize that Notre Dame is a great school with a great tradition and that they want a winner. 
"And so do I." Friends at Moeller have little doubt of Faust's ability to do the job. 
"When he was here, Gerry was the football coach, athletic director, fund­raiser, ticket manager, cafeteria moni­tor, booster club moderator, walk-a­thon chairman, athletic groundskeeper," a spokesman for Moeller goes on and on. "Why he was even responsible for keeping the sign in front of the school updated. 
"And you know something? He did every one of those jobs like it was his only job. When Gerry was in charge of something, it always got done right." 
Besides that, Faust ran a summer football camp and gave an average of two motivational clinics a week during the offseason to major corporations around the nation. Said the Wall Street Journal: "Gerry Faust is one of the most dynamic public speakers for in­dustrial meetings." 
Faust, a deeply religious man who believes strongly in the power of prayer, claims that devotion to family and willingness to yield to the will of God are the only secrets of his success. 
"Well, that and a lot of hard work," he smiles. "But I truly believe that God has a plan for each of us and if we are faithful to Him we will be successful." 
So he comes to Notre Dame as proof that clean living and honest values don't always force nice guys to finish last. He is openly grateful for a chance to contribute to Notre Dame and what he believes the university stands for. 
"I think Notre Dame wants to de­velop the whole person," he says. "No­where else is there this perfect mixture of academics, athletics and religion­the three factors that contribute to a person's development. 
"I'm not ashamed to say how hon­ored I am to be given this opportunity to come here. I know I won't please everyone but I will always do my best and do what I think is right. I was under heavy pressure to win at Moeller -we were expected to win-but I liked that." 
Offensively, he expects the 1981 Fighting Irish to be exciting and fun to watch. 
"I think you have to pattern your philosophy around the talent you have," he explains. "We'll throw about 35 per­cent of the time and we'll try to mix up our offense so that we're not pre­dictable. Defensively, we'll be aggres­sive and emphasize speed and quick­ness. 
"I hope we'll give the fans of Notre Dame something to be proud of." 
He wasn't on the job for five min­utes before he set out on his first major task-recruiting a freshman class for next· season. 
"We want to recruit the best group of men in the nation," ·he says. "That is our goal every year. But I don't just mean athletically. We want the best players, of course, but we also want the best people. We want people who will fit into the environment at Notre Dame and we will sometimes sacrifice ability on the field to achieve that result. 

"And we will not ever cheat. We will be honest with the players, because we want them to be honest with us. If you get a player to come to your school by dishonest means, that implies to me that you have no real respect for the player and the player, likewise, has no real desire to come to your school. 
"We want people who want to come to Notre Dame. And I doubt that we'll have trouble finding them." 
* * * 

At 7:15, the door opens and Gerry Faust enters the room, weaving his way through the packed · house until, when he is finally seen, the room breaks into wild applause ~nd those lucky enough to have seats give him a standing ovation. 
"I'm really happy to be here and I'm sorry I'm late, but I was on the phone with a prospect and we really want this kid because he'd be great for Notre Dame," he begins. For 60 minutes he keeps up a non-stop dialogue with the students who forget about studying, forget about television, forget about getting to the library because this is more important. This is Notre Dame's 
new head football coach. What could be more important? 
"I want to tell you that the neatest thing in the world is to be able to say you graduated from Notre Dame be­cause Notre Dame is a unique place," he tells students who have been known to scoff on occasion when told the very same thing by parents, professors or the parish priest back home. Now, how­ever, they look at him and nod their heads in agreement because it's obvi­ous Gerry Faust really believes in what he is saying. 
And it's even more obvious that these students really believe in Gerry Faust. 

Gene Corrigan 



The Ultimate Challenge 
By FRANK LaGRO'ITA 
It was late afternoon on October 14, 1980, and Gene Corrigan needed some advice. 
Corrigan, director of athletics at the University of Virginia, had just ac­cepted the same position at the Uni­versity of Notre Dame, replacing Ed­ward W. "Moose" Krause, who was retiring after 31 years 'of service. 
For Corrigan, it had not been an easy decision to leave Virginia, where he and his family had been happily situated since 1971. A lot of time, con­sideration and perhaps a few sleepless nights had been spent before he finally said yes to Rev. Edmund P. Joyce, C.S.C., Notre Dame's executive vice­president and chairman of the Faculty Board in Control of Athletics. 
"I would never have left Virginia for any school but Notre Dame," Corrigan admitted in his new office after a month on the job. "Of all things, I just thought I would never be satisfied if I didn't come here. Notre Dame has a lot of extra meaning for me because I am an Irish Catholic and I've been a fan since I was a child." 
Corrigan had lived along the eastern seaboard all his life, never having any direct ties to Notre Dame. Yet he'd wanted to be at Notre Dame since he was an altar boy growing up in Balti­more, Md. He remembers listening to Fighting Irish football with his mother who was, he remembers, "a big fan." 
"I can recall the backfield of (Steve) 
Sitko, (Bob) Saggau, (Lou) Zontini and 
(Milt) Piepul," he recalls with a smile. 
"See, I remember that as a kid. Why 
would I remember that?" 
When the time came to leave home 
and go to college, Corrigan headed for 
Durham, N.C., where he earned a lib­
eral arts degree at Duke University. 
From there it was on to Virginia where 
he served as the University's soccer, 
lacrosse and basketball coach as well as 
sports information director. 
"Now, I didn't do all that at once," 

he laughs. "But I did have a variety of 
positions at Virginia and I think that 
diversity prepared me for the responsi­
bilities of this job." 

· A s.tint as assistant commissioner of 
the Atlantic Coast Conference pre­
ceded his first athletic directorship at 
Washington and Lee University in 
northern Virginia. 
46 
i-

In 1971 he and wife Lena and their seven children returned to Charlottes­ville, where Corrigan would serve the University as director of athletics until his move to Notre Dame. During that time he took a struggling athletic de­partment and made it one of the finest in the nation. 
When Corrigan arrived, Virginia was in much the same position as Notre Dame in that the University was just beginning to admit women to its stu­dent body. Nine years later, the Cava­lier athletic department supported 10 varsity programs for the ladies. 
"When I arrived at Virginia we were really in debt," Corrigan remembers. "But w_e sat down, took a look at things -a long look, a long, honest look­and we decided Virginia hadn't really been very good in athletics. We really had no athletic tradition to fall back on so that became our first priority." 
That is one problem he will not have 
to confront at Notre Dame. 
"The tradition here is unmatched 
anywhere," Corrigan begins. "Hey, 
other schools are envious of Notre 
Dame because it is a school that not 
only preaches athletic and academic ex­
cellence but accomplishes it. I know 
when I was at Virginia I used to sit and 
wonder how the heck Notre Dame does 
it." 
He still doesn't have all the answers, 
but he's starting to figure it out. 
"There just isn't another national in­
stitution in the country," he points out. 
"They receive support from all corners 
of the United States-no, make that ·the world. And they are successful. "And they don't compromise." Corrigan then is faced with the task 
of assuming a position of great responsi­bility at a time when there are som·e turbulent undercurrents running through the sea of college athletics. 
"Certainly a great priority of mine will be to get to know all the coaches here and decide, first of all, what role their sport plays at Notre Dame and what needs must be met to improve that sport," he begins. "Now that doesn't mean a full complement of scholarships for every sport, but there are areas that need development and that is where I want to concentrate." 
One alternative to the rising-costs 

· ·problem that affects an athletic budget in the same way it depletes every per­son's pocketbook is to endow sports the way faculty positions are endowed. "We will meet on this, pursue the alternatives and see if it's feasible," says Corrigan. "Certainly that cannot happen overnight. But I can see it as a real possibility in the future. "I am not the Notre Dame athletic department," he warns. "I only serve the University. I will do that in the best way I can, but I will not make prom­ises that the University can't keep." All of that and more was on his mind that day when he accepted Notre Dame's offer to direct the most suc­cessful athletic program in the nation. But there was still that one matter on which Corrigan needed some advice. "I wasn't a Notre Dame man and I was afraid that would bother a lot of people," he admits. "So I called Bob Williams (Notre Dame's All-America quarterback in 1948 and '49), a lifelong friend of mine and a graduate of Notre Dame." That conversation went some­thing like this: "Bob, I'm going to tell you something and all I want is your reaction." "Okay, Gene, go ahead." "I just took the athletic director's job at Notre Dame ..." (pause) "Bob, you still there?" "You're kidding me!" "Ah ... that's not exactly the reac­tion I was looking for." Corrigan went on to explain his fears to Williams who responded in this way: "Gene, at Notre. Dame they judge you by the kind of man you are and the kind of job you do." Which means Gene Corrigan had nothing to worry about after all. 
'81 Preview 
Faust's First Fling 
By JOHN HEISLER 

Gerry Faust has never seen Phil Carter run with the football in a Notre Dame uniform. 
He has not yet had a chance to watch Blair Kiel throw to Tony Hunter on a streak. 
And not since their days together at Moeller High School has Faust seen Bob Crable stop an opposing fullback cold. 
In fact, until the Fighting Irish open spring practice on March 28, Faust will form impressions of his ·players strictly from what he hears from his assistants and what he sees on film. 
But that matters little to the average Notre Dame football fan. Because, with 16 starters returning (eight each on· of­fense and defense) among 39 letter­winners back, the Irish faithful will ex­pect Notre Dame to field a very good football team in 1981. · 
AU-America center John Scully, sure­handed flanker Pete Holohan and Aca­demic All-America guard Bob Burger are the offensive regulars missing-with All-America end Scott Zettek, three­year end starter John Hankerd and tri­captain Tom Gibbons gone defensively. Others slated to graduate in May are Tim Huffman, Jim Stone, Mike Courey, Nick Vehr, Marty Detmer, Bill Siewe, Tom DeSiato and Don Kidd. 
But there are plenty of familiar 

names  returning  to  shore  up·  those  
losses this spring.  
freshman  regular  Blair  Kiel  and  

classmate Scott Grooms are back at quarterback-as are vete.rans .Tom Koegel and Greg Knafelc, each of whom received additional seasons· of eligibility because of '80 injuries. 
The running back slots boast both talent and depth, led by halfback Phil Carter and fullbacks John Sweeney and Pete Buchanan, all juniors next fall. De­pendable senior Ty Barber also returns. 
Split end Tony Hunter and tight end Dean Masztak will form a tough-to­match pass-catching duo-with senior Mike Boushka most likely to inherit the flanker job. 
Top hands on the offensive front in­clude stellar tackles Phil Pozderac, . Mike Shiner and Pete Grogan, guards Randy Ellis, Tom Thayer, Rob Gagnon and Todd Bruni-and center Larry Kissner. 
•·-·-·· •--. --~.--~~.. ------..--,.·-r-,......,.-----~--;---.-..-·,.""'":""'~-.. -.·--:--~-,..-------·... -.v•--· .-···..--~--·· 

And don't forget standout place­kicker Harry Oliver and kickoff man Mike Johnston. 
On defense, the Irish start with an incumbent linebacking trio of All­American Bob Crable and junior Mark Zavagnin and Joe Rudzinski. 
Proven returnees abound in the sec­ondary, with John Krimm, Stacey Toran and Chris Brown listed at corner­back and Dave Duerson, Steve Cichy and Rod Bone at safety~ 

The front four will come from among Jeff Lueken, Pat Kramer, Joe Gramke, Tim Marshall, Kevin Griffith and Tony Belden-many of whom can play both end and tackle. 
Helping· Faust mold the '81 edition of the Fighting Irish will be five hold­overs from last year's coaching staff plus a quartet of newcomers. 
Brian Boulac (assistant head coach, recruiting coordinator, defensive line), Jim Johnson (defensive coordinator, secondary), George Kelly (linebackers), Bill Meyers (defensive line) and Joe Yonto (administrative assistant to Faust) all should rank as well-known names to 
Irish fans.  
All  the  newcomers  will  aid  Faust  
with the offense.  
Tom  Lichtenberg,  head  coach  at  

Morehead State the last two years and a former prep coaching rival of Faust, will serve as offensive coordinator and 
quarterback and receiver coach. 
Greg Blache, a former player and junior varsity coach for the Irish, re­turns to handle the running backs fol­lowing a five-year stint at Tulane. 
Tom Backhus, offensive coordinator and line coach at Air Force the last two seasons, will coach the Notre Dame offensive line. A Moeller graduate where he played for Faust, he also worked as an assistant at Tampa, Iowa State and Wisconsin. 
Also helping with the offensive line will be Jim Higgins, Faust's offensive line coach at Moeller the last seven seasons. 
Together they'll face a schedule that again ranks with the toughest in the country. Michigan, Purdue, Florida State, Navy, Penn State and Miami­all 1981 opponents-all participated in bowl games this past. season, as would have Southern Cal had the Trojans been eligible. · 
It'll be a baptism of fire for Faust, to be sure. He met with unparalleled suc­cess in his 18 years at Moeller. Now the collegiate opportunity he has been wait­ing for all those years has come his way. 
Faust has dreamed about the Notre Dame football tradition ever since his childhood. 
Irish fans only hope he won't wait long to become a part of it.
