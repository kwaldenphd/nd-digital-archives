"Hunk" Anderson, Gipp, and ..Slackford sho,ved great skill in man­ouvering in. the n1ud. The final count was 16 to 3. 
ARMY 

On the:following. Saturday the Gold and Blue met her ancient enemy on the Cadet's field at West Point. Bergma~ did not accompany the team. He injured his knee in the Indiana game. In the first half of the· game things looked 
pretty bad for otir ·squad: However, t~e old · fighting spirit carried tliem through, and once more the flag of Notre Dame was raised in vic­
tory over the officers by a· score of 12 to 9. 
MICHIGAN AGGIES 
On the 15th of November Cartier Field was honored .by the ·presence of the Michigan . Ag­gies. They were accompanied by two hundred rooters and a fifty-piece band. .They entered the camp of the "Rocl{men" with a strong de­termination to cari·y home the bacon. The Ag­gies had a far heavier team but the fast work of Bahan, Slackford, Gipp and Kirk was too much for the farmers. The contest was brought to a close 13 to 0 by a 'sensational pass, Gipp to Kirk. 
PURDUE 
The eighth consecutive victory was registered at ·Lafayette, whe~e the N. D. squad had travelled to meet Purdue. The team was slight­ly over-confident at the beginning of the· game, having defeated the Army so gallantly, and the "Boilermakers" scored a touchdown in the first quarter. The "Irish" soon_ found themselves, however; and Bergman· and Kirk fixed things up in the second period. In the last half, sue-.. cessive passes in which Gipp, "Hunk" Ander-· son,' Trafton and Kirk figured, resulted in. a final count of 33 to 13..

s.hip, ·led Notre Dame to victory over the $.trongest teams iii the East, West and South­west, so that same combination has developed this· year a team which has impressed itself e_ven .upon the ·advers·e critics as one of the strongest· in colle.giate competition. The phe­nomenal success of the undefeated eleven of 1919 is for the most part to be attributed to the \vork of Coach Rockne and Assistant Coach Dorais. 
With· Rockne· concentrating· his efforts ·Upon the development of· the line and with Dorais as the .silent' general of the backfield, the singular achievement of the team was inevi­table. The Coaches received throughout the season the fullest confidence and heartiest co­operation of the candidates. They noted care­fully the particular ability of each playei· and made their choice. for positions accordingly. No department of the game was neglected, no weak spot escaped attention, no play lacked perfection. 
Rockne has just ·completed his .second year as mentor of the Notre Dame eleven. His long football experience and his three years of work .as assistant with Coach Jesse Harper left noth­ing lacking in the way of qualification~ He faced a difficult schedule 'yith a determination to de­velop a winning team. The nine unbroken vic­tories of the season show how he succeeded.

He injected into the men that indefinable N. D. spirit. which resulted· in every contest in a mad fight for victory. And not only on~ the· gridiron did Rockne develop that efficient spirt, but also in the student body. He quickly succeeded in restoring that traditional, unanimous ent~usi­asm ,\rhich was so sadly lacking at the be­ginning of the year. 
"Gus" Dorais, who piloted the. Notre .Dame elevens in 1910, '11, '12, and '13 gave this year as assistant to Rockne, just the co~opera­tion needed to achieve such amazing success. The backfield was gradually perfected by him until to­wards t;p.e end of the year its efficient teamwork was the outstanding feature in . every victory. The indom­itable will, tireless efforts, and brainy direction of the coaches developed a ~achine which conquered teams on which every in­dividual player receiv.ed the attention of t";o per­sonal coaches. The cher­ished memories of their work will remain indelibly fixed in the minds and hearts of the members of· the squad and of the stu­dent body.-P. R. Conag-· han. Asst. Coach Dorais

PRESS COMMENTS ON NOTRE DAME FOOTBALL 
Followers of the gridiron sport in the Ne­braska camp need offer no apologies for the Cornhuskers, who bowed in .defeat to one of the. cleverest forward-passing teanis in college football; eastor west.-(From the Lincoln State 'Journal, for Sunday, Oct. 19th.): '.' 
The~ squad that Coach Rockne, former All­American end, is bringing East with him Is every bit as husll:Y as their Army rivals.. Berg­man, at right halfback, is the star of the aggre­gation. Against Nebraska a couple of weeks ago he ·received the ball on a: double pass on his own ten-yard line and ran· through the en­tire Nebraska team for a touchdown. In all of Notre Dame's other contests Bergman· has been the big factor in their scoring. Bahan at quarter is a good field general.and a capable· thrower of the forward pass. It is at' this sort of game that the 'Vesterners excel. A majority. of their points to date have been tallied via the· overhead route. 
The rush line which Notre Dame will pre­sent is not as heavy as the one that Coach Daly will muster. Coughlin at left tackle is the only forward who tips the beam at more than two hundred pounds. :\Iadigan and Smith, center and right guards, weigh less than 160 pounds each. H. Anderson, at the other guard, and Degree,. at right tackle are the next heaviest. The former weighs 174 pounds while Deg'ree is credited with a \veight of 182. Kirk and E. Anderson, at the ends, weigh 163' pounds each. However,. they are a fast, ha1;d-playing pair. .Both are good r~ceivers of. the forward pass. Notre Dame has compiled a record of 157 points to their opponents' 19. Victories over Kalamazoo, 1\U. Union, 'Vestern Normal,' Nebraska and Indiana are credited to them. They are a formidable aggregation.-(By Tom Thorp; in the New York Evening Journal, No­vember 7.)

Notre Dame, always a fast, aggressive eleven, beat the Army today, 12 to 9, in one of the most interesting and hardest-fought games ever staged on the Plains. The 'Vesterners fia.shed their usual repertoire of air-line plays; and when other methods of attaclr failed them they made these overhead tosses work to excellent advantage. * *. * *. Bahan and· Gipp, two power­ful backfield men, figured prominently ·in all the visitors' forward pass plays." Both· ·these huskies tossed with unen~ing acc:uracy, and Bahan was on the receiving end niost of the time. Occasionally E. Anderson got clear, and a long toss found him under the ball· with out­stretched arms. * * * * The \Vesterners prob­ably launched fifteen or twenty of these overhead plays and all except four o r five were successful.

were frequently r e­sorted to.-(From the New York Times, Nov. 8.)

It w1::s the first of August in 1940. The scene was in the President's off\ce at ~otre Dame. Th~ clock in the chur~h steeple had just pierced the ba_lmy summer atmosp~ere with ten . joyous rings, and their echoes could be_ heard as they· floated here and there on the beautiful canip_us. The Secretary was busy at his ·desk. Suddenly he was interrupted by a loud lniock. , ~·~ome in!" he shouted. The door o~e:tied . and . Coach Rockne stepped in­siqe. 
"Good morning,_ -Garcia'' ·he said, "Is Father Tom _Burke in?':' 
"Not_ just. now," replied Garcia, who was now Secretary to the new President, Father Thomas Burke, "But I expect him in any min­ute. ·won't you sit . down and ~vait a little while?. Here's the latest copy of the "Juggler" you _m~g~t be i~terested in." 
"All .right, Garcia. Thank you" said Rockne as· he· took~ the copy of the "Juggler" and sat down on one of the· chairs which were •scat­tered here and there about the office. 
In a few minutes the President entered. He 
had been-very busy that morning with one of 
the Alumni; 1\Ir. Ambrose, who had called to 
see him relative to obtaining permission for 
conducting a vocal concert in \Vashington Hall. ·l\fr. Ambrose had recently retired from the Chicago Grand. Opera Company.­"Good morning, Roclr,". said. the President; "'What's the . good \vord ?" · "\Vell Father" answered the famous coach, "'I have some sad ne'\vs for you: this morning." 

"The Dream of a Dreamer" 
"What's the trouble?" asked Father Burke, becoming nervo_us. 
"I am going to ·resign! I have been here· for quit a while. We ·have w_on. the ~'All-American­.championship for the last twenty-two. years·,. 
. and, as you well know, I have 'vorked. pretty hard during that time. I'm-beginning· to lose:_­~1Y ol{ -'pe£>' .and I have decided to ·g:iy~ .up football and spend ·a few yea~~· i~ ti·avelling a.·round the country before settling down at my home· in ·Pasade-na~" 
F.or a·moti1ent 01; two the President rem~ined speechless. Then he recollected himself. "Are you realiy going to leave us, Rock?" lle asked. 
"Yes," answered Rock, "I feel that the old Gold and Blu~ will find some one else who can take my place." 
"\Veil," said Father Burke, "They may find another man, but they never will find another 'Rock.'· Good-bye!" 
"Good-bye'' whispered R<;>clr, and with these words he departed. · 
The following :\Ionday the former football coach boarded the train for Ne\v. York City. He h·ad a long I;ide ~head of him," but he was well . p~·eimred -\vith .. copies-. or' the-.; scholastic and othm~ ,high-c.lass. ·literature.. ·He ·busied liimself ioi·. a 'vhile looking out of the windo'v.

~wenty-one 

About a half an hour later he was awakened by a hand laid upon his shoulder. To· him, the· half. hour of slumber seemed· like three or four hours. He rubbed his :.-eyes arid said "'Where am I?" Then he sat.:·hp in his. seat and· looked in the face of the ·eomfu~tor. One look at that face was enougn. to ~rouse ·Rock froni any sleep. \Vho was tli~ conductoi:.-but 
.one of the old players on tlie. 1bi9 va-rsity t~am! B~han! The Captain of th~ 19_1~ squa~ !:~,_ 
The conductor looked at Rock ·in amazement. "Rock!" he shouted so that it··could ·be· heard all-through the car, "What in Heaven brings you here!" 
"And you, Pete," said. Rockne.. -"I never t~10ught you would be picking up _'f,ii.irs.' \Veil how is everything, anyway?. ·:oo you~ ever-see any of the old bunch?" 
"Sure, I see several of, Jhem . from time. to time. I just had our old friend,· Gipp, on· the last trip. Did you hear the -~e~s of his new position? -He's succeeding 1\Iartie 1\IcCu~ as · 
·D_ean of Engineering." 

"YoU: don't tell me!"' exclaimed Rock, "And ··-do you ever see Trafton or Barry?" 
·. "Oh yes! I see Trafton quite often. He's on· tl1e stage now. He rides with nie about once a week. He's n1aking ~11 the. small. towns. pidn't you hear about Barry?-He's g-oing into partnership with his brother-in-law,-Barney ~ragan, in the grocery b_usiness." 
They proceeded to talk about this one and that one, until the train stopped· at· the next 
i 
: 
I I 
station. "I've got a little surprise for you here" said Pete. In a few minutes lte re-entered and coach Roclme was introduced to :.\Irs. Bahan and three little Bahan~. 
The remainder of the day was spent in pleas­ant chatting about the old 1919 team, what had. become of its players, etc. At 10 o'clock the meeting was adjourned and all went to bed. The train was due to arrive in New York City at 7:30 the following morning. 
At 8:00 a. m. the train arrived at the Grand Cenetral depot. It was just a half hour behind time, so Rockne hl;lrried at once to the Hotel McAlpine. He obtained a room and left his baggage there. It was necessary that he at­tend to a little business at once, so he decided to. take cm;e of this first and then see the sights. He had no sooner reached the street than hE: heard great .shouting and commotion. Crowds were lined up along the sidewalk and a parade was going by. He climbed up on one of the windows of the hotel where he could get a gpod view. They appeared to be members of the police department in procession. He in-· quired of a little news-boy the object of the celebration. "\Vhy they're celebrating the ap-· poh:itment of Chief Kirk, the new head of the Police Department." Rockne became more in~ terested than ever. He watched closely, and sure· enough there was old "Bernie" right in the center of attraction! Rock followed the parade until finally it dispersed in all directions. At last he succeeded in locating Chief Kirk, who ·was surprised, amazed and delighted to see· his former coach. The Chief invited him over' to his office to have a good talk over old 
times. They chatted for almost two hours. It "1as close to dinner time so the Chief asked Rockne to dinner. It seemed that they had so much to talk about that they would never get through. After the meal Bernie said-"Lets go over to Dutch's Ice Cream Parlor ror our dessert." 
"That name sounds familiar" said R::>clme. "You don't mean to telf me that Dutch Berg­man runs an ice cream ·parlor 11m·e???" 
"Sure thing!" replied the Chief. A~ter a brisk walk of about _five minutes they arrived at the famous "Dutch's". It was the most noted of all ice cream parlors in the city of New Ym;k.·-It was the oniy place where they put cherries in. the cherry sundaes. 
Arthur almost fainted when he beheld the countenance of Rockne. At last he came to. and he almost ruined Rock's hand with a hearty shake. He treated them each to a Sorin Hall Sundae which was indeed very delicious. Of course, Rock had a long talk ·with Dutch about things that had happened at the old Alma l\Iater. Meanwhile the Chief of Police was called a,vay on business, but he said he would return later; Rock.ne spent the entire after­noon in. tlie··i~e· cream pat:lo~·; which' wa~ in­~eed-a ~~ry .beautiful ·place.· The walls ,\r~re decorated with N. D. pennants and flags of all descriptions. 
At 5:30 Dutch and Rock started for the former's home. Arthur had called up Bernie, who was to meet them there. 
They had almost given up hope of having the Chief arrive in time for supper, when a knock 
Twenty-two 

was heard at the door and he entered. After supper. they continued.to talk of the old days. "How is everything around South Bend and l\Iishawaka?" queried Dutch. "I suppose the old places have changed considerably." 
"I should say they have" said Rock, "f sup­pose you heard that "Honk" Anderson is now l\Iayor of Mishawaka! ·walter Miller is run­ning the Cafeteria at the 'Y.' Grover Malone is night watchman on the campus. Madigan is now prosecuting attorney of South Bend. Coughlin is manager of l\fax Adler's store. These are only a· few of the many changes tliat 
.have taken place out there!" 
* ::= * * 
The hours passed by. It was almost eleven­thirty. Rockne was tired after his long journey and 'vas anxious to get to bed, so the little party broke up. That night Rockne stayed at the home or' ·Arthur. The· following morning Mrs. Bergman served a delicious breakfast. She was a first-class coolr, having take~ a special course in domestic science at St. l\Iary's where she formerly attended school. 
The first one to break the silence of the meal was Dutch. "Well, Rock" he said, "I suppose you would like to know the whereabouts of the rest of the members of the old 1919 team?" 
"I should say that I would" exclaimed Rock. 
"\Vell" said. Arthur, "I have a little more news that I must break to you gently. Do you remember Johnnie Mohardt who used to play in the renowned backfield?" · 
"I never will forget him" answered Rock. "\Vhat's he doing for a living now?." 
"vVell" commenced Dutch, "Johnnie is. en­gaged in a very strange line of work. He is a mind-reader and a phrenologist. This morn­ing I am going to take you up to his office and have him ..tell you just what happened to the rest of the old hunch." 
* * * * 

An hour later found Rockne and Dutch in the office of "Mohardt the Great." Of course, he was just as glad to see Rock as any of the others, although he was not quite as surprised, or at least he did not appear to be. He claimed that he knew that Rock was coming to visit him, ·owing to his superior· mind-reading and farseeing powers: Then the great phrenologist bade Rockne he seated and he proceeded, after a moment's pause to unfold the history of the 1919 eleven. 
."Far away beneath the \Vestern skies, I can see our old friend, 'Dud' Pearson. In the year 1925 he accepted a position with the Sunshine Motion Picture as leading man in one of their productions. He worked diligently for the firm and is now manager and own.er of the com­pany. A little to the East I can see another familiar character, l\lorrie Smith. He went \Vest in 1929 for his health and is now managing a ranch in :i\Iontana. In the middle western states we come across another of our old friends, 'Cy' Degree is night editor of the Chicago Herald & Examiner. Eddie Ander­son is President of the First National Bank of Cleveland. Jim Dooley is Fire-Chief of Cin­cinnati, Ohio. Shaw and Sanders are in the movie business in Philadelphia. They are the only rivals of the :N'ati·e Dame· Theater. The 
U. N. D. Quartet consisting of Kasper, \Valsh, Phelan and ~Wynn is now on the Kiet11 circuit and. promises to do big things in the coming years. Connors is now head coach at Illinois. Last, but not leas~. I see that the dearest of our old friends, Dave Hayes, is now Rector of Sarin Hall."

The famous old coach raised his eyes, as from a great dream. He had listened in­tentively. 
"Yes indeed! \Vhat a wonderful squad we had back in '19." -G. E. B. 

WE MEET THESE OCCASIONALLY! 
HE THOUGHT-He was an able-bodied man, . With mental power sup.reme. \Vithout a doubt, the coach would come And grab him for the team. 
He did not lack one. quality, \Vith "ginger" he was blessed. He was a natural football man, A star-one of the best! 
His skill in circling round the ends, A system all his own, Had won him wondrous glory,
I 
I For all over he was known. 

BUT-Day after day he waited for The coach to call his name. He felt the. joyous moment nearing And at last it came. 
The football coach· accosted him, And whispered ·sweet and low:-· ":i\Iy boy, I have sad news for you. You'll never do, I know! 
, "Your passes are discouraging, Your tackles poor and f(nv. Again; I must reiterate­! lmow you'll never do! 
"Keep up the fight-don't weaken For the future yet may gleam. And if you work real hard, p-e-r-h-a-p-s, You'll make the Freshli1an team."
