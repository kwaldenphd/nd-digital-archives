! What is that echo so poised in its flight? 
\Vkat is the story they whisper tonight? It is a name that ,goes searching the skies Parade of swift victories-glory the prize. 
They drove through the east in their fierce vaunting fame They rode through tlte south and with victory came The west met their power and fa'iled in their pride When courage and faith in their ultimate ride. Swift is their victory sure i:; their gain · Strength fails before them and courage is vain · .1\s year follows year they drive ruthlessly on .1\nd those we have now go wli{!re others have gone. ··But even they come and as surely .they go 
.1\s swift as the wind and as sure as the snow. They come for their moment; they pass to .their fate. But stop-there are others that enter the gate. 
So sing to the courage that rides down the years Such courage and fighting that 'only endears. Not for vain glory or swift fleeting fame But riding to vi~tory with "Cheer, Notre Damt.''

That athletics and studies do not mix well and that athletics of themselves are of no particular value to the. student body, seems to be .the idea that is fou'!d in tha? minds of many who are unacquainted with the facts. Having been connected in athletic work which has f:!...ought me into close contact not only with conditions at Notre Dame but also with those existing at many other large schools throughout the United States for the past . thirteen years I am absolutely convinced that anyone· hold­ing to such an idea is either ignoranrol facts or narrowly prejudiced. 
The pages that follow chronicle the activities of a season that has been one of the hardest that any of our teams has had to face. The men came through splen­didly. Their ·spirit all through that hard campaign deserves commendation. Their unselfish spirit that' in­sured the harmony and cooperation that stamped the team of 1926 is a lesson that will stand us in good stead. 
To each man on the squad, to those who labored in the practices as well as those who fough.t the games, and to everqone helping in any way, I extend my.'. sincere 
appreciation.

Knute K. Rockne 
Head Coach and Director of Athletics 
Knute K. Rockne.-What doesn't that name mean to the several million football fans throughout the length and breath of this tax-ridden universe of ours? 
"Rock"-what doesn't that mean to all Notre Dame men, wheather they dodge prefects now or. talk about all the old gang at the homcomings? In answering the above we might remark that there are several things that those words do mean and the replies are good no matter whether you fan into the first or second group. 
First, mean~ to either group, the greatest coach in the world. Look back if you will and be startled perhaps (or maybe you've always known it) that the recapitulation bears out just the thing that you have always believed. Since the captain of the '13 varsity took over the grooming of the grid knights of Our Lady the 
·teams· have· been. favored by succes.s known to no other university. Only eight times have his teams taken the windward side of the count, and each time they have risen to greater heighths when Rockne ·got in his good work. 
Perhaps the greatest exibition of his ability as a coach and 
leader was exemplified in the Army gam.e of this year. Last season the team that rode back in silence from New York did so after one of the defeats m which their opponents scored the greatest number of points in Notre Dame annals. ThP same tearh that this year proved to be a g1 oup of mule-skinners de luxe and .battle~ away at even odds (when not actually outplaying) the team of ex-All-Americans re­presenting the military academy. . 
Metamorphosing that team from 'a greaten sophomore eleven which was the weakest that the East had ever seen a Blue and Gold squad into a pack of world-beaters inside a period of hvelve months (only a small portion of which) could be· spent in drilling the charges marks a mile-stone in the annals of great coaches . 
He has been dubbed "the 'Vizard" ''the \Vonder Man" "football's greatest tactician'' and other titles that would take pages to recount but after all the word that describes him best is "greatest." 
That's what "Rock" means to Notre Dame men! 
Hartley Anderson 
Assistant Coach 
If you dig deep in musty records you'll find that Hartley Anderson is his formal sobriquet but around Notre Dame he's known as "Hunk" and ·the word connotes much in the way ·of determined football skill. 
Some four or five yea1~s ago .Anderson was a guard on ·the Rockne team (he must have been plenty hot because the only critic who didn't piek him on his All-American was an Idaho schoolboy.) It was that year that Anderson tore voluminous holes in the Army line and helped the Irish to a great victory over the Cadets, proving that the Notre Dame boys could play as vigorously as the next ones. 
After serving on the varsity for two or three years, "Hunk" adven­tured a bit and when Notre Dame called him to help in the formation of great elevens like those upon whi.ch he had played, he· responded 
For two years "Hunk" has been one of Rock's right hand. men and his unusual ability as a linemen has been reflected in 'the efficient work of Irish guards and tackles. The adamant defense and brilliant offense of the bulwarks of the Irish line should be a matter of great pride to 
the old head, Anderson. . 
Anderson was especially commended for his handling of the· team the . Indiana game. · While Rockne looked over the Cadet array, Anderson managed the Irish attack against the Crimson.

Thomas Mills 
Assistant Coach 
Time was when the Beloit Vikings rushed out of the north once a year to do bitter battle with the clan of Rockne. Never did they invade Cartier Field for an early season game without putting up a game and heady fight. 
I. But· the fall of 1926 saw Tommy behind a diffe.rent gun, a piercing,. screaming cannon that hurled Irish shrapnel. When Tom Lieb resigned his assistant coach post, Mills was picked ·to assist Rockne in whipping the Thunderiug Herd into shape for a hard season. 
· The plump, matter-of-fact .Mills has been a potent factor in the 
I success of this year's team. In his direct, forcible way he has helped to bring the Irish from the bottom up. The fierce charging and deadly tackling of the Notre Dame frontal wall can be largely· attribute to Mills' 'york. He has

The Notre Dam.e center, because of -the style of. play used, must be an accurate passer at all times. Boeringer was a wond­er at snapping the ball back and in addi­tion his experience and his keen anylitical mind told him just when to play back to break up end-runs and forward passes and when to play his position. His work was almost flawless. Hardly a game can be named in which he was not commended for his wonderful playing by the scribes.

It's claimed that your own backyard is a diamond mine· and has found reason for this assertion. One of his ends, Ike Voe­disch, lives in South Bend and the other, Johnny Wallace, tra­ces his footsteps to

Christy's a wicked boy when it comes to dodging, pivoting, or twisting around an aspiring tackler and continuing on his way. Speed, change of pace, arid fight,-he has combined so hap­pily. They are hard football qualities to beat.

Against the crafty Army and South­ern California forwards, Johnny forced his sterling ability.

through for many long gains. Charlie in addition to being a first class field general showed his sprinting form every time he tucked the ball under his arm.

John "Jack'?. Chevigney 
Hammo~d, Indiana 
Playing third string half back position would n o't be a great honor at some schools, but here at Notre Dame where Capt. Reardon and "Bucky" Dahman recklessly ride the gridiron even a man of "Chev's" ability is forced to consider third choice charm. "Chev;' displayed his ability in the Penn State game better than any ·o~her time this season. He was an ace in the hole whom Rockne felt safe to 
Charles · (Chilly) Walsh

If some literary con­


nossieur ever made the assertion that gen­ius crops out on more that one branch·of the family tree, he must have been speaking of the vValsh family of girdders. 
You can't forget Adam Walsh, skipper of the Four Horsemen 
and Seven Mules, and if his younger brother continues to play the left .wing in such admirable fashion he'll live long in Notre Dame grid annals. 
A Saturday figure on the defense, an adept at the blocking and passcatching angles of offense, Chilly has proved his grid worth for two years.

George Leppig 
Cleveland, Ohio 
Proud natives of the 
Buckeye state often swell up because the old sod has produc~d more than its share of presidents but Notre Dame can give Ohio credit for at least one good guard and he's none other than Geo. Leppig. 
Leppig's destiny has 

alway~ led to football for he's big strong and powerful with a passion for the thud of runner and tackler. His ability to a~alyse and smother line 
thrusts has made him one of the most valu­able guards of recent years. 
Ray Marrelli 
Rockford, Illinois 
Oftentimes the second line trenches contribute as much tu victory as do those up in the thick of the firing. That's the case with Ray Mar~·elli, a second string guard, whose play this year has been of the sensational variety. 

.Marrelli played a consistent 
game every time that he was 
injected into a contest. 
Marrelli has see·n hH> years 
of varsity service and will take 
his degree in June. His loss . will he ·a decided disadvantage

"Illie" ·Byrne 
Oakland, California. 
We usually hear of Notre Dame men coming out of the West to bare their wares before gridiron fans, and Illie Byrne was no exception to that rule.. California sent Byrne to Notre Dame with a fine preparatory record and he has fullfilled every point of it. Possessing eyes that could find a hole in the best of lines and the speed of a seasoned track man, he added much to te success of the Irish team of twenty six. When Illie car­ried the ball he hit· the line hard and sure and usually he was .downed somewhere on the other side of the line of scrimmage. With the experience which Byrne has gained on this year's varsity he should be ·one of the main cogs in next season's team. 
Jack McGrath 
Cleveland, Ohio. 
The full back position this season was one of the things that shifted with every hike. Injuries came early in the season and new blood was tested. Jack answered the call and proved his strength by bending the opposing line where he saw fit. The old punch he carried during the boxing season last winter manifested itself in his every movement on the gridiron. For a sopho­more with little experience. in varsity competition l\IcGrath came through with a distinctive class that promises to carry him far along the road of football perfection during his next two years nt Notre Dame. 
Bennie lVIcAdams 
Lowell,. Massachusetts 
Massachusettes has sent some great football players to Notre Dame .and among them Bennie l\lcAda~s ranks high. He played the position of tackle on the .Rockne machine througho~t his college career and steadily progressived towards perfection as experience moulded his style of play. One of the things which have made Notre Dame teams consistant winners are men "such as l\lcAdams who was always ready to go in and play a heavy and hard fought game of football. Bennie came to the front in a spectacular fashion during th~ past season and his value to the team was knownbyeveryone who saw this years·, eleven in action. 
·Joe Benda 
Duluth, Minnesota 
Had it not been for an injury in his sophomore year Joe would have undoubtedly been one of the greatest ends of all Notre Dame football history Regardless of this, however, Joe has been one of the outstanding assets to the Rockne team during the past three seasons. Playing the wing position with a m_arked perfection, Benda caused many opposing halfbacks to be thrown for losses back of the line of scrimmage and many ·dreamed~£ end runs to be smashed in the makin~. · · 
Frank Keefe 
Chicago, Illinois 
. Beside being exceptional end himself, Rockne has produced no end of great ends. Frank came down from Chicago a couple of years ago with one of the greatest reputations of any midwestern prep school man. He played excellent ball the year the Four Horsemen visited the more im­portant gridirons of the country. This year among a field of ends equal to the best years of Notre Dame football Frank played a consistant game of the highest caliber. l\Iaking an end position on a Rockne team is almost as hard as the opponents find it to circle the ends but Frank Keefe made just that position..______ 
Jim Hurlburt 
New York City 
Jim played one of the most enviable end posi­tions on the team this season as every fan who watched Notre Dame play will vouch for. Tearing in time and againto break up the plays that were 
.. to go around his flank became a hobby with Jim and by the end of 'the season he had reached an aimost transcendant stage in this field of play. His clever interference allowed the Notre Dame b-.cks to carry the ball for long gains around his side of the line and was responsible for· many of the gains cut-off by our men this season. Opposing wing .men found Hurlburt to be a tough man to take out and conversely to be always wide awake and ready to do jus·t that thing to them. 
Jerry Ramsavage 
Portland, Oregon 
·Jerry came a long way to play on a Notre Dame football team and he was certainly not disap­pointed. In his second year· at Notre Dame Jerry has· made the varsity squad and has written 111~ name indelibly in Rockne's mental notebook his ability for tackling anything. On the defensive Jerry was of exceptional worth, being one of the hardest men on the squad to move out of the way. Offensively Ramsavage opened up wide holes in the opposing line ~nabling the ball carriers to make long consistant gainiO throuJi:h the forward wall of the opponents. 
·John Doarn · 
Omaha? Nebraska 
With so many good tackles on the squad it is no wonder that the opponents "found it next "to impossible to score on the Notre Dame team this Fall. John Doarn was one of the outstanding linesmen of the season. His offensive work opened wide gaps in the line of opposition and enabled the Irish backs to reap long gains· through his side of the line. Defensively he stood out as an unpenatrable wall ·against the opposing linesmen and few backs ever carried .the ball far through his position. John bolstered. up the varsity "squad in a most comendable manner and will be remem­bered as a tackle of true merit.

Notre Dame 77 Beloit 0 
That September pastime of some 10,000 Notre Dame and South Ben~""l natives, who come to Cartier Field for the first gani.e of the year and a glimpse at K. K. Rockne's contributfon to the great sport, was a little bit more bore­some than usual this year. 
The crafty mentor of the Fight.in' Irish fooled all the skeptics in the opening of the 1926 grind for he put the gridiron work aside and ran a Sl~nsa­tional little track meet. Beloit was the victim and the score 77 to 0. All events. were ceded to the Irish without question. 
Scores of aspiring young Irishmen, some of them backs and not a_ few. of them linemen, were pushed into the fray as the occasion demanded, and before they had finished with their afternoon's work eleven touchdowns, a safety and enough kicks after go~l to fill out the score had been registere.d. 
But that doesn't tell how the fans felt about it. Every one of them anxious to put the stamp of approval on the 1926 Irish eleven, each had a chance to be more .optimistic than he had expected. Some twenty backfield men. ran ,\rild, taking the ball for gains of from one to D6 yards. And some 40 linemen smothered the Beloit. offense completely. 
Chris Flanagan gave. promise of h~s future destiny when he took .the' first kickoff of the second half on his own five yard. lirte and had no trouble in sifting through the whole Beloit team for a touchdown. 
A nice game it was7 if you get a kick out of seeing wild and wooly running.

Notre Dame Minnesota 
Having seen .the creditable manner in which Minnesota winded up its football season, it becomes all the more singular that the Irish essayed n I. 
super-task when they confronted the Gophers so early as October 9. 

Nevertheless, these Notre Dame juggernauts will try about anything else, just so it be in the gridiron line, and Minnesota looked the same to them as any other team. A!l jokes about the Minnesota shift are worthless now for the boys from the frozen: north did plenty of shifting and caused the Irish plenty of worry even though the latter won 20 to 7. 
"C~·ashing Herb" Joesting, the miracle man of the IYiinnesota grid~ was trying his best to thwart the Irish that day but he wasn't so successful. He contributed to a Gopher score well toward the end of the first half and had the satisfaction of knowing that the two teams were tied 7 to 7 when the third period began. 
But He~·b, with the whole Minnesota ·lot, felt the sting of the Irish whip during the last half. As advertised, Mr. Rockne threw his kisses across Memorial Stadium but they were in the form of touchdowns. 
Bucky Dahman's scintilla~ing run shortly after the first quarter began was easily the feature of t"he game for Bucky dodged and. stiff-arme.d for 70 yards worth of thrill and a touchdown. 
Boland and. Collins were injured clurin·g the game and as it afterward · developed, ··kept out for the whole season. Otherwise the game would have been spotless.

Notre Dame Runs Wild to Smother Minnesota, 20-7 
By \VARREN BROWN. Chicago Herald and Examiner 
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., Oct. 9.-Doc Spears of Minnesota hung the wrong light in the belfry .at Nr,>rthrop Field today, ·for the Rockne Ramblers· came by land, instead of by air, to a smashing -20 to 7 victory that entertained a· record crowd of 53,000-about as well as any Minnesota home 
gathering will be entertained for the balance of the football year. Notre Dame's line withstood all serious attempts of the· Doctor's ball carriers to rush it illto sub-· mission, and in. th:: second half of a game that was considerably harder fought than was healthy for the 
boys on this bright October afernoon, the . Irish invaders seemed to have just as much zip left as when they started, while the Gophers had wilted perceptibly. 
For one·l;alf of the football game there wasn't a great deal to choose between the . two teams, each putting across a touchdown. 
Notre Dame got its first one very soon after the game began, . Ray Dahman sneaking through an opening between the Goph­ers' right tackle and end and wiggling his way into the clear, thereafter sprinting the rest of an excursion of 62 'yards for a touchdown. N i e m i c very promptly kicked the goal. 
IRISH IGNORE PASS 
Minnesota· was not long in getting t~ score squared, and they utilized the . forward pass, a weapon which Notre Dame has found very convinc­ing in days. gone by to quiet all sorts of opposition. Today, -however, the Irish were so busy slashing through the Minnesota line for numerous yards they didn't bother much with the pass, trying but three 
in the entire matinee. 
The one that ~vened up the· count was flung by Geer, and it landed in the clutches of Capt'. Wheeler, who proceeded to outrun a few of the 
Irish for the only time· they were outrun in the entire afternoon. Wheeler's canter of 20 yards was turned into . a touchdown. and Peplaw kicked the goal, tying the score. This was· the way affairs stood at thl! end of the first half. \Vhen the battle was resumed Notre Dame took the offensive and very throughly out­rushed the Gophers. Christy Flanagan eventually sliping through tackle and end and weaving his way past all pursuers, for another one of those 62-yard. excursions thic \vere so popular with the Rockne

ramblers today. Christy tried to boot the goal, but missed it. 
Notre Dame, still scorning the air line, was rushing toward its third touchdown when the period ended. There was . very little delay in their 
getting it after the fourth opened, "Red"Hearden finally scampering sixteen yards for the score, because sixteen yards were all that were required. Niemic kicked ~his goal, too. · 
In ·the closing minutes Minnesota was flinging the ball around the place with little or no effect. It simply wasn't a day for Gophers. 

a head-on collision 
The latter, by. the way, was the Gophers' most consistent ground gainer today and what ripping the Gophers did to Notre Dame's line was largely charge­able to this' young man. · 
Minnesota was not without its casualties. Barn­
hart was car:ied from the field unconscious a short time before the . game ended and there being no ·more business before the meeting, the boys adjourned. 
soon afterwards. 
\Vhen Notre Dame. is able to run a Minnesota 
team ragged and win by a score of 20 to 7 without 
usi~g more than three forward passes, none of them 
complete, I wonder what is. going to happen to 
some of the enemy when the Irish get throwing the

Notre Dame's progress to­ward another score or two was hampered by fumbling, O'Boyle losing the ball once while he was within the Gophers' 5-yard line. But take it ali' in all, the boys from South Bend dem­onstrated that it will take a ~tronger Conference team than Minnesota to put a dent in the Notre Dame shield this year.

1926:..FOOTBALL•REVIEW 



Notre Dame 28 Penn State 0 
Sometime when you have an afternoon to kill, try roll-blocking the Niles interurban a couple of times and then sum up your seasations. You'll at least know how the Penn State crew f~lt after it had opposed the Fightin' Irish for four quarters. 
Truly enough the Notre Dame el~ven took the easterners "in stride" but it so developed that the same stride was a powerful· g1:ound-eater. Four touchdowns, .and four kicks . after. goal for harmony's . sake, enabled the Thundering Herd to win, 28 to 0. 
To begin with, the Irish struck a felling blow at the Nittany Lions almost before the whistle blew. · Only a few plays had been reeled off when Parisien passed to O'Boyle who had little trouble in running some 20 or 30 yards for the first touchdown. 
After that it was a question of how much the score would be. For art's sake, a touchdown a quarter was decided upon and the Notre Dame machine proceeded to pound out its quarterly seven points, ~he rest of the time being used in mere fooling around. 
Johnny Roach, Bucky Dahman and Butch J;'•Hemic, in addition to Harry O'Boyle, whose adventures have been exploited above, pushed over the markers. A flock o.f other backs pierced the Penn line with mocking regularity but they couldn't make touchdowns because the formula didn't call for it. 
Incidentally, we might mention that Penn State tied the Irish, zero to nothing a year ago, so the 1926 affair swung the scales in the proper direction.

Notre Dame 6 ·Northwestern 0 
If Northwestern University's Purple Wildcats could tangle with Notre Dame's Fightin Irish and not make ·an epochal struggle of it, football fans throughout the middle west would not be so keenly interested over the annual meeting. 
For. the past three or four years, the Purple and the Irish have been battling tooth and toe nail, although the \Vildcats have been destined to the bottom of the heap of all occasions. Desiring not to spoil the rivalry and at the same time to keep it close enough, the Rockmen invaded Evanston late in October and dropped the Northwestern eleven, 6 tq 0, in its ne~v stadium. 
Better games than that might have been played in the middle west during the fall of 1926 but no record exists of those games. Two bdlliant elevens, equally alert in offense and defense, played for three quarters and neither could break the deadlock. · 
Then the Idsh took to the air! Two well-aimed passes from Art Parisien and Niemic had crossed the Purple line for· the one and only score of the contest. It was ·exceptional football and thousands who looked on couldn't dig up a thrill that equalled it. 
Our old friend,· Ralph (Moon) Baker, Northwesterns great captain, was there, battling Notre Dame futiley for the third straight year. Moon didn't win but he had the old fight and stamina that has let him shine for ·these three seasons. ' 
After the game was over everyone banqueted and notables sermonized and a couple thousand rode the South Shore chariot back to South Bend. 'Twas the game of games, as.the poets would have it.

Chicago Tribune. 
But from the kickoff Northwestern's football players fought. and bled, and you wondered why some of them didn't die, as they battled that grid­iron machine from Notre Dame. From their own 34-yard line they pumeled Notre Dame until the ball rested on the Irish team's 40 yard mark. Then they" lost 9 yards, failed at a pass. and punted. Parisien, the youth who throws footballs with his left hand :1s if they were baseballs, fumbled and recovered. His teammate, Niemic, the same to whom Parisien tossed the pass that won the game, punted from behind his goal _line. 
And that break kept Rockne's men on defense for the re­. maindcr of the quarter. 
Baker slid of tackle. tried to skirt the ends; Gustafson pusn­'cd through the line and Lewis bucked it and as the first quarter ended Northwester had the ball on Notre Dame's 14 yard line. It looked like a goal from field for the purple. 
But Northwestern tried a pass on its fourth down as the second quarter began and Hear-­
den intercepted it back of his ~o.ll for a t-:mchback. Notre Dame took the ball, but couldn't break the Purple linr. 
Fighting, fighting, fighting, the two teams bucked and never broke. 
Now it was Northwestern 
that threatened; -now it was Notre Dame. Once ncar the end of the first half the fast stepping, dodg­in~. twisting Flanagan skirted the ends and passed his way down to the Purple -1 7 yard line. And then it looked as if Notre Dame would score.

Notre Dame 26 Indiana 0 
After Western Conference. opponents who aspired to-hang the crape on the Irish had been twice thwarted, Messrs, Boeringer, Edwards et all, sud­. denly came to-the conclusion that three is a charm and so the gay young 
gents from Indiana were elected to.fill out the bill. 
It's said that the V{aggish w·abash didn't flow with all its reckless. abandon on the night of the game and the -red fires that were supposed to have mirrored the·happiness in the Hoosier hearts flared up against the Saturday ~ight sky with a peculiar shade of blue. These Irish did their task in a wholesome manner for they pushed· across four touchdowns with enough kicks to ring the final score up thus: 26 to 0. 
But that isn't the half of it. It happened that Mr. Knute Rockne was 
. preparing to lead one of his sightseeing tours to New York o.n the following Saturday and· being a very able tour master he had to get the ground all set. So he went off to N. Y. a week ahead of time and got the lay of the land. Accordin-gly Mr. Hunk Anderson took charge of the team that week and did his. job quite nobly while "Rock" was looking over the Army· steam roller. 
Despite Mr.. Rockne's absence his lads played a very neat game and completely baffled the Crimson who had it in their mind to steal a· march while the grizzled mentor was on the sojourn. Two touchdowns came in the first half·and another pair found their way on to the scoreboard during the 
·. last two periods.. Passes, of qti_ality and quantity, did not ~elp the C~·ims9n to score although. they were dangerously close at times.

Notre Dame 7 Army 0 
One perfect play sandwiched in the midst of four tense, tantalizing quarters of stubborn football strife; one perfect play that meant victory for an All-American team over a team of All-Americans; one perfect play, started with a simply, rythmic shift and ended 63 yards away, made it one perfect day for the host of Fighting Irish. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Seven to nothing was the score! Which was quite enough to raise us to the seventh heaven. · 
It was .smiling Christy of the clam of Flanagan, the boy with the Gulf­Coast tenor, who carried the ball .those sixty-three yards to glory and rested it behind the goal posts that later were brought back to the region around the twin lakes. There were ten other men who also made that touchdown although their names were not in the scoring column. For Christy's sensational· trip was maneuvered by eleven men working in perfect syncronism-just another tribute to the hours of practice on interfering that Rockne fnsist upon. 
After all it's not so much what you do as how you do it in this big pigskin parade and the event known as "Flanagan's Run" was at once beauti­fully simple and simply beautiful. 
This was the .great triumph of Rockne-a feat that proved once. again that he is the greatest of the great. For this bunch of boys, humans, who made up the squad dedicated to Our Lady were the same bunch that rode back from New York with bowed heads last year rankling under a 27-0 defeat by this same Army team. He had taken the green material, worked in his deft manner and that day's team was the result. 
Flanagan's run was not the whole thing-it was merely THE thing. But· anyone that witnessed that obstinate warfare between the two elevens, both fighting to. retain an unsullied slate, will tell you that the 63 yard excursion was not all. Far from it.

Perhaps it will always be that to Notre Dame men football will be con­nected with the annual J\rmy game; and pe1~haps the true idea of spirit will always be couched in terms that have attached themselves to the legands that have grown old around this classic. Not that we do not have our traditions elsewhere or that the spirit, that ·soul of Notre Dame, that loyalty, isn't as prevalent in· our other conflicts; but rather because the memories of that little band of· Fhrhtin~ Irish led by a Swede. that went dmvn and were the mule-skinners proper back in 1913 gave birth to a tradition that is al: ways living. 
This year the splendid response of the student body in giving the team a send-o~f a:nd again in its acclimation of the wonderful victory will remain in the minds of those who sa'\v it until nothing else can be recalled. 
No wonder the Army succumed. It was battling against the weight of two thousand six hundred hearts of two thousand ~.ix hundred men who were willing to visit the basement chapel and the church as well as burn red:-flares; two thousand six hundred men who pledged their loyalty silently out'round the hvin lakes as well as in the noisy acclimation; two thousand six hundred who were a week later willing to greet a team that had fought hard and lost af; wholeheartedly as when they won from the Cadets. Two thousand six hundred who had the spirit!

Flanagan's 62 Yard Run Wins for N.D., 7 to 0 
By DAVIS J. \VALSH. Chicago Herald and Examiner. 
NE\V YORK. Nov. 13.-Looking down the barrel of a sixgun, drawing a king full to an ace "kicked" or running a rabbit down to its elbows in a dash for the goal posts:--they make them tough and trigger-nervous down in Texas. But when a 
Texan happens to be a scion of tht: Flanagans and his first name is Christie, the contest ceases there, because there seems to be nothing for it but to con­cede that the gent is a man among men.

DEFENSIVE GAME 
It was the only score of a game that was to b'av.! pulled the boys out of their shoe laces, but, some-: how, didn't. Both teams came up to the ·game . unbeaten in their respective sections, and they had the megaphone men firmly convinced that nothing 
could stop either of them. Instead. it proved to be a meeting of two teams whose defenses were too much for their attacks. 
Not once did that Army attack, about which the boys 'in the hick room bad become so maudlin, penetrate the Irish .30-yard line. Not once did ~he 
deception and speed that one has come to assoc1atc with Rockne teams carry through a sustained offcn-. sive to the goal line. It seemed, in fact, that nothing could happen · and nothing would, when s·uddenly 
the Army defense began to count its finger nails and 
the boy friend.· Flanagan, was on his way. 
Harbold was bung by the heels as the interference 
swept on, Spragn~ was boxed like a cigar, ·and 
Harding, playing defensive fullback, was dumped 
without ceremony· il$ he gazed with engrossing in­
terest at the oncoming Flanagan. 
From that point. it became a foot race and any gent by thz name of Flanagan who lives in Texas can't afford to be slow. He wasn't. He simply 
;:J:
devoured the yards and at the end, the thing wasn't even close, Wilson being put out of the race on the 1 O·yard line by a Notre Dame hip that picked up a chance acquaintance with Harry's knee caps.· 
The victory sent Notre Dame back to old South Bend with that may prove to be a season's lien on the intersectional championship, and, if they don't ring the town bell over that one, the fact that the 
2 7 'to 0 debacle of last year, will be sufficient to keep the merry villagers in the streets long after 9:45. 
In addition the day was one to inspire the brush of a painter and that goodly crowd of 70,000, lifted beyond the com­monplace by the. spectacle of 1,000 cadets marching as Dnc man and their barking, lilting songs and ·cheers was· there with the expectation of seeing the game of games. 
Rockne worked his usual hocus pocus at the outset, start­ing the game ·with Riley, Nic­mic, Dahman and· O'Boyle in his backfield,· possibly on the theory that the first shall be last and tl)e last shall be first. They arc supposed to be second stringers and, for all of me, 

they proved it when· they got two distinct breaks in the first period and threw both of them over the left ..shoulder, for lu~k or something. 
For i~stancc, \Vilson fumbled the kickoff ·and 
then· carefully stepped o~t of bounds on the. 10-yard line in recovering the ball. That incident did the Army.practically no good, and neither. did Murrell's trick punt that went out of bounds on the 3 3 -yard line .a :moment later. 

ARMY CHECKS .ADVANCE 
Now. was the. time for. all goo·d men to come to the aid of_ the Hoosier but some of. them happened to be on tt?e sidelines and so tb: Army took the ball on downs. It .·then showed a disposition to prove that 
its attack did_n't consist altogether of circumstantial evidence, Murrell tearing the Irish ·line. for re-. pea ted ··ganis .. 
But lie finally thought better of it, and punted to the' 25.:y:ud line. from which poi~t the only )_ . sustained ·march of the game. carried Notre Dame deep i~to Army territory on off-tackle dashe£ by Nicmic and O'Boyle. But it was not to be.

Notre Dan1e 21 Drake 0 
Someone presented Rock and his crew with a huge underslung bulldog in rememberance of the way that his boys. took the Army down the line. It was a fine pup; the sort that has the fire of fight in his eyes and the grip of victory in his teeth. It was a f:t:iendly canine, however, and the Fightin' Irish did not have a great amount of trouble bringing it home from the Polo Grounds. 
But such 'Vas not the story a week later when another bull dog in the form of Drake pounced in a playful manner on Cartier Field. A broad expanse of white blanketed turf sometimes referred to as Cartier Field, and 15,000 shiver­ing fans greeted the pup as it marched upon the field to show the Irish that it would not be quite as easy to handle as their new mascot. The game might have been played on skis or snowshoes; at any rate it was about all the Rock­men could do to slide across Drakes goal for three markers. 
The Alumni who had sold the farm to come back for h~mecoming began wondering if o'ld man winter had covered up. the chalked lines so that the Notre Dame rooters would not be conscious of the yardage gained by the Bull­dogs in the second quarter; with lightning like speed the boys from Iowa marched the pill to the Notre Dame five yard line where they made first dmvn. Even the Blue and Gold first stringers could not stop the Drake advance to the three inch line. It was here that Mr. Dope steped in and spoiled Drakes chances for a score. 
Then the tide turned. Using then hands craftily, blocking in a finished manner and sending the ball through the air the Irish carried the ball to the skin across the last white line. This started things rolling and ·wallace and O'Boyle each chalked up another tally. · 
It was a great game. Old man "Tinter was not so over anxious for it to be but the fifteen thousand Irish fans declared that all their shivering was worth while and was amply repaid by seeing the boys from the twin lakes muzzle the Drake Bulldog 21-0. ·

Notre Dame 0 Carnegie·_Tech 19 
Iowa, Nebraska and now· Carnegie! Each year it seems to be the fate of the vVonder Teams to run into soine opponent who spills the dope and makes what would have otherwise have been a most remarkable season into a merely great one. It would take more than a defeat such as this to obscure the record .that the Fighting Irish had established before their trip to Pittsburgh where the canny Scotsmen made crushed rock of the Rockmen; and it would take far more than his to dim the glory of that great game that they rose to on the succeeding Saturday. · Notre Dame had a good season and the loss to Carnegie, although it was a pill. without. the sweatene·d coating that proved rather hard to take, was nevertheless administered by a Tech team working feaverishly at the top of their game. As W. F. Fox, Jr., would say: "It happens in the best regulated pigskin families." . Coach Steffin had pointed his worthies for Notre Dame; had primed them for Notre Dame; and he did his work well. . The team that took the field against our Thund~ring Herd was really remarkable. Notre Dame has no alibies; no protests; nothing in fact except praise for the sturdy opponents who topped them. And indeed it should be so. The real test of a man's worth is to observe him when he's beaten; when he's down. It's easy to speak of sportsmanship when you're on top of the heap but rather a different task to put that into practice when the odds are the other way and you're far to the windward of glory. The Carnegie game had its place on the calander of events this year. It proved that the team was not a collection of super-men but was made up of boys, of men, and that the h-uman element could not be overlooked. But most of all it tested the mettle of every _Notre Dame man whoever or wher~ ever he might be and, as has always been the case, the men of Our Lady brought credit to themselves and their Alma Mater under the stress. It proved that Notre Dame is great in defeat, greater indeed than in victory! Here was a true measure. The men adequately proved their worth in the Southern California game. · All due praise to our victors! A g-reat team. -And praise for those who were corageous in defeat.

Rockne's flaming Notre Dame comet has crashed to the ground, a char:-ed and lifeless ember. 
The luminous star from South Bend swooped low over Pittsburgh yesterday, collided head-on with the football juggernaut of Carnegie Tech and broke and fell as its glitter and sparkle flickered and died away. 
A wild crowd of 45,000 crowded Forbes Field for this astonishing spectacle. And it saw an amaz­ing battle of gridi::on giants of which the hopes of the Irish were shattered into a thousand fragments and the fame of Carnegie's mighty eleven went speed­ing to every corner of the land to the ticking of a hundred telegraph instru­

and sweeping everything from. its path. 
The Irish were not feared. In a steady onslaught after a scoreless fi ·st period the Tartans scored two. touchdowns in the second quarter, two field goals in the third and came within an ace of running over for two inore touchdowns.

And at .the end the Tartans were smothhin1 the Nom; Dame varsity-the same cle\·en that b:?at the Army-under a brui!ling, battering onslaught that had the famous South Bend team reeling back dazed and demoralized. · 
All the scoring was made against the Irish varsity. The shock troops played the first· quarter and shortly after the start of the second period, Notre Dame rushed in an entirely new team-the first string boys. They came on the field with a snap and a dash. rubbing thei:-hands and patting each others' backs. Then in a few minutes they were hurt and scowling. fighting "like tigers in the shadows of their own goal posts. · 
For scarcely had the Notre Dame varsity taken the field when tth Tartans unleashed a wild, cyclonic attack that drove the South Benders back-wounding and struggling in hopeless desperation with their backs to the wall. · 
Victory. the one which would crown Carnegie as the conque-:o'r of a champion, was within Steffen's grasp only because his team, one of the most inspired outfits that ever wore cleats, would not be beaten.

And as the snow swirled about the field. as the athletes became hardly recognizable ex­cept for the great numbers whicH glared from their backs into the enshrouding twilight, Carnegie, with nineteen points. smashed the shrine upon which Notre Dame was about to ascend to receive the adulations of millions of he·o worshippers.

Notre Dame· 13 California 12 
It was little Art Parisien, the minute man of '26, who was the star of stars again after pulling the dark clouds of defeat over that much exploited Southern California sunshine on December fourth.· It was the first time in history that the trick had been pu1led by an Eastern or Mid-Western team and then it came as the climax of the most thrilling game of football that we can find recorded in the books this year. 
Like a page from Frank Meriwell, it came as the shadows from the high stadium walls of Troy were slipping down, phantom like, over the white-sliced playing field. Thei·e was a substitution and wheather or not you believe that Rockne is a magican the fact is he spoke just three words and lo, the Scarlet became mighty blue! · 
The words? \Vhy "Parisien for Riley" and in trotted Parry, the left handed, who specializes in winning games in the fading minutes of play. 
. . 
. He was in just three plays but when he trotted back to the bench the thunder that was sent heavenwards for him was the acclimation accorded-a hero. Just three plays,-but enough to made the score-board tenders exercise their accounting; enough to make us all wild with joy; enough to end a great season for a great team fighting for a great coach and a greater school. 
The teams were as evenly matched as ~my teams could be. Notre Dame outscored the Trojan in the matter of .yards piled up from scrimmage but in that matter of first downs they were each resting with ten when the time was called. Notre Dame had the brainy football; the spirit, and tho Captain Jim Cravath, "Devil May" Kaer, Laranella and . \Villiams outdid themselves that combination was too strong to beat.

Page 44 1926 FOOTBALL REVIEW 
Oh U'ad power the gijtie gie us 
ARMY 
"The Army team were sorry that they had to mar the season with a loss. but were happy, too, that they found their superiors in such a team as Notre Dame. Somehow we felt after that game that we had lost to a bunch of scrapping men-real types­who typified Notre Dame so beautifully/' 
---Cadet Orville M. Hewitt 
NORTHWESTERN 
"For years Notre Dame and Northwestern have fought cleanly· on the football field and both teams. have profited hugely by the fine spirit shown. For three years I have been on Northwestern teams that tried vainly, but sincerely, to defeat the Fighting Irish. I am sorry taht I could not have been on a team that won from Notre Dame but I am not sorry to have played against such true gentlemen." 
---Ralph Baller 
INDIANA 
"\Vhen Indiana came to your school for its game this fall, all of the men on the Indiana team were hoping for victory. After they had played four quarters against your superb team they knew that they played on an inferior team and were deserving of defeat. Still it was no disgrace to lose to a football team w·hich is so aptly called, 'The Fighting Irish'." 
---Franll Sibley 
GEORGIA TECH 
"At Georgia Tech we have a ·very wholesome impression of Notre Dame and hef student body. We think of the two as one, as an inspired unit which gets behind a project and pushes it over. Georgia Tech fell before your famous 'Four Horsemen'; likewise she was a victim of your 1926 team, almost as powerful as your wonder team of 1924. Defeats are stinging but when a s::_1ortsmanlike team inflicts them the pain is considerably lessened." 
---"Red" Barron 
PENN STATE 
"Notre Dame came to State College, P a. a year ago and played a tie with .our team; Penn State went to South Bend this year and lost decisively to Notre Dame. I received the same impression on each occasion.· Your team plays its game cleanly, hard and well and then shuts up. That's an admirable quafity." 
---]olzn Filiak

To see oursel's as ithers see tts! 
CARNEGIE TECH 
Many times have I seen Notre Dame in victory and as many times have I seen the exemplary winning spirit of your team. Only once have I seen Notre Dame in defeat 
but then that spirit dawned on me more fully for I saw its real depth.  I have only the  
best of sincere  admiration  to  extend  to  you."  
---Lloyd Yoder  

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
-"Out of the middle west came a great team, known to the entire country as Notre Dame's famous Fighting Irish. Unluckily, 'our boys were forced to bow to the smooth football eleven which Rockne developed but in so doing we noticed one outstanding thing-they were pleasingly courteous at all times." 
---jess Cravath 
MINNESOTA 
"Two Notre Dame-Minnesota games have been played in the last two years ·and if . interest in the future grows as rapidly as it has in the past two seasons we may look forward to Notre Dame-Minnesota contests as the best of the west. Notre Dame men are always serious on the field; modest after the battle is over." 
---Roger Wheeler 
DRAKE 
"All the tribute and praise imaginable could be paid to the splendid football elev­ens which represent Notre Dame every year but a world of praise and tribute would be useless if Notre Dame did not go deeper than a mere athletic representative. It's the heart of Notre Dame that counts, the heart that seems to warm toward everyone.'' 
---Paul Frye 
BELOIT 
"When we played Notre Dame this year we were so overwhelmed that we didn't get much of a view of the Fighting Irish except as they rushed past or through us to make tonchdo\vns and roll the score higher and higher. Despite the decisive manner in which Notre Dame overcame Beloit, there was a feeling of courtesy and friendship that endeared us to youi· school and students."

HNow About Notre Dame-" 
By W. F. FOX, Special Sports Writer, The Indianapolis News 
I.! If we happened to be an attache in the Army of Sports and our Commanding of­
I ficer told us to go and see if we could find General Football we would head straight for South Bend. Upon arrival there we would search for Knute Rockne and we would· say to Knute Rockne: 
"Are you General Football?" 
And we rather imagine Knute would look about ·him, scan the legions of pigskin . prowlers going to and fro, reflect for a moment on the history that graced the gridi­ron ground of the place and thoughtfully reply, 
"No, but this is the General's camp." 
·X· ·:·:· ·X· 
Of such stuff was the captain of the team of '13; of such stuff is the athletic direc-. tor and head coach of the team of yesterday, of today and of tomorrow-the tomorrow that never becomes yesterday, the tomorrow that is always today. · 
The season of 1926 probably should be labeled, "one if by land and two if by air." At least so it seemed in so far as Notre Dame was concerned when she climbed the highest mountains-Northwestern, .Army and Southern. California. 
~'It took two plays of the Paris~en to Somebody" to defeat North~vestern's greatest team when the Purple played its greatest game. It took just one play, the Flanagan Flier, embellished with all the trimmings of a modern express of the rails, to knock down the ears of the Army's mule and it took one by land and two by air· to put a middle -...vestern cloud ove1~ California's smishine for the first time. 
·X· * ·:<· 
Whenever a mo]e hill actually becomes a mountain a miracle has taken place and being good christians the Notre 'Dame football team and its coach Knute Rockne figured "theirs not to reason why, their's but to do and die"-in the· famous ~vreck -~f Carnegie Tech. Such things happen in the best of regulated football families, the more reason they should happen to the 19·26 Notre Da~e team. 
Had Notre Dame gone through its 1926 campaign those along the sidelines might have sneered. The great Four Horsemen saved them their sins by moving gradually to a national championship. They used their three years to attain it, hence in their senior year their glory was the greater ·and the sneering snuffed out completely. Per­
. haps the junior team of 1926 felt the sameway. If so, watch out in 1927.

1926 FOOTBALL REVI£ut Page 47 
Overlooking the Season 
By WARREN BROWN. Chicago Herald and Exm_niuer 
My friend Mr. McNamara has petitioned for a review of the football season. In this yea'r, he has petitioned the wrong sort of a tradesman. The only person competent to review THIS football season, is one of those modern painters, who toss a hand-full of red, two and one. third cans of blue, eight tubes of green, and two fingers of purple in a shaker, mix well, add a fried egg, sun ·:1y side up, and chuck the whole thing against a slab of canvas, thus producing the masterpiece: "The Great Waffle Mystery 
·or Why Didn't Achilles Wear O'Sullivan's Rubber Heels?" 
It ain't doing right by a poor, defenseless sporting writer to ask him to review the 1926 football season. And if the unfortunate guy works out of Chicago, it's that much more intricate. 
My football season began where the world's series left off, or rather drooped in the middle, and the world's series began where the ladies' golf tournament halted for a change of· tires, and the women's golf tournament followed so· closely after the Dempsey-Tunney figth, and both were 20 lady, like that I believe honestly-or is it honestly believe ?-that they were all pai·t of the same act. But why prolong this? I can trace the beginning of my football season right back to last January 1, at Pasa­dena, and, for all I can do to stop it the qarn season inte_nds to keep right on going until next January 1, at Pasadena. This is either a vicious circle, or the plain, old run around. Perahps it's both. 
I hesitate to name a BEST team. At certain stages of the season, teams which have no claim to national championship, appealed greatly to me. 
These teams, curiously enough, did not always win their games. But they sug­gested greatness, nevertheless. 
Washington, for instan<;:e, was defeated by Alabama, ~t Pasadena, on January 1. Yet I hesitate to say that Alabama was quite as good a team as 'Vashington. If "Pop" \Varner's Stanford team doesn't win decisively from Alabama next New ·Year's Day, 
~\than I'll admit error in this judgement. 
Michigan lost a game to Navy this year. But I wouldn't say that Michigan is a team inferior to Navy. Quite the reverse, in fact. 
Mimiesota lost a game to Michigan, 7 to 6, because the rule book still insists that points, and not first downs win football games. I am not quite reckless enough to say that, on that particular day, Michigan was the superior team. It wasn't. It simply had the seven points. · 
Notre Dame's team did very :well in a very difficult shedule. It's victol·ies over Army and Northwestern were splendid· accomplishments. I would hardly class the team with that of 1924, and the Carnegie Tech upset, while perfectly amazing to many, ·didn't cause any more of my hair to fall out, than is normally the case.. I saw a Carnegie Tech team scare the very dickens out o:{ a GREAT Notre Dame team in 1924. vVhy was it unreasonable to suppose that the Skibos, with nothing much else on their mind, should fail .to rise to the heighest against a Notre Dame team of 1926, especially when that Notre Dame team had done about all that it set out to do, ·and more, in my judgment, than it actually figured to do? · 
I don't pick All-American teams I have heard that somebody else is doing it. If I did, my only candidates from this territory would be Boeringer of Notre Dame; Joesting of Minnesota; Friedman and Oosterban of Michigan, and Shively of· Illinois. 
Oh, well, January 1, and Stanford vs. Alabama is not so very -far away. My sesaon ends, then. ·After that, there will be nothing to do until next season. It starts January 2.

Are Football Players People? 
By fames E. Armstrong 
There is an idea that Notre Dame football players are a race apart. Super-men. Quiasi-deities of the football world, whose wo_shipers have spread their fame beyond the narrower sphere into. the religious and scholastic worlds. And there the reception is not always with incense and rich gifts. 
For Rockne, Notre Dame players, and the Notre Dame system, have been so long a symbol of the highest type of football and the Milky Way of the constellations that dot the football sky that the unexpected has become the commonplace in Notre Dame's football relations with the world. As long as, and mark this well, as long as the unexpected is on the achieving, the successful, and the sensational side of the ledcer. 
There is a rumor that Rockne picks his prospective backs in their early hich school days. He presents each of them with a live pig. As th~ boy grows up so does the pig and by the time the intended half-back is enrolled in Notre Dame part of the pig has become ham, bacon, etc., and the pigskin has become a football. This football is the one used by the Notre Dame team with which the prospective stat: practic~s and he is so familiar with the ball through pre-mortem association that it is impossible for him to go wrong on ·passes, ·etc. At least this rumor is no wilder than many of its contemporaries. 
The result of these tales of the super-qualities of Notre Dame players makes them seem to the uninitiated to be separated ~rom other men by a line of demarcation as prominent as the Great Wall of China. "Students and athletes"-a difference which the so-called academic delights in emphasizing. "Gentlemen _and members of the football team"-another divergence that is constantly pointed out for no reason at all, because usually the speaker would be outside either. of the classifi­cations he draws so astutely. 
The ·increase in the popularity of football has been nothing short of spectacular and is the­product of a very -rect>!lt period. The result is that hundreds of thousands of those who witness the games today have had n~ direct .contact, even the alumni of colleges and universities, with the type of men who are playing football today. And it is among this "outside crowd" that the myths and the fables run riot. Good or bad, they pass from the man who knows quite a bit to the man who knows but little and when they reach the man who knows nothing but what he is told, it is no wonder that queer stories come back to these who know the facts. · · 
And those who know, those who see the football players every day, know that they aren't any different from the next fellow. They have off-days and on-days. They .have grouches and sick spells. They eat and it wouldn't be terribly surprising, comparing them with the fellows about them, if they might "sleep in". occasionally. · They enjoy a movie or a dance. They are, in short, college boys. And to expect them to perform constantly in the public limelight with the poise of professional entertainers is expecting too .much. The comparison between Babe Ruth, ·for instance, and Christy Flanagan should go no further than to say that each one ·is mighty good in his line. But to expect Flanagan to display Ruth's experience and to act as if he \vere drawing Ruth's salary is out of ·the question. Yet if Christy doesn't happen to run twenty-five yards the first time the ball is handed to him th_e public clamors that he isn't so hot. 
It isn't necessary to eo into the formal discussion of why football nten are human. Charts and statistics have been presented in too many instances to demonstrate that the football. player is as clear a thinker, if not more so, and as good as student as his supposedly more scholastic classmate. 
. At Notre Dame the Four Horsemen are remembered as one of the smoothest looking quartets that ever strolled through Hollywood without a contract. Nor was the 1924 line backward in its haberdashery. South Bend's dances and shows are sprinkled with football players at the proper time, and there isn't a 'symptom of anything superhuman standing out on them. And Notre Dame's church and chapels
~-' 
have more than a proportionate share of football men. That is probably becauEe religion seems most valuable in time of struggle, and certainly football involves struggle. Other articles have· gone into detail on each of these subjects, ably as well as exhaustively. And with what result? 
same old story. The Archangel Rockne has appeared with the Cherubim Line and carefully mixed diet of nectar and ambrosia expects tq place the gold Dame on the flagstaff of the capitol of the football world. And God help them if

A Laurel Sprig 
Tongues of crimson flame leap against the night sky, forming fantastic creatures of the mind. Blatant notes flow from many horns, filling the air with chaotic melody. ·Myriad voices overdo themselves and, stri.!ngthened by an inspired spirit, peel out one 
grand name, "Notre Dame". 
Some shaggy cousin of the Army mule or mute effigy of a subdued Trojan warrior is paraded about, and song and cheer rin~s out to tell the \Vorld that Notre Dame ha~ conqured again, that the powerful horde whose -power is born of Our Lady and whose inspiration arises in a sequestered clump of year-stained brick watched over by the kind hands of The Mother, has once again risen to its 8Upremacy. 
Flames die down into smoldering fancies and music floats off into silent echoes . and crowds, hoarsened at the exertion, break into tiny groups, soon to disperse. Only the silent night remains and everyone has gone to his rest-except one. 
He's Father ·O'Hara and even the silent nhrht cannot entice him from his duties. On, on, on, he labors, nor does the stilly night detract him if duty calls._ 
. They Sl1eak oft.Pn of Notre n~me ~oirit, these dilletantes, but they, none of them, auite aporoar!h its sacred fire. They brag about it. they connect themselves with it, they try to hbor und~r its embracimr sue 11 hut none of them can comprehend it. ln one man. Notre Dame spirit is lifeblood. It flows throughout his svstem carrvin~ into remote corners of his body and urge of service. That man is Father O'Hara. 

They'll tell you much about the Notre Dame football team. these clilletantes. of its mif.!'hty prowess and its unequalled power. Thev'll tell you much of Cartier Field. and its unstained turf where Notre Dame men have won year in and year out. And they'll try to explain why Notre Dame has ·won. 
\Voros are WP.ak and fall misel':1bly slYort. But actualities move the mind with a laRtinrr nicture. They won't tell you aho·ut ·the Basement Chapel, thP.se dilletantes, and that's whv thev cnn't tell you whv Notre Dnme football teams perch astride this athletic world and bask in the glory that a modern Azor deserves. 
Not.re n~me wins her victories in the Basement Chapel. Down in .the worn alcove of worshin. they n1·ay and intercede, not that their team will win but that it may fight like real Notre Dame men-and win if God so wills. 
And wit.h them prays a sinsrle man, prematurely old, it seems, but grizzled with the rrray of service. On, on, on he. prays and labors that the spirit which is Our Lady'3 will insoire the men that are Our Lady's and bring closer to them the ideal_. that· is 
·Notre Dame's. . 
Cleated feet and horny hands and. pacl ded bodies fisrht for Notre Dame on Cartier Field and P.ke out the fruits of victory. Tired feet and willinl!' hands and a black­u-arbed boov beseech Our Lady and Her Son that Notre Dame might live on her glor­ious tradition. . 
The flame flares up to die, the music peals out to drift away, the crowd -collects to weaken. Maudlin, they are, and fickle. 
The night is silent now and the sequestered clump is dark. But what is that light in a Sorin· tower! It must be that the' man who _lives there is working yet, work­ing, on, on, on. It must be that Father O'Hara will ever work and pray and labor for that sacred ideal--Notre Dame and her men. ·

What are the chances-? Deczde for.yottrse(f! 
Whether ateam comes through a season with a perfect record, a ·mediocre one or one that is starkly disastrous, the · hue and cry its adheren'e ts · can· be summed in four wo.rds: 
'Vhat are the chances? 
They always look forward, these fo'otball-mad enthusiasts, to the season that's jnst beyond the hill and to every last one of them, they can see a. team of. destiny lying in the shadow, waiting to spring up and conquer ·the world. 
.Som'etimes th~ir pr-edictions are carried out and a great eleven is in the making. .Again, they might be \Vrong and more disaster is in prospect. After all football teams are human. 'Vhat are the chances? 
Even though they had the thrill of. suppo_rtin~. the wPstern chapions -this year, Notre Dame· enthu­sillsts are looking forward to a bigger tid-bit of the gridiron. another national title. Have they a chance to .realise their aim? C.onsider the men that are. graduating and the ones that .will be back 
in the game again. Then make your own conclusions. _ 
With half th~ line back, an All-America!~ center gone. n crack backfield departing and a fine backfield ready to play another season, whether he dime falls heads or tails determines Notre Dame's chances of pulling through to an i_mpressive re.cord. 
__ ;.· 
"Bud" Boeringer, center of. centers, unanimous. choice of all experts for· All-American honors, graduates in June._ That's a bad break to begin with. But Fredericks and Moynihan. capable substi­tutes, with McCarthy and Plummer, also a good men, should fill in well at that berth. 
Guards? There's much hope there. Smith an•l Lepllil!' and· Law have workecl at the guarcl posi­
tion often and hnve their share of experience..Locke,. Br;wn and Jones, with se~sonin'e-; will be a trio of guards hard to b~at. · . · · 
Tackles? It will be hard to .beat the lot that are h"c'k. 1\Iiller and Poliskev. hnth mnnl'lgram men. nrc rn~ed among the best. Ransavage, Noon, ConnPlly. Smietnnka. Doarn nncl f.ltPin .. hcking in exper~ence only, are a beefy delegation and should make things interesting for some sets of br~cks. 
Ends? Maxwell and Wallace are ·-leaving and that is to be regretted. But Vneclisch. Walsh· and Tom Byrne are back. That. i~ cause for rejoicing. Ed. Collins and Hack Winberry, the latter handi­capped by injuries during the past season, have another year of football. Likewise Vezie, Colerick and Duperior, !!!.!.._ Sophomores, will have the advantage of a year's development. . 
So much ·for the line. The entire left flank of the ,vall is back and no small amount of e~­p~rienced linemen are available for the portside of the outer guard.. "Things· don't look so ·bad there", you will say. _And you're just about right.
·•
{, 
Coming, then, to the backfield, as all good football fans do, sooner or later, you polish your thoughts and sharpen your tongue because you'll want to talk now. 
To begin with, th'e Parisien-Niemic combination is -avaiiabl~ agai~.' Ch-risty Flaringm1, ·who didn't ~:..' play enou~:h to warrant Mr. Eckersall's consideration but who ·was quite conspicuous when he ·did play,(. will be running wild for another year. And at the other half Champ Chevigney will be ·chewing his 
bit, lest there isn't enough action. Then Austin Downes looks like the corner. 
Ray~ Elder, Montroy, Hogan, and ·nunclovic, all possesed of sp.eed a'nd daring arc due for some action at the halfback ·post's. · · · 
. With "Red" ·smith, Fred-die· Collins and· Jack -1\I,Grath .to in.. the f~llback n~sigririi(mts the~e is little cause for extreme worry. Byrne and Qualters can hit the line with no small degree. of power. 
All these, men .with at lea~t a year's .csperiience on a varsity. srpl'ld, are .ready to· make Notre 
Dame's 1927 eleven one to be thought of with the_ best. of teams. . Hall and Freshman football will 
offer a delegation o~ g~ic~ders who could take care of th~msclvcs ..o~ .almost any football field. 
"What a~e the chances?" you'll ask. again. 
Good men in prospect for every position. That makes you perk up satisfied. And then you think of the schedule. ·Only. eight games next. year! That ought to be an advantage, hadn't it? Not so much wear and tear and danger of going stale because of the long season. 
Don't let the schedule raise up ·any chimeras in your brain! Those eight games are ones to be reckoned ·with: When you meet Indiana, Minnesota, Navy, Southern California and the "Army in the space of two months,. seven weeks to be exact, you' rc biting off a hu["e hunk. And that's what this 1!?27 Fjghting Irish squad will be asked to do. 
What are the chances? 
There is plenty of hope but don't be inhuman. There's plenty of work, too.

Cheerleaders 
I 
i 
It's an established fact that colleg-iate football is more· than eleven brawny z·individuals, trained well and possessed of speed and strength. 
~ : 
In these (fays it is almost an industry, this college foqtball business and its makeup ·1~ just as intricate as an industrial unit. 
Coaches, mana~ers, howling alumni, sports ,\rriters and cheering sections are part of the industry. Special emphasis on that cheering section part of it. That's what we're going to talk about. 
Cheering sections are bigger cogs than most admit. It's ·spirit that makes a football team great and surely ·nO small amount of spirit emanates from the cheering section. Much as they are panned by "columnists" and jingle-potes, cheering sections are vital. 
Without leaders a cheering section would be an unhappy lot of people. So you see that these cheerleaders have .a big part to play-so big,. in fact, that it takes a corps of them to run things smoothly. 
Notre Dame has been fortunate in having a set of cheerleaders who do their work faithfully .and well. Notre Dame's cheering section was as good as the best and its glory reflects in no mean way the ability of Bernie Abbrott, "Pep" Mannix, "Zip" Salmon, and "Red" Leech: 
Abbrott has led yells for three years. Mannix and Salmon com­pleted their second year of service while Leech was a newcomer to the squad.

Stud.ent Managers 

Toiling, toiling, toiling, long before the crowds sweep into the stadium and then laboring long after the dark shadows have crept down from the peaks of the walls is the life of the student manager. He must be content to give his best for the University and then go his way sans the publicity, sans the glory or the glamour of the man who skirts the ends, hits back inside tackle and 
pounds  avay  at  glory.  But  the  work  must  be  done  well.  The  happiness  of  the  vast  crow'ds  often  
depends  upon  a  students  manager's genious  for  
detail.  Only  one  who  has made  a  trip with  the  
teams  and watched  a  manager at work will  come  
to  realize  the  real  importance  of these  men.  
This  year,  quite  in  keeping  with  the  dual  
captaincy perhaps,  Notre  Dame  had  two  senior  
student  managers  in  charge  of  football  and  in  
retrospection  it would  seem  that  each  was  just  
about  twice  as  good  as  could  be  expected.  The  
two  seniors  were  James  Coleman  of  Orange,  
New  York,  and  William  Kavanaugh  of  Dayton,  
Ohio. To these men fell the duty of for the team while it was away from  providing the home  james Colema11  

lot. Such matters as Hotel Reservations, food transportation and n million and one little details it was their task to anticipate and take care of. Their record in filling the bill was remarkable. 
Their work called for marked ability and dependability along with inginuity and precision in execution of tasks. "When Coleman and Kavanaugh stepped into the_ job this fall they were facing a mighty big assignment, Notre Dame travelled mot·e miles this year than any other team in this tax ridden universe of ours and that meant work for these two. Beside this the home <htcs brought their problems and thP. skillful manner in which the crowds were -handled and the field kept has elicited praise many. Then too, they were stepping to the office which in previous years had been held by men who were reputed to have been great in this line of work. But the two men buckled down and to-day there are none who can conscientiously deny them the credit that is ccrtainally theirs. 
-Just take a minute off now and look back at whatever contact you have had with the managerial corps . this season. Perhaps you were unaware that you had had any. Most likely the latter is the case you think. If this be true, then you will re:1lize the efficiency with which they have S·:>lved your problems this fall. Had you ran into trouble in finding you proper place at the games or had any of many other little details turned out in any but the right way you would have been concious that these men had been slipping up. On the oth3r hand if you have come in contact with either of .these managers in a business manner we are sure that you will agree that they knew their business. 
The managerial corps is an honor system. In the first of each year a call· for candidates is sent forth and the freshmen that answer are given cer~ain tasks to perform. These men arc gone over and .weeded down until by the end of the year only those showing marked ability along this line of work arc retained. In the sopholnore year the men are eliminated. In the junior year the manager is given responsibility and throughout his whole third year is under constant servailance. Then· in the June of that year comes the big night. This is the annual banquet given by the Athletic Associa­tion for these trusted workers. It is at this time that the f!lanagers for the varsity teams of the senior year are announced and it is a time of susp.ense for all. From this you can roughly gather the idea of how the varsity managers are selected and why it is a distinct honor to be a member of this efficient body of workers. 
This year special commendation must be given the men who worked under l\Ianagers Kavanaugh and Coleman for the fine spirit that they have sh wn as well as for their efficient co.ordination. August Grams, Ed Burke, John Igoc, Ed Cu~ningham and Bernard Zipperer were the junior managers who carried on directly under the leadership of these two and who are deserving of a great deal of credit. Bertrand, Hennessey, Wilbour, Schoppneau, Ryan, Hinkel and l\[c D~vitt were the sophomores selected for various tasks.

Players Think Football 
By LAWRENCE PERRY 
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn.. Oct. 12.-Notre Dame this season is likely to have one of the greatest elevens in the history of the South Bend institution-unless all signs as revealed in Saturday's game between Knute Rockne's men and Minnesota are misleading 
In the backfield there will probably be not only four horsemen, but half a dozen viz: Edwards, Flanagan, Niemic, Dahman, Rearden and Parisien. And the line, even ·with that fine tackle, Boland, out for the s~ ason with a brokEn leg, should develop into the greatest set of forwards that ever played for Notre Dame. 
The Rox are already starting out to do what they did so signally in 1924-they are advancing the ball with a minimum of personal contact in the.line. By this the writer means that the oppof?ing linemen are being drawn apa1·t by deception rather ~han~ by sheer brute 'force. 
DECEP'l'IO:N' IN .~ TTACK 
The quarterback, standing perhaps a bit closer to the line than in the past, alter­nates handling the ball with the direct pass from the center to the runner. The field general does a lot of thimble rigging when the ball comes through him. He spins and delays and pulls fancy stuff in concealing the precise· destination of the pigskin. 
And so· more often than not the Minnesota tackles and the defensive fullback found themselves -sliding to meet the backfield shift only to find in the end that the ball had not followed the shift. The resu It was yawning holes b the line and groping backfield men who 'vere fair game for the Notre Dame linemen who came through to take them out. 
Successfully to meet the South Bend attack the tacklers must play their positions with rare discretion, must not be too quick to get thorugh into the backfield, and if they ever lose touch with their ends, it is goodnight. ~rhe writer thinks that Fred Dawson, when he was at Nebraska, was the one coach who ever has proved himself capable of adjusting his line defense to Rockne's methods of offense. 
ROX DEFENSIVELY STRONG 
Defensively Notre Dame is just as inspiring as on attack. The men play a stand­up, look-it-over defense and then charge into the play with unerring judgment. They met the Minnesota shift not. by sliding but by_ stepping into it, and the manner i:r: which they checked the Gophers' rugged and versatile attack was highly creditable. 
Minnesota. unquestionable has an up and coming eleven. It is a big outfit and the backs are fast and heavy. In the first half the Minnesota-Notre Dame game 'vas as fine an exhibition of football as one could have wished to see even well along in the season. Honors in the way of consecutive ground gaining, in fact, went to the Gophers. 
Notre Dame seemed taken back by two serious injuries that occurred in the first few plays of the game, Boland's broken leg and Collins' broken jaw. · In the second half, though, came that wonderful flowing rhythm, that deftness of foot, that perfect b.ody control which are hallmarks of the Rockne idea at its best. 
R'OCKNE HANDLES MEN 
And does there anywhere exist a brand of psychology superior to Rockne's? Be­tween halves when the score was 7 to 7 and the issue in the air, Rockne came into the dressing room, looked at his _men a minute and then spoke just 38 words. · 
"Boys," he said, "there are two of your teammates lying in the hospital now, 
seriously injured.  All they have took forward  to  now  is the  score  at the end of thi:;  
game.  What are you going to give them?"  
He turned and walked  out.  The final  score  was  20  to  7.  
and that  was  incomplete .

NE:w York Herald Tribze11e 
NEW YORK, Nov. 13.-There was only one lone Horseman riding against the skyline of fame when Notre Dame met the Army in their annual classic at the Yankee stadium this afternoon, but this time one Horseman was enough. 
His name was Flanagan-Chris Flanagan of Notre Damo--n big gangling, hard running half­back with the speed of the wind that sweeps the prairies of the west. It wa~ Flanagan, the South Bend sirocco who ran 63 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter to beat the Army 7 to 0 in one of the finest football wars any crowd of 70,000 ever saw. It was the margin of this single slashing, whirlwind gallop down the field that the· Blue and Gold of the west found itself above the Gray, Gold and Black of the Army as night came down upon two of the most evenly matched teams that ever met. 
Teams Well Matched 
Outside of this one bewildered dash each team made seven first downs and the Army rushed the ball lGO yards against '163. for Notre· Dame as the deadly tackling and the charging defense of both teams broke up play after play. 
But that run was all that Notre Dame needed to take her old place in the procession just a stride in front of the Army march. Through the first two periods neither team had been able to make any headway although the· Army .had a slight advantage ~hrough the uncanny accuracy of Murrell's kicking in the general direction of the out of bounds zone. 
Through these two opening periods the Army had picked up fo~r first downs against three for the unbeaten invaders of the west and the Army had hammered her way for a net gain of 101 yards a.gainst 104 fqr Notre Dame. 
Third Quarter Vital 
Still unbeaten for the year, still neck · and neck, they entered the third quarte·r as the big crowd of 70,000 waited either for the expected draw or the break of the contest that might swing the winning tide in either direction. There was no hint in which direction this tide might go. There had been no margin that any eye could detect as the two. hard fighting lines charged. in upon the rival defense to spill one thrust after another. 
This battle was all along the ground, man to man and body to body, savage-and clean, fought with unremitting fierceness minus any show of rancor. Both teams had shown magnificient spirit and the ablest of coaching as they swayed back and ·forth between the two 20-yard lines, 
unable to put on any consistent advance against 
charging that came in swiftly and tackling that 
a~most never missed. 
It was early in the third quarter ·that the silhouette· of the lone horseman was seen against the skyline, now half. hidden in the shadows where the sun had set back of the towering stadium wall. 
Flanag~n Cuts In 
The 70,000 banked around the field peered down again to the pit as. the· army kicked off to start the third quarter and the brilliant O'Boyle came charging back to his own 33-yurd line before· he was thrown U,!>on his neck. The next play O'Boyle hit the line for four yards, and the simoon. struck. The ball was pusse·d to Flanagan and the lone horseman started at killing speed for the Army's left flank. He came in a straight diagonal line until he was within two strides of the Army end and then without slackening his. pace by a breath he suddenly whirled and cut in towards 
tackle. A streak headed.  He of  was by the· army line raw lightning who was  in not  a  flash. to be  
Tlzc Indianapolis News  

Gene Edwards, Hurry O'Boyle, Christy Flana­gan, Tom Rearden. These boys are the Do, Re, Me, Fa of Rockne's back field at Notre Dame this year. The So, La, Si, Do are Parisien. Niemic, Dahman and Wynne. the eight being Mr. Rockne's idea of a football quartet. 
· Trying to go up and down the Army scale was their job Saturday afternoon and judging from Army's game accounts this year these quartets were expected to hit some rough notes. · 
These boys arc the 1926 echo of Stuhldreher, Miller, Crowley and Layden, the original gridiron Four Horsemen. The Army may or may not believe in eches-last year it did not. 
Edwards comes from Kiski, where Stuhlie came from. Wynne is just a younger brother of the full who used to be; Flanagan and Heurden are merely answers to the charge Fighting Irish. 
SOUTH BEND, I~d., Nov. 10.-The skies hero were red this evening with the blaze of 2,500 red flares as the student body of Notre Dame met in the great al!nual "pep session" prior to the players' leaving for the Army game in New York 
Saturday. There was more "pep and zip" shown in this monster celebration held in the midst of a snowstorm than can be recalled to the minds of-most of the older students. 


By CLAUDE NEWMAN 
Los Angeles Times 
Realising a dcad.ly effective eleventh hour for-' ward passing attack, the "Twenty l\[ules" of Notre Dame ran the "Thundering Herd" of the University of Southern California into the sod of the Los Angeles Coliseum yesterday afternoon, 13 to 12, in the most spectacular game of the year. 
"Shock troops,". famed the length and breadth of the land, won for Knute Rockne. 
Art Parisien, substitute quarter, and Johnny Niernic, half, routed the forces of Troy just three minutes before the final gun. by completing two long passes which sent the "mules" thundering half the length of thP. field to a touchdown. 
It was· Parisien who unleashed passes to defeat . Northwestern, 6 to 0, in the final period early in the season and it was Parisien who yesterday 
· heaved ·the two !Jasses which won the game. 
The first was a magnificent southpaw heave of 35 yards to Nicmic, which placed the ball on the U. S. C. 21-yard line. 
Passing Attack . 
Cutting back swiftly .toward his goal line again in the same sort of a play, on thi'rd dr.wn, Paris­ien shot another beautiful pass to Nicmic,. who caught it on the dead run and loped across the Trojan goal line lugging the leather and the six 
:points needed· to bring .the Irish. up from the rear into the van.tagc po~ition~ . The placement. attempt was blocked-but Notre Dame had won the ball game. 
Parisien showed remarkable accuracy in throw­ing the leath~r. The two passes ·he made were the only ones but they were deadly accurate and shot to the receiver, low and straight. · 
For a time it seemed that Don Dilliams, .sub­.stitute quarter, would come through as the hero in a U. S. C. victory. As it was, he was the hero in defeat-the man who made it necessary' ·for the Irish to put on their spectacular finish.· Going into the game in the third quarter when 1\lorton Kaer, ball packing ace of the Trojans was forced to give up because of injuries, Wil­liams performed with brilliancy and time after 
time. we'nt .. ste'ariling ·. througl~ the tackles .foi; . twisting runs· of six, eight, 10, 12, 15 and some­times 20 yards. 
' U. S. C. Chance 
The U.S. C. chance.carne near.the end of third 
period when a Notre Dame· punt was partially hlocked. and recovered on . the · Trojan 42-yard line. With Williams d~ing· ·the packing twice, . 
U. s:· C; carried.·the. ball to the Notre Dame 43-· .vnd ·line as the period ended." Williams jaunted to the 34-yard line on the first down when he cut through a wide center hole opcticd by Jeff Cravath and Brice T3ylor. ·He then made it a first down on the 30-yard .line · 
and continuing. his charging through the line. ran the ball to the '11:-yard line. He then hit 'right. 
tackle for two yards•' On :a· record·' 'down 'lie-YVns· ._.:·.".'.Cause~_: as .:tiiey ·say~· "It: sounds ·'fike·· 'Ro.ck.' ,., : . .·..

held for no gain. Then he rambled off right 
tackle to a touchdown and Drury missed the 
placement try for goal, the point which would 
have the tied the Irish. 
A "break" really decided the game when Notre Dame scored the first touchdown of the g:awe. 
After a see-saw first quarter, Rockne inserted his "Three Horsemen," Christy Flanagan, Torn Rearden and Harry O'Boyle, shortly after the beginning of the second period. Flanagan passed to Riley, placing the ball in midfield, and then O'Boyle knifted through tackle, dodged to the right and went dashing down· the field 25 yards to the U. S. C. 16-yard line. 
O'Boyle had virtually a clear field on this jaunt but was pulled down from behind by Kaer, who grabbed at the flying Irishman's shoulder pads and held on like murder. O'Boyle was thrown out of bounds by Kaer. 
Place Kick 'Break' 
On the· first down Riley circled left end for a touchdown. He ran behind a perfect screen of interference-interferers who blocked per­fectly. Riley wasn't touched by a tackler until he had raced over the goal line, so perfect \vas the interference. 
Chicago Herald and Examiner 
SOUTH BEND Ind., Dec. 5.-Thcrc arc several ways of winning a football game, but probabiy only one of doing the impossible. 
When Knutc K. Rockne herded· his "Fighting 
Irish" aboard the train here l\londay for Los 
Angeles many .critics put up their hands nne 
agreed that the Notre Dame boys didn't. have a 
ch~ncc; To win was impossible:·.-,--:;::.~·-· ·· · 
Saturday they met the University of Southern 
California and 13 to 12 score is evidence that they 
turned the trick. Probably the following story 
that leaked back from the special train ridden . by the Rockmen tells the secret. It "seems that when the· beaten Irish returned from Pittsburgh last week they expected their coach to tear his hair. literally, that is.. becaUl'\e "Rock" is bald. He fooled 'em. He met the train with a smile. He had not a word to say to them conce~ning the defeat. They 
did some .thinking. They knew it hurt the grand old man more than it did them. But he said nothing. 
When they. got ready to turn in 1\Ionday even­
ing on the· Pullman they did some more thinking, 
for ·in each· man's traveling bag was a Carnegie 
Tee program. . 
The only way to do .the impossible? Why, by 
psychology, it seems. . 
Whatever may be the truth of the tale,· it;s 
going the rounds on the Notre Dame campus, 
.where Irish eyes..are ·smiling. And whether you 
·do or not, these. students _believe it, .fiijnly,_ ?-':­

FRESHMAN FOOTBALL 
Thousands of Irish eyes are smiling, th.ousands of f;ms arc thrilled, and thousands _f,'----­look back with .pride upon the way that the ghosts of the four horsemen galloped with destructing array. Seventy-five thou sand saw Rock's 1926 machine function with perfect cynchronism to take the Cadets down the line; eighty tho1;1sand saw the same crew annex the scalp of ·caJifornia in a final plunge with only three minutes to play; and forty-three thousand witnessed the boys with the silk pants beat North~ western by alone touchdown. It was a glorious season. But· there is a hidden story behind the splendor of it all; a tale the signifence of which few of the thousands who followed the team this season realize. It is just this. vVires clicked for hours, cameras· shot picture after picture, and presses rolled out page after page; all a monument to the team, Rockne's varsity. They did a good job of it. Yes! But they should have told you that behind all this, unheaded to the sporting world, was a group of pigskin wrestlers who lept their relentless efforts to help put the varsity on top; .they were the Freshmen. 
Night after night, the green jersied lads· bucked .up against men of greater age and experience and gave them a good game of it. They were the teams mythical foe. It was the Frosh who first executed the plays of the Cadets, Northwestern, and Cali­fornia in order to give the boys who would represent .Notre Dame an idea of just . what they would be up against. And they did it well. That was their game and that was all the farther· that their praise was laureled. Unlike previous years the Frosh did not play inter-collegiate games with teams in their own class~ They held ·up their morale, their COUl~age, in spite of this fact and_were OUt every night to .contribute their bit. Few knew just these facts and little was the·. praise that the Frosh rightfully des.erve. Like the unknown heroes of fie tion, they are; unknown to many but deserv­ing a world of congratulations and glory. 
vVe we're looking at a few back copies of the Review a day or two ago, and a strik­ing fact was brought home to us by a few of the pictures. On one· of the pag~s, hidden a~ongst the. crowd, were the Four Horsemen as Freshmen. Li~tle was it real­ized that that crew, all Freshman, who had helped model the team of that year, would reveai four men. the Four Horsemen, known in fiction as Pestilence, Conquest, War and Death but in real life as Crowley, Layden, Miller. and Stuhldreher. Perhaps this r year's Freshman squad might hold four men or more . of equal calibre. Who knows? vVe ·confess that we do not; but we do know that from all accounts the team has a wealth of material in passers, punters and tacklers; that they gave their all for Notre Dame. One means. of compensation·is the monument that the success of the varsity has built to them; another-is the. numerals that the .fourty of them will receive. The team was coached by Stanley arid· J: Vignos .who dese1•ve a grea·t ·amount of praise .tor· the calibre of their work. The_ follow in'g men are the ones so deservi~g .of men­tion: Add none of men who received numerals get theni in Rock's offer.

"I Went to Notre Dame-" 
By FRANK WALLACE. New York Evening Post 
It is a pleasure to be back in the Football Review which is an important item in yearly sport literature because it chronicles most consistently good. That is my idea and yours, of course; but it is also the opinion of that mythical and very real person, the football fan. 
Regardless of Iowa, Nebraska, Army or Carnegie Tech-the quartet which have been permitted to demonstrate. that Notre Dame is human as well as marvellous-people recognize the position of Notre Dame. . 
Rockne is the coach of the coaches. His boys are the brighest of students. Notre Dame is synonymous with all that is smart, effective and delightful on the gridiron. ·When Notre Dame loses it is news-big news-something td be discussed and won­dered about over the countryside wherever men gather by the radio or the printed page. 
We came up from the South. once after beating Georgia Tech. A priest in Nash­ville said·.that the Notre Dame victory had done more good than any mission ever held below the Mason-Dixon line. 
When·-Notre Dame played the Ar.my it was the big sporting event of the day. It was the second biggest event of the past football season. It was more important than the Harward-Yale game and it actually outshone the Yale-Princeton contest which was held on the same day. · 
More wires were utilized to report the Army-Notre Dame game this year than any other battle except the Army-Navy classic. There was more· agitation over tickets than over ·the Big Three contests. 
·One more subtle but convincing proof that the Army-Notre Dame engagement was the biggest thing in Eastern football this year. The premier sporting writers go to the biggest game of the week..:.._the game which outweighs others is scientific and colorful appeal. 
Grantland Rice, probably the successor to Walter Camp and the football writer with the largest following, led his band of experts to the Yankee Stadium on November ·13. The second-stringers went to Princeton fm: the Yale contest. It is probable that the same thing would have happened had Harward and Yale played on thb same day as the Irish and Cadets. . 
Your Notre Dame and mine is mi'e of the few organizations which is big stuff in this town that swallows celebrities in its hungry maw. When New York stops to look · at a visitor he is unusual.· It always stops to look at Notre Dame because Notre 
Dame never disappoints. New York stops to look and it waits to marvel. . ·Think just what that means to those of us who have left that pleasant green cam­
pus to come to this cold land to look for gold. "I went to Notre Dame" you say. "Oh, yes1"-. Soon they want to know about Rockne and the team and how. they do it. On Thanksgiving Eve I addressed ·a gathering of good fellows from Syracuse 
University at a smoker. ·<· "I went to Notre Dame-" 
I was interrupted by sound and heart-warming applause. ~ There was a tribute to warm your soul. These people were letting loose in no· feeble way the admiration they had. for Rockne and his boys·and the school. · 
Things like that happen to the Notre D arne man in New York all through 'the year. 
· It makes you glad ·and happy and proud and thankful to those boys and the coach who have made the world beat a path to the door of our brave little school out where Nature still slumbers. 
I went back to-school last Fall with Babe Ruth and the Yankees. Two newspaper­men -from New York came along. They were interested in the school. We met Father Lange. His greeting was : · 
"Who is going to win the fight?" (Dempsey-Tunney). 
They sat the head table, met Father Walsh, Father Schumacker, Father Nieuland and others. They came away amazed at the fellowship and the regulm;ity .of the plac~ They had been to other colleges in our effete East.
