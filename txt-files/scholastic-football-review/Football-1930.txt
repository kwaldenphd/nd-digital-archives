Unf.vc1·sity of Not1·e Dame 


HIS season has been a source of great satis­f~ction to 1ne, not particularly because 'We -zvon, but because of the fine feeling of 
·friends!Jip between 1nyself, the boys, and the 
, assistant· coaches. T h~ boys o~t the tea11t re­sponded as fine as any temn I !Jave e.ver had an~ in every -zva~y, o~~ the field and off tbe field, they reflected credit on the school. 
H eartl'y finderson, Cbevigny, ,Voedisch, and Moynihan ·mqde up the best varsity coai:bing staff I have ever had or ever bo pe ·to bave, and their untiring, unselfish, an·d 1tnoste1ztatious worl~ was very largely n?sponsible for our success. Bill Jones and V ezie -zvith the Fresh11zen -zvere excel­lent a·nd did a great deal to help bring our var­sity tea11t along. And to Dan Halpin and bis student 11zanagers -zvbo have helped to 1nake our season a success; 1Tt')J sincere thanks!_

CAPTAIN THOMAS A. CONLEY, Notre Dame, 1930 

;xms 
U1tiversity of Notre Dame 


S CAPTAIN of the Notre Da11ze tea11z of 1930, I wish first to express the ad1nira­tion of the temn for the excellent spori~­
1nanship displa')Jed by our ten opponents. Ever;' ga11te was cleanly fought and it -was a pleasure to 1neet tea11zs who so. well displayed the prin-­ciples of fair play. 
Ev~ry 1nan on the squad, whether with the .varsity or -with the reserves; cooperated to 1nake 
1ny position as captain as easy as possible and it 
-was this excellent spirit of temn play that 1nade 
our successful season possible. 

It has been a great experience to .play under Coach Rock11e and the other coaches who -worked so · untiringl-y to 1nal~e the ,season a success. 
Finally, let 1ne thank th~ students and facult')' in the 1za11ze ·of the players for their splendid support, both phy.sical an~ spiritual; which was a constant source of inspiration. 
THoMAS A. CoNLEY

THE BqARD OF STRATEGY TIM MOYNIHAN HEAR TLEY ANDERSON KNUTE K. ROCKNE JOHN CHEVIGNEY 
JOHN VOEDISCH 
University of Notre Dame 
(( . Varsity Coaches )) )) 
}{ ;:
KNUTE K. ROCKNE }{ 
n 
I-Iead Coach == 
Everyone already knows more about efficient, genial, inspiring, brainy, hard-working, successful Coach Knute K. Rockne than he knows about himself and we cannot, in this short space, elaborate on him. 
II 
Since he started as head coach in 1917, his teams have won Ill games while losing 13, less than one a season. His 1919 and 19 2 0 teams were undefeated and were \Vestern champions; his 1924 and 1929 teams and now his 1930 eleven all had clean slates _and 
.were awarded national championships. Seldom has he dropped more than one game a season, and only once, in 1928, did his 
II

teams lose more than two. The 1928 season was called .. disastrous" when the first ~tring played almost. every minute of each of nine hard games and lost four out of nine contests with leading teams of the country. Bedfast for .all but three games last year because of a leg ailment that threatened his life, he inspired and coached his men to a national title and repeated this year with what newspapermen call the team closest to



II II
~§ perfection of any ,in history. He has taken stoically the edicts of rulemakers directed at him and has always come back defiantly to rise to greater heights. \Vhat it is that enables him to do this, we 
II 

II 
don't know. You can call it genius or whatever you wish, but we only know that it works, and probably will continue to -work for ·the future glory of Notre Dame. His record speaks for itself. 
HEARTLEY ..HUNK" ANDERSON 
Assistant Coach
u .• II

Few, if iny, know more about line play than ..Hunk" Anderson, Notre Dame's capable 1930 line coach. He played under Rockne in 1921, 1922, and 1923, and coached with him in 1925 and 1926. Then· he went to St. Louis University as head coach for 
. three years, but returned to the fold last spring. His familiarity with the Rockne style of play has enabled him to develop a varsity line that takes its place with any of the past, and a. shock troop line that .. clicked" soon enough to save the varsity many a bruise and bump. As a player, he was mentioned on a number of all-\Vestern and all­
II 

American teams, and this year his students have carried on the distinctions that were his. 
JOHN CHEVIGNEY 
Assista11t Coach 
One of the greatest defensive half-backs in Notre Dame histor·y, ..Chev" has shown himself to be as good a teacher as he was a pupil, and as one of the most promising of 
II

the multitude of the younger mentors. An excellent scout, he brought back on one occasion more plays Of the opposition, so says Coach Rockne, than Notre Dame has itself. His keen mind, unti.t:ing energy, and almost inordinate love of football make him all that a coach should be. 
II 

JOHN "IKE" VOEDISCH 
Assistant Coar:h 
Like the others, Assistant Coach ..Ike" Voedisch is a former Notre Dame star. He finished his career as an outstanding wingman three years ago and has just rounded out his third year as a producer of steady, hard-playing ends. Tall, quiet, and unassuming, he has taught his men well all the tricks of boxing ·a 'tackle, covering a punt, catching. a pass, turning in an end run, and the hundreds of details of end play. \Vith him co<"~.ch­ing, Rockne has never been without five or six capable men at the flanks. 
TOM MOYNIHAN 
Assisfa11t Coach 
II 

II 
\'\'hen .. Big Tim" was graduated last year after three years of play at center which won him national recognition, Rockne knew that there was only one man who knew the strengths and weaknesses of the candidates out to fill Tim's shoes. He was the spark­plug of the great 1929 line and he has, in his first year as a coach, not only brought out 
the best qualities of his group of ball-snappers, but instilled in them the indomitable fire 
that characterized his play.. A year's experience behind him, he. should do great things
u II ij
}{ next season when he has back his three best men, Yarr; Butler and Rogers.

CAPTAIN TOM CONLEY 
Right Bud · All-W'estern 

To be elected captain of a Notre Dame football team is every small boy's ambition. To be the star erid on the same team -and to lead· it through the hardest schedule in football history undefea-ted is more than even the wildest youngster dreamers visualize as their future lot. 
It was more than Tom Conley had ·ever thought of' doing when he was left tackle at Roman Catholic high school, Philadelphia. -In the first place he never thought that Coach Rockne would move him to right end, and in the second place he had his doubts that he would _ ever make the first team at Notre Dame. Even as captain and all­city tackle for his high school, the thought farthest from his mind was that some day he would be a national hero. 
The ovation he received as he trotted off the field at Los Angeles after participating in the worst drubbing Notre Dame has ever given Southern California was perhaps the greatest compliment he ever has , or ever could receive. His team had just won a national champion­ship and 90,000 persons whose hopes and prayers were all for the Trojans, rose as one to recognize his fine sportsmanship, his marve­lously consistent play, and his great spirit of leadership. _ 
Tom Conley's individual feats of splendor inay be forgotten· with the passage of time-he had defeated Southern California in. 1929 with his brilliant catches from Jack Elder's arm, he had defeated Carnegie Tech to redeem a shattered tradition at Cartier field at· the beginning of the season just closed, and he had broken into the limelight on numerous other occasions when he rose above his usual, hard, steady play to punctuate his career with brilliancy-but never will his over­whelming modesty, his friendliness, his great courage, his undying spirit, and his genial smile be forgotten as long as Notre Dame men talk about football. 
FRANK CARIDEO 
Oiwrter-bac/{ · Xll-Americau ­

Many were the responsibilities of Frank Carideo in his three years as Notre Dame's quarter-back. In 1929, with Rockne home in bed with a serious leg ailment for six of the nine games, his was the responsibility of the· great coach himself. Only superJatives can describe how he combined his striking per­sonal qualities to make himself the unanimous choice of the press of the nation for all-American honors. 
First as a field. general, his judgment in calling plays was beyond all re­proach. He made absolutely the best possible use of the greatest array of attacking weapons any team has ever had. 
The perfect rhythm and deadly blocking of Notre Dame was the marvel of all who witnessed the 1930 team. The rhythm came from Carideo's res.onant voice as it called the signals, slowly, and so deliberately that by the ti1.11e .th~ ball was snapped, the entire team was straining, every muscle tense, ready to spring. ..Twenty-three-eighteen.....;_;_forty-five-hip-one-two -\X'HAM!" His blocking was that of a battering ram and as often as not he sent two or three opposing defenders flying as he struck. . . 
His kicking was perfect. Against Northwestern and Army, in spite of-the logginess of the ball in the latter game, he sent long spirals down the field from behind his own line when a slip might have meant the. turn of the tide of bat­tle. Against Northwestern and Southern California,_ especially, his punts out of bounds within.the five-yard line on numerous occasions did much to de­moralize powerful opponents. Finally, he did all. of the kicking off for Notre Dame and missed only four points after touchdown from placement while boot­ing 27 squarely between the uprights during the 19 3 0 season. 
He could run back a punt or catch a pass with the best, and, had it been necessary, he could have thrown his share of passes. He had the mind of an honor· student, the physique of a Hercules, the leadership and. craft of a Napoleon, and the natural ability. of Frank. Carideo-there is no other with whom to compare him. 
U11iversitJ' of N ot1·e Dame 
:MARTY BRILL 
Rigbt Half 
All-\Vcster1t 

"German" in the land of the Quakers means "Pennsylvania Dutch," and that in turn means dete~mination and persistence. Marty Brill is a German from Pennsylvania a~d ·everything else still holds . 
.In 1925, as a youngster, he finished a brilliant career as a hal(-back at Penn Charter prep and went to the University of Pennsylvania. where all good Philadelphians go. He spent a year with the freshmen and went out for varsity ball. He was not exactly an overnight success and, in fact 1vas relegated to the ~econd string. One day he dropped the hint ·to his father that possibly he ought to be on the first team. His father talked with the coaches . . . just long enough to tell them that Marty would make good with the best' team in the country. 
It was a dramatic gesture and what might be called a whale of a long shot. In 1928, though, Marty was again playing freshman ball, this time with some 300 Notre Dame aspirants. Then in 1929 the gesture became more than a g~sture. Marty made good! Now it has developed that he not only made good with the best team in the country, but with the two best teams in the country. For two years running Notre Dame wo~ the riational championship and during 'those same two years young Martin Brill was an integral part of two of the greatest teams Notre Dame has ever. seen. . 
He had an indomitable spirit, the greatest evidence of which was given when_, after receiving a nerve injury in the Drake game which kept him awake for long agonizing hours and caused him to lose 10 pounds in a week, he went into the last three games of the season to give everything he had. 



MARCHMONT SCH\VARTZ 
Left Half All-American 

The Southern gentleman who teamed with Carideo of New York, Brill of Pennsylvania, Savoldi of Michigan, and Mullins of California to make Notre Dame's 1930 backfield a really cosmopolitan one, was Marchmont Schwar~z, of Bay St. Louis, Miss., whose all-around plain and fancy ability to play the great game of football made him an All-American in his second year of competitio1_1. 
lvfarchy, who is immortalizing the name of a race horse-just a second­rate plug, by the way, with a distinctive name-was to the fellows on the campus just another-quiet, refined, soft,.spoken Southern Raleigh, unobtrusive, astonishingly modest. Once in a football game, though, l}e went crazy! He hit the line, blocked, and tackled with a fierceness and abandon seldom seen in a star mainly publicized beca.use of his ability to trip lightly through an open field and to throw accurate passes over your own distance up to 50 yards. He was vicious, alniost savage.. He lived football. He played every minute of every game for all it was worth, relentlessly, giving all he had and taking everything the opposition had to offer. · 
The Rockne offense is built around ·a heady quarter-back, a smashing full-back, a blocking right half, and a swift, tricky left end. Schwartz had everything that Jimmy Crowley,·Christy Flanagan, Johnny Neimic, Jack Elder and any number of other famous Rockne left half-backs had. 
\Vhen Rockne ordered passes, Schwartz was there to put them unerringly where the moving. target should. be. If a pass was incomplete, it was invari­ably the fault of the receiver. \Vhen Rockne wanted a running attack, a word to Carideo was enough-Schwartz always came through. 
l-Ie lives football, but not to such an extent that he did not find time during the past season to make himself an honor student. He has that way of going whole-heartedly into everything he likes; he merely ignores things that he dislikes or things that do not interest hirri and they never bother him.. To millions of people last fall, all that mattered w:is that he liked football. He will continue to show his yen for the pigskin next year when he startles the football world further with his brilliant exploits.

Official Football Review-1930 
LARRY MULLINS 
Full-bac/{ 

"They're lining up for the kick-off. Notre Dame is leading, 13 to. 0, and they're starting the second half now. Rockne has sent Mullins in at full-back with the varsity." Then, a play later: "There goes a substitute. It's O'Connor~ Mullins is coming out. I wonder what Rockne was thinking of." It was a radio broadcast of the Southern California game in Los Angeles. 
And Rockne was thinking of a gallant, rough and ready lad, who with a chance to save himself and star before a rabid 90,QOO crowd of his home town fans who wanted to see him play, ·had given ·his all the week before in the cold, mud, and icc of Soldier (Field so that Notre Dame might win ·in its traditional game with Army. Half-crazy with pain from a knee which had been injured and injured again for two years, Larry Mullins had stuck it out against Army to keep his team in the ball game until fate might decree victory. \Vith thousands waiting to hail him, with writers waiting to' scream his praises from eight-column streamers, he had put his last ounce of courage, his last bit of energy into as gallant a game of football as has ever been seen. 
His one minute of play a-gainst the one team he wanted to play against closed his Notre Dame career. He had been battered so badly that he scarcely could walk to his position for that one pathetic gesture which spoke volumes. There was none of the "I'm-doing-my-best-but-it's-killing-~e" attitude about Larry. Not even his team-mates knew the pain he was in when he climaxed his glorious career in the Army game._ Doctors were astounded after the game that he had been able to stay in at all. 
Now he has gone, not with any especially dazzling record of performances left behind him, but with the respect and admiration of the thousands who knew him as -a real "Fighting Irishman." 
BERT METZGER 
Rigbt Guard Ali-Americau 

One hundred and fifty-three pounds of, dynamite was little Bert Metzger, the lightest All-American guard in history. He came to Notre Dame four years ago and went out for freshman football. The -:oaches ,told him he was too small and he was dropped_ from the squad. But he went to Rockne himself and told him, "I may be small, but I can fight and I want at least a chance out there." 
So he was given his opportunity and he went up to the varsity squad his second year as a third or fourth string man. In 1929, his colorful playing had won him a place under Capt. John La.w with the shock-troops ... Even smaller than Law, one of Rockne's most famous "watch-charm" guards," Bert went to the varsity at the ·beginning of the-past season. His ability was recognized, but it was thought that his small, slight build would be crushed to pieces before mid-seaon. 
Instead, Bert outplayed some of the outstanding linemen of the country, older, heavier, more experienced men who had won great reputations._ Almost every team Notre Dame met sent its crashing full-backs over the center of the line in an effort to wear out this dynamic little warrior, and all of them failed. After playing to a standstill All-American \Y/oodworth ._of Northwestern, Metzger showed Capt. Humber of Army.how to play guard, and went on to close his career in a blaze of glory against Baker of Southern California, another prominent mythical team chbice. 
He had a fighting heart and didn't know the meaning of pain. Accountable for _his great success was his quick, clear head and versatiliy which enabled him time and again to outsmart first-rate linemen who weighed well over the 200-pound mark. He, too, has finished his time at Notre Dame, but his name will go down · with the Clipper Smiths, the Cannons, and the Laws as perhaps tlr1 greatest product of that great school of "watch-charms." 
-·~1 24r:fo-~ 



_U11ive1·sity of Not1·e Dan.ze 
TOM KASSIS 
Left Guard 

Probably better known·· to ·the folk of Casper, \Vyo., as a rather impressive Casper high school center, Tom Kassis finished a brilliant career as a left guard at Notre Dame with the close of the past season. 
Playing center his sophomore year under two such bulwarks of offense and defense as Tim Moynihan and Joe Nash, Tom didn't get very far, but 1929 found a comparative ~hortage of guards and Rockne realized tha.t the talents of this aggressive 185-pound prospect should not be wasted with the third or fourth team. Ka~sis adjusted himself to the change from center to guard with remarkable swiftness and in the opening game with Indiana that year, he drew his first attention when he made three or four spectacular tackles behind the line of scrimmage. In spite of a chronic sprained ankle that season, Tom stuck it out under Jack Cannon and he was graduated to the varsity last season after proving himself one of the smartest defensive men in the game and as good a blocker as Notre Dame has ever seen. 
Again, his path was beset with injuries, but he shook them off doggedly and turned in the same brilliant brand of play that had characterized those who had made football history before him. The usual thing with him was to be taken off the field one week in intense pain, almost given up for lost, rested for a week, and. sent back into the next game heavily taped but as effective as ever. ·In· the Southern Methodist game a gash, four or five inches long, was torn above his eye when he collided head-on with an opponent, and, even though the cut required three stitches to mend, he had to be literally dragged off the field before he would 
· leave the game. Such spirit as his was bound to have its reward, and, while he was overlooked by the star-hunting mythical team pickers, we give you Rockne's word that Tom Kassis was one of the smartest, .. fightingest," best all-around guards that ever dug his cleats into the sod of Car.tier field. 
·TOMMY YARR 
Center 

In 1929, playing with the third string against North­western, as an understudy to Big Tim Moynihan and Joe Nash, Tommy Yarr made one bad pass-he let fly with a 20-yard snap tha.t later enabled Northwestern to score, its only touchdown. of the day. Since it was the \Vildcats' only score of an afternoon which saw Notre Dame roll up 26 points, the· pass got publicity which it seemed could never be lived down. 
Big Tim and Joe went their way in June and Tommy was all that Rockne had left so he went to the varsity. Many were dubious. They said it would be better to take a chance with a Sophomore. 
But seldom does Rockne misjudge .a player, or anyone else for that matter, and he knew thit Tommy Yarr had the stuff that makes for grea.tness. Y arr's great play in the season just past more than justified the responsibility Rockne placed upon his broad shoulders. 
In many a game, Notre Dame was pressed deep into its own territory and Carideo had to kick from behind his own goal line, but did Yarr falter and get off to a bad pass? Did he on any occasion miss a signal and pass the ball to the wrong back or did he ever fail to have just the right speed and direction on the ball? Not to our knowledge. · He made an unusual number of tackles on punts after slipping a well-placed spiral into the outstretched hands of Carideo. Perhaps his most noticeable talent was that of intercepting passes, and, in his first game with the varsity, he made three interceptions when a completed pass would have meant a tic or defeat. 
\Vith another year to go, Tommy should add further glory to an already illustrious record.

0/ficia_l Football Review-1930 
JOE SAVOLDI Fu/1-bac/{ . 

One of the most brilliant and colorful stars in . Notre Dame football history, an offensive power house, and. a defensive wall personified, passed out of Notre Dame football history with the close of the 1930 season. ·· 
His name i~ Joe Savoldi and he came to Notre Dame from Three Oaks, Mich., unknown, unheralded. He was boni. in a small town ncar Milan, Italy, and came to America with his mother and father at the age of· 13. . Ht: had played the games the Italian child:en played when he was in grade school, but football was all new to htm.' At Three Oaks high school, he went out with the rest of the boys and played, untutored. but willing, and developed into a smashing, 
devastating full-back. \Vhen he came to Notre Dame in 1927, Freshman coaches were amazed at his splendid physique-some 200 ·pounds of muscle-and his grca t speed. Hs lack of high school coaching was, however, no small obstacle to him. His natural ability was recognized, but when he 'went out for varsity ball his second year, he was relegated to the reserves. To learn the intricacies of the complicated Rockne offense and the maze of assignments to be remembered on defense against the best teams of the nation in one season was more than could_ be expected of any man. · In 1929, though, Joe came into his own with his bruising rushes · through the line and his brilliant open field running. In the se~son. just closed, he covered himself with glory from the first game agamst Southern Methodist when he countered the Mustangs' first touchdown· with a. 97-yard return of the ensuing kickoff. Against Na.vy, he scored three times. . It was that way in every game in which he played. He did not a.lwa.ys score, but never did he fa.il. to get a.wa.y for great gains and 
never was a. pass completed in his territory. 
The story of how Joe Savoldi came to Notre Dame from no:vherc, without anything, and made himself the most feared back of h!s two years with the_ varsity, is one that will be told and retold m the 
years to come. 

AL CULVER . Left Taclde If Al Culver has any fault, it is that of being too methodicaL The words 
:fiery, colorful, brilliant, a.nd outstanding do not apply to him; the newspapers never carried a line about his great fighting heart and he never said a word himself concerning .the fact that he was a Notre Dame varsity football player. 
Both at practices and in games, he merely lined up with the rest of the team, shifted the right wa.y, seemed to walk through the opposing line, made his tackle if he were anywhere near the play, rather if the play were anywher.:! ne~r him, and then got up and walked back to his position to wait for the next play. On offense, he was much the same; he did his blocking exactly, cleanly, 
· decisively, never missed a play, never missed his man. 
In 1929 he had played with the shock troops and had gone· through an entire season with scarcely a bit of mention, but he didn't seem to mind. Last season, he was again slated for the second team, but Frank Leahy was ·hurt and he went to the varsity; again, it didn't seem to make much difference to him. 
Alwa.ys there was an air of mystery about him, the mystery of silence. To those who knew him, though, this silence was easily explainable. He simply had the ability to mask his emotions, to cover up with apparent placidity the surging of his great competitive spirit, a. spirit that carried him through the most rigorous campaign in football history with perhaps the greatest team in history. 
His play speaks for itself. He stopped everything sent his way by ten first­·class opponents, he opened wide holes for the backs, and his sturdy 210 pounds withstood every shock of ten gruelling games without showing the least out­ward-evidence. 
Behind his mask of silence, his intimates knew there was a friendly, serious man; and coaches knew that in AI Culver they had perhaps the most dependable man. on the squad. What won't he do, we ask, in his one remaining year of competition? 



U1Zive1·sit)' of Notre Dame 
ED KOSKY 
·Left Bud 

Quiet, friendly, and serene, Ed Kosky would never strike anyone as being a football player, especially a Notre Dame varsity football player, but it's no secret that when he got into a game he was an entirely dif­ferent person, that he was transformed into· a fighting, determined, dog·ged tackler and blocker. 
Before the season just closed, Ed had spent a year with the reserves where it was thought he would stay the rest of his time· a.t Notre Dame.· His play was not especially brilliant and there was nothing about him that would cause the casual observer .to stop and single him ·out of a group of some 15 or 20 other ends dashing up and down the field pick­ing off passes. \Xfhcn John Col~ick and Ed. Collins were graduated last June, though, Rockne looked about and it took his trained eye less time than it takes Floyd Gibbons to say ..Jack Robinson" to light on Kosky's tall figure. 
Playing with the varsity during the past campaign, Kosky proved 
himself to be a clever pass receiver, a deadly tackler and blocker, ami, 
strange as it may seem for an end, a capable ball-lugger. Rockne de­
veloped an end-around play on which the left end takes the ball from 
the left half ori a spinner ·and cuts through outside the right tackle. It .was on this formation that Ed earned his reputation as ball-carrier. 
Since he has two more years of competition, Kosky should, by all that is logical, develop into one of Notre Dame's greatest stars. 



DICK DONOGHUE 
Rigbi Taclde 

Oppressed. from the very beginning of the season by an· injury jinx, .. Big Dick" Donoghue nevertheless carried ori with a dogged spirit which won him the respect of all with whom he came in contact.· 
He was alternate varsity right ta~klc with Frank Leahy during the 1929 season, but the graduation of Ted Twomey left a hole at left tackle to be filled and Frank Leahy was moved to this position. It seemed that Dick had finally come into the right that was his because of two years of splendid line play. · 
He went in with the varsity in the opening game with Southern 
· Methodist, but, before the game was through the third quarter, he was carried. from the field with what was at first thought to be a sprained ankle. No swelling set in and doctors were puzzled at first about his hurt; subsequent examination, however, showed that he had received a torturing injury to the joint in his ankle, peculiar in that there was !10 outward evidence of tl~e harm done. 
It was weeks before he was able to rejoin the squad and~ when he did, he was siowcd up by the injury so much that he was never able to regain his place with the first string. On the occasions when he did play, he gave excellent account of his ideal physique and his two years' previous experience. He was aggressive and exceptionally fast 
for a 200-odd pound man, and he knew all there was to know about his position. 
He has finish~d his career at Notre Dame and, although his name docs not appear with those of the great, he will always be remembered as one good tackle and a man who gave all he had for his school.

Official Football Review-1930 

JOE KURTH 
Right Tackle 

One of the problems confronting Coach Rockne at the beginning of the season was that of finding an experienced man for the position of left tackle. Inasmuch as two· veterans who had battled throughout the 1929 season for the call at right tackle, Dick Donoghue and Frank Leahy, were still on the squad, the natural solution of the tackle problem seemed to be to shift one of these two to the other side of the line. Leahy was thus shifted, and the tackle posts were in the hands of experienced workmen. 
This arrangement was seriously interfered with when Donoghue, in the opening game, incurred the painful injury which was to slow up his play for the rest of the season. This left an unexpected gap in the line, and Rockne inserted Joe Kurth, a sophomore, into the opening. 
Kurth evidently realized tha.t favor.able first impressions are usually a good thing to make, for from the start he displayed a brand .of football that was highly satisfactory. The feature of his Notre Dame debut was his vicious tackle of Mason, Southern Methodist star. Even old timers, such as ucap" Edwards, said that this t~ckle was one of the hardest th7y had ever seen. 
\'{!hile Kurth's lack of experience naturally made him appear a bit unpolished in some departments of the game, he rapidly acquired tlie finer points which come only with active and strenuous competition. Rockne noticed some mistakes in his playing, but said that the former East Madison star never made the same-mistake twice. The combination of his newly-acquired experience_ with his natural ability and great physique made him an ideal occupant of the right tackle post, and he . held this position for the rest of the season. They have already bugun to COfl"!.pare the 197-pound Wisconsin lad with Ted Twomey, 1929 ace, and the ((little Brute" still has two~years of competition! 
MIKE KOKEN 
Left ·Half 

Koken was the smallest of the candidates for the left half-back position, .but his superior speed kept him very much in the running at all times. 
Built along almost identical proportions as Jack Elder, the scrappy Youngs­
town ball-carrier resembled the Kentucky flash in more ways than one. In 
addition to their mutual fleetness, Mike also possessed a good share of Elder's 
skill as a passer. 
I 

Mike performed with regularity during the season as a member of. the shock-troops. His presence on the field always was a. threat ~o the opposition, for his size and speed made him unusually elusive. Koken is one oCthose players who are guided largely by football instinct, and many of his ball­carrying activities are almost second-nature to him. 
Koken's best performances were against Pittsburgh ana Pennsylvania. In the Pitt game, he crashed over from· the five-yard line for a touchdown, while by, means of a sligh~ly longer goal ward dash he gained six of the sixty points scored against Penn. The Ohio boy also gave a good account of himself in the Drake encounter. . · . 
The fact that Koke,n is .smali does not detract from the ·fact tha.t he is also tough.. His defensive play was featured by his hard-hitting bullet-like, tackling. Along with the other shock-troop backs, he took considerable puni~hment but was never injured. Mike is another of the boys who have two more years to fight for the Blue and Gold, and should accomplish big things before his career. is ended.

PAUL O'CONNOR 
Right Half-:back 

The supreme test for any athlete is to come through when the competition is really crucial. Paul· (Bucky) O'Connor closed his grid career by meeting the .most crucial of tests in a. manner that brought glory to himself and to his university. 
\'V'hen the team was enroute to Los Angeles for the all-important Southern Calfornia game, it became evident that an injury would prevent Larry Mullins from carrying on in the full-back position. Accordingly, in the two-day stopover in Tucson, Coach Rockne deci~ed to convert Bucky into a full-back. In the two days tha.t followed, O'Connor had to forget the signals and the shift which had become almost mechanical to him as a right half-back, and he had to learn the intricacies of the full-back position. 
· In addition to the extreme difficulties which came up in handling his new post, Bucky was under ·a severe mental strain. It is glorious football history, however, how he carried on for Mullins, his bosom friend, in the titanic grid epic and emerged as the star of the game. His brilliant 80-yard run gave the Irish their second. touchdown of the· day, arid again in the third period he crossed the Trojan goal after taking a lateral pass and running 7 yards. 
Previous to his big day on the coast, Bucky had served three faithful years on the shock troops, and he was an ideal understudy to Marty Brill. One of the fastest men on the squad, he gave one of the best exhibitions of this speed against Penn when he galloped 60 yards for a touchdown. 
O'Connor's name would. have lived at Notre Dame as a steady, dependable, and thoroughly capable athlete even without his sensa­tional "swan song." As it was, the final burst of brilliance merely clinched his claim to stardom. 



FRANK LEAHY 
Left Taclde 

The story of Frank Leahy's football career at Notre Dame is the story of a great struggle against handicaps that in the end proved to be over­whelming. Before the 1929 season opened he suffered a shoulder injury that forced him out of action for part of the year and slowed him up for the rest of the. season. He ·resumed play before this injury was entirely healed, only to suffer a severely sprained ankle. Despite these discourag­ing setbacks, the end of the season found the good-natured Dakota Irish­man ~ack in his regular post playing his usual high-grade brand of ball. 
Leahy returned last September and was slated for ·a regular job on the varsity. For once in his career he was free from injuries, and in the prac­tic~s before the Southern Methodist battle he di$played great. form. \'V'hen it seemed that at last he was to have an opportunity to shake misfortune and shpw his true ability, another of life's little tragedies befell him. In making a long, diving tackle over the prostrate forms of two of his var­sity mates, Leahy injured a membrane on his leg, the ailment known as ''periostitis" set in, and he took another involuntary vacation: 
He rejoined the squad during the week-before the Drake game and during the next two weeks made a last, pathetic effort to thwart the adverse odds. This attempt was marked by the same dogged courage which kept him in the game last year, but this time Frank was forced to admit defeat. Use of his injured leg caused a recurrence of his.trouble, and brought to a close the career of one of Notre Dame's "fightingest" and most unlucky stars. ·

DAN HANLEY 
Full-bacl?. 

The Drake game has come to have a somewhat symboli­cal significance on, the Irish schedule, as new stars have a way ot appearing in the games against the Iowa· outfit. Jack Elder and Larry (Moon) Mullins both attracted no­tice for the first time in Drake games, while in the most recent game of the series Da~. Hanley served notice upon the sporting world that he is a star in the making. 
Midway in the season it became apparent that Rockne was going to need an extra full-back for the four hard games remaining. He put Hanley into the Drake game and the "Butte Beauty" soon made a flashy 20-yard run; after it had been called b:ick and a penalty inflicted, he scooted 32 yards fo~ the first score of the game. In ~he closing minutes, he took the oval for an SO-yard nde after several shorter. gains. 
The Montana flash showed the same high-powered, l~ard-:drivng tactics when he relieved Mullins and O'Connor in the Northwestern, Army, and Southern California games. He crashed over for Notre Dame's second touchdown against the Purple. His chief asset is his tremendous power which enables him to keep his feet when apparently downed. He carries pis 195. poun-ds with the speed of a half-back and his defensive work is up to all the standards of his brilliant offensive performance.:;. 
Barring the unforeseen,, he will star with the varsity next year and in 1932. ­
CLARENCE KAPLAN 
Right Half 

A great little ball player who would have been a regular and a star on almost any other team in the country-that's Clarence (Kap) Kaplan. This fleet­footed Minnesota prospect had a world of talent but was somewhat a victim of the circumstances at Notre Dame. "The circumstances" were that in Marty Brill and ~'Bucky" O'Connor, Coach Rockne had two high-powered right halfs whose strength and ability simply were not to be denied. Furthermore, Kap's 155 pounds were not quite enough to carry the heavy burden which is placed upon "the right half in the Notre Dame system. 
In spite of these handicaps, Kaplan demonstrated beyond any doubt that his speed and skill entitled him to play a leading role in the Notre Dame attack. In his sophomore year, he saw plenty of action and distinguished hims~f against Indiana, \'\Tisconsin, and Southern California. In the. closing moments of the latter game, he knocked down a pass that otherwise might have ·brouglu victory to the lads from the West coast. ' ~ ~ · 
During the past season, Kap's best game was against the Navy. In two con­secutive plays the Minnesota flash carried the ball a total of 71 yards and put his mates in position to score. He also won the favorable conin1ent of Coach "Pop" \'{!arner of Stanford for his brilliant play against U; S. C. 
All in all, Mr. Kaplan's career has been one of splendid achievement made against odds. Long will· the memory of his deer-like dashes through, around, and away from larger, ·more publici~ed defenders be remembered at Notre Dame.

JOHN O'BRIEN · Left Eud 

The play which made .Johnny O'Brien famous, the one in which he caught a pass to score the winning touchdown against Army in 1928, proved later to be a handicap to him. After that, whenever the smiling Californian was put into the game the fans remembered his immortal feat and expected him to duplicate its brilliance. In always looking for the spectacular in his work, they often over­looked the quiet, capable football he played. 
O'Brien's greatest asset, of course, was his speed. Captain of the track team and a championship hurdler, Johnny used. his agility to advantage on the chalk­lined turf equally as well as he did on the cinders. Primarily he was an offensive threat, partly because of this speed and partly because it was second nature for him to grab passes. 
That he also had more than average defensive ability was shown chiefly in the 1930 campaign. In almost every game in which he played, Johnny broke through, and threw opposing ball carriers for telling losses. He turned in an especially tight defensive exhibition in the Northwestern struggle. 
\Vhen an athlete achieves undying fame in one sport and earns a captainship in another, there's only one answer-such success is the result of extraordinary ability. O'Brien will be remembered at Notre Dame, not as a (tone-play" or even (tone-sport" athlete, but as one of the best all-around athletes .to wear the Blue and Gold in· recent years. 



FRANK BUTLER 
Ceuter 

\Vhen Coach Rockne began lookipg around for a suc­cessor to Tim Moynihan, the figure of Frank Bu.tler loomed up~ From the standpoint of size, Butler's six feet two inches and 202 pounds made him the outstanding candidate. Moreover, the former Tilden Tech star proved that he did not fall into the category of -linemen who are merely big. 
Buder played the bruising type of football which is so 
devastating to the center of an opposing line. He used his 
natural power and drive to advantage, and handled his 
size remarkably well. Gifted with a huge pair of hands, . he learned to wield them to get the desired results. 
The Chicagoan was one of the hardest tacklers on the squad. In addition, he showed a well-developed ability to diagnosing plays and an ability to break them up once he had gauged them. On offense, his passing was con­sistently accurate. 
Butler gained much valuable experience during the sea­son, and will be a leading candidate in the battle to un­derstudy or to replace Y arr on the 19 31 aggregation. \Vith his natural advantages and the skill and experience which he has acquired, this powerful pivot man should dis­. tinguish himself in his two more seasons of competition.

JAMES HARRISS Left .Guard 


Although 1930 was Harriss' first year with the varsity squad, he proved himself a worthy understudy to Tom Kassis of the va.rsity and practically a certain starter with next year's first string at left guard. The vigorous and .heady play displayed by him in his inititation to ubig time" football, and the experi­ence he gained in games during the past season should place him in front next season. 
Although he was not flashy, he raised havoc among the oppo­sition, when given a chance, both with his terrific blocking on end runs and his-ability to smash through on defense to nip plays in ~he bud. Seldom was he taken out of a play and this fact may be laid to his bull-dog spirit and aggressive charging .. 
His 185 pounds cemented a forward ·wall that was impreg-:­nable before the rushes of such ·stars as uBull" Karcis of Carnegie Tech, Hood of Pitt, Brubaker of Indiana., and Van Koten of Drake, to mention only a few. The phrase, uunusually fast for his weight" has. been used over and over until ·it has lost much of its original force, but ·it applies more to no one, perhaps than to this p,udgy lad. To appreciate this, one has. only to see him pull out of his position and knock an end flying before a ten­second back-field has had time to reach the line of scrimmage. 
A monogram in one's. sophomore' year is a rare distinction in­deed and it usually indicates thatits proud owner will go places in his _remaining two years of competition. 
GEORGE VLK 
Right E11d 

\W'hen a coach has one experienced, fighting right end he is well satis­fied; when he has a substitute for that position who possesses sufficient' ability to make the squad two consecutive years, his satisfaction ap­proaches elation. George Vlk, although the term usul]stitute" harly applies, was this year's cause for Rockne's high spirits concerning the right end position. 
Vlk has all the qualities of an end demanded by Rockne. He has fight, necessarily, and an uncanny way of sensing the direction of the opposi­tions' onslaughts, which enables him to be at the point of attack in time to smash the play. His prowess on defense is accepted by those who have witnessed him time a.nd again turri end runs in, or break through the interference and throw the runner. •On offense he is tireless in blocking out tackles and racing down the field after punts. Every minute he plays is characterized by intense fighting that serves to demoralize the spirit of the opposition, and it is his stamina. to withstand the smashes of opponents and yet fulfill his duties as an end that has placed and kept him in his position with the shock troops. 
. An interesting feature of this year's race ·for the right end position wa.s ·that Vlk and Dick Mahoney, who also aspired for Tom Conley's place, both hail from Cleveland, Ohio, the former from Holy N arne, and the latter from Cathedral Latin. Their rivalry of high school days assumed a more friendly nature, naturally, in their struggle for a berth on the regular squad.

U1ziversity of ·Not1·e Dame 
ROBERT TERLAAK 
Right Guard 

Although Bob ·rerlaak is scarcely a guard of uwatch charm" proportions, since he weighs some 180 pounds, he nevertheless seems destined to carry on the traditions which the uwatch­charm" school of guards have.established at Notre Dame. Being Bert Metzger's understudy during the past season has given Terlaak an opportunity to observe one of the greatest of that group in action. 
'Terlaak was one of the most dependable men on the shock­troops. This was so largely because he was smarter than some of the other inexperienced men on the reserves. Terlaak could be relied upon to play alert, uheads-up" ball every minute of the time he was _on the field. 
His work was featured by the abundance of ufight" which he injected into it. He had the power and the drive so neces­sary for every good guard, and with these qualities he com­bined a scrappiness which made him an· extremely stubborn man for opponents to handle. 
The Cleveland product is another of the men who played their first season on the team this year. If he fulfills the promise which his work has aroused, he will be an unusually valuable lineman and an important cog in the ·next two Rockne machines. 



CHARLES JASK\X'HICH 
Quarter-back 

Although Charlie Jaskwhich had had no previous varsity _experience, Coach Rockne used him with regularity from the beginning of the season. By so doing, uRock" expressed not only his confidence in Jaskwhich's present ability, but also faith in his possibilities for development as a quarter-back; Jaskwhich displayed talents which justified the opportunity which had -been given him. 
The Kenosha boy kept the Blue and Gold machine functioning smoothly at all times when he was its pilot, and contributed a. brand of individual play which did much to help along he cause. His judgment was sound, and -his decisions were generally confirmed by favorable results. · 
H JaskF"hich excelled at any one phrase of the game, that department was probably punting. He did a good share of all the punting which was done during the season, and during that time got only one or two poor kicks. On several occasions he came through with punts of remarkable yardage, and he .could be depended upon to send the ball a good averge distance down the field. 
Jaskwhich's greatest handicap appeare-d to-be a lack of self-confidence. He lacked the assurance which marks the difference between stardom and medioc­rity. This failing, however, comes entirely from inexperience and sho1-1ld be overcome in the two more seasnns that remain for the \X'isconsin lad. The best part of-his career is yet to come..

FRANK HOFFMAN 
Left '[ackle 


Football fiction contains ·many a story about the lad who had 
never played football in high school and who made good in a big . way when he went out for the college team. Such is sometimes the case in real life, but it is seldom if ever that it occurs when the team in question has the high ranking that Notre Dame has. Frank (Nordy) Hoffman, however, is emulating the hero in the story­
books, and, what is more, is doing it at Notre Dame. 
\Vhen Hoffman went to high school out in Seattle, he never went in for the gridiron pastime; Corning to Notre Dame, how­eve!', he followed the line of least resistance and reported for the team. \Vhen the coaches got a look at Nerdy's build (weight: 198; height: six feet, two inches) it is easy to understand why ·they gave him plenty of encoura.gernent in his new venture. 
Hoffman spent the 1929 season familiarizing himself with the game, and acquiring as much experience as possible. Then when last season started, Rockne gave him a chance in the varsity games and Nordy carne through in great shape. Big and aggressive, he was naturally :fitted for the game. From week to week, as the little crudities in his play w.ere smoothed out by experience, Hoffman acquired ~ finesse that added greatly to his style of play.. 
\Vith this added season. of experience, Hoffman is· now all' set to accomplish really big things in the one remaining year of com­petition which he has. And when he does, the old .crack about truth being stranger than :fic"tion will ha.ve held true in regard to football. 
BERNARD LEAHY 
Left Half 

One thing kept Bernie Leahy from being· a great star at Notre Dame. He had everything a half-back needed: triple-threat talent, courage, good physique, and a great football mind, and . still he. never quite carne through. The one fatal failing was a persistent over-anxiousness which he cou~d not shake. 
In practice sessions, Bernie was nothing short of brilliant.. He dis­played the highly developed sense of rhythm, the·,:finesse, and-the polish which set off the star from the average ball player. His was the super­technique of the All-American. He won the support of his coach and his team-mates. He had the enthusiastic backing of the students. Every­one wanted to see his talents crowned with success, but when under fire his old over-anxiousness returned to nullify his efforts. When he should have been cool and relaxed he was on edge and tightened up with the zeal to come through. 
. The season has closed. His career has ended with his genius unrealized arid unrewarded-but not unappreciated,: for all true followers of the team have hailed him as one of the greatest halfs in Notre Dame history.

ALHOWARD 
Full-back 

Al Howard is another of California's contributions to Notre Dame athletics. Like Larry Mullins, another member of the California colony, Howard went out for full-back upon his arrival at Notre Dame, and won his monogram at that position. The Alhambra boy was also like Mullins in that both won monograms the first year that they sa~ varsity service. 
Never a flashy full-back, Howard played a steady, well-balanced game. He appeared in four of the games in the 1929 campaign and distinguished himself by his determination and scrappiness. AI proved himself to be a. hard-working athlete who could ·always be counted upon .to give everything he had to hk work. 
During the past season, Bowar~ suffered from the unusually. stiff competition ' which he had. In Mullins and Savoldi Coach Rockne had two of the most capable. full-backs in the country, while Hanley was close behind thc!TI. 
As a full-back, Howard was naturally handicapped by his lightness. He lacked the weight and power necessary for effective plunging.· This was some­what overbalanced by his dependable blocking, his hard tackling, and his defensive play against passe~. 
During the past season, Howard performed against· Southern Methodist, Indiana, Pittsburgh, Navy, and Carnegie Tech. He started· the game against the Annapolis lads, and looked his best in that contest. 



PAUL HOST 
Left Emf 

Although Host had had no varsity experience previous to the past season, his work then stamped him as one of the best all­around ends on the squad. The former LaCrosse High star proved himself to be proficient in every department of end-play. In addition, he seemed to be naturally fitted for the pos_ition which he elected to play. 
In the matter of foot-work, which is all-important to the end, Host is said to excel every flank-man that Notre Dame has had in recent yca.rs. Host used his feet in such a way that it was extremely difficult to block him out of a play. He was a master of the "floating" technique in end-play. 
Naturally a fast man, Host learned how to usc his s.peed to best advantage on pass and punt plays. In this connection, he developed into a valuable pass-receiver and became an offen­sive threat as well as a skilled defensive player. 
Host was a sure tackler, and was better than the average end in the matter of blocking. In addition, his work in leading ·inter­ference was highly efficient. On the whole, the \Visconsin prod­uct was one of the most consistent men on the squad. 
Host is one of the most promising prospect's which ..Rock" has to work with, and is especially so inasmuch as he has two more years of competition.. He will sec plenty of action next year.

JOHN ROGERS 
·Center 
Rogers was another of the second year men who saw considerable action during the season. When­ever called upon to handle the pivot position, Rogers came through with a smart, consistent exhibition of center-play. He is an Alexis, Illinois, product. 
Somewhat shorter. than the usual Notre Dame center, Rogers was heavy enough, weighing 170 pounds, but he was only five feet, eight inches in height. His size proved to be a handicap, for all of his competitors for the center position were much larger than he. · 
The Illinois lad was a master of the fundamentals of his position. His accurate passing left nothing to be desired in that department of his game, and he was well-versed in the art of blocking. His play was characterized by his alertness and aggressiveness, and his scrappiness made up for his smaller size. 
Defensive line-play presents special intricacies for the center, but Rogers handled himself well and proved himself to be a reliable defender of t~e post. 
In the battle for positions on the 1931 varsity, there will be a wide-open contest for the center job. Rogers, with a year of experience to his credit, ·will be a leading candidate for that position. He has two more years of eligibility. · 
ART McMANMON 
Rigbt T acMe 

\'V'hereas the average weight of the line candidates on the squad approximated 182 pounds, Art McManmon weighed 202 pounds. This, _ combined with the fact that he was 6 feet, 2 Yz inches in height, gave him a great natural advantage in his quest for a line job. His efforts were ·inspired by the record that his brother, one of the greatest of Notre Dame tackles, had made. But there was more to qualify Art for varsity service than merely his size and his athletic background. 
It is no mere figure of speech to say that McManmon w:as-·a tower of strength on the line. Time after time his work checked enemy ball­carriers at the line of scrimmage. His playing was featured by an agility and aggressiveness tha.t is so often lacking in men of his size. 
On the offense, the Massachusetts boy fitted in well with the team-play of his mates. His size and power were instrumental in op_ening many gaps through which long gains were made. 
The tackle strength of the squad last season was such that McManmon was not used as much as he naturally would have been. \'V'henever he was on the field handling the right tackle post, however, Art came through with the brand of football which has come to be associated with Notre Dame. 
Since most of McManmon' s work was performed on the .shock troops, he has battled more or less .. behind the scenes." All followers of the team, however, realize the worth of his efforts and set a deservedly high value upon his services.

CARL CRONIN 
Quarter-back 

To play the quarter-back position as Knute Rockne wants it to be played is one of the toughest tasks in football, but Carl Cronip. demonstrated early in the seas'on that he was capable of handling the assignment. The stubby 155-pound Chicagoan refused to allow his size to handicap him, and fought his way upward in. the ranks of the signal-callers until he had clinched the post on the shock-troops. 
His play during the season was distinguished by a smartness unusual even in quarter-backs. His judgment in calling plays was marked by strategy and a generous allotment of good football sense. · -· 
Cronin made his debut to big time football in the Northwestern game of 1929, and lost no time in uncovering one of his greatest talents-his skill as a punter. Several times in the closing minutes of the game when Notre Dame was deep in its own territory, Cronin coolly booted long spirals to put his tea~ out of danger. 
In eve~y g·ame in which he appeared during the past. season, Cronin exhibited this kicking ability. He is also an accurate drop-kicker, but is rarely given the opportunity to exercise this talent except to add points after touchdowns. Add to the capabilities already mentioned his dependabil­ity as a passer, and the picture of this brainy little field. general is complete. 



DICK MAHONEY 
Rigbt Bud 

Dick Mahoney, playing his first season on the team, wound up the year as understudy to Captain Conley him­self. Few of the capable group of sophomores, whose work was a feature of the past season, showed more promise than did this former Cathedral Latin star. His career has had a fine beginning,. and with two more years of competition he should be able to establish himself as one of the best ends in Notre Dame history. 
Rather than being especially flashy or spectacular, Mahoney proved to be a workman of the steady, smooth­working, utterly reliable variety. His defensive play was practically fool-proof. His superior speed combined with his proficiency ·at snagging opposing backs, made him an ideal man to go down on punts. 
On the offense, his blocking was a contributing factor to more than one long gain during the season. Moreover, he was always a threat as a pass-receiver, his almost effort­less speed making him. hard to cover. 
The 175-pound Cleveland product also made himself useful· as a kicker. . \'{fhenever he was in the game and Carideo was on the sidelines, he took. care of the kick-off for the Blue and Gold. And, with an offensive aggrega­tion such as represented Notre Dame during the past season, .the kick-off play is used with unusual frequency and assumes more than ordinary importance; 
In short, as an end who does everything unusually well, Mahoney has a great opportunity to attain stardom during the next two seasons.

BILL PIERCE 
Rigbt Guard 

Winning one's way to ~he shock troops in the first year of competition is no small·accomplishment for a~y Notre Dame prospect, but class will not be denied and Bill Pierce established himself with the second string, playing urider Bert Metzger, by his steady showing in spring practice last spring~ 
At least ten good prospects were out for the same position and it took a lot of sifting to get the group aown to Pierce, Kerjes, and Terlaak, but these three stood out with little to choose be­tween them and all saw action in sever~l games. Which one of them will be graduated to the va.rsity next fall remains to be seen, but money placed on the head of Bill Pierce is compara­tively safe. 
He is built close to the ground and has a tremendous amount of leg-drive so necessary to a guard;· He is a quick thinker and he picked up the hundreds of details connected with guard play in a remarkably short time that he was with the. squad. Line Coach "Hunk" Anderson docs not' expect a sophomore to be perfect; all he asks, as does Rockne, is that a man not be fooled by the same trick twice. If he 'learns something every time he makes a misplay, he is bound to be .. up there" before he gets through. 
For this reason, we predict that Bill will take his place with famous N otrc Dame guards of the past bcfor.c he finishes his athletic career at Notre Dame in 1933. 
REGIS McNAMARA 
Left Tackle 

Competition is great at Notre Dame, and, in order to make good .with the varsity, a candidate must not only have the physical gifts necessary, but he must also show great natural ability, a powerful competitive spirit, and evidence of quick, clear thinking.. 
Regis McNamara showed all of these essential qualities his sophomore year and he won a coveted monogram. Last season, however, some spark that made his 1929 play great was lacking, and he was at least temporarily eclipsed by his more fortunate rivals at left .tackle. This is not an unusual occurance at any school with any team, and it is, in fact, quite common­place at Notre Dame. · 
That McNamara was not back with xhe shock troops during the 1930 season does not mean tha.t in his one remaining year of competition he will not stage the come-back that will again place him with the top-notchers. He has an ideal build for a tackle, he has competitive spirit, b;t;ains, courage, and a remarkable willingness to work. 
What it was that kept him in co.mparatiye oblivion;-if playing even· wi~h the third team can be called oblivion, no one knows. He does not know himself, but anyone who tries as hard as he did during the campaign just past and who has the natural gifts he possesses, cannot be. held.long from the 
.rewards that .arc due him. 

You can't keep a. good man down and fgr this reason we predict that McNamara will be back at the top of the heap, or very close to it, in 1931.

FRANK KERJES 
Right Guard 

frank Kerjes IS a 192-pound guard, ·not exactly of the watch­charm type, whose :rugged· strength and aggressiveness came in handy on more than one occasion during the past season. There was an abundance af good guard material on the squad and Frank found 'the competition too stiff for him to entertain hopes of win­ning a varsity berth. This can be understood readily, without dis­credit to him, when it is realized that he would have had to beat out dynamic, more experienced Bert Metzger to do so. 
Coach Rockne often used Kerjes as a. shock absorber with the varsity as well as with the second string. The plan of action was to start Kerjes and to depend on his charging to wear down the al­most unfailingly heavy man Bert Metzger would have to face. \Vhen Frank had worn the opposing bruiser down to approximately Metzger's size, Bert would step in and Frank would return to the bench and admire, satisfied that he had done his bit. Metzger was not delicate, but Rockne often shuddered to think what would happen to him and his 15 3 pounds if he were started against a blood-thirsty 200-pounder. 
Although h~ndicapped by a rib injury in 'the early part of th~ season, Kerjes showed a great spirit and, with a little more experi­ence, he may develop the offensive qualities necessary for a varsity position. · 

NORMAN GREENEY 
i 
Left Guard 


\Vhcn Tommy Mills, 1929 Freshman coach left to take up his duties as head coach at Georgetown, he said that he had just coached one of the greatest frosh teams he had ever seen, a team of potential stars whose ability and spirit would show in the future. 
How true his prophecy was is shown by. the rise of two sopho­mores, Kurth and Hanley, to the varsity, and .·the rise of eight second-year men to the shock troops. Not the least brilliant of Tommy's prospective stars was Norman Greeney. whose rugged guard play put him with the second string from the start, under­studying Tom Kassis.• 
. Norm, with a little more experience, will make an ideal varsity man because he has every quality essential to his particular phase of play. Coupled with his natural ability was the faculty for learning something every day and for improving with each prac­tice. It might be said that the player who doesn't improve every day under 'Rockne is hopeless, but Greeney's period of moulding, grinding, and polishing was so short and was characterized by such great strides of progress that it is not an exaggeration to say that he showed more thap ordinary promise. . 
Barring accidents and other unforeseen hindrances, he should emblazon his name in his next two years of competition on the roster of great Notre Dame stars. He has everything cls~all he needs is time.

'TIS often said that an army moves on its stomach. 
If that is true then it is also true that Notre 
· , Dame's fooball team moves on its uHam­burgers;" The occasional visitor will look around awed and astounded when Rock calls for the uHamburgers.'' · To the seasoned watcher at the daily practice sessions it means o~ly the _appearance of a band of white-shirted re­serves about to do their bit in getting the varsity in shape for the forthcoming battle. 
The uHamburgers," as Rockne has so ignominiously classed them, are coached in the system and plays of the Notre Dame opponents, and they execute these plays against the varsity elevens with all the earmarks of an hon­est-to-goodness Army, Pitt, Southern Cal., or whatever other team they might be repres_enting that week. 
And then when the week's work is done, these uHam­burgers" doff their white jerseys for the traditional blue and trek to some foreign point where they meet other gridiron foes. Although tired out from the past week's hard grind, they put forth every ounce of strength that is in them. · 
Seven victories out of eight contests is the 1930 record. That is something to be proud of and the lowly uHam­burgers" have d~ne up their own individual season very well. · 
Thes~ reserve or ccB" teams again won every game played with a complete squad. For three consecutive years whenever the entire reserve team has played as a unit the outcome has been in their favor. The only defeat this year came when the squad was split into two sections. One beat Northwestern but the other lost a heartbreaker to Wisconsin. 
The season opened with a game which resembled a track meet more than a football contest, and the uB" team walked away with the City College of Detroit eleven, 53 to 0, Oct. 4 at Roosevelt Stadium in Detroit. Dyna­mite Dan Hanley, who later went to 'the varsity, carried the oval across the goal line three times during the course of the afternoon. Staab made two touchdowns and Dill~ ing, Banas, and . Bice, one apiece. Notre Dame received the kick-off and with two plays had scored a touchdown. 

The play ~as called back, however, and Notre Dame: was penalized. Two more plays and the reserves again carried 
the ball across for a touchdown. 
On Oct. 18, a thousand Pittsburgh fans discovered that Notre Dame could play night football wit}:t the same skill and accuracy that her sons display on cold .and bleak Saturday afternoons. Under the blinding floodlights of Forbes field, the uB" team eked out a win over the Du­quesne university _freshmen, 13-7. After a. thrilling first half, featured by a punting duel between Banas of Notre Dame and DeCoster of Duquesne, the victors finally ran the ball across for six points. Kramer, full-back, we.nt 3 0 yards on a cut-back off tackle for the score. 
.The next Saturday, Oct. 25, the reserves divided into two groups. One team, playing the Northwestern reserves as a preliminary to the Northwestern-Centre game. that day, wound up in a close 7-6 victory.· The other lost to \Visconsin uB" team, 26 to 19 after holding an early lead of 13 points. 
In the game with Northwestern the -reserves were con­tent to play defensive ball for the most part inasmuch as the varsity was to play the Wildcats several weeks later. Brancheau scored the only Fighting Irish tally on a pass from Conley, Foley kicking the extra point~ :North­western got their tally in the third quarter after re­covering a. Notre Dame fumble deep in Irish te_rritory. 
In the tilt with the Badgers, Notre Dame got away to an early lead by scoring 13 points within the first three minutes of play;--On the kick-off Capter, playing full­back for Notre Dame, took the ball on the run and dashed 90 yards for the first score. Shortly after Banas went across fgr-the second touchdown with Christman kicking . for the extra point. In the second quarter Banas repeated his scoring act v.;ith an off-tackle play but the Madison team scored on a pass and two off-tackle plays in the sec-: ond period, and at the end of the first half the score was tied at 19-19. Bullock, the bulwar~ of the Badgers' offense, crashed over from the three-yard l_ine for the score which in the end meant victory for his team-mates. 
Another night game on Oct. 31, at Kankakee, Illinois, resulted in ·a .ru~-away for the reserves, the uB" team 

U11ive1·sity of Not1·e Dame 
trampling the St. Viator college eleven 25-7. A second group went to Bloomington, Ind., where the .Indiana re­serves were met at the same time the respective varsities were combating in the Notre Dame stadium. Again the Blue and Gold were victorious, this time a decisive 20 to 0 score. A 3 5-yard pass, Conley to Bice, counted for Notre Dame in the second period and a display of splendid run­ning plays accounted for two more tallies late in the third quarter. Dilling made both of the latter touchdowns, on off-tackle smashes, the first for 15 yards and the sec­ond on a run of 46 yards. 
Although they weren't as·charitable as they might have been in the real sense of ·the word, the reserves trounced the Michigan State Normal freshmen at Grand Rapids, Mich., Nov. 8. Five thousand fans jammed Ramona park stadium and contributed to the support of the Carl A. Johnson post of the American Legion. Long runs fea­tured this 32 to 0 victory for the Fighting Irish, Abbate­marco getting loose around left end and running behind perfect interference, 45 yards for the first marker a few minutes after the game started. Nick Lukats slipped through right tackle a bit later and raced 60 yards for ·the second . tally. The other three touchdowns came in the final quart~r of the contest. One was the result of a long pass from Vejar to Bice and Lukats counted another on a short plunge. Kozak scored the last by intercepting a Michigan State pass and carrying two men with him while he bored his way eight yards to the goal. 
Two weeks ~crest" and then to the South. Comparative rest, for they did .not engage in outside competition dur­ing that time, but on Thanksgiving Day they made the Vanderbilt uB" team just too sick to eat their Turkey for they put a 58 to 0 crease in the year's record of the Southerners. The reserves ended their season in a blaze of glory, showing the Nashville folks the spectacular Notre Dame style of football. It was scheduled as a charity game but here again the· Fighting Irish were miserly in· allowing charity to their opponents of the day for· they ran the Vanderbilt team ragged during the first half and then finished up with a tremendous last half push which brought the score up to its large total. Perfect defense prevented the southerners from scoring. 
Whence came the pseudonym, uHamburgers," no . one seems to know. It is merely one of the characteristically striking inventions of Rockne's brain as far as we can learn. The reserves were originally known bY.-that hack­neyed title, uthe scrubs," but this would not do for long. During a period of evolution, the ~ub-varsity candidates were known by various other n~Ines, and the 19 3 0 name just happened to be uHamburgers."-· -.. 
In this connection, it is interesting, ff irrelevant, to .note that uRock" has several other words of no.,apparent origin or especial application which have their own par­ticular meaning to his men. One of these is the cry, uYockee!" (if that's the way it is spelled) with the accent on the first sylbble. The casual dropper-in at practice will hear it time and a.gain during the course of a shadow scrimmage, and he will be puzzled. It was chosen by Rockne because it is a powerful word, one that can be heard above the roar of a crowd during the heat of a game, and it is the tip-off, usually coming from an end or tackle, 
meaning that the wing-back on his side has started in motion toward the other side of the line before the ball has been snapped. It lets the other side of the line, which can not see the play, know that the ·play may be expected to strike in his territory. 
The looker-on will also hear he word ·uworse" shouted 
from time: to time and will· be mystified again. This is merely another word for ureverse" and its purpose is the same as that of uyockee." Rockne found that his men were missing plays when ureverse" was used, diagnosed the word, found that the first syllable was lost because it did not stand out, and so changed to the more emphatic ver­, sion now used. A reverse is much the same as a uyockee," except on a reverse the man in motion has not started un­
til after the ball is snapped. 
One of Rockne's favorite words in connection with his 
teams, is that they should be what he calls unifty." By 
this he means that his men, whether varsity or reserves, 
should exhuberate an air of quiet confidence, coolness, 
savoir faire, and determination well-masked to do the task 
at hand and do it well. His teams must be, if we may 
use the term, ubig-time" in every move they make. Never 
must any man. give the appearance of being a novice, and 
no crudity of actiOn, word, or manner is tolerated. 
Perhaps the reserves at. times are not quite as unifty" :ts the varsity, but thtir various defects are polished and buffed in practice until these men are ready for varsity work, if that glorious moment should ever come to them. In their games this year, however, even in defeat they exhibited well the effects of uRock's" teaching when they. stepped onto enemy fields with their attitude of quiet superiority, not noticeable enough to be offensive, but · effective enough to throw their opponents a bit off bal­ance. Once, when Jimmy Crowley, famed left-half horse­man of. the equally famed Four Horsemen returned ·to, school after a defeat in 1923, the year before the great backfield won its lasting nickname, he was approached by a devoted ground-keeper who asked him sympathetically what the trouble was in the game. u\Vell," replied Jimmy, uRock says we were defeated by mental poise." uoh, that guy never could play football anyhow," re­torted the ground-.keeper. 
Destruction of tpe other team's mental poise is one of the chief aims of Rockne teams. Reserves as well as varsity men are told how to keep shifting their defense so that the opposing quarter-back will never know where to run his next play; on offense, Notre Dame quarter-backs are the essence of coolness and confidence. \Vhile these elements will not win ball games by themselves, they are nevertheless important factors in many a close struggle. 
To return to the uHamburgers" after this digression, 
we repeat that seven victories in eight contests constitutes 
a remarkable season's rcord, especially so after so many 
tough and gruelling week~ as battering rams to test the 
varsity's defensive mettle. The record may be a tribute to 
umental poise" or whatever you like. 
At any rate, the uHamburgers" have done nobly and 
Notre Dame may well be proud of them. Much of the 
success of the past varsity season goes to these reserves, 
who so courageously and so generously allowed themselves 
to be actually uground up" in daily actual or dummy 
scrimmages. ·

lnterhall Football 
By EDMUND G. BRITZ 
E
VERYONE who so desires plays football at 
Notre Dame. One might have distinctive 
qualifications and so merit a coveted position 
on the var·sity squad; or perhaps he might not have ·marked ability, and so ,confine his talent to the interhall football league. It is not the difference in competency with its resulting rewards that is of importance; rather it is the fact that regardless of glory, more than 800 men play football each fall at Notre Dame on either varsity or 
interhall teams: 
Interhall 'football, which might be said to be in the 
"patent applied for" stage of popularity, represents an 
integral part of Rockne's system, and its relative worth as 
a foundation for varsity teams is readily perceivable with 
an explanation of its function. The plan is nothing more 
than an arrangement whereby players on the teams in the 
league are afforded an opportunity to learn the funda­
mentals of the game without fear of embarrassment. The 
following spring they are given the chance to display the 
results of their experience; if worthy they are' asked to 
join the varstty, if not, it is suggested that they return 
to the interhall lea.gue for further improvement. Thus 
it is that Rockne has always at hand a copious source of 
material for varsity teams of the future. It is this abun­
dance of material that has mystified the fan and other 
coaches, but this so-called mystery· is gradually being un­
veiled as the system of interhall football receives its proper 
recognition in football circles. 
Many potential varsity players have been (~unearthed" in interhall competition, later to become Notre Dame stars of the gridiron. Perhaps the most noted case in which a ufind" figured is that of George Gipp, the greatest foot­ball player Notre Dame ever produced. Coach Rockne tells of his first meeting with Gipp, who in his early days here played on the Brownson Hall team. While on one of his st'rolls about the campus to observe any ~atural talent, on a field set aside for interhall players, he saw a tall boy consistently drop-kick 50 yards with all the poise and grace that comes with natural ability. Here was a worthy prospect. It was George Gipp, who was .later to electrify thousands of football fans by his spectacular playing before death called him. 

· Interhall football at Notre Dame has long since be~n graduated from the experimental stage, and now occupies leadership in sport activities on the campus with the ex­ception of the varsity teams in their various ·branches of major sports. Its.. history is packed with memorable in­cidents of hard fought battles, bi~ter victories and acrid losses. Intense rivalry characterizes every game in inter­hall competition, yet good sportsmanship always predomi­nates. It is. fighting spirit that has brought interhall foot­ball out of the obscurity that enshrouded it in earlier days into the limelight of campus popularity. · 
The greatest single advance in interhall football came in the years shortly preceding the war when· the university initiated its policy of furnishing equipment to the players. This important function of the· system has been gradually developed until today the equipment room for the hall gridders resembles the uplant" of a large university. 
Previous .to 1929 the task of supervising the league has been in the hands .of one man. \Vith the intention of centralizing the labor of administering over the :·league, Coach Rockne, in September, '1929, created a board of· directors composed of the twelve residence hall rectors with the Rev. Raymond Murch, C.S.C., as chairman. In addition Mr. Rockne ·appointed George Keogan, head

basketball coach, to be director of the hall system with 
the duty of deciding all disputes and protests; and assign­
ing the fields and officials for the contests; while Fa.thcr 
Murch arranged the schedules. This year the league was 
under the management of Dan Halpin, senior football 
manager, and his ·associates. , . 
In an effort to instill a. keen. interest in interhaU foot­

ball, Mr. Rockne decided last year ·to assign varsity men 
as coaches ot the various teams so that each team in the 
league might profit by the instruction of a man well 
experienced m football. The decision became a precedent, 
with the coaches and their assistants selected from the 
university's School of Physical Education. By this work 
with the hali teams, they obtain the practical coaching 
experience required in their course. 
In the following list of coaches for the year I93 0, the 

first named in each case is the varsity representative, and 
the second is his co-worker: Freshman, Brill, Napolitano; 
Sophomore, Kaplan, \Vilson; Carroll, Yarr, Bresson; 
Brownson, Savoldi, Kuhn; \Valsh, Conley, Cunningham; 
Corby, Romanin, Griffen; Badin, Leahy, Edmond 
O'Connor; Howard, O'Brien, Luckett; Morrissey, Capter, 
Artman; Lyons, Carideo, McQuaid; St. Edward's, Kosky, 
Koken; Off-Campus, Butorac, Sheeketski. · 
The ulterior motive of Coach Rockne in appointing a varsity man to supervise the formation of a hall team was one o~ preparation. By being in contact with the teams the varsity men could easily spot any prospective material, and see to it that every avenue to advancement was opened to the one under consideration.. The type of player sought for mostly IS a fighter possessing some football technique, no matter how little. If he has fight he can readily be moulded into a finished player by responding to the tute­lage of expert coaches. Thus the interhall circuit is rich · in varsity material because the primary requisite for an 
interhall· player is the ability to fight. 
\Vith the issuance of 3 50 suits to the candidates, the 

I930 season promised to be highly competitive as usual. 
The twelve squads earnestly groomed in anticipation of 
the race for campus laurels, swung into action on October 
5, after an inspiring talk by Coach Rockne urging· them 
to take full interest in the competition. The response was 
evidenced by hard-fought battles, each contest reflecting 
the traditional spirit of the. league and drawing large at­
tendances from the respective halls. Efficiency was the 
keynote of the schedule, and to the officials who directed its 
fulfillment credit is due for their excellent management. 
The outcome of the. gridiron elimination' contest had

Thrill followed thrill as first Walsh and then Lyons hammered the line and skirted the ends in an attempt to score. It was a great defense· against an equally great defense, with all ground­gaining efforts rendered practically futile. Then as the last . seconds of play rapidly lessened, a long pass from Bob Law fell into the waiting arms of Jane, who sped across Lyon's 
goal to score and to crown \Valsh the victor. 
The final score is an indication of the comparative 
strength of the two teams which represented the interhall 
groups. Narrow margins of victory in other contests 
marked the season as the closest and most keenly competi.., 
tive. The champs played six games exclusive of the final 
one with Lyons, defeating Howard, after one tie game, 
Freshman, Off-Campus, Brownson, and Carroll. Their 
march to the championship was distinctive in the fact that 
not once was their goal crossed by an opposing team.

Official Football Review-1930 

11The Wearers of the Green11 
By RonERT E. GoRMAN 

MANFRED VEZIE AND \VILLIAM ]ONES 
Fresbman Football Coaches 
T
\VO hundred and eighty-seven high school 
heroes reported for Freshman football last 
September, presented their newspaper clippings 
and all-state records to Coaches Bill Jone~ and Manny 
Vezie, and waited for the numerals to be awarded. All 
of the boys should have made good by Thanksgiving time, 
in accordance with the old storybook tradition, but. it 
seems, on the contrary, that two hundred and two of them 
were slashed frorh the squad and a. permanent group of . . only eighty-five was left to carry on for good old '34. 
Prior to last year the Freshmen were used as ((contact men" for the varsity to push around in practice scrim­mages. Last year more attention was devoted to the work of familiarizing the frosh with the Rockne system. This plan brought better results and was adhered to, for die most part, by Jones and Vezie this season. \Vitness the rapid rise of Joe Kurth, who stepped in with the varsity at right tackle, when Dick Donoghue was injured in the first game, and has stayed there ever since. Also note the fact that Host, Harriss, Greeney, Butler, Terlaak, Pierce, Mahoney, Jaskwhich, Staab, and Hanley of last year's frosh all saw action with the shock troops during the past season. As a result, the 85 men left on the squad under­went a thorough initiation into the intricacies of Notre Dame football. 

This plan was deviated from long enough for the men to learn the _plays of Navy, Drake, and Indiana. \Vhen called upon to impersonate these three teams in scrim­mages with the varsity, the green-clad athletes had an op­portunity to play around with the toughest .of opponents before the greatest of critics. \Vhereas at the beginning of the season they had been overwhelmed iri the annual Freshman-Varsity ((frolics," the frosh now came through as few freshman teams have . ever come through, display­ing defensive work that was pa-rticularly capable. 
During the last three weeks of the season the men were given an intensive drill in the fundamentals of the game, at the' completion of which they had finished serving their gridiron apprenticeships. Numerals were a.warded in time for their recipients to wear tqem during Christmas vaca­tion for the edification of the boys back in the hometown meeting places. 
To be entrusted by Knute Rockne with the responsible task of giving talented freshmen the right start in their football careers, is a tribute to any coach's ability. Coaches Jones and Vezie earned this distinction by their long ser­vice during the Rockne regime. After three years of playing experience, Jones collaborated with Tommy Mills in tutoring the 1929 Freshman team, while Vezie is one of the most capable ends . to wear the Gold and Blue in recent years. 
Although· the old sandlot cry, cci want to play quarter­back," was voiced by fully two-thirds of the 'freshman backfield cadidates, it still managed to arouse interest in the coaches who realized that there will be an all-American quarter-hick to replace on the 1931 varsity. After the last signal· had been called, two Chicago products, Ray Boland and Al McGuff, together with Larry Furlong, of Joliet, stood out as the classiest field generals on the squad. 
In emulation of Schwartz, Elder, Flanagan, and other flashy ,left half-backs who have made history under Rockne, another flock of aspirants tried out for this posi­tion. George Melinkovich came all the way from Tooele, Utah, to steal the coaches' attention from these candidates, while Harold Johnson, of Kewanee, Illinois, is another bright prospect. · 
The parade of tlie right halfs was led by Michaelson, Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Millhean, Beloit, \Visconsin; and Smith, Indianapolis. 
The latest contribution which Captain Tom Conley's alma niater, Roman Ca.tholic High,· of Philadelphia, has made to Notre Dame athletics is Jimmy Leonard, a full­back with a future. Leonard, however, had far from a mo.­nopoly on the full-back situation. Joe Rinaldi, another Tooele, Utah, product, and V ettel,. an Ohio lad, are other high-powered full-backs. 
\Vhile Larry Mullins_ has already made Pasadena high school famous, Ben Alexander, a promising center, is seek­ing to perpetuate tha.t school's fame. Another prep star from the west coast, Tom Cahill, of Los Angeles, gave Alexander the stiffest kind of competition at die pivot post, while Joe Buzolits, a South Bend boy attempting to make goo~, also showed ball-snapping capabilities. 


U1z{ve1·sity of Not1·e Dame 
Fine guards have beco~e a tradition at Notre Dame. This is one tradition that the class of '34 apparently will carry on, for there was an abundance of good guard ma­terial on the squad. The list of efficient guards is headed by the brothers Chapman, of Los Angeles, and by four Hoosiers: Schrenker, of Elwood; \X'eidner, of LaPorte; and Paulson and Lentsch, of South Bend. . 
The squad also included several tackles who in all prob­ability will be playing big time ball before their careers are finished. ·Paul Krauciunas, formerly of De LaSalle, Chicago, is one of the best prospects at this position, while other outstanding tackles are Barstow, of Menominee, Mich.; Rascher, of Beecher, Ill.; Bomba, of Chicago; and Zvonkin, of Hamilton, Ont. 
Plenty of talented performers were also a.vailable at the end positions. Hugh Devore, having prepped at the same school that Johnny Colrick did, St. Benedict's, Newark, is attempting to equal Colrick's brilliancy as an end. Frank Canale, la.te of Christian Brothers Academy, Memphis, is another outstanding flankman, while Franklin, of New York; Ed Krauciunas, of Chicago; and Moriarity, of Phil­adelphia, arc equally promising. 
Right here it might not be out of place to mention the fact that no amount of advance agent blurb or high school distinction wins a man a place on the Frosh squad. On the other hand, no candidate, no matter if he is just an­other number to the equipment room and just another green-jersied 'dreamer of heroic dreams to the coaches, is denied the chance of making good with the chosen 85. 
The mulling done by Bill Jones and Manny Vezie over each prospect before his fate is decided puts to shame the endless process· of sifting done by all-American pickers for the newspapers. Every man who wants to try his hand and his foot in the manly fall sport is handed the necessary equipment and what he does on the field-not what he has done in high school, ~r would like to do with the varsity-is the criterion by which these two mentors make their selections. 
Perhaps this sounds like the pep talk Bill and Manny made at the beginning of the season when they had their 
2 87 yearlings together for the first time. But to say that it is not true is to contradict fact that stands on the 
·basis of the past. We cannot name off-hand any men with brilliant high school records who did not make good and who were dropped, because these things are not dis­cussed either by the coaches or the players in question .. But we can name men on the present varsity and with the second and third teams who just went out for the fresh­man team without showing their newspaper _clippings to the coaches, and some·who perhaps didn't have any news­paper clippings because they hadn't even played football in high school. , 
Marty Brill is perhaps the outstanding example of the point we are trying to make. He wasn't even good enough ·for the team Notre Dame last season beat by 40 points and, so ~ay the critics, could have beaten br a hundred. 
-But he was given his· opportunity. Tom Kassis came from C1sper, \X'yo., and went out for center ... no one had.. heard of him, but he was given his chance, shifted, to guard his third year, and now he has passed out of history as. one of Notre Dame's best. And so it was with Bert M~tzger, all-American guard who was unknown to such a great extent that he was almost prevented from going out because of his lack of size. Given his chance, though, he came through. Tommy Yarr at center, and Ed Kosky at left end are also examples of unheralded men who were considered by the freshman coaches, kept on the squad, and subsequently moved up to the varsity. 
\Ve could nap1e countless other examples of .. finds" made among the aspiring freshmen. Boys like Frank Hoff­man, shock troop tackle who never played in high school, are not so rare a:; tO be startling at Notre Dame. The freshman coaches make mistakes a.t times; no. one is per­fect. But both Jones and Vezie played three years of football at Notre Dame themselves and they at least know enough about the game and about handling men, so that they seldom have to second-guess. All they ask for is some show of na-tural ability, some evidence of courage, and some willingness to work-they will provide then ­'Yhat is lacking.

U1tive1·sity of Not1·e Dame 
The Beginning of a New Era 
( 

By NEIL C. HuRLEY 
N
OTRE DAME Stadium -a monument to sportsmanship, a tribute to fighting youth, and an ampitheatre devoted to modern 

athletics. · 
The architects say it was made with brick and mort3.r. Maybe it ,was. But there was a lot more "Rock" put into that bowl than even the builders ever dreamed or unimaginative technical men would ·be expected to know. 
The dedication the night before the Navy game culmi­nated a frenzied torch-lit parade of the student body, with about 20,000 spectators looking on~ Next day, just before the kick-off, Frank E. Hering made the official ad­dress amid a bevy of air bombs and camera flashes. 
It was the best demonstration ever seen on the Notre Dame campus. ·The band began playing about seven o'clock Friday evening. The st.udeius fell into line, torches blazing, songs on high, three ·thousand strong. 
A new era was beginning. 
A new era, undoubtedly, but with the same traditions, 
the same :fight, yes, even the same soil of the-immortal 
Cartier Field. But new history was to be made, new tra­
ditions to be· started. 
The structure was raised by engineers and architects, by means of blue prints and placing brick upon. brick. Technically, the stadium is flawless. It is modern in every respect. As a building it compares with any in the 
·country. 
But it was not the perfection of this structure thlt was the key-note of the . dedication. The gathering w:1s not to give praise to the work of the masons and brick­layers. Even the visitors saw that. It was a memorial to Pete Vaughan, to Jimmy Phelan, to George Gipp, to the Four Horsemen, to all other Notre Dame men and Notre . Dame stars. · · 
There were some persons who wanted to.~ame it Rockne 
Field. It was fitting, but "Rock" said no. He was 
generous. 
The pa'rade· to the stadium is unforgettable in Notre 
Dame history. The torches, _flaming red, marked off the three-block-long procession. A procession of cheering, loyal, stout fellows, who chanted the Hike Song as they marched. The meeting of the Off-Campus delegation at the postoffice was inspiring. More cheers were given, more singing, more fla.res. 
The bowl was crowded with humanity, the north end was completely filled. An Indiana moon, round and bright, added to the picture. The setting was perfect. 
As the students thundered ·to their seats, twenty air bombs exploded. Again they sang "The Hike Song." The Notre Dame spirit was at its zenith. A cheer leader came from 'somewhere and the stands vibrated with. the "Drum" yell. Even Gilbert Keith Chesterton, the writer, was given a volley of yells. He learned about school spirit that night. 
Notre Dame .was.dedicating a stadium. 
"\X'e are happy to have the Navy help us on this au­spicious occasion," said Knute R9ckne, as flashlights for newspaper cameras in~errupted the darkness of the night. Brick and mortar. And "Rock." 
Set pieces burned in a far corner of the stadium. They blazed out a welcome to the Navy, spelled out the Notre Dame monogram, and unfurled the American colors in a flaming-flag. 
In this haven of enthusiasm, basking in the informality of student loyalty, Rear Admiral S. S. Robison brought the best wishes of the Naval Academy. There were flowers from big universities, the biggest wreath coming from the team that was first defeated on the new field, Southern Methodist. Sportsmanship, ideals, friendly rivalry. 
The crowd tha.t night heard Knute Rockne speak, they heard Admiral Robison, as he told about the Navy's friendly relations with Notre Dame, and lastly, ably in­troduced by Pat Manion, they heard the Rev. Charles 
L. O'Donnell, C.S.C., as he recited that famous story of George Gipp; the story which seemed to symbolize the spirit of the Fighting Irish, which seemed to fit in so well with the new surroundings. 
"I s~w Gipp play his last game against the Army in

1920," began Father O'Donnell, .. and was on the bench 
when in the last quarter he was relieved from play, limp­
ing off the field exhausted and depleted of every ounce 
of strength, ail of which he had given for that impossible 
dream of love and loyalty which makes up a college' man's 
devotion to his school and his fellows-actually dying, 
though we knew it not, for already in pis system was 
working that insidious poison which was less than a month 
Iater to bring him to the grave. 
· ..He had done everything," he continued, ..that any 
football player had ever done upon a field and he had 
done it better than most. Darkness was coming in on the 
bitter winds that swept across the plains as he sat there 
in his blanket, relaxed, pale, silent, crying a. little, I think. 
"Then suddenly he was on his feet; he-leaped onto the· 
bench, the blanket fallen from his shoulders. Chet \Vynne, 
our full-back, had made one of those sudden, amazing cuts 
through the line, good for some fifteen or twenty yards. 
In a vo1ce that could be heard, it seemed to me, above :til 
the roar of the crowd, Gipp shouted: 'Yea, Chet,' as h;: 
stood there, ·self entirely 'forgotten, quivering from head 
to foot with joy and loyal pride in that achievement of his 
team-mate." 
That was Gipp. Tha.t tells why Notre Dame could 
build a· great stadium. It explains. what is behind every 
football team that Knute Rockne coaches. 
Brick and mortar. No, a monument to loyalty, to 
fighting youth, and dashing spirit. 
It is a memorial earned by the sweat of twenty-four 
years of football. Earned by the football heroes of three decades-the late John I. Mullen, three times captain of the team; Louis ..Red" Salmon; Harry ..Red" Miller; Charley Crowiey; Gus Dorais; Knute Rockne; Ray Eich­. enlaub; the Bergmans; the younger Millers; Clipper.Smith; _ "Hunk" Anderson; the famous ends, Kiley and Anderson; the Collins boys; Johnny Mohardt; Lawrence ..Buck" Shaw; Paul Castner, and their equally famous team-mates. 
The next afternoon before the thousands who thronged 

to witness· the .Navy game, Frank E. Hering, former cap­tain and first coach of football, delivered his address. The dedication was complete. 
"To Knute_ Rockne," said Mr. Hering, "and those thou­sands of athletes who, inspired by him, have added to the fame of Notre Daine, this ceremony is more than a dedi­ca cion; it is a testimonial. 
·"The sod that carpets the floor of this stadium is rich in traditions."· Mr. Hering is in a corner of the new field, flowers about, newspaper photographers, and a notional radio hook-up carrying his voice throughout the nation. "For. a quarter of a century, athletes who have added to the fame of Notre· Dame have raced over its emerald sur­face carrying our colors to victory, or have opposed with their bodies charging opponents seeking the coveted goal­line. _ · "Notre Dame is an advocate of clean, vigorous ath­letics. Each student is encouraged to excel in the sport for which he has an aptitude. Pres. Charles O'Donnell has made known to the world our position; we accept gladly the discipline of. competitive sports; we especially favor games in which high proficiency is a.ttainend only by mergmg achievements of individual players into the closely woven pattern of team-play. 
"Tradition is a compound of reverence and pride a.!ld unselfish service," continued Mr. Hering. ..Notre Dame traditions live. They are cherished and perpetuated. Over the years, the devoted men who have built this institution have established records of unselfish service and sacrifice that have reacted convincingly and beneficially on those who have· come under their influence. · 
"\Vhat other American college or university during the past quarter of a century has contributed so many names that deserve to adorn football's Hall of Fame? . Notre Dame teams-physically fit, splendidly coached, and in­spire~ by the ideal, 'Each for all and all for Notre Dame' -have thrilled millions _of specta.tors and inspired the youth of the nation to play the game of football-and the

game of life-in the spirit of the rules." 
The band played; the flag was raised; the kick-off-and that new era began. Football history in the making. Tele­graph instruments and typewriter keys clicked, radio an­nouncers recounted the tale to the microphonc--,-the world was told. · 
Notre Dame has a great stadium. They selected the Navy to help them dedicate it. They selected Navy be­cause relations between Annapolis and Notre Dame have always been of the best, because the Irish have ba-ttled "Bill" Ingram's boys for a good many years, and no mat­ter the calibre of c~thcr team, both at the end knew .tliere was a scrap. 
They selected Navy because the Midshipmen possess so much of that ideal Notre. Dame admires. Annapolis is a school of sportsmen. They play hard, tough football, but they arc sportsmen., Notre Dame teams like to do business with that type. 
You sec, Notre Dame teams know how to fight and be sportsmen, too. That's why the stadium could be built· in the first place. 
Facts About the Stadium The entire work was completed in little more than four months .. James Carmody, student statistician extraordi­nary, 'with the combined science and commerce schools, delved into the matter ·a bit more closely and brought forth some facts and figures on· the project. "Believe it or not," begins this young Roger Babson, 
..but if the 2,000,000 bricks were laid end. to end they would reach from the Administration building to the Cleveland waterfront, or a. matter of some three hundred miles. 
"And furthermore," continues Mr. Carmody, «if we take on1y the steel that makes up the framework of the stadium, look what we find. There were· 400 tons of it used, or, more simply, 20 carloads. Let us make bullets of it and there will be 6,400,000 of them, if two ounces wcrc·'used for each one. If they were fed steadily into a machine gun which shoots one hundred of them a minute, the tngger would be pressed for forty-four days and ten hours be±ore the supply would be exhausted. 
..The laborers required a ton of food daily," he con­tinues, ..and drank five ·hundred gallons of ·water each day. F~rthermorc, the 15,000 cubic yards of concrete, if made into a tower of ten feet square would reach a height of five and one-half times that of the \Voolworth build­ing. 
"If a table were to be made of the 100,000 feet of Cal­ifornia red-wood lumber used for the seats, some inter­esting facts would be divulged. For inst:mce, it it were four feet wide, it would stretch for a distance of 25,000 feet. And 20,000 people could be accommodated for meals at one time." 
The architects of the stadium were the Osborn Engi­neering Co. who have designed some 50 stadia in all parts of the country. These· ·indluce Comiskey Park in Chicago, and the Y ankcc Stadium and the Polo Grounds in New York. They also have crec~ed the stadia at the Uni-

vcrstttes of Michigan, Indiana, Pu_r­
duc, and Minnesota. 
It is so designed that, should oc-· 
casion warrant the change, it is possible .to ·place a double deck on top· of the.present structure. Should this be done there would be room ·for. 120,000 spectators, ··making it 
one of the largest in the world. 
Designed for football and foot­
ball alone, the stadium is rectangular 
in shape and all scats. arc as close as 
possible to the playing field. Thus, 
visibility i.s aided to a great extent 
and the statement that there is not a 
poor scat in the cnt_irc arena ~s true. 
· The scats start about 10 yards 
from each boundary of the field-there is no running 
track, no jumping pit, no equipment whatsoever irrelevant 
to football, included on the playing field-and the rows arc 
banked so that there is· no necessity of jumP..ing to one's 
feet to sec every play. .: 
Everything possible was done for the convenience of spectators when the stadium was planned. · The play~ng field is sunk some 10 feet below the level of the outside terrain so that the spectator ma.y enter the stadium · through any one of its many portals without climbing endless ramps or fatiguing steps. The problem ~f draining the field was unusually difficult because of the fact that it is below the outside level, but this was taken care of by an elaborate system of tiling. · 
For added convenience of· the spectator, new cement 
highways from every direction were built and unlimited 
parking space was provided. Railroads ran special 'spurs 
to a point within easy walking distance of the :stadium to 
take· care of the crowds expected from Chicago, ·Detroit, 
Indianap~lis, Milwaukee, Fort \'V'ayne, Cleveland, Toledo, · 
and other cities of Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, , 
and Ohio, as well as more distant points. 
There arc special offices in the stadium where the work 
of recovering or re-assigning lost tickets is carried on by 
]. Arthur Haley, business manager, and his assistants. Rest 
rooms, concession stands, first-aid rooms, everything pos­
sible for the convenience and comfort of visitors to Notre 
Dame's home games has been provided for by the architects.

Official Football Review-1930 
The student managers have their own office at the north end of the stadium close to the two. team locker-rooms which flank the large entrance at this end of .the edifice. The locker-rooms arc modern . in every respect, roomy, light, airy, well-ventilated, meticulously clean and sanitary at all times. 
A large ramp at the north en? admits the contestants to the field with a minimum of delay and effort. Instead of ha.ving to file through narrow gates or push through crowds hurrying to their seats, the ·players can run onto the playing 

. field in a group independent· of whatever else is taking place. · 
The ramp also permits bands to eritcr in full formation, ­and it is the one and only entrance for trucks and ground.:. keepers' equipment. 
Coach Rockne, ever thoughtful of the spectators, has kept· the number of .. side-line guests" at a minimum and he allows no photographers, sound movie trucks, or any­thing or anyone of this nature on the field. · Instead of the orthodox players' benches, which not only cut off the view of persons in box scats, but also expose the players to the rain, snow, sleet, and cold of fall, a. dugout for each team has been provided. These are enclosed on three sides and are well below the first-row seats. 
Perhaps the crowning glory of the stadium is the press box, generally agreed by the nation's prominent sports writers to be the finest in the country: With its seating capacity of 264 writers, besides photographers, radio broad­casters, messengers, electricians, and ushers, the press box 
. is ideal in its way. Not only does it seat more to our knowledge than. any other in the country, but there is more room at each position than will be found at others with the same number of seats. ·There is plenty of space at each position for a portable typewriter and an open 
·program beside it. · · . 
The radio· booths, three in number, are situated in the north end of the hox in the back. 1;hey are fully sound­proof and visibility from them is perfect.· They have microphone connections to all parts of the stadium so that

band music, cheering, and crowd noises may be picked up for the millions who sit_tense at home form­ing their. mental word picture of all that goes on. 
A special platform for photog­raphers, dropped from beams in the ceiling, gives cameramen a most strategic posi~ion from which to ,look down on plays, and pictures from this, the highest point of the stadium, give a. comprehensive view of action shots, much clearer than those taken from the sidelines: The 
platform also places the photog­raphers above the heads of the work­ing press and it interferes in no way with their vision or work. " 
Finally, the entire press box is glass-enclosed and even has windshields running the full lengtl~ of each row to keep papers from blowing about and to protect the writers 
. from the clements. 
A thousand and one other details, unnoticed by specta-. tors, help to make it as easy as possible for a person to sec the fighting men of Notre Dame upholding the traditipn of old. Cartier field. A public address system broadcasts to the spectators and to the pressmen a detailed account 
·of each play from the sidelines. Electric scoreboards at either end.of the field supply all information to the eye that the ear might miss. 
Everything practicable has been done to make more pleasant the visits of thousands of football lovers and 
·friends-of Notre Dame. The stadium, a monument to warrio~s of the past, is the kind of a remembrance they would want .most. It is mor~ than a testimonial, it is a useful, living, practical, service-giving piece of architec­ture, a reflection of their great services. 
Early History The present edifice is a growth from the old Cartier: Field which was erected in 1899 on a spot just cast of the 

Brownson campus, wherever th;l-: might have been. 
In those days there were no ad­mission barriers, appaling gate re­ceipts, or huge, colorful crowds. Football was football of the brute type, played in innings, not halves. The first game that the school . ever played was a gains Michigan---:­and this was even before the players' bench had been built, let alone a 55,000 capacity stadium. They dug up eleven unpadded suits and chal­lenged the \Volvcrines. The site' of this encounter was the Green Stock­ing ball park in South Bend. The game was described as very exciting, and included much kicking of the 

ball and rushing by men of the team. The following day, they played the same team a-gain. This time the, game was entirely for the eyes of the student. body and was played· on a vacant lot somewhere close to the school. Notre Dame lost both games. 
Traffic Handled Well 

The Rockne traffic and parking system for Notre Dame's new stadium has achieved great success this year. 
At each games from 2,500 to 4,500 automobiles were steered into convenient and ample parking places over well marked and policed routes that dodged the 'local traffic in the South Bend business district. 
The parking facilities for the new stadium have been called by experts the finest in America. Plenty of room is aff01;dcd on all sides of the field and it is well utilized by those in charge. 
Knutc Rockne, knowing that a great deal of enjoyment of a football game depends upon the personal comfort, personally saw to plans fo: the arrangement of parked cars.

N PRESENTING its 1930 All-Opponent team, the Official Football Review feels that it has one of the most representative mythical teams pos­

sible. At first glance, perhaps, many will disa.gree with out selections because they do not agree with what the newspapers have picked as their sectional and all-American choices. 
The method used in picking the Review's team, how­ever, is so thoroughgoing and so independent of .. news­paper stars" tha.t we feel it gives us an eleven which if actually organized would take its place with any chosen by a newspaper :or a magazine. 
The schedule Notre Dame played brought the Fighting Irish into contact with representative teams from every section of the country, teams whose individual sta.rs were as brilliant as any coach could desire. 
In making its selection, the Review first consulted with . the Notre Dame scouts who had seen Notre Dame's opponents in action during the 1929 season and last sea­son. From them, we gained a world of information about stars who were bcing.promoted for ·my_thical honors because of brilliancy in one department of play, stars who had big reputations, but who ..didn't like it"-the vcnacular for a player who will signal fair catches all· afternoon and run out of bounds rather than be ·tackled after being hard hit by a tackler or blocker. 
Secondly, the Review asked the coaches who they thought stacked up best as consistent, all-around men, both before, after, and during their games against Notre Dame. · 
Finally, we went to the Notre Dame players themselves for their opinion of the play of the men they opposed in their ten games. For example, the ends were asked which tackles, ends, and half-backs were the hardest' to draw out of position and to block out of a play as well as which could block best themselves. They were asked which ends and backs they thought were the best pass receivers, and, in short, which men they opposed showed the most all­around ability, the most spirit, and the best coaching. And so it was with the other players; all gave us willingly their opinions and we feel that from the information we· gleaned from scouts, coaches, and players we have selected a team with spirit, fight, and ability, and a team that could go out and play steady, consistent ball day in and day out. 
There naturally were scvera.l hard decisions ~o make, and perhaps we have done an injustice to some of our oppo­nents. \VIe feel, however, that our selections arc as repre­sentative as they possibly could be and trust that a short description of each man's play will dear up any doubts the reader may have about the choice made. 
At the ends, we have named Louis Long and Edwin Messinger of Southern Methodist and Army, respectively. Long was perhaps the most brilliant pass-receiver Notre Dame met all season ·and he was just as good as a blocker, a decoy, and as a defensive man. No a.ttempt to run his end or to cut inside of him was entirely successful and to pass into his territory was folly. He wore out a com­plete Notre Dame backfield with his persistent long dashes. down the field, not only as a receiver but as a decoy and he was going just as strong at the end of that hot, sultry October 4 afternoon as he was at the beginning. He had a great competitive spirit and his attitude was re­flected in his entire team's confidence and hard play. Messinger, who was chosen last year on the Review team, was, if anything, bett~r than last season. His steady de­fensive play and his emphatic blocking in the mud, ice, and rain of Soldier Field kept his team in the ball game and never once did he let down or relax during the 60 grueling minutes of play. 
His team-mate, Carlmark; Briley, Drake's captain-elect; Byng, of Navy; Roscnzsweig, Carnegie's hard-driving, ex­perienced flankman; Arbelbide, U. S. C.'s all-American prospect; ~iblett, captain-elect at Penn; ·and North­western's brilliant Baker, arc also outstanding men who arc worthy of mention here. :lviost of them were not really impressive in all departments of the game,_ however, and the two on the first team represent .the consensus of Notre Dame's players, coaches, and scouts for first honors. 
At the tackles, R. M. Bowstro.m, acting captain for the Navy against Notre Dame; and Dallas :lv[arvil, of North­western were chosen. Bowstrom's inspirational leadership and never-say-die spirit coupled. with his natural ability and experience made him ideal in this position. He was the outstanding lineman in a fighting Middic. forward wall when he played against the Irish and his work all season· was steady. Marvil, of Northwestern, was everything that a good tackle should be. He covered his territory on

11 Paths of Glory Lead, But Ji 
By ]AMES E. ARMSTRONG Alum11i Secretary · 
N
OT everyone follows them. . · The new Notre Dame Stadium presents a peculiar ·COntradiction to all that is venerated in proverb. The world, the ancients said, will beat a path to your door, provided you have something the world wants. Yet in this first year the world,. apparently wanting Notre Dame football like nobody's business, has done any­thing but pack down the dirt around the gates of the stadium; And not only need the way not be beaten-it . is advertised, plentifully marked, and open. by air, land and water. . " Economic conditions unquestionably have played. a part. But the same person who cries to Heaven for vengeance on the :five-dollar dedication ticket, which comes once in the lifetime of an ordinary stadium, will question the latc:;t musical comedy if tickets sell for less. And these run nightly for far too long a stret'ch, and aside from the un­certainty of the continued blondeness of the star, there is little difference in musicomedy technique from year to year. Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Evanston, Chicago and Los Angeles could not hold the crowds that clamored this season to see what is widely heralded as Notre Dame's greatest team, and that means to most people the game's greatest team. Three times as many persoris have seen the team in the :five games away from home· as have seen the :five home games. The :five home games would, on the other hand, have accommodated twice as many, assuming capacity crowds; · . · Why, then, does Notre Dame dra.w fewer persons at home that a high school game played in the same Stadium? Echo answers, why? . Rockne's schedule for the 1930 season was early d~bbed 

"suicide." The home :field was given :five games that prac­tically any home :field in these United States would have welcomed. Southern Methodist, the most dangerous, col­orful representative from the Southwest, opened the season. to a Stadium less than. half full for its initial contest; Navy, one of the country's two great Service teams, with all the tradition, all the attraction of Annapolis, and no ' little rivalry with Notre Dame to seas!Jn the battle, played the dedication game before more than 10,000 vacant scats. Carnegie Tech, heralded as the most powerful team in the country, coming to Notre Dame with advance storm signals flying, admittedly bent on another of its distress­ing series of victories over Notre Dame, faced a Stadium more than a third empty.

·THERE ·is a saying of the philosophers that in . every change something is lost and something . is gained and something abides. On last Oct. 4, Notre Dame's football team said goodbye to old Cartier field to launch a new era in a new stedium, and in this .change also there was something which abided. It was the old turf and the tradition of victory which went with it. 
Football coaches have used many methods of keying up their teams. They've exhorted 'the boys to do their best for Alma Mater, for the old grads, for their mothers and fathers, for their brothers and sisters, their· classmates and the home town folks. · 
But Notre Dame boys do not stand in need of pep talks such as these, for every time they trot out upon the sod of Cartier field, now transplanted to the new stadium, they have that tradition of victory to spur them on, know­ing that they are playing u'pon turf which has been pounded by the flying heels. of heroes of former days. 
This greensward has know.,!l the tread of Lou Salmon, Ray Eichenlaub, Knute Rockne, Gus Dorais, George Gipp, the Four Horsemen and· countless unsung warriors 'Yho have brought Notre Dame from obscurity to football su­premacy; For twenty-three years no Notre Dame team knew defeat upon ths turf, and the snapping of this. vic­tory string by Carnegie Tech in 1928, was avenged by a new band of football players who are keeping. the pace set by the greatest of their predecessors. 
The sod of Cartier field is the tie which links this new 
team to a glamorous past. And what is this past which. ha~ 
the power to put fire into tiring playe .l and make them

seem incongruous from. today's point of view. A few of the opponents-Illinois ·cycling Club, Indianapolis Artil­lery, Englewood High School. 
Then in 1898, the prowess of Salmon, Hering, and Egg­man drew the interest of what football followers there were in those days and brought games with \Visconsin, Northwestern and Indiana. · 
There came a time when Brownson cainpus, scene of the home games, was no longer adequate and \Varren A. Cartier, class of 1887,·donated the plot of ground which became known as Cartier field. Upon this gridiron Notre Dame suffered a 5 to 0 defeat at the hands of \Vabash in .1905 and then, link by link, the chain of victories lengthened. . 
Notre Dame's power grew and presently .. Dorais to Rockne" became the gridiron's counterpart of ..Tinker to Evers to Chance." This was the beginning of the golden age of Notre Dame's football history. The Irish now were nationally recognized as big time players.

Seasons passed and still the victory march continue~ over the chalk lines of C~rtier field~... Then came George Gipp, who has been called half-brother' to the wind.

Official Football Review-1930 

On the Other Side of the Fence 
By ]ACK ELDER 

JACK ELDER 
I 
SHOULD have entitled this article uLooki~g at the Game From the Pressbox,'' uRcflcctions of a Has Been," or perhaps, to instill ;some of the 
Horatio Alger spirit into the thing, ccWatching the Boy5 Carry On." But since none of these titles struck me as being quite appropriate I hit on the idea which is made real by. the passing of years and have called it, what we cchas beens" are doing, ((Looking at the Game From the Other Side of the Fence." 
·People often ask the fellows, who have. done their bit for Notre Dame on the gridiron and have passed on, just what sort of feeling they have now that they must watch the game from the sidelines or a sea.t in the s:ands. . 
But to tell all the feelings expcnenccd whtlc watchmg a game now, after ha.ving played, would more than fill a book. Every tough situation: the fellows out on the field get into is just as tough for the fellows who arc looking on. So strong is the desire to uget back in there" that at times it's hard to keep your seat beside the best girl or to keep from biting your nails or tearing your hair. 

The emotions become so upset at times that one is tempted to pull the same stunt a Navy player once pulled in an important game. · \Vhilc sittit?-g on the bench wait­ing for that call which would send him into the game, this Navy back saw an opposing half-back weave his way through the Sailors' line, cut out to the sidelines and outsprint the safety man for what seemed to be a su~e touchdown. But tha.t old spirit which prompts men to udo or die for dear old Alma Mater" got the best of this lad and he ran out and hauled down the fleeting back from behind. 
Although this sounds funny it is really a fact and even though this young sailor is the firs~ one to carry out the plan I'm sure it had been formulated in the breasts of many youths before him. 
\Vhile we arc on the other side· of the fence we must realize that our playing days are over. \'{!e must realize that we have served our time and must move·on and give more sprightly youth its chance to gather the fruits of victory for our Alma Mater. 
But this realization need not be carried so far as to lead us to discard all ambitions of ever donning' the moleskins again. Even as this is being written, a group of e.x:­gridders. arc out on h_istoric Cartier Field preparing for their final bow, a charity show. These men who you remember as making up the personnel of teams· from 1921. to 193 0 carved their names on va.rious gridirons of the country with cleated shoes and are back again because they love the game and all that it means to them. And in spite of the training grind which is die most provoking part of football, these men arc back at it again solely for 
the chance of again meeting their old pals and working and sweating together. · -· The most common fault of the inhabitants of this side of the fence is their readiness to criticize. Picking out

11 Refreshments -for Newspapermen"

P
EOPLE who write in glass press boxes, 
shouldn't throw bouquets. 

But I can't help it. That new Not~e Dame cage for cnttcs is the feature of the stadium. And was, from the start. No matter how many of those c~mcrete rows arose, empty, to annoy the finer sensibilities of Art Haley, the cage for the critics was always sure of a capacity attendance. One never did realize how many newspapermen there must be in the world, until he tried to circulate in that critics' cage, preferably at half time, and one second after announce­ment had been made that refreshments were. t~ be served, to newspapermen .. 
The last two words were always superfluous. 
A newspaperman has only a certain amo~~t of game­

Arrangements were such, in the two games that I wit­nessed from the critics' cage, that coverage followed the lines of least resistance. The aides of Joe Petritz did every­thing but write for the visitors. 
Here and now, I wish to return my somewhat belated thanks for a real service rendered. 
Mr. Petritz and his· aides did a noble job of blocking (and mayhap some tackling) of the added starters, so that newspapermen who had come to cover were not forced instead, to take to cover. No more sh;ll this casual" vis­

Behind the Tearn 
T
HIS article is not concerned with the synthetic_ 
enthusiasm· of the pep session, the long-winded 
oratory, nor the bally-hoo of' school spirit. It purports simply to tell of the loyalty of Notre Dame ... that masculine, stolid, everlasting loyalty that is the tra­ditional legacy of Notre Dame men. 
Notre Dame backs its football teams. But it's not the torch-lit parades or the blaring of the Victory March, however idealistic, that typifies Irish enthusiasm and loyalty. It's the stuff behind that counts. School spirit means more to Notre Dame than a Drum Yell or holding aloft a blue and gold card betw~en the halves. 
They also serve who only sit and yell. 
Someone has called student celebrations the yard-stick or measu~ing block of school spirit. But in _the instance of the Carnegie Tech pep meeting, mile-stones would have proved an inadequate rule. · . 
There were 3,000 pushing, cheering young chaps stand­ing bare-headed in the Notre Dame gymnasium that night, shouting the praises of Knute Rockne and his boys. They pledged their loyalty then. And the next afternoon they proved it. School spirit ... wild s_houting ... a student body that backs its football team. The harder the battle, then so much the tougher is Notre Dame. 

That's what Tim Galvin had said that night...\V/e've met them toughbefore," he shouted...Notre Dame has al­ways met thcrri tough. But when they get tough, we get tougher!" The student body had liked that phrase. It sounded powerful. Things like that were built up only after generations of men had felt the same way. 
Ed Massa led the shouting; he originated. the Drum Yell; and he helped with Silent Cheering-for these three achievements he is justly deserving a word of praise. Like­wise to Joe Kennedy and to Dave Powers, who assisted. in the yell provoking antics of Cheer Leader Massa. 
Silent cheering was mentioned. Tim Beriitz, chairman of the S. A. C., started it. 800 students, garbed in white sweaters, held aloft cards of vari-colored hues at ·the half. In this manner they spelled· out, movie-like, such phrases as .. \V/ELCOME NAVY" and ..HELLO INDIANA." 
Notre Dame teams arc victorious because they fight until the finish. The student body shows its loyalty in the stand, win or lose, until the final whistle blows. Both of these. reasons are a. composite of why Notre Dame usually-wins.

The Real Notre Dame-­Has It Changed? 
· By FRANCIS \'fALLACE 
T
HIS is written the day after the Southern Cal­
ifornia game. \Vc have just put the boys on the 
train for a triumphant journey ·across the states; 

this climaxed an afternoon spent at the estate of Edward 
Doheny, a principalit)r in the hills of Hollywood as large 
as mythical Graustark and more royal tha·n McCutcheon 
ever, imagined; after leaving the Doheny place we travelled 
by inotor cop convoy to the Paramount lot; saw sweet 
Mary Brian looking disappointed as a little girl because 
plans went wrong and she couldn't be photographed with 
the boys. Then to Fox Hills-and saw movie stars looking 
at Carideo and handsome Tom Conley with the same adu­
lation football players give movie stars. Back to· the hotel 
to read how rabid Coast spo~ts writers break down and 
generously acknowledge that Notre Dame was two touch­
downs better than any ~cam ever coached. 
As I write, a radio in the ~ext room is playing the good 

ol~ Victory March; the Hike Song. The Ambassador, the 
Biltmore and other hotels arc strangely quiet after a wild 
night of celebration of the most modern version of the fall 
of Troy. 
Notre Dame is big stuff. The country is extremely aware 

of the sunshiny lawns of Notre Dame and acutely admir­
ing of everything which comes out of there. 'Newspapers 
will marvel for weeks; Collier's has just finished a series 
of articles by that great writer, King Knutc himself. Col.:­
legc Humor has just finished Huddle, my fiction story of 
Notre Dame fotball, and the story is out in book form and ·may be produced as a movie. 
A,nd I cannt help but compare all of this with the old 

days; to marvel at all of the changes which have taken 
place since I first came to South Bend and asked a copper 
where the Hill Street car came in. · 
That was in 1919. Rockne was jus_t a young football 

coach, beginning his remarkable career after a prep season 
during the S.A.T.C. war year. · 
The big games were with Ncbraska,·Purduc, Indiana and 
our good friend, the Army. If \'falter Eckcrsall gave us a 
writeup everybody was flattered ·and rushed to the old 
newsstand in the basement of the main building ... Those 
were the days when our fondest hope was someday to be 
admitted to the Big Ten. If a New York_ sport writer 
visited the campus it was a sensation. As a rookie rcpor_tcr 
I followed Lawrence Perry around wild-eyed . . . ·The 
radio was unknown then-and a magazine article about 
Notre Dame was the last thing any editor would imagine. 
The football field had wooden bleachers which seated 
2500: The student body comprised about 900. If we 
wanted to play Nebraska we had to go out to Lincoln 
every year -nobody ever thought of coming to Notre 
Dame to. play ... Rock was director of athletics, football 
coach, student manager, trainer,. business manager and 
what have you. His one-room office on the second floor 
of the main building was a hodge-podge littered with un­
answered corresoondence • .football equipment, one type­
writer and a roll-top desk against the wall; a desk which 
he never bothered to close. 
\Vhen we went down to the Armv there was one Pull­

man car-and all berths were, crowded. The army game 
was played at \Vest Point before 6000 people and there 
r--~----~~---. 

"For God, Country and Notre Dame" 

were no gate ·receipts . Joe Byrne and his fine old father were the angels who took us to the theatre and to a cabaret for dinner. If the stage comedian mentioned that the Notre Dame team was in the house it was a ter­rific thrill ... \Vhcn we went to Iowa in 1921 the squad made the trip in a day coach ... 20,000 people was a mammoth crowd at a game. The big home games were against Valparaiso, Depauw and Michigan Aggies. 
·Things have changed since the old days. The University has grown in size and prestige; the end is not in sight; Notre Dame has kept pace with its football teams. The· magnitude of its growth is apparent to anyone who visits the campus or re~ds the printed page or listens to comment 
· in any section of 'the country. 
But in all of this change some things have not changed; and these things which remain the same have caused the changes. 
Rock is still Rock; eleven years older and eleven years wiser; but the same keen brain, the same generous heart. the same simple compl~xity, ·the same hard fighter. and game sportsman. . The spirit is still there; the intangible· winning spirit; the democratic atmosphere; the close communion between player and student. · 
The boys have not changed. Tom Conley, Bert 1vletz­·ger, Tom Kassis, Frank Carideo, Marchy Schwartz and Marty Brill are the same types as George Gipp, Johnny 
Mohardt; Eddie Anderson, Chet \Vynne, Buck Shaw, Slip Madigan, Hunk Anderson and all of the older boys ... The Notre Dame athlete is still a hard-hitting, keen thinking chap on the field and a clca~-cut, healthy, modest boy in civics. 
The priests have not changed. Father O'Donnell is th'.! logical development of Father Cavanaugh, Father Burns anrl Father \Valsh. •· 
The bascmct?-t chapel has not changed. And I hope, that as the University continues to grow, it will never even be renovated. For there, where the casual campus visitor seldom goes,_ a spot about which the football public never reads, is to my mind, the real Notre Dame, the constant source of all its change.

E
VANSTON, ILL.-This is a tale of silence­interminable, boundless silence-ear splitting 
silence. Silence absolute. It is silence that clubs you, holds you, startles you. It is the silence of ·the Notre Dame dressing room, at the zero hour. 
This silence presses in on your car drums. It is strained, unreal. It seems eternal. W c arc in the halflight of a shadowy locker room, deep 
under Dyche stadium. The chalk white walls exude no sound. The pallid reflection from the high windows casts the shadows of the tall black lockers diagonally across the floor. ­
Faintly, through some remote opening, comes the echo of cheering from the crowded stands above. Only the echo breaks the stillness. 

Men, half a hundred of them, clad in the blue and gold of Notre Dame, arc here, waiting. They' arc in uniform, girded for war-grim war on the gridiron. War against and _undefeated and fea-red rival-Northwestern. Notre Dame men have had their short turn on the field for the brief warming up in an oval banked solid with tense humanity. Now they are back in their dressing rooi_U-waiting. Waiting the zero hour. In'_twenty minutes comes the kick-off when all this , repression will be cast aside-when smashing, crashing 'action will case this painful tension. 
The ·minutes tick away. No sound even from Knute 
here, but he is silent. The minutes tick away. I study the face of my watch. Yes; the hands really move. In this strained silence there is nothing to do but study the watch. In a ·restless moment I stir and the creaking of my chair resounds through the tomb-like quarters. Heads are turned but drop again. The men are occupied only with themselves. 
Now, only ten Iri.inutcs remain before the kick-off. Now nine, eight, seven-. \X'ill this silence never· end? Will Rockne never speak? The minutes tick away an'd the in­terminable silence continues: · 
Rockne moves. He looks at one of his men .but says 
nothing. He glances at another, but speaks not. ...Up!" 
Rockne's sharp co·mmand breaks the deathlike stillness. Instantly every man is on his feet. The silence· broken, the atmosphere is electrified. The men stand, eager, strain­ing, inwardly trembling.

is painting the scene in colors that are faded indeed. Each· minute every man expects to hc~r Rockne shatter the ·silence with some ·last minute ·instruction, some blast about the battle, but not a sound comes from Rockne.

my own cars his method of arousing his men.

more on silence than on any blistering lecture of any 
burning plea that even Rockne might make.

By jACK CANNON All-American Guard, 1929 

L.:
TTLE do spectators know of the value .of the football adage, .. keep your eye on the ball." I shall try in a brief way to tell of its importance. In the . 1929 season, Notre · Da·me was proclaimed national champions and many sport writers have termed that team, ..ball-hawks." They have writ­ten reams about its members' alertness in recovering fum­
bles, intercepting passes, . and JACK CANNON general following of the ball. By following the ball on 
every play, the Notre Dame· players easily lived up to their nickname. The Army game of 1929 was played on a frozen gridiron with spectators almost frozen to their seats. One of the· greatest thrills of the season was theirs as they watched the speed-demon, Jack Elder, race through the ferocious Army stalwarts for the coveted touchdown which meant glory for Elder and victory for the Fighting Dragons. 
Elder kep't his team's record from being marred by a scoreless tie by performing this marvelous feat, and the achievement was due entirely to his watching the ball all during the cold afternoon. So also, a lineman must not only ta.ke his opponents out of the play and tackle, but he must keep his eye riveted on the pigskin which passes to new life every tipte i~ is handled. 
Many hard fought, close games are lost because a player momentarily loses sight of the ball. In my opinion, the team that caused Notre Dame the most fright was the Carnegie Tech outfit which kept the ball in almost con­stant motion. Many of our players tackled the wrong man only to find too late that another back, several yar~s down the field was running with. the ball. Their attack was especially deceptive because of the gigantic size of the linemen who formed a visual barrier and enabled members of the rear works to handle the ball with ease. 
On offense, a team must always keep in mind the value of proper handling of the ball. The players must handle the _ball, gracefully, skillfully, and securely. Although most anyone can handle it fairly well with a little practice, it takes a smart player to handle the ball correctly at all times. 
I received the greatest thrill of my career when I pounced on a loose ball on the five-yard line during the · Southern __California game. \VIe were enabled to score our first touchdown when U. S. C. was leading us, 6 ·to 0. Little did I realize· the importance of the play at that ·time, but the 13 to 12 Notre Dame victory tells the story. In the few months I have coached at Alabama Polytech­nic Institute, my first experience in the coaching field has been successful because in ev~ry game. this football adage

Official Football Review-193 0 
According to Our 
Watch-Charm Guards 
By JOHN p. (CLIPPER) SMITH 
Captai11 and All-American Guard, 1927 
T
HE development of the open style of 
play, which found its first great popularity after the Army-Notre Dan:te .game of 1913 when Gus Dorias passed to Knute Rockne all afternoon for a 3 5 to 13 Notre Dame victory, has led to the increasing use o'f the small guard. 
The great Army game of 1913 saw the pass used exten­
. sively for the first time on an Eastern gridiron arid :from that game may be dated the 

rise of the open game used today. Spinners, reverses, ·end­around plays, passes, and wide end runs have· replaced the old, bruising mass plays in which the 200-pound guard was such a vital part. 
Notre Dame's famous coach, Rockne, first as a player and later as a mentor, has been largely responsible for this modern, scientific trend, and he is the one who started the idea of using the «watch charm" guard. Perhaps the most outstanding of these were Capt. John Law of the 1929 team and little Bert Metzger, who has been ac­claimed All-American, for his excellent work during the past season. Metzger won his distinction only after put-­ting to shame men who outweighed him by as much as 40 and 45 pounds, men who themselves were being touted for All-American honors. 
Because of his small size, Metzger had the speed which enabled him to drop out of the· line and cover rapidly on passes, or, on offense, to pull out and lead the interference on wide end runs.. He was also skilled at slipping through an opposing line to ..cold-kock" the ball-carrier before he got to the line of scrimmage, and at piling up a play when it was aimed at his part of the line. ·Several teams on the 1930 schedule boasting a heavy, powerful, full-back with plenty of drive, and using the \V/arner system, aimed ~heir whole offense at Metzger in "an effort to wear him down or sweep his 15 3 pounds aside. His versati~ity of· attack, however, upset all of them and as soon as he sa.w a power play coming his way, he merely dived across the legs .of the opposing center and ·guard and pile~ up the interfer­ence so that there was no hole to go through. 
A heavier man, of course, could do the same thing, but it would be impossible. for a 200-pounder to get out and. lead a set of swift backs, such as Rockne alwa.ys has, to the line of scrimmage on an end run. Pulling the guard out is dangerous· and many serious injuries ha.ve resulted from it. In 1929, Larry Mullins received the knee injury which slowed him up and possibly kept him from All­American honors, when a guard pulled out on the wrong pla.y and Mullins went crashing into him. The guard; was bruised a bit and Mullins was permanently handicapped.

The Apex of the Attack 
By ARTHUR (Bun) BoERINGER 
AII-America11 Center, 1926 
T
HE center position is one of those "nose in the mud" jobs; 

but along with that, it car­ries many fine points which can be brought out scientifi­cally by a man able to take hold in the proper manner and develop all its possibilities. 
I played center all the time I was in any competition, both in high school and at Notre Dame and I have become convinced that this position, like all others, is one which 
·requires ~ore than a season to master. 
My first coaches were Harry Mehrc, now head coach at Georgia, and Joe Brandy. Both were fine men to work with and Harry gave me my first taste of Notre Dame football. . He was a great center himself and a fine passer and he instilled.into me the cardinal principle of all good center play-that a center's first job is to pass the ball and pass it accurately at any distance and at any speed. 
I had hopes some day of getting to Notre Dame and just being a member of "Rock's" squad, and I don't think there was a happier kid in the world than myself when I finally found myself striving along with 100 others for 
· a. chance at big time football. Right· then and there I learned the value of' practice in perfecting passing. A center should throw the ball at a target until it becomes almost second nature with him to make the various kinds of passes. 
My first game was against Beloit and the opposition completed several passes in the territory I was supposed to be covering. I shall never forget the caustic remarks "Rock" made about me at the half. But his criticism was only an incentive to go out there and try · all the 
. harder to do the job right. 
Some of the points I think most ·important, both of­fensively and defensively; I shall try to outline. First, I shall mention passing. The spiral pass is used because, although it 'is harder to make, it is much more effective for speed, accuracy, and ball-handling. The ball is grip­ped by the strings with the right hand and it is given its direction by the left hand for right-handed passers. Good practice is :to swing the ball in an arc between the legs until .this motion is mastered. The weight of the body should never rest on the ball, but should be dis­tributed on the buttocks, and the feet should be as ncar parallel as possible. This stance, a natural one, will resist attack from any angle. Since most running plays go to the right, it is sometimes necessary to advance the right foot a trifle. The' center must master five kinds of passes: a short lob pass to a. back bucking straight in, a pass merely handing the ball to the quarter-back, a pass directly back

has just finished 
two years of 

competition without a de­feat against opponents which never once gave the Irish a chance to let down. For 19 consecutive games, the team was called upon to exhibit "High Test Football" in two of the hardest schedules any team has ever played. I firmly believe that no coach but 


Rockne could have taken any team through these man-FRANK CARIDEO killing contests undefeated. As quarter-back both years, it was my responsibility to direct the team's attack, only, however, after Coach Rockne had very carefully mapped the proc'edure of each game in his daily noon lectures. It was he, and not the quarter-backs who went through the scouting reports, mulled over the plays likely to be used by the opposition, and then set about to build up a defense to meet them. It was he, also, who told the quarter-backs how to dis­organize the defense of the opposition by varying plays. It was Rockne who developed what I believe to be the most dazzling array of offensive weapons the game has ever seen and then instructed the quarter-backs which ones to usc each game. \"'0"e were fortunate this season in having Southern Methodist as our first opponent. This team which had passed its way to three Southwest Conference champion­ships in three years with one of the game's most brilliant aerial attacks, gave us our baptism of fire against passes, and the long, accurate throws of Kattman impressed every man with the necessity of fast, complete covering. I think we learned more in this game about defending against passes than fifty lectures could have .told us. Then came · N a.vy and we got our first taste of the \Varner wing-back type of offense in which the spinner, reverse, and man-in-motion formations play such a vital part. After Navy came Carnegie Tech, much more power­ful and with its attack-based on the \Varner system­which was developed to a high point of perfection and interspersed with plays of Coach \'{Tally Steffan's own making. Pittsburgh presented a combination of \Varner, Steffan and Coach Jock S1;1therland in its offensive make-up, but the predominating phase of the Pitt attack was \Varner's system which we had already met· and defeated in two games. Thus, it was not much of a problem to form a defense for the Panthers. Indiana came the next week and again we had to re­organize our defense to meet the tricks Pat Page had in his elaborate. system. Against Pen~sylvania, we ·found the \~_arner system again and were ready for it. Ossie Solem.

Official Football Review-193 0 York Daily News and to write on t'1e changes which have· 1 
taken place since his day.
An. Editorial 
T 
. . 
HE fighting men of Notre Dame, taught to 
fight scientifically and effectively by Coach 
Rockne, have completed another year of foot­ball exploits which bring new laurels and new glory to the feet of Our Lady, whose bea.utiful·image, posed at the top of the Main building of the campus, is a. constant source of inspiration to all men of Notre Dame. 
The plaudits these men have received, the roar of the crowds whose sympathies lie with Notre Dame opponents, and the unfailingly flattering accounts of their games by the sports writers: of the nation from coast to coast are undoubtedly more':impressive than anything Official Foot­ball Review can say in its all too unworthy gesture .of recognition to these warriors. 
Many of the nation's :finest writers and most recognized authorities, however, have cooperated with the staff to make this R(:view what we confidently feel is our best effort, and in:·the publication of the 1930 issue we feel that we have coine closer to our ideal than ever before. We wish to take this opportunity to ·thank our friends who gave generously of their time and talents and contributed gladly without the least question of monetary return. 
One of the best known sports ca.rtoonists in the coun­try, the one at least we think is the best~ is Feg Murray whose striking drawings are syndicated to papers through­out the country. He contributed his genius and ·much of his valuable time to the Review to make the impressive sketch which appears on page 61. 
\Varren Brown, sports editor of the Chicago Herald­Examiner, who delights each Fall in singing the praise of Rockne and Notre Dame both in his scintillating column and in his news stories, became so effusive about the Notre Dame press box one day that we asked him to write us a story about it. \Ve still feel, in spite of his statement that ..The rap is a bum one," that his scathing article in the 1928 Review concerning the old Cartier :field press coop led directly to the new elaborate box for scribes. 1 
Bert McGrane, of the Des Moines Register-Tribu11e, which by some miracle of management boasts a circula­tion twice the size of its town, one day dropped in. on Notre Dame to write a series of feature articles about the university from a number of different angles. All were so good that the North American Newspaper Alliance carried them throughout the country and we secured Bert's kind permission to reproduce what we thought to be his best, his description of .. silence that grips you", for our readers. 
A number of prominent writers who formerly attended Notre Dame were so moved by school spirit and perhaps a touch of pride in the 1930 team that they have sent in their works for your approval. Arch \Vard, sports editor of the Chicago T,ribu11e, took enough time off from his very pressing duties· to tell how tradition was built at Notre Dame. He was here when tradition was in the making and it was his work as Notre Dame's first pub­licity director, that did much to put the team before the public eye 1when Rockne was first gaining recognition with his great teams. He really knows his ·subject, and his way of putting ideas on paper is marvelous, no less, to us. 
Frank \Vallace, a later publicity director at the school, and the author of Huddle, a novel dealin~ with Notre Dame's heroes, traditions, and customs, which was recentlv released in book form after its enthusiastic reception in College Humor, consented gladly to let us use his descrip­tion of the Northwestern game which was in the New

He must have been rather able himself to win his mythical laurels. Finally, Frank Carideo, the keen, I icalculating, inspiring field general of the 1928-29-30 ! elevens, who twice has had the laurel wreath came to rest i I on his classic brow, has reviewed the 193 0 season and has I told some of the "inside" on what makes Notre Dame win. !

'  Ray Morrison brought to Notre Dame to open unofficially a new  
era  in Notre Dame football history.  Their record of winning

their reputation as perhaps the leading exponent of the forward

Ed Kosky and Tommy Yarr, left end and center respectively, both rose from no­where to fame with the varsity, quietly, un­obtrusively, and stamped themselves great in the first game. ·

Every school has its traditions whether they be social, scho­lastic, athletic, or spiritual. Probably no unwritten la.w of athletics is more deep-seated than that which says no Notre Dame team loses a game on its home field. From 1905 until 1928, there was no violation of this rule, but the last game played at home before the old Cartier field stands were razed and the new stadium was built, saw a powerful Carnegie Tech football ma­chine roll over a game, but weakened band of Fighting Irish who had spent themselves the week before defeating Army's great 1928 eleven. '

Fletcher and Highberger! These two names had become watch-words in the Notre Dame training camp before the Car-: negie Tech game because they belonged to two Skibo tackles who had two years of experience behind them. Rosenzsweig and· ·_ · Flanagan! ·These. were the two Carnegie ends, each of whom had two years also.

Indiana and Notre Dame started to play football together in 1899, and they have played off and on ever since.'

Notre Dame, Ind., Nov. I.-A doughty little band of warriors, the best that Pat Page was able to muster, invaded the home of the Fighting Irish here today and for the first ,30 minutes repulsed everything the Notre Dame boys flung at them. But the odds were· too great, and in the second half of the contest, the ..Rockmen" unleashed an attack that would not be stopped, and game finally ended 
with the Irish having piled up 27 points to Indiana's 0. 
A fighting line, evidently out to do or die, surprised the I 5,000, spectators and perhaps surprised themselves, by holding the second Irish eleven scoreless for 20 mi_nutes and 
the first team without points for the re­maining 10 minutes of its stay in the second quarter.

A lot of words must have been said during the intermission, for Notre Dame came out with a. bang and before the period was half over Savoldi had literally driven through the Hoosiers for 3 3 yards and a touchdown. ·

these scores by Brill were the first he has made since he 
became a member of the Notre Dame team. But when he . decided to do a little scoring, he surely did it up right, for 
he drove and drove with all the power his sturdy legs could 
muster until he had crossed the line ~or his first touchdown. 
Brill Scores Twice In ~aking the second he had to share the glory with Marchy Schwartz, who on the first play after the kickoff 
ran the ball from his own 20-yard marker through the entire Indiana. team to Indiana's two-yard line. 
It was a magnificent run and had he been faster he would have gone over the line before Ross pulled him down from behind with a flying tackle It didn't matter, for Brill carried it over two pla.ys later. 
The first quarter was a rather dull affair ·with both teams blocking and tackling well. 
During the second quarter the game opened up some­what, with Koken getting away for 19 yards around his right end, carrying the ball t~ India:ta's 20-yard strip. 
Notre Dame, however, was held for downs and the blll was kicked out of danger. 
Play see-sawed back and forth for a few minutes until the first eleven came in and began to batter away. ·The Hoosier line began to give, but strength­ened to hold the first stringers in mid­field as the second period ended. 
Brill's Scoring Debut . 
This was the end of the great Indiana stand. Not long after the fireworks began to go off in the form of runs by Savoldi, Schwartz, .Brill and Carideo. These four battering rams, with the fine assistance of the Irish forwards, kept hammering away at the Crimson line 

until it broke long enough to let Big Joe through for his 33-yard drive and the first marker. Not long· after Schwartz cut loose with his goalward ­jaunt, netting him 26 yards and· another touchdown. 
Brill skirted the left flank to score his initial marker for Notre Dame. He followed this score with another a few moments later after Schwartz had run 78 yards to the 2­yard stripe by circling wide his left flank and driving over the final line in the embrace of two tacklers.

It was· the finest run a football field has ever seen, and it shattered the Red and Blue. From that point on, with Frank Caridco directing the attack, Brill, Savoldi and Schwartz ran wild. They carried the ball as far as they wanted to run. They crashed through for 15 yards and they galloped for 40.

One of them was to the strong Oregon Aggies, another to Marquette on two intercepted passes in the closing minutes of pla.y, and the third was a one-point loss to Missouri.

"\'\'hen the going gets tough, that's when we like it!" Many arc the times Knutc Rockne has thundered this exclamation at his Notre Dame warriors when experts were picking them to lose to an unusually strong opponent, or at the half of a game when the tide of victory was ebbing. Shaking his head vehemently and biting off every word so that it resounded and vibrated through the otherwise perfect quiet of a locker-room or class room at his noon lecture, "Rock" has stirred his men .with this phrase so that they have gone out time and again to do the impossible.

1930 marks another new era in managing at Notre 

Dame. The completion of the new stadium brought new 
'problems to the organization. There were traffic prob­
lems both within and without the stadium, an ushers body 
to perfect, thousands of minor matters to be taken care of. 
Daniel D. Halpin was football manager during the past 
season. Under his guidance the stadium affairs and team 
care was done in an incomparable fashion. Joseph A. 
Lauerman was the associate manager in charge of the team 
at practice and in games. John F. Saunders handled the 
stadium arrangements and assisted in the details of the 
season's work. These three managers have brought a 
greater perfection to the group than it has ever. known. 
\Vith the opening of the new stadium and the subse­
quent swelling of crowds at home games, the training of 
an efficient body of some 1000 ushers was one of the 
greatest problems the managers had to meet. Most of the 
responsibility for the handling of the home game crowds · 
fell on the shoulders of Associate Manager Saunders, al­though Dan Halpin, as head manager, had the final word on everything that was done. Prospective ushers who had answered an invitation in the South Bend news­papers to serve in this capacity, in return for which work ~hey were admitted free to each game and automatically . made members of an Usher's club such as many of the eastern schools boast, were sifted down, their qualifi­
cations were considered by those in charge, and only the cream of the thousands who reported were used: 
Some idea of the great mass of work which fell upon the shoulders of the managers during the past season may be gained by a consideration of the various things they had to do during the week preceding the Army game. The game was in the nature of a home game for Notre Dame, but that fact didn't belie the necessity of moving the team and its equipment to Chicago. The usual reservations and accomodations for the visiting team had to be made. All. of this came in the· usual run of business for the week. In addition, though, the managers took care of all arrange­ments for the team of ex-Notre Dame stars who played another group of ex-Northwestern luminaries in a charity game at Soldier Field Than~sgiving Day. A reserve team played in Nashville that same day and the trip had to be handled by the same mangers. Finlly, two teams from the interhall league played out of town games that day. Hotels, meals, transportation, equipment, and a multitude of smaller details had to be p_rovided for for each of these games. 
Senior managers of other sports for the year have served during the football season as assistants to the football managers. Cross country in the fall.was::ably handled ~y Tom R. Ashe, manager of all minor sports. The basket­ball team will be under the management of John Hughes. Winter and spring track will be managed by C. Bourke Motsett, and baseball by Robert C. Balfe. . 
The junior managers, important cogs in the machine, are six in number: John Colville, John Grams, Joseph McKeon, John Ross, Charles Spangenburg, and Charle~ \Veiss. Together with the undergraduate managers, these men round out a most efficient body, one deserving ·praise.

The Band 

U
NDER the leadership of Prof. Joseph Casas­. anta, the University Band has finished another 
. successful season. The 82-piece organization played before the crowds at the five home games, besides making the Northwestern and Army trips to. Evanston arid Chic.ago with the football team. 
It is safe to say that no bancl in the country faced the keen competition that the Notre Dame musical unit did during the past season. The small but highly entertaining Southern Methodist band was on hand in the opening game, while the justly famous Kiltie band of Carnegie Tech was the next to engage in a musical duel with the Casasanta men. Indiana's celebrated .. Marching Hundred," one of the finest collegia.te bands in the coun­try, and Northwestern's colorful and capable musicians, were the other bands to share the football field with th~ Notre Da1:11e organization. 
In deference to the .. silent cheering" system which was inaugurated this year between the halves of the home and Army games, the Band gave up the marching activi­ties it hitherto had performed at those times. This doe:> not mean, however, th~t Director Casasanta dispensed with all drilling this year, for, on the contrary, the band learned more intricate· formations than ever before and went through them before the games instead of between the 
halves. One of these, which was featured at the Carnegie 
Tech and Northwestern games, was the spelling· of the 
word .. Irish". The Band also formed the initial of each 
visiting team. 
The group was equally active in regard to musical drill. 
In addition to learning the school songs of the opposing 
teams on the . schedule, the men practiced classical music 
in connection with their work as a concert band. Every 
year after the football season, they. give several concerts. 
The Band also took an important part. in the special 
events which occurred during the season. Their rendition 
of .. Anchors Aweigh" greeted the Navy officials when 
the new stadium was formally dedicated. They also pro­
vided a musical welcome for Cardinal Patrick Hayes, Arch­
bishsop of· New York; when he visited the campus to 
dedicate the Law building. In addition, they were much 
in evidence at the pep meetings which were held. · 
The organization was headed by Vigilius Phillips, presi­
dent; John \Veibler, vice-president; and Albert Stewart, 
Junior officer. Henry Tholen again led the ,marching 
musicians as drum major. · ' 
Prof. Casasan~a's own compositions figured prominently -in the Band's repertoire. ..\Xlhen Irish Back.s Go Marching 
By" ·was featured. Father Eugene Burke, C,S.C., col­
laborated with Casasanta in this composition.

cc H0\V about a pair of sweat socks?" ..Just out." 
This is the song so familiar to every a thlctc

Theirs is a thankless job; they· arc always m the middle. These men must be masters of tact, firmness, and discrimination. The phenomenal growth of the size of the squad and the type of equipment used by Notre Dame athletic teams have made the equip­ment job an important one. There is a slogan which is always adhered to when equipment is purchased; ..Noth­ing ·is too good for the Irish." The results of such treat­ment, as records show, need no explaining. 
During the first three years of the Rockne regime, ..Rock" himself issued all the equipment so necessary to the man who is going out to get himself shoved about. As the squad grew larger, Coach Rockne found himself unable to attend to everything alone,· and the first equip­ment custodian was used. The job has passed in rapid succession through the hands of the following men; Johnny Mohardt, _Morrie Starrett, Rolang Gucnin, Leo Sutliffc, Max Houser, Jim Stewart,' Pat Canny, Botts Crowley, and Joe Canny. . · 
The old equipment room used to be where the manager's office now stands, with its old picket fence, bulging wooden shelves and equipment cluttered floor. The lack of space is afforded brought about the building of the new, enlarged, all-steel storage room. From this room 400 football men, 1,000 track men, 85 basketball men and 100 baseball men arc equipped during the year. This docs not include the interhall material. There is a complete drug store in this room; in fact, there is everything from corn pads to. shoe laces. _ 
. Much of the success of the team depends upon its cquio­mcnt and the way in which it is handled so much credit. must be given to uKcg" and uTony" for keeping the best equipped team in the country fully supplied at all time~. 
The Trainers 
T
HE s~aff of the trainers constitutes one of the 
mos_t In;tportant parts of any major football or­
. gamza~10n. \Vhcn such an organization, how­

ev.cr, IS m th_c .thick of the fight for a national champion­
ship, the trammg staff takes on even greater importance 
and may even prove to be the deciding factor in the team's 
success or failure. It was under this pressure tbat the 
Notre Dame training staff had to work d~ring the past 
season. 
The personnel· of this staff consisted of Dr. Frank 
Summers ~and Dr. Edward Su~mers, team physicians; 
~ugcnc (S.crap-Iron) Young, tramer; Ray De Cook, as­
sistant tr~mer; Gene Howery, assistant trainer; and Joe 
Kurth, assistant trainer. Kurth's activities on the football 
team prevented him from doing his share of the trainers' 
work, but he took up these duties after the season closed. 
"Scrap-Iron" Young, the head trainer, is a familiar and 
colorful figure in N otrc Dame athletics. Back in his own ~ndergraduate days, when he was a member of the track t~am as a two-milcr,. Young built up a reputation for ·himself as an "iron man." His favorite trick was to set up the bleachers for· a meet, and then go out and win the grueling two-mile event. Assistant Trainer De Cook is one of Coach Keogan's veterans on the basketball floor while Gene Howery, another assistant, is captain of th~ 
cross-country team and also a monogram man in track. 
While there were no broken bones for the team physi­
cians to care for, there were ·the usual number of cuts 
bruises, pulled muscles, sprains, dislocations and othc;
. . . ' 
mi.nor lllJUn~s-:-to say ~othing of several black eyes. The sk1ll of a trammg staff IS largely determined by its ability to c~re, for these. minor injuries and to prevent 'them from kcepmg the players out of the game. · 
One of the little dramas which occurred during the sea­
son in connection with the training crew came when 
Frank Carideo was injured in a practice session 'before the 
Carnegie Tech game. The All-American quarter-back was 
carried to the dressing room in an unconscious condition. 
Besides the trainers who were working anxiously over 
Carideo, Coach Rockne and members of the team were 
gathered around the injured star. \Vhen Caridco failed to 
respond to efforts to revive him, fear was held out that he 
had suffer~d a concussion. Just when everyone was al­
most convmced that the worst had happened, Carideo sat 
up and snapped out: "Get away, this is. a. ball game!" His 
ailment was merely a good, old-fashioned knockout. 
The methods of the trainer necessarily differ with the 
individual who is injured. \Vhilc it is extremely difficult 
to deal with some players when they arc hurt others arc 
ideal patients. It is a somewhat common, th~ugh never­
the less. praiseworthy oc~u~rcncc. for a player to cover up 
the scnousncss of an lllJUry m order to avoid being 
be.nched. \~hen,.. for exa~Rle, Tom Kassis cracked up 
With a chargmg Mustang m the opening game and re­
ceived a cut over his eye, he was extremely reluctant to 
leave the fray. M~dical treatment, however, proved that 
the cut was no ordmary one, and three stitches· had to be 
t:1kcn. 
Marty Brill and Tom Conley arc planning on starting a boys' camp near their home town of Philadelphia next summer. "Marty's capital and my brains" smiles Tom

The Answer to Notre Dame Football 
By LAWRENCE PERRy 
(CojJyrigbt, 1930 Soutb Beud Tribuue.) 
E\V YORK, Dec. 9.-As the amazing nar­always-made no difference. No boy, whatever his relig­
.N 
rative of that Notre Dame-S~uthern Calif­
orma game at Los Angeles· came over the radio into an uptown club on Saturday a man who follows n~tional football closely and whose opinions are not only bulwarked by knowledge of the game but by broad-minded points of view turned to a group of friends shrugging: 
"\Vhat is the answer to this Notre Dame football? You will say material. You will say coaching. You will say greater opportunity for extended practice sessions. All true. But Southern California, for instance, has no lack of the best material, has all necessary time for practice, has an excellent coach. So have other universities met and defeated by N ot~e Dame in the last two years. No, there 
is something  over  and above  those  things, something  as  
elusive  as  It  is  irresistible.  I  don't  know  what  it  is.  
\Vho does?  

The writer thinks he does. That mysterious element which inspires and informs Notre Dame play is a great underlying motive, an organic impulse that transcends sport and involv;es all that is highest in the human soul. Notre Dame football, to be explicit, is inspired by a cause and that cause is their religion. By this is not meant a fiery, indomitable impulse to prove that it takes a Roman Catholic football outfit to play the best football there is. Not at all. The impulse is deeper than that. 
These Notre Dame players are expressing upon the foot­ball field what religion means to them individually. Every game they play is built upon a sub-structure of religious aspiration. This is an. age of sophistication, so called. So there will be many, no doubt, who will smile at the above. \'{/'ell, let such as these be not too sure in their amusement. There is a lot more in life, in football, than your so­phisticate dreams of in his philosophy. There are stupendous things in human life which are not seen, which cannot be gripped and felt. 
To just what saint th;tt particular Southern California. game was dedicated by·. Notre Dame the writer docs not know. But it was dedicated to some Saint. «All games are. And whether a· Notre Dame player was a Roman Catholic or l>rotestan-there were both on this outfit, as

ious affiliation~ can come in contact with electricity and 
not feel it. 
In which connection is the story told by Ray Miller, a Notre Dame grad, now district attorney in Cleveland, Ohio. A player in the Notre Dame dressing room before a game in which the odds were ag~nst the Irish suggested that they say a little prayer before going out on the field. That player was George Gipp, son of a Methodist clergy-' man. The prayer was; offered and the boy who made it was Chet \'\lynn, son of a Baptist clergyman. There y.eu have the Notre Dame idea. 
. Knute Rockne. is a great coach, the greatest, and he has a sure knowledge of the heart of man and how to get into 
· his soul. But it rriay be suspected that not even he gets to the deep underlying reasons of all that his men accom­plish. Perhaps only the saintliest of priests do; those who · have walked in wisdom all the years and see through the veil.

No doubt the Navy will reveal this against \Vest Point next Saturday. But Notre· Dlme is always consistent. \Vithout fail, week after week, the. players. express 1 die best that is in them; and year after year. · 
Did you ever sec or hear of a Notre Dame player who 

-· played dirty football? Did you ever hear of an unsports­manlike Notre Dame team? Did you ever see a drunken Notre Dame student in the stands at a game? The .answers inevitably lie in the negative. Did you ever meet a Notre Dame man who was ashamed to believe in something eter­nally definite? Here, one. thinks, may be the answer to Notre Dame football. 
Only four teams scored against Notre Dame first tean.1 last season. They were Southern Methodist, Carnegie Tech, Drake, and Army. The Cadets' score followed a blocked kick and the others were· from scrimmage. Non'! of these teams -scored more than once against the varsity;

eleventh minute of play. Carideo added the extra point with a place ~ick. Within three minutes Notre Dame's un­ending pressure paved he way for the second score. On a bad pass from center on his own 33-yard line, Duffield scooped the bobbling ball, took a quick look at the end and half-back bearing down on him on his own 45-yard line, and quickly kicked it over his own goal. 
The. Trojans' howl of glee over this quick witted action had not died down when Notre Dame, lining up, shot Schwartz, Brill, and Carideo over the position of Bob Hall, Trojal! tackle, and O'Connor, the dark horse full-back, rode· through the opening on an 80-yard touchdown dash. The Irish came back to score again early in the third period. 
Schwartz took the ball from his own 3 0-yard line to Southern California's 12 in two efforts, with Brill con­tributing a 3-yard gain. A penalty advanced the oval to the 7-yard line and the Irish nearly lost the ball when O'Connor fumbled. However, he recovered and on the 

·next play took a lateral pass from Schwartz and eluded three tacklers on his way across the goal. Carideo kicked goal. The fourth touchdown, coming in the last four minutes of play, was engineered by the combined second and third string, with Jaskwhich replacing Carideo and Lukats in at half for Schwartz. · 
\Vhen Notre Dame was held for downs, Mohler tried 

-a desperate Southern California pass from his own 20-yard line. Hanley intercepted, however. Then Dan bucked twice to the 11-yard line, and from there Lukats drive through a hole -as big as a roundhouse in the left side of the Trojan line.

that Rockne teams arc as magnificent in defending as in attacking. After striking the vital blow, the Irish were smarter and stronger than their rivals and proved their superiority convincingly.

The term "Fighting Irish," originated in 1909 when Michigan was beating Notre Dame, 3 to 0. .Pete Vaughn, disgusted at Notre Dame's poor showing, shouted, "\'{!hat's the matter with you guys?

Charles (Polly) Humber, in addition to his steady, hard play, gives him a slight edge on the other brilliant right guards, however; and John ~aker, ·of Southern California, who is among the outstanding all­American left guard candidates as we go to press, played inspired ball which marked him as great even in the crushing Notre Dame victory. His work all season won him recognition from the experts and he proved his. merit when the going was toughest. 
Capt. John Dreshar of Carnegie was another_ fine leader who played this position, Zeller of Indiana was the spark­plug of the Hoosier .line and he even step_eed into the backfield on occasion to carry the ball; \Villson of Penn not only played a bang-up offensive game which stood out brilliantly in Notre Dame's 60 to 20 triumph, but, he proved himself the best open-field runner on the team · when he grabbed off a poor punt and ran it from mid­field to the seven-yard line after shaking off a half-dozen tacklers. 
At ·center, \Valda Don Carlos, the nonchalant Drake warrior who wa~ chosen on last year's Review team stood out head and shoulders above any pi~oi: men other teams had to offer. Against Notre Dame, he made three-fourths of the tackles of his team, his passing was accurate, he covered well on passes, and he exemplified everything a roving center should. \Vith apparent ease, he broke up Notre Dame's strongest running plays and he showed un­erring instinct in following the most intricate of Rockne formations. Playing with a better-known club, he un­doubtedly would be all-American. Ducanis, of Carnegie Tech, was a veteran ball-snapper who also played con­sistent ball all season; Miller of Army played an· inspired game against Notre Dame, Clark of Northwestern formed the nucleus of a strong Northwestern line, and \Villia.mson of Southern California, Eagle of Penn, and Daugherty of Pittsburgh are all worthy of consideration. 
Almost every team Notre Dame met boasted a smart, able field general, but the brilliant leadership of the ..mighty atom," Drake's Capt. Lynn King, who led his· Bulldogs against Notre Dame· in spite of the fact that two bones in his left hand were broken, makes him stand out above the rest. He slashed the powerful Irish line with a fury th~t usually does not _go with a signal caller; he ·threw passes, he caught passes, and he directed the com­plicated Drake attack like a master. He was probably second only to Notre Dame's all-American Carideo, as he led his little band through a rigorous season. He always provided the punch and the ccpepper" that makes the Bull­
dogs the colorful group they are. . 
Official Football Review-193 0 

Carver of Army, Duffield and Mohler of Southern Cal­ifornia, Capt. Brubaker of Indiana, Capt. Baker of Pitts­burgh, Lee Hanley of Northwestern, McCurdy of Carnegie Tech, and Graupner of Penn all played credit­ably and there was little to choose between them. None, however, had the brilliancy of King. 
The half-back position presented a problem and there was no end o.f discussion before \Vcldon (Speedy) Mason of Southern Methodist, and Howard Eyth of Car­negie Tech were nomina-ted for first string ranking. Both, 
:howevet·, are excellent triple-threat men, staunch de­fenders, and real fighters. It was Eyth who made the ­longest run of the year· against Notre Dame, a cut through the center of the line which fooled the Irish secondary and sent him speeding 72 yards to a touchdown. He and ·Mason were perhaps the best open-field runners Notre Dame met and both were excellent passers and pass receivers. Both the Mustang and Skibo attacks were based on speed and deception and the work of these two m.en fitted in exactly with their coaches' demands. 
Tschirgi and Kirn of Navy, Frentzcl of Army, Van Katen and his substitute, Lansrud, of Drake; Bruder of Northwestern, Pinckert and Apsit of U. S. C., Kattman of Southern Methodist; Opasik of Indiana, Heller and \Villiams of Pittsburgh, and Perina, Gentle and Masters of Pennsylvania were also impressive against Notre Dame and throughout the season. 
There was little doubt that hard-hitting Reb Russell of Northwestern, ·who alone did enough ground-gaining to keep the \Vildcats pressing into Notre Dame territory in the first half, was the outstanding full-back of the season.. Although he was knocked out by Schwartz's vicious tackle in the first period, he ·got up and came back as strong· as ever with a determination and drive that was not to be denied. He took plenty of punishment "but, as the scouts had warned, .. he liked it," and he retaliated with plenty ·of his own. His tackling and blocking was above aver­age but his fine ,crashing alone was enough to make him good enough for any man's all-American. 
Hopper of Southern Methodist, who was· a good' pass receiver as well as an excellent plunger; .. Bull" Karcis of Carnegie Tech; Hood of Pittsburgh, Hagberg of Navy, and Musick and Shaver of Southern California, were also. mentioned prominently by the coaches, players, and scouts for all-Opponent honors.

Notre Dame, 60i Penn, 20 
(Continued from p3gc 77) 

They had a great line giving them a chance and they had as fine blocking and all-around interfering as any backs could ask for. They simply ran amuck. 
The four horsemen· averaged around 162 pounds. This Notre Dame backfield to-day averaged around 190 pounds and it was just as fa~t as the four horsemen. Pennsylvania never had a chance. If Rockne had cared' to. keep. in his first string he could. ha.ve run the score up to 90 or 100 points. As it was; his first string averaged better than this final counting for the time they were in. There was, however, a big drop to his second and third strings. It was against these reserves that Penn scored three touch­downs. Two came on forward passes to Perina over the goal line. The other came on a short buck ·after a series . of fumbles on botp sides that finally gave Penn its third c_hance. 
Reserves Are Much Below Par 

Penn's attack was helpless a.gainst Notre Dame's first string. It couldn't make a first down. It had difficulty in gaining inches. But it carried the ball well against the reserves, who were far below the top layer of talent. Brill alone scored three touchdowns and two of them came on long shifting, exciting runs where he showed everything a fine back needs. He weaved and shifted. He used a killing straight arm. He worked his way through with a cool head and he always had the ablest possible support. 
As ball carriers Savoldi and Schwartz were only a step away. They ran with great speed and driving power. They were hard to stop, even when tackled cleanly. They 
.. 
held their feet and kept plowing on and they were fas't enough to swerve and follow the interference provided. This first string Notre Dame team was something to look at in football. It is so far beyond anything the season has shown there is no comparison for here you have strength, bulk, power and ama~ing speed, all ably directed by one of the great quarter,-backs of the day, and in ~ront they had a forward wall that charged and slashed and opened up and did a great all around job. Brill, Schwartz and Savoldi ran up three touchdowns before you could b~eathe twice after Brill got started. The first string· scored 28 points against Penn in less than two periods. Penn's only battle with Notre Dame was with the second and third string entries, who had rough sailing. 
Didn't Need Passes 

Notre Dame made most of its distance by the running game. Few passes worked on either side. Notre Dame had no need of passes when almost every other play was good for a touchdown, once the Irish got warmed up and on their way. Notre Dame led, 28 to 0, at the end of the second period. Then Penn _scored on the second team through a long run by \Villson and a forward pass to Perina. 
But when Penn began to get busy again, Rockne rushed back his first string and a.gain the wild stampede headed by Brill and ably supported by. Savoldi, Schwartz and Mullins, started all over again. 
\Vhen ·his team had 53 points, made in less than 3 0 minutes of actual play, Rockne again gave his reserves a chance and again Penn got going. But the gap was too wide. The first battalion had left Pennsylvania slaughtered on the field as 80,000 spectators looked at the best team they had ever seen.

Watch-Charm Guards 
. (Continued from p~gc 62) 
Again, the guard may catch the signal wrong and pull out to the wrong side and collide .with the other guard comi~g out from that side with all the power and speed 
··that h~ can muster. Toin Kassis was injured early in the season when this happened and his head cracked against a reserve guard's helmet opening a long gas4 above his eye. 
\'{Then I was playing at Notre Dame, Rockne had an unusually slow-thinking reserve guard on t~e squad, but an injury to the regular guard and this man's great fight­
·ing spirit put him up with the varsity in practice. In the excitement of the day, he immediately went blank above the $boulders, and started pulling out and staying in at exactly the wrong tiine. Rock was exasperated for a while, then his quick wit came to the rescue . 
. .. \Vheriever an end run is called and. he is not supposed to pull out," he told me, uyou holler •NO!' as loud as you can. \Vhen he is supposed to pull out, holler •YES! '­and next year we'll use letters instead of numbers for signals. Numbers seem to confuse the boys." 
I guess Rock has been threatening to make this change ­ever since, but if he can continue to have guards· as smart as Cannon and Law of the 1929 team, and as brainy as Kassis and Metzger of the 19 3 0 eleven, he need not worry. 
Although he fumbled once and recovered for no gain, 
.Bucky O'Connor averaged ~ 0.9 yards on his 10 ·trips with the ball against Southern California. His 109 yards were almost as many as the entire Trojan team made.

to the punter, a pass with a. lead to a shifting back going off· tackle or around end, and ·a. pass with a lead for runs and passes from punt formation. The ball must be thrown at just .th~ right tiine and in the right direction or it will 
. throw the backoff stride and perhaps raise him up, thus destroying the effectiveness of the play. · 
. On offense, the center must learn to charge and pass. in one continuous motion and to block a hole left by an interfering lineman pulling out. · He must also know the characteristics of his backs' and know just how to· .. feed" the ball to them. If the backs have confidence in the center, they can concentrate on more vital things. 
The center's defensive play is also invaluable to his team ·if he can back up the line well against both running plays and passes. His first job is to watch where the ball goes and, with that as a tip-off as to what he may expect,-he ·either stays in the line, pulls out to bolser up he flanks, or ··drops back to defe~d against passes by covering a certain man or zone. He must keep always before him the tactical ·situation,~ such as the down, the distance to go, t~e position of the ball on the field, the score, the ~~me to go, and so on. 
His ·hardest defensive job is covering on passes for he must first hit the line so that he cari go on through if necessary, then he must pick out his man or zone and drop 

.back to pick up the receiver.. If his man is very fast, this is difficult, but with experience it becomes easier. The .a~erage back will give away the play by some little man­nerism which the center can pick up by careful watching.

has been in the minds of my men. A large number of 
early season games arc lost when fumbling teams have · 
their .bobbles recovered by a ball-hawk among the oppo­. sition which capitalizes on the y:trds gained in the misplay. 

· A great deal of the glory once the ball-hawk's has been taken· away since 1928 because members of the Rules Committee in that year amended the fumble rule so that a recovered fumble cannot be advanced by the defensive ' team, thus making it less dangerous for the team that fumbles often. 
Baylor University used to terrorize its_ opponents with 
the famous hidden ball trick nearly 20 years ago. The 
quarter-back took the baH from center, placed it on the guard's leg, and there it remained until the defensive team ·had drifted toward the faking half-back; then the end or wing-back would swing around and sco6p it up and on very few occasions was he stopped short of a touchdown. 
Ever-changing offenses, always · more intricate than 
those that have gone before, make the old adage more 
worthy of stress than ever before. Some years ago, Field­
ing H. (Hurry Up) Yost of Michigan strongly maintained 
that the player who recovers fumbles is an idler and a 
loafer. Otherwise, Yost insisted, he would have been in 
the midst of a 'play and not lurking around where he 
would be in position to recover. This is unsound reason­
'ing because all defensive players strive to get at the ball­
carrier or the ball itself. Yost's influence at the time led 
Official Football ~e~iew-1930 
indirectly to the rule preventing a defensive player from advancing a recovered fumble . 
Rockne, our own famous coach, emphasizes his first defensive prjciplc: ((Hound the ball!" 
The development of football offensive in so far as the hidden ball, spinning, . and . other machinations of the offense are concerned, has reached such a perplexing stage that I think I may predict safely for the future that each backfield will be ad9rned with bushy mustachios and beards in which the ball may be hidden securely. To meet· this wrinkle, it is not impossible to be~ieve that the defen­sive team will needs have large combs as a part of their equipment. Some day, perhaps, Notre Dame will win from Army by out-combing the Cadets.

with his Drake Bulldogs, again presented a new style. of play in which only two backs carry the ball and two others do the blocking. Drake, in spite of its lack ~f national recognition, had one of the smoothest-working offenses we met all season and it was one of the three teams to score at all on the varsity from scrimmage. Army also scored on us, but their touchdown came on a blocked kick and recovery. 
Northwestern and Army both employed the \Varner style of attack and the former offered more power while the Cadets had more deception.· It was fortunate for us, in a way, that Army came after Northwestern for the campus was covered with nearly two feet of snow and outside practice was impossible before that game. 
Perhaps the most deceptive, most highly developed of­fense we met all season was against Southern California. Its deception lay in the fac.t that when the team came out of its huddle, it did not shift immediately into posi­tion, b~t lined up behind the center. There w~s a quick shift into the formation called, and the ball was snapped before the defense had a chance to get set. · _ 
Lest all of this might be taken to indicate that Notre Dame football players spend most of their time working on problems of defense, I might point: out here that the maximum amount of practice put in each day is two hours and, as the season progresses and the tea~ develops, this time is often cut in half. The shorter days m the late fall make it impossible to practice later than five o'cloc~ and·.the Notre Dame practice field, unlike many others, IS n.ot eq~ipped with flood-lights.

The offense is a source of worry to the coaches each fall, but once it starts to ((click" their worries are some­what relieved. Notre Dame, following out all \Vestern Conference rules, although not a member, has only three 
weeks of practice before the  season  opens and  to  get  a  
group of men working as  a unit in  that tim~  requires  a.  
grea~  deal of work.  .  .  

It is often a source of surpnse to outsiders the amount of rest Rockne gives his varsity. He figures that th.e team will get only so good no matter how much work IS done and often after a hard game, th~ team will not return to practice until \Vednesdy, never before Tuesday. . . 
This gives the players a chance to keep up m their studies and also gives them tim~ to replace by rest the energy used up in a tough game. . · 
It was the wonderful spirit of Coach Rockne wh1ch en­abled us to go through undefeated. He never under­estimated an opponent and usually he got us to fight by impressing. us so strongly with our opponents' strength before the game that we were afraid to go out and d.o anything but fight. The excellent u.s~ he made of h1s material and of the many fine traditiOns Notre. Dame players of the past have built up made it possibl.e for us to be successful in the past two seasons of ((H1gh Test Football." · 
Here's one tht actually happened last fall. In one of Notre D~me's games a. player with the opposition became a bit over-zealous and an official, who was a salesman for a large sporting goods house, told him to take it easy or he would be penalized. ((Yea," grinned the offender, .. pen­alize me and you won't get our shoe .order next fall."

Rissman Trophy ·Permanently Notre Dame's 
T
HE close of the· 1930 football season found Notre Dame at the top of the heap, straddling the football world like a Colossus, master of all 
i~ surveyed with perhaps the greatest team in history. 
Immediately after the closing game of 1930, with Southern California, Notre Dame was proclaimed the na­tional champion and the J~ck F. Rissman trophy became the permanent possession of the Irish. The trophy is given annually to the team which, according to the Dr. Frank 
G. Dickenson system of rating, was the outstanding of the country. To win the award permanently it ~as necessary for a team to be adjudged the best in the land three times within a decade; 
The undefeated Four Horsemen of 1924, gave Notre Dame its :first leg in the beautiful plaque, and the 1929 eleven brought a further claim. And now the great eleven of 1930 has brought it to its :fi.nal resting place. 
M~. Rissman, the donor of the trophy, is one of Chi­cago's best known sportsmen and he is especially interested in the clean, virile game which every fall holds the atten­tion of millions. In making the annual award for tempor­ary possession of the trophy, he was guided by the selec­tions of Dr. Dickenson whose system consists in giving a team so many points for each victory over a major oppo­nent, fewer points for a victory over a lesser foe, and so forth. Alabama _and \Vashington State were runners-up to Notre Dame last season and, at the time of going to

It is interesting to note h:!re that in wim.1ng two na­tional championships in consec-:.1tive sea~~ms) Colch Rockne ·has repeated his_ feat of a decade ago when his 1919 and 
1920 teams went undefeated and won \Vestern tides. 

In winning its third na.tional·title, Notre Dame made 130 :first downs to its opponents' 75. The Irish gained · 3,109 yards from scrimmage to 961 for the op_position. ·

And this moving finger writes that nowhere in all the land, is there a press coop comparable for comforts, to that at Notre Dame. And the mov:ng finger, having writ, moves on! 
There is elbow room, to begin with. There is visibility. There is ample attention, mechanically, to all the require­ments of the reporting profession. 
And there i~-most important of all-a more than reasonable assurance that, while K. K. Rockne lives, there will always be something going on out there that will ~e worth watching from such a worthy perch.

The week before they played Notre Dame, the Drake Bulldogs played a night game on Frida.y. The Notre Dame scout assigned to the game, thought:_ the contest was to be on Saturday and showed up after it had been played. Coach Ossie Solem of Drake, however, sent Rockne a com­plete scouting report of his team's plays, its strengths and its weaknesses so his fellow countryman might not be taken at disadvanta'ge.
