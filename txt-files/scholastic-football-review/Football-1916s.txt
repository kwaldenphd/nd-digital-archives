Football at Notre Dame: A Retrospect. 
MICHAEL A. QUINLAN, C. S, C. 

N the twenty-third of November, 18S7, Notre Dame engaged for the first time in what is now called intercollegiate athletics. . Prior-to that date it, had been the custom of^ the University to encourage athletic contests only in so far as they were of purely local interest. In the matter of track contests, for exarixple, the men" who could run and jump and throw weights had rnade repu­' tations for themselves locally during, a period of nearly ten years before there,was any attempt made to "participate in contests with other universities, as was the case when Hal Je\yett ' represented us at Ann Arbor, May 24, 1890. His success on that occasion is represented by a score of thirteen'points. Football, however, was the branlrh of sport in which -we were first represented by a team which competed for the University-of Notre Dame against an outside 
. University, Michigan University being our opponent. ^ ' At .'the-time of otir first -game of football, twenty-nineV' years ago,' the University of 
Michigan came to us not only as an opponent but also as a, teacher of the game, as appears from the fact that the visitors on that occasion gave the Notre Dame team some coaching on the principles of the game, a preHminary contest being staged in which the players took sides-irrespective <of the schools to-which they belonged. On this account the actual contest; which followed was not of fuU length for a ,­
-regulation game; and as a result the score which was made—Michigan, 8; Notre Dame, o— . does not' represent the comparative strength-­of the two teams at the time. Nevertheless, . the contest is memorable in the history of;­athletics at Notre Dame; and the spirit of friendly rivalr}'-which brought both teams -> together at that time was,the ideaT spirit for i; intercollegiate athletics, a spirit that brought^ Notre Dame and Michigan together in two ­other football contests during that same scho-; ; lastic year, one on the twentieth of April in;..' the following -spring, the score being six, to; _ twenty-six in Michigan's favor, and one pa the twenty-first of April, when Michigan won by a •; ­score of ten to four. . ;:; 
For these reasons, as well as f01: other reasons, .-Michigan has been a natural rival of -Notire _• Dame in athletic contests-of all kinds; and.it; seems that in thenatiure of things these two •;. schools should keep this fact in mind. Intef-^ ; collegiate athletics serve their best-purpose :.: only when nattural rivalry is taken as a^basic =:< element for scheduHng any contest that may be;-J under consideration.,-Permanent interest; Is/:, attached to such contests in all parts of the/;; United States; traditions grow up ist^armg I. such contests; and in the long run contests;;,.^, of this^kind are the only ones that.count foir:/ much in a season's success.; ' , --r/H"/ 
Considered in their total,' the; gamesj; ofjl;', football w] Daine and Only one of these games-^the last, bne^was S-H^llSf^­won by Notre Dame, the combined'scpre>of#^^ the nine games being twenty-seven points for the representatives of the Gold and Blue, and Notre Dame against one-hundred and twenty- in that way has enabled the critics of the game four points for Michigan. . to form a surer judgment concerning the relative 
Purdue and Indiana Universities are two strength of teams in widely separated sections other natural rivals of Notre Dame. In the of the countr}'-. In particular is it true that case of Purdue eight games of football have our games with the Army have contributed been plaA'ed, resulting in two tied 'scores, largely, to the recognition accorded the West Purdue winning three games, and Notre Dame in general by those who speak with authority winning three games. The sum total of scores for the East. made, giA-es Notre Dame sixty-nine points, Besides the games ahead}'- mentioned there Purdue getting one 'hundred and eighteen, are, of course, many others that must be taken In the last two games scheduled Notre Dame into account in any complete record of inter-was victorious. collegiate football at No'tre Dame; but it would 
In a general way Indiana's record of football be out of place to treat the subject so exhaus­games plaj'-ed. with Notre Dame is much like tivel}?- in a paper of this nature.

To any one who has been closely associated with the University during the period of time-in­cluded in a survey of the entire history of Notre Dame football, it is apparent that the natural strength and latent athletic skill of the men who were members of that first football squad were of such excellence as to compare favorably with similar quslities to be found in the high class 
/'material" out of which the coaches of later times were able to develop some of our unusually^ strong teams. In those early days, however, the teams had to get along as best they could without' the services of an experienced coach. ^ If was only in the fall of 1893 that the Univer­sity teams. were given for the "first time the benefit^of any forrnal and,regular instruction in the game. .Morrison, Hadden, Hering, O'Dea, Faragher, .Salmon, McGlew, Barry, Place,/ Longman, Marks, and Harper—these are the names of the men who-fo,r nearly a quarter of a century have had the task of developing the football idea in the teams of Notre Dame. To this list other names are to be added, the names of those who have rendered regular service as assistant coaches, nainely,"McWeeney, Bracken, Lantry,. Ljmch, Philbrook; Dunbar, Edwards, Rockne, and Hamilton. 
Aside-from the service rendered to the Uni­versity . in the department- of coaching, many of the members of the 'Notre Dame football teams have found 'in other universities an opportimity to teach the principles of the game; and this is true not only in the depart­ment of football but in other.branches of sport" as well, the complete list ' including about sixty names of athletes who might be.enrolled in what could be called the Alumni Coaching Staff. • . .. - -Year after year there are added new names tO­the galax}'- of football stars whose deeds have challenged, the admiration, of' all lovers of the game: To this distinguished group Notre X)ame has contributed her share in numbers":and in degree of" excelleiice;; and sometimes, as at-the close of the present; season, the critics must needs refer to several of our players as worthy of consideration ill the choice of an All-Western 
'Eleven. Be that^asvit may, it "will always be high praise for anj': football player, ever to be mentioned as the equal of Louis J. Salmon, who, as captain and fullback of - the Notre "Dame team of 1902, achieved such success as entitles him to a permanent place in any honorary eleven that may at any time be chosen from among the best that Notre Dame may claim as her own. This would be high praise in­deed; for we need only remember that a few years ago the Chicago Herald, after conduct­ing a nation-wide canvass of opinions concerning prominent football players, proclaimed Louis 
J. Salinon to be the'best fullback of all time. 
Football Elements. 

A is for Andrews a tackle- silk fine. B is for Bachman a bull on the line And also for Baujan a wizard at end. C is for Cofall whom critics commend. Also for Coughlin a bear on defense. 
D is DeGree of a stature immense ^yho sends the ball skj'ing for numberless yards. And "Dutch" with his speed passing tackles and 
guards. ^ 

Dorais too, has-played a great game. E is for each fan at old Notre Dame. F is Fitzpatrick who hits the line low. 
And F for the fello.w who, falls at the blow." G is for Grant a slippery young eel. H is for Harper whose strenuous zeal 
Has built up a team of which we are proud., I for the redskin whose blanket's his shroud. J is for jay, or the Comhuskers' lot. K is for King, just as fast as a shot. L is for Lee who gave us advice. M is for Mac Avho surely is twice 
As large as our Bachman and Cofall and Fitz;' And John Miller too who destroys what he hits. And "Walter the halfback quite helpful indeed, : 
. And Meagher a wing man of marvellous speed; Not to miss Grover Malone as a back At dodging and plunging he's surely a "crack." 
N is for night with its slumberpus cheer . ­O is O'Hara as fleet as a deer. ' , , • P is for Philbin, and Phelan of fame. Q is a letter tliat stands for no name. . R is for" Rockne Jess Harper's right-man

COACH HARPER 
The 1916 Football Season. 
HARRY E. -SCOTT 
Well, it wasn't such a bad'season"aftei" all. 

Casej Western Reserve, Haskell, Wabash, South 
Dakota, the Michigan Aggies and Nebraska 
(the same Cornhuskers that nosed us out last 
year '13)'' one point), all went down ±0 defeat 
before the powerful Notre Dame eleven in 
1916.'^ The wearers of the Gold and Blue came 
out of just one game holding the smaller end 
of the score.. The Army did it. 
The past -season was a great deal like the 

1914 season, when our team^ played wonderful 
football against everj-bod}'' except Yale. That 
one game they, slipped, just as they slid this 
year at West Point. -, 
We could go on to sa)'; tha,t Notre Dame 

scored 293 points during the season to her 
opponents 30, and that she gained two thousand, 
nine hundred^ and eighty-three yards to; her— 
•but what "is the'use of all these figures. 
The season opened on Cartier Field September 30:. Case was the victim, and ,she played her part well. ;Chet Grant,- Avho played his first game, .showed lots- of promise;'and class. His \^ofk' in - rettmiihg punts was good to look upon, while the end fiins of CofaU and Bergman 
ibrpughtjb}'^. to"the heart of .every:':N. D; football bug.' WHien the-day's work was over, the score stood 48 to o Avith the Clevelanders on the zero end. It was a superb opening, and ever};-­thing pointed'to an unbroken string of victories. 
But then the injuries started; coming. First John Miller broke his hand; then Malone was injured, then Bergman, then Cofall—mind you, we are not "alibi-ing" for we have no reason to alibi; but just the same it is only fair" to sa)' that Notre .Dame suffered more from injuries this ^^-ear than ever before in the history of the Autumn sport at the University. We could inject a Avhole paragraph of ifs-7­howeA'er we will not. Just" one! If it had not been for Oliphant to throAV their forward passes and Vidal to catch them, the score would have been—Avell, probably 10 to 9 in our favor. Klmer Oliphant, himself a native of the Hoosier Sta'te, apened up his forward passing in the last seven minutes of play; 'and by the tinie Vidal and himself had enjo5''ed themselves sufficiently, 
they  had  annexed  seventeen  more  points  to  
the .Army's  score.  
This  ma)'^ be  some  consolation:  the  New  

York Sttn said that "in tackling Notre Dame made the' cadets look like novices .. . in rushing the ball the cadets were outclassed . . . in line play Notre Dame stood out above the cadets like a giant among pigmies ... . had the forward passing game been barred the Army might have gone down to a bad defeat." 
- However that is another stor3^ We were

defeated, but not without doing credit to ourselves. 
Feeling the sting of the Army defeat, the team journe3*ed to Sioux Falls on November II,- where they mauled the Coyotes to the tune of 21 to o score. South Dakota .always has a strong team, but it is to- be doubted whether a team of Oliphants could have stopped the Hoosiers on that day. 
A return to the schedule of the Michigan Aggies was welcomed by^the football public, as \yell as by followers of Notre Dame and the Michiganders. It was especially appreciated by Notre Dame, who won by the score of 14 to o. In this game CofalL played one of the greatest games of his stellar career. John Miller, Bergman, Rydzweski, and in fact every 
- man on the team, played a wonderful game. 
Then came Alma! They came, saw a lot of football, and were conquered. We say-th&y were conquered, by the score of 46 to o. 
Next,, and last of all, came Nebraska, the same jjroud, chesty Nebraska that nosed out Notre Dame by one teeny-weeny .fatal point last year. Notre Dame went out for Revenge, and got it. In a slashing, lightning attack, she swept the husky Cornhuskers off their feet. Captain Cofall and Bachman were forced to retire early in the game, but the rest of the team fought just the harder because the services of these two had been lost. Bergman was the shining star in Notre Dame's attack; -he ran "around the ends, pulled passes out of the air, and covered the' ground between the line of -formation and the Nebraska goal with such speed that most of the time the Nebraskans couldn't see anything of him except his heels. 
.Twenty to nothiiig" was the final score, and victory was doubly sweet .because of that 20 to 19 score last year. 
At any rate, it was a fitting finale to a success­ful season. Cofall, Bergman, Bachman and Baujan have played, their last game, but Notre 
•Dame. wiU not soon forget-them, especiall)'­when she thinks of that Nebraska score. 
Va'sity Voise; 
That team, L guess, was not so woise. .' It gave cause to rejoice. 
Though Army game left bare my poise ­I still am^^.glad to raise my voice To praise the boys of Harper's choice—. 
To write them up in voise. . . ! .• L. J.B. 


Monograin Men. 
EDWARD J. McOSKER 
CAJPTAIN STANLEY COFALL-^ 

A fighting leader, a demon at carrying ;the • 
ball, and one of the hardest tacklers in. the 
history of football, his place will be hard to 
fill next year. It is little wonder that eastern 
football critics were unardmous in terming 
him the greatest all-round backfield man in 
America. Cofall never -knew the word quit; 
in his three years as_a member of Notre Dame 
football squads, he gave the best that he had, . 
and that in itself was~ enough to make him one" 
of the best halfbacks of aU time: Cofall will be 
badly missed next y^ar, but his name' wiU 
long-go down in the annals, of Notre Dame . 
football as a star of the .first degree. 
CHARLES BACHMAN. ' -­Another man who leaves after three years of valiant service at Notre Dame. "Bach's" name is familiar to every student on the campus. ' His record is of the best. Bachman was a wonder at opening holes in an opposing lii^e, and it was seldom that gains were made . through his-position. Always in the fight, whether his team was winning easily or was battling to defend its own goal, he never _ ­shirked. In addition to his own brilliant play, his was always a steadying hand in the line and his words of counsel were of great value to the yoimg player. 
- JOHN MnxER. Injuries did not prevent John from showing his spirit for his school and his fight for the ­team. The fleet fullback was one of the bright . and shining lights«of the season just closed., . MiUer was a brilliant broken field runner,, a. consistent gainer in'smashes through the line, . a powerful man in interference and a tower ~-= of strength on the defensive. . John completed., a great football career in the Nebraska game, / 
and he will leave school in June with the best. ;. wishes of every student.' - :.:. .« 
HARRY BAUJAN. . . : .' Harry won his third football monogram this," year and his deeds, on the gridiron will; be-^ remembered long after he is gone. Harry was, '' sure death 'I. to opposing backs when .they;';K: tried his end. -He was full of fire and "peppei''-:;^^ ".": and fought constantly/in every game from the{ij^r 
'•-ii'-~'^-^J^.>,k---Z ^ 

first to the last whistle.  Baujan  
is  another  man  whose  place  
it  will  be  exceedingly  difficult  
to fill next 3-ear.  
GILBERT  WARD.  
"Gillie"  won  his  monogram  
this 3'ear after a steady,  faithful  
exhibition  of  football  .ability  
and  fight.  As  a  substitute  
lineman,  he  could  be  called  
upon  at  any  time  and  he  
never  failed  to  "deliver  the  
goods."  Alwa3'S willing, he won  
his  way  into  the  hearts  of  
coaches  and  students.  It  will  
COF.'VLL  be  a  hard  task  to  find a  man  
so  able  to  step  into  the  breach  and  take  a  

regular's place as was Ward. He too goes forth with the best wishes of all the students. ARTHUR BERGMAN. 
The' "fl\'ing Dutchman" is undoubtedly one of the best halfbacks in the country. In the games this season, he was one of Notre Dame's most brilliant performers. At'carrying the ball,' he was a wizard. Time and again, he broke away for long, brilliant runs. At Nebraska, he was the man who arose to the occasion and scored two of Notre Dame's touchdowns. Practically all that the Cornhuskers saw of the speedy little halfback: was his heels. He has one more 3^ear to pla3- and the fans wish it were five. 
FREDERICK ST.ACKFORD. 

"Slack" gave exhibition after exhibition this 3'ear that thrilled the rooters. Overcoming an injur3^. which handicapped him during his pla3­in 1915, he proved a,.most valuable substitute to John Miller in the fullback position. Slack-ford was a powerful driver on line and-off tackle plunges. He was clever and'consistent at coxxj­ing the ball in the open field and a stead3'' man on the defensive. 
JIM PHELAN. • 

Stead3'' old Jim is. one of .those pla3'^ers who know the game of football, from A'to Z and who use that knowledge to wonderful advantage. As a field general, Phelan is hard to beat. Alwa3-s cool under the heaviest fire, his signals ring out with a spirit that sends the Varsit3'^ plimging ahead to victor3''. Jim has also been consistent in caiT3'ing the ball and a most reliable man on the defense. Notre Dame is fortunate in having him back next, year to run the team from the quarterback position. 
STEVE FITZPATRICK. 

Though it was his first 3''ear in college football, "Fitz" showed abilitv that ranked him as one of the best backfield men in the Avcst. Pie could step into cither halfback position or into fullback and pla3'- excellent football, and he did. Steve was a most valuable man to the team and he never failed to give his best. In the next two 3''ears, he should be a great power in Notre Dame teams. 
CHESTER GRANT. 

He is another man who stepped into the front rank in his fir_t 3''ear in college football. As an understud3'- to Phelan, he improved steadity as the season advanced. Possessed of a world of speed, he was one of the team's most valuable broken field runners, and on the defense, he never failed. Grant will be back for two more 3^ears and again Notre Dame can consider itself fortunate. 
RAY WHIPPLE. 

Whipple likes football and he likes to fight for his alma mater. The stock3^ little end pla3^ed the st3de of "game that the rooters like. Alwa3''S ready for a hard struggle, he put forth his everv'.effort. "Whip" is a deadl3^ tackier and a terror t the opposition. At the end position, he has been a most valuable adjunct to Harper's great machine, and fans are happ3' that he has one more 3'^^ear of service to give to Notre Dame. 
JOHN MEAGHER. The rise of Meagher was phenomenal. At the beginning of the season, he was simpl3^ one' of a number of candidates for an end position. But as the season progressed Meagher improved, 
and by the middle of the schedule he was ranked as one of the first three /i^ ' ends on the team and as a ^^"'^^ 
' 

powerful factor on the squad. "Jack" was another man who never knew the word quit. He was alwa3''S full of consis­tent, effective fight,' and in the. two years he has left to play, Notre Dame will receive much more valuable service from him. _ = ' 
ARNOLD MCI-NERNY. 
" Big Aiac " was a bulwarls in the Gold and Blue line. On the ,offense, he bore through BACHMAN

"position Avas always Avell taken care of b}' the big, but "peppery" guardian. "Mac" has another year at Notre Dame. Once more Notre Dame is fortunate. 
FRANK COUGHLIN. 
Mclnerny's runnnng mate, Coughlin, pla3''ed'the left tackle' position with the manner of a veteran, despite the fact that it w^as his first year in college 

BAUJAN football. Big and rangy,, he used every bit of his strength and energ}'- with telling effect and it was seldom that gains were made through him, while on the offense he Avas consistent in opening holes for his own backs. "Cough" has two more 5''ears and the students are glad. 
DAVE PHILBIN. 

"Phil" upheld, the reputation established long before him by athletes from the far west. Time and again he stepped into the. shoes of -. Mclnern}'- and tore viciously into the opposing line or blocked attempts at gains through him. Philbin isn.'t" through here 3'^et, and the fact causes niany a smile of happiness, because he's coming through with" a lot more valuable pla}'- before he receives his diploma. -T . : 
. , ' . . "BODIE" Andrews. : Andrews was " considerabl}'^ .lighter than the^ other tackles on the. Notre Dame, squad, but tliis iact did not prevent him from displa3ang his,,true. w^orth.

FRANK RYDZEWSKI. 

"Big Frank" plaj^ed McEwan, the All-American star of the Array, to a standstill a few weeks ago- and thereby gained recognition from the critics as*" one .of the greatest centers in football. But his West Point pla}?- was only one ,^of his consistent exhibitions of ability. He was.a never-failing pivot. .He played the offensive ganie steadity and brilliantly, and he was a great bulwark on the defense. Frank has another 3-ear and again fortune smiles sweetly. 
TOM KING. 

King long' ago displayed his ability as a basketball and track star and his performances on the gridiron this season were almost as brilliant. As a utilit}'' end, he was most valuable. He was a good defensive "man and - speedy and consistent on the offense. Tom has another 3''ear to play Varsit}'-; football. . ; There are other men who gave valuable service to the squad during the season. Among them; are Grover Malbne, the great -little half-" back for whominjiu-ies that kept him out of the game for weeks stopped a brilliant season; Joe Dorais, the little quarterback who never failed to give valuable service and. wjho constantly displayed the nerve of -m.en twice ,his size, .Walter Miller,- O'Hara, Ward :Miller,. Allison,. Morales,-Yeager, Garrv'-, Frantz,Jerr3'- Murphy, 
. Madigan,. and Kelly,—all of . them acquitted 
.themselves well, in games and worked consist-'

fromiri future years. . . - -,

C. Freshmen.77 to 3, by the score of 10 to 6; a.lone defeat at the hands of Kalamazoo College, M. I. A. A. Champions, by the score of 34 to 7, are the record of the 
Notre  Dame  All-fresh  football  team  for  this  
season.  
'  Kankakee,  Illinois,  was  the  scene  of  their  

first battle. St. Viator's College boasted of one 
r
of the best teams in her history and after she had run up a double century score on a Chicago school early in the . season her followers did not hesi­tate to predict a victory over the. 
Notre Dame yearlings. When the two teams clashed these predic­tions were almost realized. Two teams could scarcely have been 
better matched and each team played-all the football it knew to come out a winner. Each side scored a touchdown, and each side added a point by kicking the goal following its touchdown. Cap- ., tain George Gipp, fullback for i;i the Freshmen, contributed 'a goal from 'the field, and these three points were the slender but alto­

gether sufiicient margin for.-victory. Kalaniazoo, Michigan, was the destination of the Freshmen's second trip. Michigan Western State Normal College was the foe. Unbeaten for five long years, convinced that a team which could beat the M.. A: C. Freshmen 77 to 3 could beat any other team outside of the Western Conference and maybe one or two select teams in the East, the Wolverine embryo teachers were prepared to smother our yearling aggregation. As in the St. Viator's game each side scored a single touchdown. As in the St. Viator's game the booting ability of George 

A second invasion of Kalamazoo punctuated-the season with a defeat. .Kalamazoo, College  tiumed the trick. The Celery'pity team are: the champions of their restricted "conference"  which includes all the. minor Michigan institu­tions, and they play a first-class article- of.fdot­ball. After setting-down the fact that;-the better^team won, and deser\'-ed to win, it would not be fair„to ignore the fact that Notre\Daine , was severely handicapped before and throughout the game by injuries. Backfield inen .^ere ­played in the line when the regular, linemen,, were forced out of the game following injuries; 
But ^11 this is the glamour connectedr^with; being a member of the Freshman squad.; ^The games chronicled above were parlor pastimes ' compared with the imheralded bruising scrim-
images the yearlings endured at; the hands of the Varsity, once, twice, or three times a week. Whatever prestige the Notre Datne Varsity team has attained during its 1916 campaign is due. in no small measure to the men who will get their degrees in 1920. .- Per­sonifying Wabash at one time, the Army at another,' M. A. C. and Nebraska at others, they gave their best on. every occasion. 
Who coached this wonderful 1 Freshman team? Freeman Fitz-. gerald and "Biff" Lee. Two of; the best athletes Notre Dame ever. ­turned out guided the destinies of the first year men. '' They separ-_ 

ated the chaff from the wheat'-'  and they had a good brand of the scarce article .^  before the season had= progressed far. Teaching a green bunch-of mateirial the-unique type of  football pecidiar to Notre Dame, they .exhib­ ite'd a world of patience and perseverance. ;  They turned a line which was little better than a sieve during the;first few scrimmages into a.  stone wall that could hold the Varsity "^with  considerable regularity; they turned the off en­ sive strength of their proteges from-a joke into.-^ a genuine actuality that could-make it: intei:-­ esting for the Varsity or any other team; they , 
Gipp.decided the contest. Standing on his own .brought'the forward passing of their team-up:; forty-yard line in the latter part of the game he'- to a high standard by.midseason. '. '.•:.? 
sent, a long low field goal-sixty yards-directly between' thefKalamazoo uprights for a second victory, and for what is reputed to be a season's­record for a drop kick. ' : 

 Some sort of recognition of the :indiyidualsji^  that comprised the Freshman team .seems';; fitting in a resume of the season. .To'their;>:  credit let it be-said the .rhembers of-the team v: 
did not confer this recognition upon themselves at any time during the year, but each one gave his best efforts for the success of the team and never reached out for individual glor}'-. Captain George Gipp distinguished himself b}'' his extraordinar}'- kicking throughout the season. He pla3'^ed fullback and he plaj^ed it well. He has the drive necessary for the position ^and he proved a consistent ground gainer all year. Murph}' at quarterback^ showed considerable class. His generalship was good on all occasions and he displayed a lot of ability with the. 
never failed to give a good account of himself. 
Hayes made a good end and could catch a forward pass on slight provocation. Stanley, McGuire, Stein, Powers, Sullivan, Ryan, Flani­gan, Fusick, and Evans, played hard, consistent football and all were better players for their efforts. All these recruits will bear watching, and we A'enture the prediction that the team that flung the colors of Notre Dame from Kanka­kee to Kalamazoo will do much to plant them in the East and West next year.

The Critics' Choice. 
Football critics began getting in their "deadly" work before some of the prominent teams had completed their schedules. All-Western and' All-Conference and All-i-Vmerican selections fly thick and fast these days. Notre Dame has received much mention on these mythical teams, but it is in no sense egotism to assert that she has - not received a bit more' than she deserves. What team East or West, North or South, would not have gladly found a place for a Cofall, a Miller, a Bergman, or a Phelan? What team would not have gladly added any of our linemen to its roster? Each was a star in his own position Avithout displaying center and Cofall, halfback, on his second team. 

Malcom McLean, Chicago Evening Post 
critic, placed Bachman at guard on his first 
All-Western team. 
Charles E. Parker, writing for the Boston Post,, honored Bachman with a place on his All-American second team. ^*^ 
Jack Velock, International News' sports editor, claimed Bachman and Cofall were good enough for his first All-Western team. 
The selections of the United Press for the 
All-American teams placed Madigan and Cofall 
on the second sc[uad. 
These are the extent of the selections to come ^before our notice previous to going to press.

it. The superb team play developed by. the Gold and 'Blue outshone the brilliancy of any one man. The team was successful beyond a doubt; that a few men should obtain particu­lar recognition is no reflection on the men that assisted them. ^ However, it is a little something to beheraldedas the best in your work, no matter what it is, so we take pleasure in • cfironicling some of the selections on mythical teams that have come to our-attention. 
Walter Eckersall, writing for the Chicago Tribune, placed Arnold Mclnerny at a guard position on his first All-Western team. Captain Cofall found a place on his second team.

 CHAMPIONS 
Not to be outdone by Walter Eckersall, 
Walter Camp, G. W. Axelson, Ring Lardner, 
the editor of the VALVE, or anj'one else, the 
referees who decided the fine points of the 
interhall games have picked an All-Interhall 
Team. They pretty generally concur that the 
team they have picked could beat any other 
team recruited from interhall. 
The selections come after a season singularly . successful in the annal5 of Interhall Football. Corby slowly but surely ehminated ever}- con­tender for the championship and all the honors_ of" the season belong to the hall beyond the Church. "To the victors belong the spoils" is again demonstrated by the number of Corby men selected for honors on the All-Interhall team.

hopeless. The visitors didn't try their offensive to 
any extent, preferring to keep the ball in- Nebraska 
territory with DeGrce's long punts. In that last quarter 
the visitors again secured the ball near the middle of 
the field and launched the attack which wound up with 
the long forward pass and the final touchdown. 
In- addition to the touchdoAvn, Notre Dame made-

three attempts at field goals, all of them failing by 
wide margins. Miller tried a place kick from the 
fifteen-yard line and saw it blocked. Cofall tried a 
drop-kick from near midfield and it went wide. Miller 
toward the end of the game tried another place kick 
- and it too, went wide. BERGMAN IS DANGEROUS 
Bergman was the- great __ ground-gainer for the 

visitors. Around the ends or at the end of a forward 
pass he was good for most of -the big gains.. Like 
many another speed man, he showed a tendency to . 
run toward his own goal and it was that tendency 
which brought him grief once or twice. Riddell, 
Rhodes and ShaAv each took great pleasure in d6A\''riing 
him for a loss of from eight to twenty yards. 
Miller and Slackford did most of the gaining through 
the line on split bucks. 
Caley, the little field general of the Nebraskans, 
ran off most of the Nebraska's gains. With Johnny Cook running interference and Corey and Kositzky ' making a path for him, Caley usually was good for 
yardage. 
Otoupalik on the few occasions he was given the ball 
made good and his running mate, Dobson, also smashed 
his way through for neat gains. , ­
Bergman's first run for a touchdown was a pretty 
effort. Notre Dame had taken the kickoff to the west 
and DeGree punted after the first down. Dobson 
returned the kick to > midfield, the visitors making a 
nice, gain on the exchange. From midfield then, 
Notre Dame reached down the field, a sixteen j^ard 
pass, Cofall to Bergman helping. A fifteen-yard 
penalty for interference with a pass put the ball on 
Nebraska's ten-yard line and a Notre Dame score 
seemed certain-. However the visitors were repulsed 
in three attempts and Miller tried a place kick from 
the' fifteen yard line. Cameron broke through and 
spoiled it. 
PUNTS OUT OF BOUNDS 

Dobson's punt went out of bounds on the forty-four-yard line: Cofall gained but two yards through the left side, then Bergman took the oval and started around Nebraska's left end. -.Four men formed the Notre Dame interference and they cleaned up on .the buskers. Once clear of the first line, "Bergie" doubled back inside the secondarj-- defense and then hiked diagonally.for the goal line. He wasn't touched until ^ he liad slowed up on the other side of the chalk line. 
The next score came in the third quarter. Neither side could puncture the line and both sides were kicking. DfeGree!s last punt had landed on Nebraska's twentj-^-tAvo yard line. Cook and Caley dropped back to their favorite formation. The ball was passed, evidently to one of the fullbacks immediately' behind, the line. There was a brief struggle. Then Left-End Baujan emerged from the pileup and streaked'for the line, twenty-two yards,away.. 1'The last score was in .the third quarter.'.^Neither ­
side was gaining consistently and the punting duel was still on. Notre Dame finally secured the ball near the middle of the field, but a fifteen yard penalty set the squad back on its own forty-yard line. Two plunges netted five yards. Then came the long pass. Miller; to Bergman, and the fleet little halfback made his fifty-five yards to a touchdown without trouble. Miller, the man who failed to kick goal last year and thereby lost the game, was revenged when, his pass succeeded and the score had been run up to 19. It stayed there last year, if you remember.^ The same Miller arranged the ball for the goal kick. This time^ 
he made it and ran the score up to 20, the same number 
of points acquired by Nebraska  last year.  
Revenge  was  his.  .  '  ­ 
^  BETTER  TEAM  WINS  
To  one  who  witnessed  the  game  there  was  no  

question that the better team-won. It was the better"­team because it had some elements which Nebraska lacked. 
Statistics coinpiled at the end of the game showed . that Nebraska had nlade but eighty-nine yards in scrimmage, while Notre Dame had run off three hundred , and twentj'-four. . ­
Not one of Nebraska's ten forward passes con­nected. Five of eight attempts by Notre Dame were successful and the total gain was one hundred and one yards—an average of twenty yards" to the pass. The penalties were even, each side being set back fifty yards. Notre Darhe made eleven first downs..' Ne­braska made four excluding one completed with the aid of a penalty. • •

Book Review. 

THE NOTRE DAME ATHLETIC GUIDE. The 
University - Press, Notre Dame, Indiana. 
Price, , 50 cents. 

In February, 1902, there was published at the University a volume called the "Notre Dame Athletic Almanac," a book which contained the names of those who had the best records annually in the various track events dvu-ing a period-of twenty years; the book contained also the names of those who had made the Varsity teams and likewise the scores made in games with teams from outside. ~ " • 
Six years later there was published-^another sum­marized account of the activities of the University teams, a book in which special attention was given to the classification of the scores of'all games between 
• Notre Dame and other colleges. There was no attempt made to give the names of the players who represented Notre Dame. , 
Now, for the first time, we have at the University'' a published volume which gives us not only the scores and names of monogram players in all, our intercol­legiate games but, alsd the addresses of the' players in a section of the "book called the Directory. As a source of,material for a complete history of the'^inter­collegiate activities'of Notre Dame athletic teams, "The Notre Dame'Athletic Guide" is highly valuable. The section called the .Directory gives the addresses and years of- monogram-membership oh teams for the entire, range of- intercollegiate competition at Notre Dam'e, dating back to the fall of 1887. To this list, . by way .of correction, should be added the name 
of Joseph T. Lantry, football, 1906-1907, now a promi-^ nent contractor at Tulsa, Oklahoma. ";• 
The second section of the volume contains the: monogram membership of each "year's team: in foot­ball since 1887, in track since 1890, i^ baseball "since 1S92, and in basketball since 1898. In each case there is given.also the name o! the state and cityTrom which-; the individual player came at the time he became a member of the team. Following this s'ection is a list of the scores made in all games played by the teams given in the monogram list. This list, by the way, contains the names of many of the old-time players who were officially recognized as monogranx men by action of the faculty board of control at a meeting 
" held last May. ' In the section of the book given over to - traclc' affairs the'exact number of points made by each con-, testanl is given, regardless of the fact of his earning a, monogram or. not. Under the heading "Best Track, Records" are included Varsity Indoor Records,. Varsity Outdoor Records, Notre TDame Gymnasium Records, Cartier • Field Records, Interhall Indoor-Records, - Interhall Outdoor ' Records, Preparatory School Indoor Records, and Preparatory Out­door Records,—in each case the latest relay performance being the only one listed. " -. There is a section ,of the book devoted to the names of the captains of the teams, another section to the managers, and another to the coaches. There are about sixty names' given in a list of those who, after being students, at Notre Dame, have' become members of prominent professional baseball' clubs, twenty-rthree names being , taken frojoi the ' National League. Tn like manner there is given a list of those who have obtained recognition as athletic instructors, the number of names being again about sixty. ; " . ^ There is also a section devoted to the rides governing, athletics at jSTotre Dame, and finally an account of-the ­organization and a transcript of the constitution of the. Notre Dame Monogram Club. ' . . "

Air. Murphy  Right  Halfback  
Mike  ,  Left  Halfback  
" Murph "  _-.  Fullback  
We  have  placed  Adam  Brungardt  at  Centre,  on  

account of his ability to make himself misunderstood, thus confusing the other plaj-ers. Adam is the first man—on the Brownson team and Eve finds him as fresh as he was in the early Morning. On account of his not being a regular sophomore—according to his own statement he is taking the course .of gasoline this year—he is not playing on the Varsity. Adam can keep silence in seven languages or can gurgle forth in all seven at the same time, reminding one of the busy "busy" signal on the telephone. It is for his . great proficiencj' at eating fish and absorbing the tails that he is best known among us. In using his first name care should be taken not to separate the first letter from the last three, however strong the 
• temptation may be. 
.Michael Murphy goes to Right Guard on account of his travelogue ability: Murphy can go right through an oration on himself in the largest audience without giving any one a chance to get a Avord in. There is no department of football, baseball, higher mathe­matics, Hebrew or long division in which Murphy has not excelled, and we are not guessing at this either. We know it for a fact, because he told us so himself. His line would ta"ke his opponents completely olF.-their feet, ontorhis feet or head but they couldn't stand his modest way of belittling himself and must succumb. . ; 
James Malone goes to Left .Guard for his ability to : talk like ;five-in-a-be*d/ to people who have not asked him to join their company. He payed a license 
-of ten dollars some-two years ago for, the priAnlege' of being a' public nuisance and he is making the.best of the ]privilege. If .there is anything you .don't;Avant to.know or haven't time to hear Malone mil insist ^ oh orating it to .you in his own mixed up way, and^if 
;*-Noting too tough for us. ...J. :-i- ^• 

you break a book over Jiis head in self defense he's 
a friend of yours for life, and will visit you daily. 
•He has nothing but a howling wilderness above his neck but then his neck" is so long that he doesn't care. He rushes in with hob-nailed boots where angels fear to tread and exits just as" quickly on another portion of his anatomy. 
Bernard Heffernan goes to Right Tackle and deserves 
special mention as this is his second year on the team. 
He was formerly cheer leader in an old ladies' home 
and was so popular that he was made athletic director 
in a hospital for incurable cripples. From thence 
he rapidly rose to teacher of vocal expression in a 
deaf and dumb asjdum. He can use the deaf and 
dumb-bells and thp injun clubs with grace and ease. 
He is a tall, dark complexioned, lean, long, lanky, 
cadaverous, son-of-a-sap-sucker who joined the Repub­
lican party when its leaders began to give out cam­
paign- cigars. He is to carry concealed in his football 
suit a copy of the song that Kanaley and Cartier can 
sing. This he will wave defiantly in the face of oppo­
nents until they sink unconscious. He 'come' from 
Washington, Ind. 
Alonzo Finnup fits in at Left Tackle because he is 
an old fish with only one fin and that always turned 
up. He would have been an orator or a policeman 
in ancient daj's had he never come to like hamburger 
sandwiches. As it is he has the Jiamburger spirit 
which %rill not down—any more than the hamburgers. 
He dearly loves' onions and can be recognized at 300 
paces. We dare you to tackle him. 
Shorty Quinlan who \n\\ play Right End needs no 
introduction. All he needs is a hair-cut and a cap 
that will sit straight oh his head. He acted for some 
years as head rooter at a correspondence school and 
Avas a complete success. He is to wear a white duck 
suit and carry a basket so that he'will be recognized 
by the fans in the stands: When making end runs he 
will be allowed to put the ball in the basket and carry 
a hand mirror in his left hand so that he may see 
himself as others see him. 
Rudolph who easily made last year's team was 
disqualified this year on account of his class standing. 
He flunked in Arithmetic and Elocution. His place 
therefore goes to Rubio who is a veritable whirlwind ' 
at running back punts, and at eating beefsteak at the 
training table? He has a wonderful head for running 
a team and could run it into the~ ground when the 
captain happened to be absent. Opposing players 
Avould mistake him for the.tackling dummy and would 
pass by him without stopping his progress. He likes 
graham'bread and prunes and has a regular mania for 
having the dentist drill holes in his teeth. 
LeRoy Schinkoeth has never, seen a football, caniiot 
take two steps without tripping 6n_ his own feet, 
never knew, or could learn a signal irihis life but other-­
wise he is a wonderful footballs player and easily ­
deserves'a place at Right End; ' 
"- If there are any.places that are not yet filled.th^y Avill be^ cared "for by. the. same aforementioned Mike Mui-phy of Soiin ;Who^has played and says he can play any position. At a signal from, th'e Quarter, -Mike will drop out of the-line and do.the work for the backfield. He will shine too as a'Kicker. . •
