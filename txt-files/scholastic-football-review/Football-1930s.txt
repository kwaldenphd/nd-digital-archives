HIGHLIGHTS OF FOOTBALL SEASON 
A 
GREAT TEAM, without a doubt, this 1930 bunch of Fighting Irish, and only the short, terse, meaty sentence from the lips of Chick Meehan: "The teaiii is 
the greatest in football history"— 
can fully express the convictions of 
the football world. 
And with all due deference to their 
great master and teacher may we add: 
a well-drilled team working to perfec­
tion all the while, overcoming handi­
caps which would ordinarily dim the 
morale of any normal team, sweeping 
on to ten consecutive victories. 
Added to the nine straight wins left 
over from the national championship 
season of 1929, Mr. Rockne's charges 
now have a record of 19 wins in a 
row, rivaling the 20-game winning-
streak which ran from October 4. 
1919 until October 10, 1921. 
Receiving a total of 25.13 points 
for their victories of the season, the 
Fighting Irish received the Jack F.

Rissman national Intercollegiate foot­ball trophy for the year 1930.- Not only did they receive it for the pres­ent season but for all time; three times a winner within the same dec­ade means permanent possession of the trophy. 
Washington State received 20.44 points and rated second place accord­ing to the manner of ranking under the Dickinson system, which is based on strength of team and opponents rather than percentages. Alabama, champion of the South, ranked third with 20.18 points.

The 27 to 0 win over Southern Cal­ifornia marked the 107th win of Rockne's career as a Notre Dame head coach. In thirteen years the Rockne teams have lost only 12 games with four resulting in ties, three of them scoreless. The all-time record, beginning with the first football game played back in 1887 against Michigan, is now recorded as 254 victories, 48 losses, and 17 ties. 
The summary of the ten games this season shows that Notre Dame scored half again as many first downs as did her opponents. In yards gained from scrimmage the Fighting Irish out­marched their opponents three to one. 
Although Notre Dame completed only 25% of its passes while the op­ponents completed 36%, its successful

attempts amounted to 42% of the to­tal yardage gained by both via the air route. 
Apparently not wishing to be out­classed in any field of play, the Fight­ing Irish were penalized slightly more than twice the amount of yardage im­posed upon their opponents for in­fractions of the rules. 
The most decisive point of the sea­son just concluded was the double victory over the two service teams. This makes the third time in three consecutive seasons that both the Army and Navy have been defeated by Notre Dame on the gridiron. 
Southern Methodist's first touch­down and ensuing conversion was the only time during the entire season which saw Notre Dame on the short end of the score. 
Long runs were quite numerous throughout the season but Joe Savol­

di's 90-yard return of a Southern Methodist kickoff was easily the out­standing one. Bucky O'Connor ran into second place by virtue of his 80­yard dash olT Southern California's left tackle last Saturday. Savoldi stepped 48 long .yards in the game with Navy for another touchdown run. 
Eyth of Carnegie Tech turned m the best performance for the opposing teams, running 70 yards through the riddled Notre Dame team.
