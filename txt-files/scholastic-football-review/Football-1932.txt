HE Notre Dante coaching staff during 
the past season was the finest I have ever 
seen front the point of view of efficienCJ' and 
cooperation. The assistant . coaches · worl~ed 
splendidly with Head Coach HeartlJ' Anderson 
at all ti1nes, and there 'Was perfect harnt011J'. in 
the 1·anks. 
Our 1nanagerial systent was 1·ight up to par. 
It is one of the finest organizations h~ the ttniver­
sitJ' and it tal~es an exceptionally good 1nan to 
becom.e a senior 1nanager. 
Our relationship with all of the schools on our .schedule was pleasant in every 'Way: All of the 
big schools we played m·e on our schedule for 
1933 and 1934. Notre Dante showed by the large 
attendance at its gantes that it still eJijOJIS the 
follo·wing of a large public. 
I bope that Notre Dante is al~uays in a position 
where its opponents consider it a great thing to 
beat Notre Dante. For Notre Dauz.e I will saJ' 
that u:e take our hats off to any teanz. that beats 
1tS. 
TI:Jis year's Notre Dinne teant in tbe Anny gauze was the greatest Notre Dante temn I have ever seen in the history of the series. The players deserve lots of credit for the hard, fighting football tbey played after tbeir spirit had ap­parently been brol~en by criticis;J~ received after 
their early season defeat. 
FinallJ', I 'Wish to express 1ny appreciation to the students, facultJ', and aduz.inistration for the cooperation they have given us during· the sea­son. Witbout tbis priceless support, athletics here would not be on the high plane nor of tbe higb calibre they are now.

. HE Notre Da111-e captaincy 11'iakes one aT part of a great tradition, and i1nposes upon 
hhn a great, but ·welco11ze, 1·esponsibility. The full realization of the honor I had 1·eceived by being na11zed captain of the .1932 tea1n.· first struck 1ne when I looked back o~er the list of fonner Notre Da11ze leaders. To be a part of the tradition which included 1nen lil?.e Lou Sal1non, Howard Ed·wards, Fat!Jer John FarleJ'~ Knute Roc!?.ne, Fran!?. Coughlin, Ada1n Walsh, John S11zith, John La·w, To11t ConleJ', and To111-Yarr is enough to sober anyone. 
MJ' onlJ' hope is that I have liv.ed up to the 1·ig­orous exactions which 1ny position during the past year de11zanded of 1ne. If'was a particularly trying· season.· We lost to Pittsburgh's fine temn; and t!Je thought that we should have won that ga11ze ··was discouraging. For several weeks the temn had all it ·could do to win ·while ·still back on its heels /rout the Pitt defeat and subsequent criticis11t /rout .all sides. 
Notre Dmne 1932 showed against Anny, thougi:J, that it had the heart to fight back. It showed against N orthivestern that it would not be satisfied ·with last year's tie. · 
For the playeJ~s, I will say that 'they were as fine a group of 111en as I have ever seen. I. "thank theut for the confidence they placed in 1ne~ My relations ·with Coach Anderson and ~he assistant coaches was al~o a thing I shall always cherish. 
Finally, I ·want to ·wish the freshu~en and re­turning varsity plaJ'ers the bes.t of everything /or 11ext season. I regret that I shall not have another opportunity to plaJ' against our fine opponents of the past season.

which team at Notre Dame was the first team, we arc presenting here the shock troop backfield-so called-with the varsity line, An example of their work came to light prominently when they scored four of the ' five. touchdowns made against Army and Navy-the two against the Middies being registered behind the second string line. 
In the backfield, we have Em­mett Murphy, quarterback; Nick Lukats, _left halfback; Steve Banas, fullback, Joe Sheeketski, right half­back. The line is the same as that appearing· on the· opposite page.

1932 Coaching Staff 

• There were those who doubted the 
advisability of putting three such young and illustrious coaches in the place of older men on the Notre Dame coaching staff." But they showed that the confidence Head Coach·Heartly W. Anderson placed in them was justified. Here is the staff, left to right: Tommy Yarr,. 1931 captain and all-American center; Frank Nordy Hoffmann, 1931 all-American. guard; Head Coach Anderson; John (Ike) Voedisch, 1927 star end; and Marchmont Schwartz, all-American 1931 halfback. 
UNIVERSITY NOTRE DAME 1932 EDITION 
Varsity Coaches 
• In the five year span extending from 1913 
to 1918, Jesse Harper was Director of Athletics, head football, basketball, and base­ball coach, and even had a fling. at coaching the varsity track team at Notre Dame. In that period he laid the firm · foundations for the smooth-functioning athletic system that the University now knows. 
. Intersectional games were at that time things of rarity. But by a consistent policy of seeking the finest opposition in the country 
• When paraphrasers of popular slogans are 
looking for a new angle they might dis­cover that "When better football lines are built, Hunk Anderson will build them" is not only an accurate paraphrase but a statement of fact. This guiding hand of the Fighting Irish, once an outstanding member of one of Rockne's greatest lines, is without a peer in the matter of developing front lines for grid teams. 
It isn't to be inferred in any way ·that Anderson's ability is fenced in by the bound­aries of line play The almost flawless per­formance of his team as a tcani in Yankee Stadium this fall is demonstrative enough that Notre Dame's coach knows his ·football from every angle. 
• In the Army game of 1926 Christy Flan­
nagan swept off-tackle and straightened out for a goal-line run of over sixty yards and the touchdown that would give Notre Dame a victory. As he passed everyone but the cadet safety man, who had him well-trapped along the sidelines, it seemed· that it was going to be another "almost score." Then 
• "The next best thing possible, after losing 
three all-Americans, is to bring them back as assistant 'coaches," stated Coach Anderson at the beginning of the season. Developments proved him right. · · 
Marchy Schwartz is the first· of the trio, 
• Last fall it was Captain Yarr; this year it was Coach Yarr. The second of the all­American trio who came. back to coach. 
Yarr's biggest job was to find a man for his own place. He found two or three, and

for his grid squads, Mr. Harper built up a series of rivalries with schools far removed from Notr~. Dame--a series fostering some of the finest developments ·and by-products oi intercollegiate football. Army, Yale, Princeton, Texas, and Rice were a few of the outstanding teams he brought to the Fighting Irish schedule. 
As a coach he was just as successful. .In football he won 33 games, losing but 5, and tieing one. .His basketball teams, travelling 
HEARTLY: (HUNK) ANDERSON. 
Head Football Coach. 

"Hunk's" approach to the coaching business is probably the most scientific and the .most sound of any ever tried. He relics little on pep talks, on emotional states, or on hyster­ical inspiration. Rather he works system­atically for mechanical excellence of such a high standara that it will be irresistible. 
Again there is danger of a mistaken impli­cation. It might ·be gathered that he omits to key his men up. Nothing could be far­ther· from ·the truth. Eighty ' thousand witnesses saw· a demonstration of how well he can handle that phase of his job as they watched mechanical perfection, goaded by the force of fine mental poise, crush Army with unbelievable case. 
"Hunk" is close to his squad. He never

Returning in May of 1930 to take over the director of athletics position after an absence of twelve years, Mr. Harper has pro­vided the Irish with the same efficient organi­zation, the same high-class opposition, and the same minute care for details that marked his first period at Notre Dame. 
rides them, is sparing with blame, but un­ceasing in correction and instruction. The players' faith in him is always evident and in the season's week of stress and with the outside world crying for an explanation of Pitt's upsetting victory, the Irish squad to a man was with the coach, showing where he alone had seen the game in its proper light during the pre-game weeks. 
His record for his first· two-years as head coach, measured .on any standard, is far above the state of "successful." Considering the terrific burden he assumed a year ago, and the losses he had to contend with out of his ranks of stars this year, that record is nothing short of phenomenal. ·

CAPT. PAUL ANTHONY HOST. 
Right Bud All \'(!estern Honorable Mention . D Readers of Notre Dame undergraduate publications have noticed 
the by-line, "By Paul A. Host," appearing frequently ·above some sports article, criticism, or short story. How many of them have associated that name "Paul A. Host," writer, with ••Paul Host," foot­ball captain? . . . For it is a fact that the two names belong to the same individual. Another of Notre :Qame's Fighting Irish who disprove the false theory that a football player, to be good, must be a dullard in the classroom and off the field, is the captain of the 1932, team. . Besides being a good writer, Host has also the ability to produce original ideas for features. During the dreary. season between Feb­ruary and Easter last year he· wrote the first of a series entitled ••My Tensest Moment. in Sport," concerning the highlights of various noted Notre Dame athletic careers, and presented it to the editor of The Scholastic, student news weekly. More along the same line I were sought. 
\Vhen the first issue of the 1932-33 Juggler, University humor magazine, appeared on the campus during October, one of the fea­I 
I
tured articles concerned . the ways of fictional "football writers." Tucked down at the bottom of the last column, after the fashion 
I·
of modern publications, was the name ..Paul Host." He had ·proved I his versatility by turning from sports to humor. I Then when the first issue of ScrijJ, Notre Dame literary quarterly, was released during November, in the table of contents was listed 
I 
a short story, "Lifeguard." The author was Paul A. Host. From sports to humor, to fiction-more versatility. 
This writing, in addition to playing a great game at right end and carrying the responsibilities of captain, proved Host to be an ideal combination of brain and brawn. 
JOSEPH JAMES KURTH 
Right Taclde All-American•:­
• After winning a tackle position on a majority of All-American 
selections at the end of 1931, Joe Kurth, for three years regular right tackle'on the Notre Dame varsity team, came through this year to rate a unanimous selection as an All American. 
Making the varsity line-up in the first game of the 193 0 season by his brilliant, brainy play in the hectic open of that year against Southern Methodist university, Kurth was one of the few soph­omores to hold a regular's berth under the regime of Knute Rockne. He continued his brilliant, hard, driving, slashing game through his remaining two years of competition. 
'Twice an All-American, Kurth did not let the r_7sulting reams and columns of publicity go to his head or affect his playing. He continued producing the same kind of championship ball and never rested on his laurels. 
He seemed to take the attitude that he must play good ball because it was expected of him. That reaction to discipline placed on him by football fans might, perhaps, be t'raced back in the Kurth ·family to an incident quite a few years ago. · 
At one time Kurth's father was an officer in the German army. There, more than likely,· he learned the meaning of discipline and, possessing the character necess~ry to produce the right reaction to discipline, handed down to his son an heritage that was not mis­placed. At any rate Joe Kurth has played three years of great football. I 
Not only a great tackle, Kurth is a licensed airplane pilot. After graduation he intends to put into practice theories learned I· in his Journalism courses by becoming a sports writer and a coach. t *Unanimous

JAMES M. HARRIS 
Left Guard Ali-American•:­
• Big Jim Harris! Now there's a man for you. 
He's a rough, tough, hard, clean-playing left guard. Stamina of the type that never is lacking of something in reserve, he is an example of the fictional football player who was ..tough as 
tungsten and resilient as rubber." Big Jim's history at Notre Dame is one of meeting conditions as they arose-never a.r:t.ticipating events and. worrying about the outcome. 
He was one ·of the flu «victims" who struggled from his infirmary cot to board the train that took Notre Dame's Ramblers to ·New York the week-end of November 26 to meet the "bored" football warriors from \Vest Point. At the \X'estchester Country club he suffered the first of his two relapses. 
The day o£ the Army game, he was again too ill to play. He managed to force himself into uniform and took his position at left guard for the opening kickoff. How he managed to survive fo1' almost the entire four periods of that game is still a mystery but when it was over the New Yor/{ America11 rated him as their choice for all-American guard. 
During the course of that game he recovered a fumble for Notre Dame's third touchdown. Monday morning after the game he went as usual to his classes and was greeted with the name 

of uTouchdown Jim, the leading scoring guard in the country." 
·Planning to follow coaching as a career after his graduation in June, Harris has majored in Education at Notre Dame. Never doing anything brilliant in the way of scholarship, but never failing, he has pursued his studies the way he played football­giving his best and never worrying. 
EDWIN STEPHEN KOSKY 
Left Bud All-AmericaJI. Honorable Mention. 
B Ed Kosky goes in for a .multitude of activities. Besides taking care of the duties relative to the left end position for three 

*Bill Corum, New York American Selections 
years at Notre Dame, he became twice president of the Metro­politan Club, one of the largest undergraduate· organizations on the University. campus, Director of the Journalism forum, and co-editor of two football programs. 
In addition-to these extra-curricular activities, Kosky was quite a boy with the books. After spending a year in the College of Commerce, he transferred to the College of Arts and Letters and registered in the Department ·of Journalism to "pursue his professional studies under the direction of genial Dr. J. M. Cooney. 
Now that football is over and Kosky has spent three seasons as varsity left end, it might be interesting to note that he will be graduated ~ith an average more in keeping with the academic life of the proverbial "student" than with one of the best ends in the Middle \Vest, if not the nation. 
On his degree will be imposed the legend, "Cum Laude." But those words won't tell the entire story. For he will have -missed the higher ttMagna" rating by just .8 of a point. His average will be in the neighborhood of 89.2 which is a good average for anyone during eight semesters of college study which includes everything from "education" to "philosophy of the mind." 
And while Kosky was becoming president of his 'club, playing football, and making an enviable academic record, he didn't seem to be -;vot"king. He took things in his stride, was always trying, and came through with a record that disproves the theory that a person can't do more than one t~ing and still do it well.

JOSEPH L. SHEEKETSKI 

• A Notre Dame right halfback is supposed to be a blocker-he doesn't 
have to be so much of a ball carrier. But Joe Sheeketski seems to have­
made over the position. He has carried out the blocking assignments but 
added a touch or two of ball carrying. . 
After every backfield member had got his share of . touchdowns in the 
first games of the season, Joe began to score a't critical times. In the Kansas 
game he took .a jaunt of sixty-five yards to tie the s~ore. In the North­
western game he carried out the blocking assignment. 
Next came the Navy game. During the first half Sheeketski scored 
twice;. in fac~, accounted for all the scoring done that day. The first he . made by taking a pass from Murphy. The second came when he went through left tackle on the "perfect play" for ten yards. . So, since .his exihibition of right half back play, a Notre Dame right half can be both 
a ball carrier and a blocker. · 
Sheeketski is a native of Shadyside, Ohio. \X'hen he was a three sport 
high school star there he made th~ acquaintance of Frank \X'allace, Notre 
Dame public relations council from 1919 to 1923 and later football expert 
for the New York Daily News. \Vallace is also something of a football 
noveL writer, having produced four in the last three years. 
The first of these, "Huddle", had for its hero an iron worker who made 
good in the big. leagues of football. Perhaps Sheeketski is the ~nidentified 
hero of that novel for he is both a good football player and an iron wo'rker, as 
his record of seven surrimers in an iron mill and rise to position of "lap 
wielder" proves. 

MICHAEL RICHARD KOKEN 
Left Halfback All-Westeru Honorable Mentiou 
• Lean jawed, black bearded, short legged, small, and fast is Michael Koke~, left half back of the 1932 .Notre Dame football team. Light, brainy, and mercurial in action, he typifies the modern football player .

GEORGE JOSEPH MELINKOVICH 
Fullbacl{ All-American'=· 
• Scott once wrote a poem about a young man who came out of 
the \Vest and caused considerable trouble among a certain group of people. Another poem might be written about a young fellow who came out of the \Vest and caused commotion on a few gridirons. 
Down in Tooele, Utah lives the Melinkovich family. There is a son named George who spends his summers breaking horses and his autumns breaking the hearts of football opponents . 
. Fullback in the Notre Dame Line-up, George Melinkovich must have thought he had to ..scratch 'em high wide and handsome on both sides of the cinch" to make a good football player. And when he got on his horse, he usually rode to town. 
It was· in the Northwestern game of the past season that he gave his best performance as a horseman. He took the opening kickoff of the game, tucked it in the saddle bags, spurred, and was off. Right up the middle of the field, aided by the blocking of his teammates, he rode until he passed the thirty yard line when he outdistanced the field. Alone he continued to cross the goal line for the longest run of the :year, 97 yards. 
\Vhen the Army game came around, his horse was a bit spavined. He could barely stagger from the infirmary to the station to catch the New.York train. 
But during the first quarter. of the Army-Notre Dame clash he carried Horseman George for twenty-five yards. And when he caught a pass for a touchdown it was just lucky for he was almost too ill to hold the ball. 
CHARLES JOSEPH JASKWHICH 
Quarterback All-American Houorable Mention 
• Charles Jaskwhich is going to be a railroad traffic manager. That's his ambition, -he says, and sticks to it. . 
From his three year experience as director of the travelling of various and sundry Notre Dame football carriers up and down the gridirons of the nation, he must have learned a few things that will stand him good stead when he gets shuttling railroad cars-freight and passenger-around the nation. 
In addition to knowing the best ways of getting a certain individual to a certain . · point with the maximum power behind him in the shortest length of time, Jaskwhich 
·has had plenty of opportunities to observe how the nation's different railroads are handled. For three years a. member of the Notre Dame varsity means that the quarter~ back must cover a great deal of territory. 
Jaskwhich will probably make good when he gets to be a director of iron wheels clicking over the country. In June he will complete his courses for the Bachelor's degree from the College of Commerce and will graduate with cum ·laude enscribed on his diploma. 
In the earning of that academic rating, he has been three times winner of the 
· Hering-Keach Monogram A ward for being the monogram winner with highest schol­astic standing. In all, he will have carried a double load and emerged a double winner -three Notre Dame football· seasons behind him and a scholastic work that will bring him .. honors."

NORMAN J. GREENEY 
Right Guard 

• For the first time in three years Norman J. Greeney will not be 
on Cartier Field to answer "here" when Coach Anderson makes the annual football roll call next fall. The Cleveland, Ohio, lumin­ary will be graduated this spring and Notre Dame is. going to miss this athlete's ability long before the opening game of the 1933 suicide schedule. 
Norm came direct to South Bend from John Marshall high school in Cleveland and after serving the customary one year apprentice­ship on the freshman squad, where his all around work attracted the eagle eye of Rockne, he stepped into a regular berth on the varsity and has for the past three years been receiving his mail in care of the Notre Dame first team. · 
Besides playing footb~ll, Greeney is one of the best wrestlers in school and attributes his sturdy rugged physical development to his close following of this sport. As a matter of fact there would be no foundation for the truth of a story that Coach Anderson tells about Greeney if the lad were not a wrestler. Greeney was injured in the closing minutes of the Pittsburg game last year and was car­ried from the field direct to Trainer Scrap-Iron Young's operating ro.om. \"Vith the crack of the closing gun, Coach Anderson dashed to the side of his injured athlete. Onl the way he met "Kitty" Gor­man who informed the coach that Greeney had received· a terrific blow on the top of the head. To this Anderson replied: "Oh, he'll be as good as ever in a day or so as long as it was his head." 
Greeney distinguished himself by playing the entire Southern California game in 1930 and considers this accomplishment his great­est football thrill. 
EDWARD WALTER KRAUSE 
Left Tackle All-American•=· 

• "As their tackles go, so goes Notre Dame" is a saying familiar to football 
fans who have followed the history of the Fighting Irish over a period of years. During the 1932 season, almost without exception, the left tackle assignments went well under the handling of Big Ed Krause. 
A native of Chicago and receiving his first knowledge of the Notre Dame system· from. Norman Barry, famous blocking half-back on the machine headed by the irresistible George Gipp and now coach at De LaSalle high. school in the Windy City, Krause has carried on for two years in a manner indicative of Notre Dame's gridiron success during those seasons of 1931 and 1932. 
Krause made the varsity line-up during his Sophomore year. A sensation of the season, he was rated all-Western tackle during his first year of college com:­petition. -But his gridiron success was not enough. 
He went out, a few days afte·r football suits were packed away for another season, and, after playing through a ·full basketball season as center on Dr. George K,eogan's basketball team, he became known as Notre Dame's all­American center for 1932 . 
His athletic endeavors began early and were early recognized. \"Vhen he was fifteen he was chosen all..:City Chicago prep school tackle. Now, after adding all-\'V'estern honors in football and all-American sclec.tion in basketball, he goes on to another season of competition. That will probably bring all-American football recognition, if his play is not handicapped by injuries.

EMMETT FRANCIS MURPHY 
.Quarterback 
• Short of stature, light of build, Emmett Francis 1v1urphy was recom­pensed for these handicaps to a football career by a courageous heart in­herited from generations of fighting Irish ancestors. 
\Vith a determination that would be checked by nothing, Murphy, once he had. started his drive for a place on the varsity, began quarter­backing in earnest, and, after· a spotty junior year, moved this year into the front rank. From third string signal-caller, he spurted until it was a toss-up who should get the call-Jaskwhich, first string quarter the last two years, or Murphy. Though slight, Murphy's lithe and compact figure cut down opponents with. dea~ly sureness. His generalship, choice of plays and strategy, left nothing to be desired; his leadership of his 
men was unquestioned. Murphy's greatest game was the 21 to 0 drubbing administered Army this· year. He personally conducted ·the second team to two touchdowns and booted over the extra points to insure the Cadet's rout. He is 23 years of age and weighs 153 pounds. He is a native of Duluth, Minn. Asked what he intended doing after graduation from_ the College of Com­merce in June, he replied characteristically, "\Vork." 

·JOHN JOSEPH ROBINSON JR. 
Ce1Jler 

• A few years ago motorists passing a certain Long Island 
estate were treated to an unusual sight. On the rolling green lawn a tall, well built boy. of prep school age was crouched over a football. Behind him, abo~t ten yards, stood a gangling colored maid whose structure was reminiscent of a 
toothpick. ·Suddenly the boy, from his position, sailed a center's pass back to maid. She steeled herself to remain in its path, fran­tically put up_ her hands to ward off the blow she saw coming her way; and was knocked down. ·If the passing motorists wondered what was going on, they g1ight have found the answer to their question in reports of the late Notre Dame football season. There, beginning with the Kansas game, will be found the name of Jack Robinson, center. It was he who was practicing center pa~sing on the lawn of that Long Island estate that afternoon a few years ago. But football is not the only interest of the new Notre Dame Sophomore center who bids to carry on the great tradition that all-American centers arc dev~lopcd ·by football coaches at "the Fighting Irish institution. Last spring Robinson was among those who had the priv­ilege of the owners' paddock at the Kentucky Derby in Louis-He took a few days off from school to take his own horse to the race. Another of his hobbies is spending summers touring Europt.' via the walking method. The last three vacation periods have found him and a friend strolling along the roads of Europe and absorbing culture from study of people of another con­tinent.

-BENJAMIN FRANKLIN ALEXANDER 
Ceuter 
• Big Ben Alexander retraced the covered wagon trail from San 
Marino, California, to South Bend, Indiana, to merit the honor of wearing the coveted N. D. football monogram. The road was plenty rough. On the way he stopped off at Santa Clara university for one year but continued his journey when Hunk Anderson came on to serve as Rockne's assistant. 
\Vhen Alexander landed at Notre Dame his battles were only beginning. He found Capt. Tom Yarr firmly entrenched at the pivot position and there were a pair of capable understudies waiting. an opportunity to step into the spotlight.. Alexander put his nose to the grindstone and before the season was over he was generally recognized as the second string center. This year the fight for honors became hotter and a three corner battle developed. He has played in every game this year and o~ four occasions took starting honors. \Vhich shows what "Hunk" can do with the right material. 
San Marino boasts another distinguished citizen in the person of Larry "Moon" Mullins who made football history several years ago while at Notre Dame. Alexander and Mullins attended the .South Pasadena high school as did Ray ~parling and Clark who became national figures while playing with Southern California. 
Alexander is ?1 journalism student and carries an 85 7o average. He is however, more interested in forestry and after graduation desires to go back \Vest and work for the government. 
WILLIAM CLARKSON PIERCE 
Right Guard 
II Changes in the 193 2 code of ·football rules and regulations for 
line play placed more or less of a premium on beef and went a long way toward eliminating one of football's finest shows-the watch-charm guard, as "Rock" called him, the little Bert Metzger and little Bill Pierce type. This year, his last, Pierce saw little action as bigger men supplanted him, but when he was called on he gave always of his best. . 
He likes to recall as his biggest· thrill on a Notre Dame team his first assignment by Rockne to the first string for the ·Pittsburgh game in 1930. The first play of the game, with every man:in the line blocking superbly sent Marchy Schwartz cantering unmolested to . a touchdown. 
William Clarkson Pierce hails from Sherman, Texas. He is 22 years of age and will be graduated in June in -the college of Arts and Letters. After graduation he intends making coad;ing his career and should, if he. gives to it the sportsmanship, courage, arid abjlity that marked his own play, make a success of-it. 

UNIVERSITY NOTRE DAME 1932 EDITION 
NICHOLAS PAUL LUKATS 
Left Halfbacl?. 
.• The somewhat irregular: career of Nick Lukats reached a new high this year 
when he saw action in every game. This is news. In 19 3 0, Nick was held out until the final two games of the season, making several long gains against Army and scoring against Southern California. 
The next year, the fullback blight had set in .and he was shifted from left half­back to the plunging post. A stiff scrimmage, a sudden twist on a plunge, and Lukats was out for the season with a broken leg, before the season had opened. 
The first scrimmage of 1932 found him back with all his waving trickery, and all his tractor power, showing the coaches that· he, not Mike Koken, should be the regular half-back. He. couldn't be denied, and he got the job. 
His year's lay-off, however, counted against him in the long run, and he was put down to the shock troops. The fact that Koken maintained his fine edge by competition last year and also Kokcn's seniority undoubtedly entered into the picture. 
Against Army, Nick was· nominated the hardest driving back on the field. He averaged just short of five yards a trip _against one of the greatest Army lines in history. In th:! two Service games, with N~vy and Army, the shock troop backfield-so cal!ed-scored four out of the five touchdowns. By the end of the season, Anderson decided he had no first team backfield, but two alternate quar­tets-this \\'as consoling to the alleged regulars. It might have been worse. 
Since he did not play in 1931, ~ukats, one-time seventh ranking boy tennis player in the country, has another year as the successor to Gipp, Crowley, Flanagan, Niemiec, Elder, Schwartz ... and Koken. 


RAYMOND JOSEPH BRANCHEAU 
Righ~ Halfback 
• A triple-threat right halfback is a thing novel, if not unique, at Notre Dame. ·Ray B~ancheau filled that bill with the Irish this past season. His qualities were not the usual kick-pass-run attributes. He could run with 
the best of them, as he showed on his wide sweeps around left end on weak . side plays, after the defense had been caught over-shifting. His forte was blocking, at which art he justified his selection of Marty Brill's number 12 on his jersey. 
And against Southern California, he threw passes for the first time in his two years with the varsity. Did we say triple-threat? Brancheau also compares without apology with Brill in backing up the line against running plays, and covering his territory on passes. He stacked up with the ends as a pass-receiver on the rare .occasions when Hunk Anderson reached deep into his bag of tricks and pulled out a surprise play designed for Brancheau. 
Had everyone blocked like Brancheau in the Pitt game, the Irish ·would have won hands down, for blocking is the essence of the Notre Dame system and that day Ray didn't miss an asignment, according to coach Hunk Anderson. 
Rugged, dependable, Ray will be listed .with the assets w.hen Anderson takes stock for next season's Fighting Irish varsity, one of the few regulars returning for another season.

Rigbt Bud  
•  If you ever saw Hugh Devore lay into his bosom pal and roommate,  


Jim Leonard, in practice, you'd know why they call him the toughest man on the Notre Dame squad. · 
..He doesn't know how to play easy," says Coach "Hunk" Anderson. "He loves to smack 'em. He is the most consistently hard player I've ever seen." 
In addition to his ability to treat 'em rough, Hughie is an adept pass receiver, as he showed in the Army game by fielding an arching toss from Steve Banas which sailed some 50 yards in the air. And Devore was playing with a concrete glove because of a broken bone 
in his wrist. 

He hails from Newark, N. J., which may explain the particularly inspired game he played against the \Yfest Pointers. After making a touchdown on the Banas toss, he intercepted an Army throw later in the game and put Notre Dame in position for another touchdown attempt-a try which failed through no fault of Devore's. 
Perhaps out of justice to the fine_ ball Capt. Paul Host played at right end this year, it may not be fair to menti9n that Devore replaced der kaptink with the varsity for the space of a week after the Pittsburgh debacle. And it is a cinch that Devore will step into Host's capable shoes next season. . 
It's no state secret that there was little to choose between the first and second team lines at Notre Dame this year..Devore showed in the Army garrie unmistakably that he is capable of smart football,· mixed with a dash of peppery cracking-an ideal combination. 
STEPHAN PETER BANAS 
Fullbacl~ 

• Steve Banas did a lot of travelling-before he settled down: at Notre Dame 
and carried out the job of alternating at the fullback post with Georg-e Melinkovich. He crossed the Atlantic twice, remained awhile in Australia and Iowa, and stopped off for a period in East Chicago, Ind., before he came to Notre Dame: 
Born in Bridgeport, Conn., Banas started his first journey at the tender age of three months. His parents decided to make a trip to Australia. \Yfhen they got there they liked it so well they remained for five years. 
By then Young Steve was growing up and decided that the Continent 
didn't offer enough advantages for a young, bright, up-and-coming young 
man, so he took his parents, recrossed the Atlantic, and finally chose Iowa 
as a place to settle down. 
But, finding the coal mining industry not so good in the state noted prin­
cipally for corn of the vegetable variety, Steve and his parents moved to East 
Chicago, _one of the garden spots of Northern Indiana. That move took 
place when Steve was about 12. He remained-there until it was time for _him to come to Notre Dame. 
Banas came up to the Notre Dame first string during-the 1931 season 
when a new fullback was found and incapacitated by injuries each week. 
He managed to last until the Southern California game of that year when 
he played almost the entire game. 
During the season just closed he developed into something of a triple­threat. It was k~own all along that he was a good ball carrier. Then he began doing the punting when he was in the game. Then came the Army game and it was discovered that he was something of a passer when he pitched forty-five yards to Devore for a second touchdown.

LAURIE VEJAR 
QuarterbaC/{ 

• \Xlhen Damon Runyon rolled a sheet of copy paper into his ma­
chine. at the end of the latest Army-Notre Dame game in the Yankee Stadium, he sought around for a lead. · He glanced over the Notre Dame roster in the program which gave the players' names, their age, weight, and home town among other things. 
·The fact that Notre Dame drew her players from all sections of the United States struck home. That was his story. 
Laurie Vejar, a native of the Capital of Filmdom, Hollywood, probably rolled up the greatest total mileage to reach Notre Dame and make a try for her football team. It meant that he had to leave the Land of Sunkissed Sands and come to live among the variable weather conditions of Indiana. 
But the climatic change didn't seem to handicap him. Re~ching upward from the ground only about five feet, five inches, and tipping the scales a little over 140 pounds, he carved a hold on one of the quarterback positions by his grim determination to make good. · 
That determination, plus a lot of natural abi!ity, made him one, of the surest and most deadly blockers on the squad. At the dose.;: of the spring football training season in 19 3 2 he was a warded the Hering medal for the player showing the most improvement during spring practice. ' 
He continued to improve. \Xlhen the fall season began he spent extra time practicing receiving and running back punts. He de­veloped his footwork to the point where he could step around four charging, would-be tacklers, leave them stumbling over themselves, and continue on for a good gain. · · 
\X!hcn the Trojans of Southern California were met in their own Los Angeles lair, it was a case of "local boy who made good in the big city returns home" for Lauric. Hollywood was not far. 
JAMES RAYMOND LEONARD 
Fullbac/{ 
• If Pedricktown, New Jersey, wasn't on the map when James Leonard left there to come to Notre Dame three years ago, it's a better than even bet it will be before he returns with his college degree in 1934. 
To the faithful followers of Notre Dame's football destinies this rangy 190 pound fullback brings back memories of Elmer Layden of Four Horseman fame. He hits the line with head down and knees high. Failure to open a hole won't stop him. For verification we refer _you to the Pittsburgh linemen who stopped every other Notre Dame back in that 12 to 0 nightmare this year. But they couldn't bring James Raymond down, no matter. what defensive tactics they 
employed. 
Leonard has one more year of competition at Notre Dame and will be a valuable asset to Coach Anderson when the Irish start their national championship drive next Fall. He may be rated as third string on the present varsity but you may find him closer than that 
in the 193 3 campaign. . 
At St. Joseph's prep school in Philadelphia, Leonard also starred as a track man and captained the baseball team in .his senior year. He passed up these sports at Notre Dame in favor of football and as a result has been able to devote er:tough time to his studies to main­
tain an 82% average.

to .work with next year, Hunk Anderson should have little difficulty in finding abundant talent for the left halfback posi­tion, with only little Mike Koken lost by graduation. 
LaBorne is a flashy back, fast, shifty, a brilliant broken field runner, po:;sessed of a powerful and effective "straight arm." He is a good passer, one of the best on the squad. Despite his lightness he can knife and crack a line and is able t_o slip through holes with the fleetness of a whippet. 
W'hen Frank came to Notre Dame from Brooklyn prep, ip. his home town he intended to become a quarterback, and he served for a time in that capacity. Though weighing only 168 pounds-his height is five feet, eleven inches-he was tried at the halfback post and not found wanting. In high school he captained the football, baseball and track teams, and partici­pates in the diamond and cinder sports at Notre Dame. After college what? Coaching, he thinks.

A deadly blocker himself, «Piv" at right guard had given yeoman service for Hunk when called on to relieve Norm Greeney. 
Fast, alert and aggressive, he can pull out of the line with a halfback's speed and has led many a swiftly moving charge on opponents' line stripes. 
At \Varren Harding high school in Bridgeport, Conn., his home town, he captained the football team and won the attention of many a football coach in the eastern colleges before selecting Notre Dame as the scene of his future gridiron activity. He is also a member of the_ baseball squad. Some day he plans to coach. He is now a junior in the College of Arts and Letters.

ALBERT THOMAS COSTELLO 
Right Halfbac/{ 

A Rockne coached eleven always entered battle with an ace in the 
hole who generally produced a touchdown. One year at Nebraska it was a pass on the opening kickoff that broke ((Dutch" Bergman into the open for a score. A few years later it was a left handed passer in the person of Art Parasien who flipped the pigskin twice to win ·two important victories. In the current campaign Coach Ander­son had another ••spot" tosser, Albert Thomas Costello, a sophomore halfback who hails from North high school in Akron, Ohio. This 185 pound Italian was the 1932 ace in the hole. At Pittsburgh he threw several passes that were completed but unfortunately the re­ceiver couldn't shake himself loose. He has two more years of com­petition and we suggest you keep him in mind. 
Down in Akron wliere basketball has come into its own as a major sport, Costello star:red as a regular on the high school team and in 1928-29 captained the quintet through two city championships. In the state basketball classic he was chosen the all-tournament guard and received a gold medal for his performance. 
Last summer the depression forced Costello into the ranks of the grand army of the unemployed and he played quite a bit of baseball to keep himself in good physical condition. He enjoys the sport and from what little information we can gather from the Akron press, little Al has what it takes to make himself into an exceptionally good diamond performer. 
DOMINIC MARTIN VAIRO 
Left Bud 

• . One hundred and ninety-two pounds, well placed on a six foot-two inch frame, the calmness of an old trouper, the fire of a young warrior, and a great fighting heart char­acterize Dominic Vairo, one of the latest discoveries on Notre Dame's star-studded foot­ball squad. 
And why shouldn't Vairo be good? His home town is Calumet, Mich. And. that's the town which turned out Notre Dame's first and greatest all-American, the immortal George Gipp. 
That's the town where Gipp lies buried under a blanket of snow. ·That's the town which sent Heartly \V/. Anderson to Notre Dame to play footb'all in 1918. And Anderson won all-American distinction on mor~ than one expert's team. · 
Now Vairo is at Notre Dame. As a sophomore, he beat out more experienced oppo­
nents to play with the shock troops under all-Western Ed Kosky. \V/hen Kosky was injured 
before the Northwestern game, Vairo started with the varsity. 
If you ask him his biggest thrill, he'll say pulling in a pass from Koken to score one of the three touchdowns made against the Wildcats, and helping Notre Dame erase the blot of last year's scoreless tie with the Purple-clad fighters from Evanston. Two all-Amer­icans out of two attempts is Calumet's record. Vairo has two more seasons to make it three out of three.

Harry Fred \Vunsch is also one of the fastest. In high school, at Central of South Bend, he played in the fullback position, starred in basketball, was an all-around point winner on the track team. His specialty was the dashes. 
This year \Vunsch was shifted from right to left guard and understudied all-American Jim Harris. His speed plus a battering ram drive make him effective in any department of guard play, whether pulling out of the line t~ run interference for the backs, or opening a hole in the line, or smacking down a ball carrier. Next year, with Harris out by graduation, the fight for his post should be a battle-royal. \Vunsch, with many natural advant­ages, has every incentive to strive for the assignment. 
He is five feet, eleven inches tall, weighs 212 pounds, and is 21 years of age. He is in the law school, which indicates his intended profession. Next to football, he now prefers indoor swimming, handball and tennis.

left his favorite city for St. Viator's academy in Bourbonnais, Ill., to begin making his mark in the world, the remaining 449 members of th~ community cheered, then settled back to await reports of the doings of "that Rascher boy." · • 
Four hundred and forty-nine expectant villagers were not long denied. In academy basketball and baseball, the athletic Rascher began giving the folks something to talk about. He won all-state honors in the former sport under Coach Bill Barrett. \X'hen ·it came time for college, Rascher chose Notre Dame and Cedar Lake prepared for more accounts of the favorite son's prowess on court and 'diamond. , ' 
· Instead of prominence in those fields, however, the ambitious Rascher launched ~ football career, a sport new to him, never tried in high scl1ool. He began a steady drive, soon overtook more experienced men, this year waged a nip and tuck battle with stalwarts Capt. Host and Devore for the right end post. He saw much action, gave agood account of himself at all times and indicated that with the experience of this year behind him he would be· one of the mainstays of the 19 3 3 Irish club. 
JOHN JAMES FLYNN 
Rigbt Guard 
• John (Jay) Flynn, a big, powerful guard, weighing 200 pounds, 
six feet, one inch tall, in this his second year on the varsity, has from the start of the season been in the van of. a parade of contenders for the right guard post, early serving . notice to first-stringer Norm Greeney that seniority was no assurance of priority. Next ·year, with Greeney graduated, Flynn will be one of .the first to lay siege to the vacated post. He saw his first action in the Notre Dame game with Navy last year. He treasures that first appearance on the green-jersied squad as the biggest thrill sport has ever given him. 
Flynn's home is in Quincy, Ill. At Quincy college academy he was captain of the football team in his senior year and co-captain of the track team. He is a member of the South Side Rowing club, and runner­up for three years in the N.A.A.C. He also likes to wrestle. His hobbies are tinkering with old cars and bottling carbonated waters, this last be­cause when through school he intends going into the bottling business­Coca Cola bottles. He is now a junior in the College of Commerce.

• "\\'arching my roommate, Ed Krause, play gives me a great thrill and 
· the courage to carry on ~ysclf," says Albert Luke McGuff, regular third string left· halfback on the varsity this year who promises to become in his senior year in 1933 a worthy substitute for graduating Mike Koken. 
A powerful punter, reputed one of the best on the squad, McGuff should develop into a sensational kicker next year. He has already proved his ability to run, pass and hit the line. Under fire he is heady, consistent and swift. He is also a great defensive player. 
Al was made over into ·a halfback at Notre Dame after a high school career as quarterback at St. Mel's in Chicago where he ·resides and sells tickets at the race tracks in the sun1mer. His high school coach was the famous John L. (Paddy) Driscoll. In 1930 he captained the football team and an all-city b1sketball championship team. 
He is 21 years old, weighs 171 pounds, and is five feet, 10 inches tall. A junior in the College of Arts and Letters, McGuff intends after grad­uation to coach and carry on some literary sideline for a living. His hob­bies are golf, fishing and watching· "Scrap" Yo~ng's work on the boys in the training room. ·

.::;.for his position, and say, "Good work, hero!" Then run. For Rocky will know that the phrase is not intended as a compliment, recalling as it does embarassing memories of his first appearance on any gridiron. In an Emerson high, Gary, football uniform, an almost season-long bench-warming for Schiralli was finally interrupted when he was sent into a game to relay strategy from coach to quar­terback. _ 
Bursting with excitcn1ent he tore onto the fie!d, made straight for his captain and breathlessly blurted directions. A referee set his team back 15 yards for his failure to report. A furious coach promptly yanked him, and jibed, "Gcod work, hero." . 

Christened Rocco Victor, t;,he twenty-year-old Gary steel man has his heart set on being a coach, likes reading good literature, likes to swim, was captain of his high school football team after plentiful redemption of the above-told bonehead episode, is a sophomore· in the College of Commerce and thinks his .

• The indomitable spmt of Sturla Canale will be one of the favorite topics of 
f 

conversation in years to come when alumni gather to hash over the events of the 1932 football season. \Vith pride they will recall that· he actively participated in three practice sessions of the varsity prior to their departure for the Southern Cal­ifornia game even though handicapped by a broken bone in his leg. .Canale wanted to make that trip-he wanted to help Notre Dame win. This is just a sample of the traditional Notre Dame spirit but it will live long in the minds of Notre Dame 
men. 

As an understudy for Ed Kosky, he has participated r in every game this year. Although only a sophomore, his all-around playing merited him second team rating. Kosky will be graduated in June but with Canale coming back next year Coach Anderson should have no left end worries. 
Memphis, Tenn., points to Canale as one of its distinguished citizens, and Cath­olic high school of that city claims him as its outstandinl! alumnus. Canale ex­pects to practice law in his home city after he is graduated from Notre Dame. He is 21 years old, over six feet tall and weighs better than 190. 
MICHAEL JOHN LEDING

• Michael John Leding is another South Bend boy making good 
at Notre Dame. And Mike is that rarest of individuals, a student with a 95 per cent average in his studies. Maintaining a scholastic record of this kind and at the same time absorbing the bumps of a tackle assignment on a football team is one of those "believe it or not" feats. 
Leding has another year's eligibility and should he return to join the lists of those contending-for the left tackle post next yeal", stands a good chance of being one of the leaders. Of course, there will be big Ed Krause, two-year first stringer and all-Amer­ican, to meet. 
. Mike himself has plenty of heft, is tall, rangy and powerful. He is six feet, two inches tall, weighs ~ 80 pounds and is 2l. years old. He is a graduate of Central high in South Bend where he played a lot of baseball, a sport he gave up after .co~ing to Notre. Dame. Summers he holds a job as municipal playground director. Chemical engineering will be his life work.

JOHN EDWARD· TOBIN 
Rigbt Halfbac!l. 
• Playing his first year with the varsity, John Edward (Red) Tobin dis­
played sufficient all round ability blocking, tackling, and carrying the ball to merit the attention of Coach Anderson, win promotion to a regular berth at right halfback with the third string, and see action in many games. \'V'hen, before the Southern California game, Hunk shifted Tobin to the full­back position, followers of Notre Dame recalled Rockne's shift of Bucky O'Connor from right half to full before the Trojan game in 1930. 
At Janesville high school in -Janesville, \Vis., Red distinguished himself as an athlete, but strangely never as a footballer. Baseball and basketball were his fortes,_ and in the latter he was rated an all-conference guard. Never before coming to Notre Dame did he consider football as a sport seriously to be taken up. 
Though small of stature-his' height is five feet, seven inches-he is nev­ertheless of stocky build, possesses powerful leg drive and a ·world of speed. His age is 21 and he is a junior in the College of Arts and Letters. He in­tends to coach after graduation. 
FREDERICK ADOLPH BARSTOW 
Rigbt Tackle 
Fred Barstow, better known as Fritz to his many comrades, came to Notre Dame after being graduated from Menominee high school in Michigan. The game of football is anything but a novelty to this athlete. For the past 
years he has been an active participant. He played three seasons on' the high school team and held the captain honor in his senior year. Since entering Notre Dame he has been a regular on the freshman eleven and in the: last cam­paign he was Joe Kurth's understudy. · 
The all-American Kurth concluded his college career in the Southern Cal~ ifornia game and Coach Anderson expects Barstow to help fill the gap. He is capable of doing just that and it isn't unlikely that Notre Dame will have another all-American-right tackle when the honors arc passed out next Thanks­giving. . . 
Barstow has also shown ability on the golf links and plans ·to try out for the team this year. His favorite diversion is bowling and is a favorite to coo the scholastic tournament to be held in the ncar future. 
In rounding out his list of athletic achievements we find that Barstow cut quite a figure as a track man during his prep schoo~ days. He put his 200 pounds of beef behind a discus one afternoon and hurled.it to a -ne~. high scl1ool record. Coach Nicholson considers him a valuable man and so do we.

Notre Dame__________ O; Purdue "B" 
• Experiencing its worst season from 
the standpoint of wins since its in­ception several years ago as a unit in Notre Dame's football program~ the 1932 Notre Dame "B" team, playing all games away from home, lost four and tied one, meeting_ opponents se­lected from the East, Middle \Vfest, and Southwest. 
Opening its ·season against Kalama­zoo; October 7, the Notre Daine "Hamburgers" lost a close game, 13-7. Both teams started slowly and play during the first half was confined to territory· between the 40 yard lines. 
Beginning the third quarter with 
a series of line plunges and end runs 
starting on the Notre Dame 40 yard 
line, Hachadorian, Kalamazoo right 
half, plunged for the first touchdown. 
The try for extra point failed. 
Taking the ball on the succeeding kickoff, Notre Dame/ made their touchdown by line plunges aided by a 40 yard run by Ronzone, fullback. Ronzone ran ;the ball for the extra point, putting the "B" team in the lead, 7-6. 
Fighting to hold their one point_ lead, the Reserve team had the better 
_________ 0 

of play until late in the fourth 
quarter when Kalamazoo recovered a 
fumble within the Notre Dame ten . yard line and pushed over for the win­ning touchdown. Thomas, Kalama­zoo left half, place kicked the extra point. _ 
• The first of their two intersection-· 
al games took the "B" team to. Lubbock, Texas, Oct. 28, to meet Texas Tech before a crowd of 8,000. Facing t}:te Notre Dame system as taught by Coach Pete Cawthon" of the Matadors, which had previously defeated several of the South's strong­est teams including S. M. U., and playing under flood lights, the Re­serve team suffered its worst defeat of the season, losing 39-0. 
Cawthon started his shock troops and play during the first quarter was about even and marked. by the de­fensive work of Leo Dilling, Notre Dame right half. At the beginning of the second period the Matador first team was sent into the game. From that moment the Texans took com-. mand. 
After scoring one touchdown in the second period, Crites, fullback, car_rying the ball and dropkickin g the extra point, Texas Tech added two more in the third quarter. The first resulted from a sustained drive by the consisten~ plunging of Mc1(eever,. right half, and the sec::md from an intercepted pass. . During the fourth quarter, the Texas te1n1 · op~ned up 
. their passing atack wh~ch .Tesulted in three more touchdowns. ·· Afer a week's rest the "B" te:1m met St. Thomas, Nov. 6,' at Scranton, 
· Pa., in· their second inter-sectional game before 1o,ooo· fans.': Facing an undefeated team which numbered among its victims the Un._iversity of Baltimore and Manhattan·.:. College, coached by "Chick" Me~h?rt; ;formerly at N .•Y. U., ·the N'_<_?,tre Dame te:1m lost by a score of 24=-6. · 
Piercing the St. Thomas line for ·consistent gains ·:-·-during the first -quarter, the C<B'~ team scored from their own thirty~five yard line in eight plays. ·St. Thomas ran the -succeeding kick-off back . to their 
-forty-yard line . and then completed a forty-yard pass which placed the ball in scoring position. Casey, _St: Thomas star, made· the touchdown . but failed to convert the extra point. 
In the second quarter St. Thom:1s 

UNIVERSITY NOTRE DAME 1932 EDITION 
drove from their forty-yard line for their ·second touchdown. Their third score resulted from a long pass over the heads of the. Notre Dame second"" ary to an end who ran unopposed to the goal line. The final score came when Casey ran 62 yards to place the ball on the Notre Dame two yard line from where he carried it over the goal. 
• During the week-end of November 
12, the "B" :squad was divided into two teams which played Gary college, Nov. 11 and ·the Purdue "B" team Nov. 12. Gary won the Friday game 7-6 and Saturday's game re­sulted in a 0-0 tie with the Reserve team's only Big Ten opponent. 
Meeting Gary at night and in 
freezing weather, Notre Dame scored 
first, midway in the first period, when 
Clark, left halfback, ran 45 yards off 
right tckle for a touchdown. Quarter­
back Burke attempted to rush the 
ball for the extra point. but failed. 
On. the last play of · the second 
quartel', Gary completed a pass for 
their touchdown and place-kicked the 
extra point which ultimately resulted 
in victory after the gun endin.g the 
first half had been fired .. -During the 
second half both teams were unable 
to make sustained dri~es and play 
was marred by many fumb!es. 
Meeting their Big Ten o'pponent at Lafayette the same afternoon t.he Varsity was playing Northwestern in the Notre D~me stadium, the "B" team was held to a scoreless tie by Purdue's reserves before 6,00J p:!o;:>le. Twice the Reserves went the length of the field to the Purdue five yard line but both times were held for · 
'downs and lost the ball. Purdue was outplayed but when the Irish "B" team reached a scoring position, the Boilermakers' line stiffened and stop­ped all scoring attempts. 
• \'Vith the Purdue game ending 
their season, the Reserve squ~d next journeyed to Cleveland to witness the Notre Dame-Navy game as guests of the Notre Dame Athletic Associa­tion. Athletic Director Jesse Harper and Head Coach Anderson rewarded them in this manner for their whole­hearted cooperation during the season. 
Players selected to make the sev­
eral trips were chosen from the fol­
lowing who constituted the Reserve 
squad during the 1932 season: Ends, 
Hafron, Herold, Murphy, Sulliv:m, 
Macintosh; Tackles, Cousino, Yehle, 
Kennedy, Mariani, \'Valdron, Vyzral; 
Centers, D'Amora, Fitzmaurice, Bow­
den; McGraw; Guards, Bruno, Fisher, 

Yeager, Dunning, Shamla; Quarter­backs, Burke, McMonagl, Caldwell, · . Boland; Halfbacks, Cavender, Devitt, 
McArdeli, Smith, \'Vinterbottom, 
Clark, O'Brien, Dilling, Costello, 
Laborne; and Fullbacks, Heinle, Ra­
zone, Donelly, Hagan. 
Assistant Freshman Coach George Kozak was in charge of the "B" team on all trips with the exception of the St. Thomas game when Freshman Coach Clarence . Kline accompan:ed the team. Managers for the various trips were drawn from .the Notre Dame undergraduate managerial staff. 

• The reserve teams, like the frosh 
squad, are han~icapped in their efforts by the fact that they learn new offenses from week to week. They are the victims of Coach Hunk An­
derson's daily varsity defensive clinics, in which he tries to discover ways and means of stopping what he has seen and what he expects from the opposi­tion for the following Saturday. 
Never let it be said, however, that 

the reserves don't know their defen-:­
sive ball, frontwards, backwards, and. 
inside out. Their ability in this line 
of play is cramped because all they 
scrimmage against is the Notre Dame system, but they learn the Not~e Dame system and stop it consistently in practice. 
\'Vith everything to gain and little to lose, they go into every scrimmage as if it is the season's high point. If Coach Anderson had some way to key his varsity to the pitch the reserves and freshmen reach daily, there i wouldn't be a defeat on the card. These 
boys all. figure themselves in line for 
promotion to the varsity. The varsity 
figures it has no chance of advanc­
ement and rests somewhat on its 
laurels in practice. 
The frame of mind of·the two com­batants, then, .is usually good for an !.· even contest. 
Getting back to the routine of the reserve team through the season, these boys, as we have said, learn a number 
1,. 
of different offenses-Notre Dame, \o/arner, Southern California and vari­ations of all of them. \'Vhile the jumble of learning a new offen-::e and new plays every week keeps the reserves below par against outside competition, it does give the players a thorough working knowledge of· the various styles of football. And this knowl­edge is a boon to them when they go out into coaching positions or into boy guidance work.

lnterhall Football 
BY JAMES S. KEARNS 
• Notre Dame's interhall football 
system has often, and in various ways, been referred to as the incubator of material for the Irish varsity. That estimate of the campus gridiron league may o~ may not be strictly accurate. 
Certainly the interhall league has ·sent men to the varsity-Jack ·Rob­inson and Eddie Caldwell, for .two contemporary examples-but just as surely there have been hundreds of under-graduates who have played the intra-mural brand of football without any notion of a meteoric rise to the Fighting Irish ranks. 
·But there is one indubitable fact 
about interhall football: it presents 
the greatest opportunity for collective 
fun and good times of any branch 
of campus activity. 
This year, for . instance, twelve 
squads of varying sizes from twenty 
to. seventy-five have ba-ttled through 
a· two-months schedule for the cam­
pus championship and have had a 
great amount of fun and hard-playing. 
Interhall is a branch of sport that has 
remained strictly "with the boys." 
At the conclusion of that eight­
week season, Alumni hall, coached by 
Sabby Addonizio and boasting one of 
the strongest elevens the league has 
seen, downed Ray Morrissey's Morris­
sey hall squad 12 to 0 for the campus 
title. 
Before the situation reached that climax, however, a long series of in-· · teres.ting Sunday games had gone into the records. 
On October 9, the two leagues of six teams each started in quest of the crown St. Edward's had won last year. The Off-Campus eleven was discontinued this year owing to the small number of students living downtown. 
• On the first day in Group 1, St. 
Edward's and Badin whipped Lyons and Morrissey respectively and Dillon an·a Corby played a scoreless tie. Individual stars began to appear as Andrews of St. Ed's, Desnoyers of Badin, Sheedy of Morrissey, and De­vine of Lyons led their teams' open­ing demonsrations. 
Group 2 got under way as \Valsh beat Howard 7 to 6 and Freshman topped Carroll 6 to 0. Alumni and 
Brownson did not play. Red McCoskey paced the Fresman team and Hughes of Carroll shone for the dorm. \Valsh produced heroes in Ackerman and Blake with Sandura and \Vhelan in Howard's limelight.. 
The next week saw Corby run 
roughshod over Lyons 25 to 0 and 
Morrissey whip Dillon 7-0. Devlin 
and Behrman led the· Corby drives; 
Blake of Morrissey and Shultz of 
Dillon loked best in their game. 
Alumni launched its march in 
Group 2 by whipp-ing Carroll by three 
touchdowns. That was Carroll's final 
game as the lack of material, caused 
by the small number in the hall, kept 
the Main Building entry from present­
ing a representative team. Freshman 
swamped Brownson in the other game 
of Oct. 16th. 

A rating system that gave two 
points for a win and one for a tie was 
inaugurated to eliminate the chance 
of a tie for first place in the final 
standings. 

The third Sunday of the season saw 
Alumni, Freshman, and \Valsh remain 
undefeated in Group 2, and Morrissey 
alone at the top of Group 1. Morris­
sey's loss to Badin on the opening day 
was reversed and given to Morrissey 
as a victory when the use of inelig­
ible men by Badin was noticed. Corby, 
with a loss and a tie, still threatened 
Morrissey's position, while in Group 2, 
Howard and Brownson were out of the 
running with two losses apiece. 
On Oct. 30, Corby tied Morrissey 
and Alumni beat Howard. Those re­
sults left Morrissey definitely out in 
front of their group and drew Alumni 
up on equal terms with Freshman for 
the leadership of Group 2. Brownson· 
was credited .with a forfeit victory 
from Carroll. 

New stars were appearing as Alumni 
rolled on~ Powell, Lukanitsch, and 
Charley Huisking ~vere l~ading the 
fast moving· juniors. Aberle and La­
Londe were forging to the front as

dependables for Morrissey. Another Sunday brought a fourth victory for Morrissey, saw \Valsh and Fresman tie, Corby beat Badin and St. Ed's trounce Dillon. The standings showed that Morrissey had clinched the Group I title and that Alumni, with Freshman and Walsh ahead on its schedule· had tough sledding to a championship in the other league al­though they held a definite lead. Nov. 13 found Alumni disposing of Freshman as Bloemsma, Pahlman, and Pogue lead the way in a one-sided 3 3 to 7 triumph. So strong was the junior line that Freshman entered Alumni's territory but once during the game, that time for their touch­down. Only \Valsh remained between .Alumni and an unblemished record. On Tuesday, Nov. 29, Alumni. whipped \Valsh 12 to 0 for the title and the chance to play Morrissey in the Stadium for the campus champion-· 
ship. Alumni's fast backs and big line were too much for the senior team. 
Climaxing. the ye~r, Alumni faced Morrissey in the biting cold and blow­ing snow of December 3rd. As in their previous games, the juniors threw a powerful line and a fast run­ning backfield into the meeting and galloped away with a 12 to 0 victory over the Group-I winners .. 
Early in the opening period, a long punt return by" Lukanitsch and a pass from Pahlrrian to Lukanitsch put the ball on Morrissey's 12-yard line in Alumni's possession. On the third 
UNIVERSITY NOTRE DAME 1932 EDITION 
play from that point, Finkel went through tackle for the score. 
In the second quarter Bloehsma broke loose for 55 yards and a touch­down but the play was called back and Alumni penalized. From that point to the final quarter the play was fairly even with Pahlman of Alumni and Bintz of Morrissey exchanging long punts. 
• A fine kick by Pahlman to Morris­
sey's nine yard line put the soph­omores in a bad spot and Bintz kicked out to his 46-yard line. Alumni opened a smashing drive for the goal line and McKiernan, Bloemsma, and Finkel advanced steadily, Finkel finally scoring on a thrust through center. The work of LaLonde, Blake, and Bintz stood out for Morrissey as they battled to hold off the title-bent juniors. 
To the outsider, perhaps, this an­
nual scramble for whatever honors 
come one's way with success in inter­
hall football may not seem important. 
But on the campus it is. \XThether 
playing before a championship crowd 
of from 10,000. to 20,000 persons or 
just among themselves on one of the 
many recreation grounds which dot 
the campus, you can see these inter­
hall players putting their best into 
every play of every game. 
Their rec~ors are just as enthusi­astic in their efforts to keep their re­spective halls at the top of the heap, whether in football, b~sketball, track, baseball, cross-country, boxing, tennis, golf, or any of the other forms of 
-ahtletics _for which equipment is pro­vided by the university. · The net result of the interhall sys­tem is that students, living away from the large amusement centers and with little to occupy their minds with the exception of their scholastic and reli­gious exercises, are given a chance to . develop themselves physically and develop a strong mind in a ·strong body. A group spirit is formed by the various athletic rivalries of the halls. The minds of the students, whether participants or not -and almost · everyone in school participates in one sport or another-have something to turn to when they need relaxation from studies and from extra curricu­lar activities. 
• The system has been aped at other 
schools, seldom, however, with any reference to Notre Dame. The model is usually the house plan of the large English universities, as far as the public prints are concerned. But Notre Dame bows to· no one in this respect. It is undeniably true that the hall system cropped up naturally at Notre Dame because of the fact that halls were there, students wanted to participate in athletics, and the students were not adept enough at the 'beginning for varsity competition against other schools. 


47 

The varsity system grew out of the hall system at Notre Dame. But the hall system grew naturally and was· not based on any other plan. Now, when other schools institute their hall systems, nine times out of ten they give credit for the plan to European schools. And ten times out of ten, they point to their system as something unique.

The Men Behind the Tearn 
BY LESLIE RADDATZ 
• Governing Notre Dame's athletics 
is the Board of Athletic Control. The Reverend Michael Mulcaire, C. S. C., is chairman of the board and James 
E. McCarthy is secretary. Other mem­bers are the Reverend Thomas A. Steiner, C. S. C., the Reverend Thomas A. Lahey, C. S. C., \Villiam Logan Benitz and Clarence Manion. As the· board's title indicates, its bus­iness is to approve schedules and to award monograms. 
The Board of Athletic Control was founded in 189 8 and reorganized in 1924. Under it Notre Dame ath­letics , have grown to their present prominent position. The board's big­gest task was the building of the new stadium, a task which it performed well. 
. Directly behind the football team are, of course, the coaches. Under Head Coach Heartly Anderson, As­sistant Coaches Voedisch, Schwartz, Hoffman and Yarr have worked and planned so that Notre Dame football may continue to be the .great thing that it was in the past. Aiding them are the freshman coaches, Jake Klein, Norb Christman, George Kozak and Regis McNamara, whose duty it is to take a green squad and, in a few short weeks make a team strong · enough to scrimmage the varsity­with a new set of plays every week. 
• In charge of seeing that Notre 
Dame teams function without dif­ficulty arc the managers. This year the managerial system, developed by Knute Rockne, has been under the di­rection of Anthony \'\f. \'\firry. As­sisting him as football managers were Frank Buhl and John Sherman. These. men have worked from carrying buckets and sweatshirts in their fresh­man year until this fall they arranged 
.the transpor:tation of a great football squad that travelled from coast to coast~ Under Senior Managers \'\firry, Buhl and Sherman are a group of junior. managers, a number of soph­omore managers and a host of fresh­m~n managers. The junior managers arrange ..B" team trips, no mean task during the past season when the Ham­burgers went to Texas one week, to Scranton the next and to Purdue the next. 
Trainer of Notre Dame teams is Eugene C'Scrapiron") Young. For the past three years he has taped and bandaged ailing athletes. Young re­ceived his nickname from Knute Rockne during his days as a student here. As a member of the track team he would set up the bleachers before a meet, run a mile and two mile race, and then take down the bleachers. Many Notre Dame men insist that Young· is better than a doctor at treating bruises, sprains, dislocations. During the past season he has set Dick Pfefferle's shoulder more times than he can remember. His success m keeping Norm Greeney's trick knee in shape has done much to aid the strength of the Notre Dame line this fall. 
"Mac" McAllister is in charge ·of the equipment room and manages the gym. Every year he must hand out scores of jerseys, sweatshirts, pants, socks, shoes and headgears. . He must keep track of the silk pants and the rain pants a1_1d the regular pants for some hundred football players. 
• Dan Hanley (no fullback) hands 
out to\vels and se·es to it that things run smoothly in the locker room. He conducts a daily campaign against Athlete's Foot by throwing 
·chloride of lime on the floor of the showers and makes himself popular with Notre Dame athletes by calling them "Mister." · 
These individuals .all help Notre Dame football teams. But the. great­·est and most influential group behind the team is the· student body. In order that the· student body may function properly as a backer of the­team, the s:A.C., the Blue Circle and the band each fall help in. the organ­ization of giant·pep meetings. Usu­ally these begin with announcements in the form of S.A. C. bulletins. The Blue Circle and the band wait out­

body comes out. The Blue Circle lights flares; the band plays the "Vic­tory March;" the students march to the gym. There the S.A.C. chair­man introduces the speaker· of the evening. The coaches speak. A few players ask the students for their sup­port. The students sing and cheer. The meeting ends and students and players are ready for the next day's game. 
• The staff in the athletic associ­
atio~ offices. has also been largely responsible for the comfort and well­being of the team during the past season. J. Arthur Haley, business manager of athletics, is the man who arranges, with ·the managers, for all trips, meals, hotel accomodations, and transportation for the team on its invasions of enemy land. 
And with him, it is only fair to mention those Notre Dame alumni and well-wishers who provide trans­portation for the team from trains to hotels,· hotels to stadia, stadium back to hotels, and hotels to trains. Cars or busses _meet the team when it pulls into town. The players pile in and are whisked through traffic with a police escort to Mass, then to their quarters, and wherever else they may want to go ... on time, without delay which might wear on their nerves when they are nervous and keyed for that day's or the next·day's gam~. \'{Te regret tha_t these willing . workers must re­mam anonymous. 
Finally, the kindness of the news­
. papers has been appreciated at Notre Dame. The usual disparaging. rumors and stories cropped up from time to time, but Notre Dame is used to these. It appreciates the fact that the news­papers are willing to treat the school fairly when they are treated fairly. It also appreciates the fact that Notre Dame is a boon to ne\vspapers by reason of its athletic success. The papers, fairly enough, give cognizance io this . fact_ by giving an unbiased view of the activities of the Fighting Irish. On the whole, the papers have been lavish in their praise of Notre Dame this year as in the past.

A Hike to the Right... . 
BY TED HUSING 
• High in the stadium's press box 
are seated three young men. The teamwork which features the Notre Dame attack features also the work these lads must do as they view the football game being fought on the gridiron below. The technician con­trols the music, the cheers and the voice of the descriptionist. The ob­server, ·well versed in the offensive systems used by most of the leading elevens, presses the buttons on the electric lamp annunciator which iden­tifies for the announcer the men who are in the attack and the oppo­nents who are on the ·defense. Never a word is said between them. Grim­faced, determined, and on edge, they co-operate to make millions feel that 
they, too, are at the game. 
uLaurie Vejar is calling signals.

Notre Dame is playing football. 
Millions are hanging·on to every move 
they . make on the field. Vested in 
Columbia's trio of broadcasters is the 
right to detail each play, the respon­
sibility to televise the game in vocal 
description. All over the country 
people listen. · For Notre Dame is 
football's standout broadcast univer­
sity. Letters that pile high·. on the, 
broadcasters' desks ask for Notre 
Dame broadcasts, and there are too 
many reasons why this has come about 
for me to reel them off at length. 
\'{Then the Eastern authorities de­cided to abandon the broadcasting of football, Notre Dame, mindful of its powerful actual and synthetic alumni, proudly notified the world that they, at least, would permit each and every home game to be hurled through the ether . so that football fans from Maine to California could follow the play of the team that they had ·ac­cepted as their own. The hesitant Big Ten officials, who ~ere debating in their minds the probable results of such a broadcasting ban, were moved to do nothing about the matter, and so the Big Ten was not officially pro­hibited from allowing the airing of each fracas. The Eastern officials had already decided on . the ban. 
• \'{Then the embryo broadcasting 
schedules for the year had been submitted and were declared null and void by the broadcasting officials due to the declination of permission through the ban; Noire Dame games were inked in, and it appeared that 
1932 was going to be a big Notre Dame year. · But the fact that one university of the many hundred throughout the country would secure such unmeasured attention had some little to do with a post-Olympic Games conference in which the ban was rescinded. Despite the opening to the broadcasters of all the games, ex­cepting those in the Southern Confer­ence, Notre Dame retained top posi­
51 

tion with this network, by being pen­cilled for four games. Some of the universities restricted broadcasting schedules to two or three of the super sell-outs, but the lakeside institution that has immortalized Knute K. Rockne in its history-making football campaigns welcomed any broadcasting with open arms. 
\'{Tith attendance dropping all over the land, many arc inclined to think that broadcasting affects the gate. To this I personally do not· subscribe. \Yfe find agitation against the pricing of games. to such heights that the 1932 public cannot afford them. Not many colleges arc guilty of 'this pro­cedure, but at the same time none of the remaining universities has re­
duced the gate price appreciably. Radio does affect the gate on a rainy day, but since the tickets arc sold by sub­scription and then up to game time by public sale, most . of the sale is made before the day of the game.

Army Aftermath 
BY GEORGE TREVOR 

• In that cave of the whistling winds 
called Yankee Stadium, a jade­green jcrsied Notre Dame eleven found the verve, the rhythm and the cohesive drive that were missing.against Pitts­burgh some weeks· ago and smother.ed the flashiest, if no't the solidest attack­ing unit in \Vest Point history last Saturday afternoon. · 
In a word, Notre Dame-boasting the grca test man power this side of Los Angeles-clicked. \XThen that happens, it makes very little difference what team occupies the opposite corner. The luckless adversary is al­most certain to take it on the chin. This· time it happened to be ·Army­an Army team seething with speed and offensive rhythm, but lacking sheer 1-~wer. In two weeks it will be Southern California's turn to feel the fury that is Notre Dame. 
\Why play any Rose Bowl game, if Southern California, as seems certain, is to be the Pacific standard bearer? That clash between Trojans and Ram­blers on December 10 will decide which is the greatest football team in America. A fig for your undefeated records! They arc often misleading. 
Colgate?· \Why, these Notre Dame wreckers could pick the little Giants up by the seat of their plum-colored pants and heave them clear back to the Chenango Valley! Purdue could ·probably do the same. That flat stat­ement is the greatest tribute one can pay Andy Kerr, the peaked-faced genius, who has fashioned a silky, smooth Colgate team out of material that doesn't compare with that at'any one of a dozen major universities. \With .~one or two. exceptions there isn't a man on the Colgate varsity who could make the N otrc Dame team. All the more honor to Kcr!" and Colgate spirit that so much has been made of so 
little.. 
• It is a football truism that games 
arc decided in the line. N oi:rc 
Dame exemplified the truth of that 
trite statement against Army. "Up 
front where the football game is" (as 
Knute Rockne used to say with a bit 
of irony in his vpice, when he heard 
about backfield exploits) Hunk Ander­son's .burly linemen outcharged and over-powered an Army barrier that. looked almost frail by comparison. 
"The first thing I noticed" said Major Sasse afterwards "was the size of the Notre Dame linemen. They looked as big as a battery of howitzers. Mere beef is a liability unless supple­mented by speed. Here in the East huge men arc usually slow on their teet. Anderson's giants were nimb~c as cats. They had the speed to make their size ana weight count." 
Sasse is right. Those Notre Dame behemoths-Robinson, ioo pounds, 6 ft. 3 in.; Grccncy, 190, ·6 ft..; Harris, 188, 5 ft. 11 in.; Krause, 220, 6ft. 3 in.; Kurth, 204, ·6 ft. 2 in.; Kosky, 185, 6ft., and Host, 175, 5 ft. 11 in. -generated ·an offensive drive that simply obliterated. Army's front line trenches. Their star'ting impetus was amazing for such big men and their surg:ng momentum swept Army's comparatively ligJlt linemen clear back into the secondary defense. Only one man on the Army line. exceeds 181 pounds in weight. This is Armst~ong, the 220-pound tackle. 
The game hadn't gone five .minutes before it became apparent that Army . was hopelessly overmatched up front. As well expect a bunch of ·middle­weight wrestlers to cope with a batch of speedy Hackenschmidts, Gotches, Sandows and Lewiscs.. Speed? .You should have seen the strapping Harris and the brawny Grccncy .swing out of thcirguard berths to head interfer­ence on sweeps, slants and short side reverses! They reminded you of those fifty-mile an hour heavy duty tanks now being tested by the United States \War Department.

compliment of assigning two men 'to double-team him or else struck at the ~ther flank. The right side of Army's Ime took a merciless battering all afternoon. Seventy per cent of Notre Dame's plays-whether reverses or strong side drives-were aimed at Army's right. 
• Richard King's absence was sorely felt, though that nonpareil of 
· Army ends could not have averted this \'fest Point \'\Tatcrloo. Subjected to the shocking impact of a superior line, Army felt the loss of its 1931 master pair of ·tackles-Price and Suarez­for the first time during the present campaign. But even those lancinating tackles could not have halted the South Bend twister· which burst out of a yellow-green cloud and leveled all defenses. 
Here, please remember, was a Notre Dame team operating on. dry turf against Army at long last. In 1929 the Irish offense was .shackled by an icc-bound gridiron. In 19 3 0, Soldier Field, Chicago, was one big mud· pud· die. · Last fall, the heavy, slippery 
going hamstrung Notre Dame's sweeps and cutbacks. All Coach Anderson asked last Saturday was a field fit to run on. He got it and did. those Ram­blers run!· 
\With a firm . purchase for their cleats, Notre Dame's two sets of well matched backs pranced, cavorted and pinwheelcd in the approved Rockne

pinochle hand-eight aces. Backfield 
. B, labeled "arsenic," embraced Mur­
phy, Lukats, Sheetketski and Banas. 
No joking, this is the second string 
quartet at Notre Dame! It started 
the game and softened up Army to 
the snapping point. 
Backfield A, tabbed "strychnine," 
comprised Jaskwhich, Koken, Bran­
cheau and Melinkovitch. These regu­
lars did the mopping up in the second 
and fourth periods. The starting 
combination has just a shade more 
power; the clean-up brigade has an 
edge in speed. All eight backs ·can 
block like so. many Hardwicks. They 
exhibit a collective ferocity on .at­
tack, a devil-may-care abandon that 
may be duplicated here and there 
among individuals, but nowhere else 
in the mass. 
• \Vords are futile things with which 
to convey· the cadence, the poise, 
the rhythmic tempo, the arrogant as­
surance ·of these two Notre Dame 
backfields. The lilt of them, the joy­
ous zest of them, the lifting, shatter­
ing impact of them-must be seen 
with your own eyes! \X'hichever four 
happens to be in action functions with 
a measured deliberation, a metronomic 
precision redolent of tha~ intangible 
something we recognize as .. class."­
«One-two-three-four," you can 
hear them chant in unison as they hike to right or left, pause relaxed for the required second, arms swinging pen­dulum fashion and then explode in ·an ·irresistible torrent of pent-up muscu­lar a~d nervous energy. There is no lost motion, no false moves. You get an· impression of relaxed concentration which is the very essence of winning 
football. , Let's have a l~ok at a few high Water marks in the relentless surge of the Notre Dame ·attack, a rolling force as monotonous yet as variable as the waves of the sea. It is the second period. A raw wind hums through the spider web of steel girders supporting the triple deck grand stand. Coach Anderson has sent· in his climax-running ba~kfield Notre Dame holds the ball at midfield: Peppery Jashvhich, whom. Rockne personally selected as Carideo's. succ~s­sor, signals for a short side run by the fullback, George Melinkovich. This pale and interesting invalid had been fighting off influenza in the college !iick bay all last week. \Vhat chance had the flu germs to get the Utah 
bronco down? About as much chance as Army's tacklers! 
Melinkovich sweeps Army's left flank screened by three blockers-· Harris, Greeney and Jaskwhich. That Utah boy can run like a halfback, though his chief job is plunging, but his three interferers keep ahead of him, smacking down gold-helmetd cadets in staccato fashion. This blan­

r., keting interference is typical of Notre Dame's rushing attack. A way over by the East sideline Cadet Brown finally nails Melinko~ vich on the 20 yard stripe. Notre Dame shifts to 'face the wide open side of the field, but Melinkovich · along the ncar boundary on ·the same \'{/'est Pointers. · 
The convalescent is doing so well that they gave him the ball again. but he· fumbles when hit hard on the 5 yard line and Army is temporarily saved.· Maybe the flu has weakened Melinkovich after all eh? 

• Mike Koken, Schwartz's stubby 
successor, now starts harassing Army. Mike is a miniature projectile. \X'hen about to be tackled he takes off in a kind of swan dive, ·launching his· compact body head first through· space. It's practically a sure way of gaining 5 yards if you don't give. a whoop for your neck. Mike doesn't. 

Now Kosky, a· dashing, crashing wing m.an,· takes the ball from Koken on an end around phy and hurtles to a first down 2 yards from Arm)r's goal. Here the cadets, . their backs to 'the wall, stand like the British Second Corps at Ypres. Notre Pame disdains three'. sure points. by fiel~ goal. The boys in Nile green think-. only jn terms of touchdowns. . ' 
\X'hen Fields kicks out to the 3 6 yard mark with only tw? n~inutes to go, it l~oks as though ..~h~~fj_~s.t:. half

yard oblique hc.tve into Army's right wing zone. Capt. PalJl Host flags that sailing pass on the fly after cross-. ing over from his post at right end. Two Army secondaries are at his heels, but he beats them to the ball and scoots to the 5 yard stripe. 
No time to waste jabbing at Army's condensed line now. Koken scuds to­ward left end as though to circle t~e flank, suddenly turns tail, retreats rapidly, and lobs a high pass into the 
erid zone. A pair of bright green arms. reach up to gather in the ball. They belong to the sick man of South Bend. George "Spanish influenza" Melin­kovich, Esq. Quick, nurse, another shot of a_spirin! Like the soldier in 
the war-time tune, George can warble: "I don't want to get well, I don't want to get well, oh, I'm having a wonderful time!" 
• -In the second half, tender-hearted 
Hunk Anderson turned loose his second-string backs and to!d them not to catch cold. They didn't! Receiv­ing Army's kickoff, Sheetketski, Ba­nas, Murphy and Lukats paraded 40 yards on spinners, reverses and tackle slants. Just when it seemed that Army had ·this advance pegged, Steve Banas fell back in kick formation, but not to kick. Oh, dear me, no! 
It was fourth do\vn and the cadets weren't looking for a pass. They rushed B~nas, thinkin-; to block the punt. H~ gave ground nearly to mid­field, dodged one Army tackler and cramped for elbow room against the side line, launched a brobdignagian 
·pass. It was even longer than that toothsome adjective, covering a good 50 yards of frosted ozone. 
Away down yonder in the'· Bronx: end zone three Notre _Dame receivers were waiting impatiently for that floating-power pass. Reading from left to right. their names were Hugh Devore, Ed Kosky and Mike Koken. An imposing reception . committee, sure enough, even though high silk hats, suede gloves and gardenia-em­belished cutaways were missing to complete the Grover \X'halen touch. No \Vest Point representatives were 
present. ~ 
Any one of the three could have caught the pass, but Devore, being the only Irishman in the quorum, was elected to do the honors. Flanked by a Koken and a Kosky, this lone­some Irish boy· just didn't dare let that ball slip through his fingers. 
Broadcaster Oil 
BY WARREN BROWN 
• About once a year, in' football 
season, I make up my mind to listen to the radio broadcast of a game. 
I chose the Notre Dame-Army game, this year, as the medium for car-exercise. I gave up, before the first period was over, and "watched" the game coming in ove·r a press association printer, and was content. 
I wonder when the radio men arc ever going to realize that they are, in a certain sense, reporters, and not prophets. _ 
Not one of all their company is ever content ·to describe a play 'as, or after it happens. No, they must anticipate it, and nine times out of ten, they are wrong. 
The one I tuned out, seemed to have an Army complex, which is, of course, his privilege. I have a Notre Dame c"omplex, so I've been told, though at least one person who may read this space-filling bit announced, during . the season, that it looked as if I had gone over to Northwestern. 
However it grew tiresome, after. a while, listening to the broadcaster's promise that ·Vidal would get loose; one of these minutes, and go pl~ccs. I heard afterwards that he did get loose, and went back to the dressing room where there were no Krauscs, Kurths, Harrises, Grcencys or Robin­sons to harass him. 
\Xrhilc waiting for ·the breaking loose of Vidal, the broadcaster missed what still seems to me to be the big story of the Notre Dame-Army game, the introduction of a new offense de­
. signed by Coach Anderson. But broadcasters get that way, I 
suppose. If they assumed that their listeners accepted that they knew something about football, and didn't 
keep on trying to prove it, the whole program would "be much easier on the cars. Or would it? 
One of Notre Dame's friendly rivals, Dick Hanley, of Northwestern, tells the story of a broadcaster who went into training in earnest, for the coming season. 

• Here is one man who, the brilliant 
sports editor of the Chicago Herald and Examiner tells us, was really qualified to give words to his views on a football g:imc-he did once and every anticipatory remark was realized on the field of play. 
The training took the form of regu­lar· attendance at Hanley's coaching school, during the summer. The broadcaster asked more questions than an alumnus after his team has lost the game in which the alumnus gave somebody 20 points and bet him two dollars. 
OFFICIAL FOOTBALL 
R E V I E W 
The broadcaster was graduated with high honors, and was all set for. the season. 
He showed up to announce the play by play of the opening game on the Northwestern schedule. 
He went along in great style, for quite a while. The ball was deep in the opponents' territ6ry-actually on the five yard line, and directly in front of the goal posts. A play was run off. There was no gain. The officials swarmed in. The players clustered about in groups. 
All this was breathed into the mic­rophone at a-furious, highly excited rate. . 
"Ooh," fairly screamed the broad­
. caster. "It's a penalty for North­western. They must have been o.ff side. The referee has the ball. He is stepping off the yards. It can't be offside. He's gone more than five yards. It must be holding, or some­thing. No, he's gone 'more than fif­teen yards.· Gee, he's still going. In. all my experience, I have never seen a penalty like this. \Vhy, he's passed the center of the . field. He's still going: I can't understand it. There he is now, putting the ball on North­western's five yard line. 
"That is the most drastic penalty I have ever seen inflicted upon a team." 
And it was not until Northwestern put the ball into play again, that the broadcaster made the startling dis­covery that what he had just seen was the changing of goals at the end of the first period. 
Of course, this is an exceptional case of radio reporting, though it is abso­lutely true.· 
A ~arcr case is that in which two professional teams, one of them Jack Chcvigny's Cardinals, played a game in Chicago. Because the opposition wore jerseys of a cardinal hue, .just before· the .game began, Chevigny ordered his men to don jerseys of an­other color. It was well on towards the middle of the first period before a broadc-aster discovered that the team he was . calling Cardinals, weren't Cardinals at all, but eleven other fellows.

The Rockne System 
55 

BY ED BANG 
• .·Anyone who knows that clipping betgets a 25-yard penalty and has nothing to do with the barbering trade, has heard at some time or an­other of that intangible something called the ..Rockne system. The term "system" is one of football's vagaries and requires definition. Actually a coaching system is nothing more or less than a series of favorite forma­tions. \'\!hen those formations produ·ce enough touchdowns to genera tc three successive winning seasons, they auto­matically formulate themselves ·into a 
·system. The Rockne system, so-called, is based on a diamond of backs behind a balanced 'line. There is, as you sec, nothing occult about it. · In fact, football scholars will tell you that a coach can mobilize a far more versatile attack with the \Varner wingback formation as a starting point. 'But the patent fact remains that the Rockne style· is more ·widely copied and em­ployed than any two other systems you can name. An . aura of mystery has sprung up to shroud the Rockne sys:em; it is mentioned only in hushed wh1spers as though it were one of life's dark secrets. · The 'fundamental reasons behind the 
bn 

success of teams coached by Knutc 
Rockne lay not so much in the Notre Dame system, but in the master's methods of teaching. Rockne stressed the value of sound blocking. He saw to it that his interference was always fast enough to stay a step ahead of his ball-carrier. His line was perfectly · trained He emphasized precision in 
t1mmg. Always when you saw a 
Notre Dame team play you saw simple 
running plays take form behind flaw­
less protection. Any formation looks. 
impressive when you sec it crystallize 
behind a well-schooled line. Rockne 
built upon a groundwork of sound 
fundamental football. The system as 
such has had little to do with Notre 
Dame's winning streaks:. The system 
employed by Podunk High School 
would probably _have flourished equally 
as brightly behind the blocking 
Rockne provided for his star runners. 
And with such men as Carideo, Brill, 
Gipp, Schwartz, Stuhldrchcr ~nd the 
rest of them to execute it;' the Podunk 
system might easily have won as many 
games as the Rockne system. 
• An essential feature of the Rockne 
system is that so-called ..perfect touchdown play." Again the answer

lies in excc_ution rather than in design. And once again the magic touch of Knute Rockne has lent an atmosphere of dense glamour to what in the final analysis is little more than a simple off-tackle thrust. They tell you that when every man on. the team performs his task perfectly, the inevitable result of the formation must be a touch­down. They tell you that, concern­ing the Notre Dame play designed by Knute Rockne. But they neglect to tell you that every play in football designed by any coach, save a few out~of-bounds, or ..built-up" forma­tions, is calculated to produce touch­downs. And like. the Rockne touch­down play, they will all culmina tc .in scores IF every man ·functions per­fectly. · 
The difference is this. Rockne's pupils apparently arc schooled just a little bit better than the charges of

• The ad·visory board of the Nat­
ional Association of Volunteer Football Coaches rushed into a huddle in the Pittsburgh stadium late in the afternoon of Oct. 29. A matter of grave importance involving the foot­ball future of the great University of Notre Dame was involved. 
The Irish had been beaten. The duty oi the National Association of Vohinteer Football Coaches was to see that the Notre Dame coach was :fired without delay. The nation had to be canvassed for possible success-· ors to the Notre Dame coach.

UNIVERSITY NOTRE DAME !932 ~DITION 
Rule 7, Section 2, Article 5 
BY ARCH WARD 
(Sports Editor, The Chicago Tribune) 
El Since the playing d:1ys of Knutc 
Rockne, and on through the Gipp, 
Four Horsemen, and Caridco-Brill­
Schwartz cycles, Notre Dame has b2cn 
the motivating factor in American 
football. It has played before th:! 
largest crowds ever to sec games in 
this country. Attendance figures on 
any game played against Southern 
California, whether at Chicago or 
Los Angeles, and against Army at 
New York, will bcar.out that statc­
mmt. 
It has sent forth from its playing fields a large number of the country's leading coaches. Among the coaches who learned . their football at Notre Dame and who today can point to their records for the last few years with pride are Noble Kizer of Purdue, Chet \X'ynne of Alabama Poly, Jimmy Crowley of Michigan ·state, Frank Thomas of Alabama, Slip Madigan of St. Mary's of California, Gus Dorais of Detroit, Charley Bachman of Florida, and Harry Mehre of Georgia. 
It has developed speed, alertness and deception on attack, and the fundamentals of blocking and tack­
ling to such an extent that the Rockne ~ys.tcm is probably the most widely Imitated plan in the ga~P.~~.. 
All of these are patent· reasons for the impression Notre D_ame, its play­ers and coaches, have made on the game, but one argument generally overlooked in· the making of that im­pression is the effect the play of teams from South Bend has had ort the constitution of footbalL 
The most notable example of this, of course, had to do with the shift, wl.1ich enjoyed a comparative anony­mity for several years under the heading of ''Rule 9, Section 5" in the official playing rules of the National Collegiate Athletic association It retained that title until the beginnin-g of the 19 3 0 season, when the rules ~vere recodified and it. was ·renamed 
Rule 7, Section 2, Article 5". It \Vas the shift as practiced by Notre Dame elevens and their imita­
tors which disturbed the peace of that brief paragraph in the rules, and ever since those few sentences have prob­ably undergone more annual gram­rna tical surgery than any other portion of the book, and now. carries one of the longest supplementary explana­tions in the rules. 
The first major operation on it by the rule makers was performed at the beginning of the 1924 season, the last and greatest year of the Four Hors:!­mcn. Heretofore, the rule demanded only a momentary pause on the part 
of the shifting players, sufficiently long to assure officials of the legality of the play and that the ball was not snap­ped while the players were in motion. The note appended to the rule further stated that when a man. shifted to a new position, he should halt so that all momentum would be lost, and he would make a new start from a posi­tion of rest when the ball was put in play. 
The change in the 1924 rules, which undoubtedly grew out of the fact that the shift as practiced by Notre Dame gave light, speedy backs an opportunity to get perfect blocking angles, specified that players ((must come to an absolute stop and remain

stationary in their new posltlons suf­
. ficiently long enough to jJrevent any doubt in the minds of the officials as to t.~e legality of the play." This en­abled the defensive team to shift its players with the offense, and also was intended to restrain momentum, which was thought to be the secret of the Notre Dame system. This was a fallacy, since Rockne stressed not momentum, but rhythm and· timing, and the 1924 team gave ample testi­mony of this by winning the national championship. 
Another phrase aimed at the shift was inserted in the rules for the 19 2 6 season. It stressed thd fact that players in a shift must not only come to an absolute stop and remain sta­tionary in their new positions, but must do so. also ((without movement of the feet or swaying of the body." 
In 1927, still another effort to curb the shift was made. The original supplementary note to Section S of Rule 9 became Section 6 all by itself, with a suggestion for determining the length of the momentary pause now defined as q_ full second in this parenthetical sentence: ..This period may be conveniently measured by

Listening In to "Hunk" Anderson 
In which the Review pre­sents a copy of the genial Irish coach's national radio interview Nov. 18, the eve 
of  the  Navy-Notre  Dame  
game  at  Cleveland.  Read  
this and reap.  

1. Whom would you name as the most outstanding player ever produced at Notre Dame? · 
There is no doubt in my mind that George Gipp of the 1917, 1918, 1919, and 1920 teams is the greatest foot­
. ball. player ever produced at Notre Dame. Gipp had as much natural ability as any player I have ever come into contact with. He had a way of getting just a little bit farther than. perfect when the game was tough. Finally, he had a fighting heart. He went through that 1920 season like a true soldier, although he had already been stricken with the illness which was to cost him his life a few weeks after the season closed. I played ori the same teams. with him in 1919 and . 1920 and know first-hand his great character, generosity, team spirit, and courage. His last words were to Knutc Rockne, who has gone to join him in the next world. He told ..Rock" that when the going got tough sometime to tell the boys to 
... go out and win one for the Gipper." That last statement of his was typical of his life. 
2. Do you think the new 193 2 rules have made football safer for the players? If so, do you think the game is less thrilling or less spectacular because of the rules? 
think that the rules have made the game safer. There has been a definite decrease in the number of deaths and serious injuries from foot­ball this year. In the main, they have not detracted from the color of the game, with the exception of the dead ball rule. ·This rule declares the ball dead when any part of the player's body except his hands and feet touches the ground. It has stopped many potential long runs when a player has slipped while in the open with no one near him. It has also encouraged fumbling and loose ball playing de­fensively because the ball is dead when 
the carrier hits the ground and it · 
doesn't matter if he fumbles. There 
is still the instinct to fall on a loose 
ball, and this scrambling has resulted 
in as many. injuries as .. piling on" used 
to under· the old rule. I suggest modi­
fying this rule to read that if the 
player slips five yards either side of 
the line of scrimmage that the ball 
should be dead. But if he is more 
than five yards past the line of scrim­
mage, he should be allowed to get up 
and continue if possible. Players arc 
capable of taking care of themselves 
and they know how to prepare for 
piling on if it is going to occur. 
3. 
Where and how did you get your nickname ccHunk"? 

\Veil, this is a long story, at least in the matter of years. \Vhcn I went to grade school, I always used to hang around · the older fellows and try to pal with them. The others started calling me ...Unc," short fC?r. uncle . Then, when I went on to high school, they a·dded the ..H" and I've been called ..Hunk" ever since. 

4. 
Do you think the charges ot proselyting and paying players are exaggerated, or do you believe these to be common practices? 


I think ·that these charges arc greatly exaggerated. In cases where they are true, it is very seldom that the university itself is to blame. Some­times enthusiastic townspeople or alumni take it upon themselves to help a star player through school without the knowledge or sanction of the school. But very few schools in the country place football on such a high plane that they will come out and buy football players. \X'c don't have to at Notre Dame because enough good players arc attracted to the university by our scholastic and athletic reputa­tion so that we have plenty of good material almost every year. I think the same is true of many other schools. Most athletes are in school primarily to get an education. Their marks show this. At Notre Dame the av­erage of our athletes is consistently higher than that for the rest of the university. Football or other sports arc to them nothing more than games. They arc too sm~rt to place football on a pedestal and to think that foot..: ball success means success in later life. 

5. What -:w-ould you name as the most thrilling play you have wit­nessed in your career? 
The biggest kick I ever got out of football came in the last three minutes of our game with Southern California in 1926. Art Parasien, our left handed passer who had won the N orthwestcrn game a few weeks pre­vious with two perfect tosses in the last quarter, was rushed into the game with the ball deep in our own terri­tory. He threw one long pass to Johnny Niemiec, left. halfback, to put the ball in mid-field. \X'e then tried three running plays, and he cut loose -with another long pass to Nie­miec for a touchdown. Five plays took us right down the field to score. 
·Niemiec added the extra point and we won the game, 13. to 12. 
· 6. How many nationalities are included on the roster of the Irish, and what are they? 
\X'e have a total of 25 nationalities and combinations of nationalities on our roster this year. There arc 3 0 Irish boys and six German-Irish lads. Eight others are French-Irish, Italian­Irish, Bohemian-Irish, American-Irish, Scotch-Irish, English-Irish, \Vclsh­Irish, and Canadian-Irish. The other nationalities are German, Bohemian­German, Italian, English, Polish, Span­ish, Slovak, Hungarian, Austrian, Portuguese, Jewish, ·Belgian, Bohemian, Lithuanian, Swiss, and Swedish. 
7. Do you :find that the eco­nomic trend has affected attend­ance at .the football games? If so, what is being done, generally, to offset it? · 
The depression naturally has hurt 

UNIVERSITY NOTRE DAME t932 EDITION 
attendance at games, although interest in football is just as great as ever. Most schools arc cutting ticket prices and scaling prices as we have done for 
· tomorrow's game with Navy. 
8. To what do you attribute the increase in attendance at pro­fessional football games? 
In the first place, people have a real attraction at professional games in the person of the all-American stars they will see. Secondly, prices are lower on the average for professional games than for college games.. 
9.-Whom would you include in an all-time all-American team? 
This is the hard question to answer and it is impossible to draw up an all­time all-American team that will meet with the favor of everyone. Here is my ·contribution: 
At left end, I would place Dclwig who played for Marquette around 1923 and is now starring for the Green Bay ·Packers. At left tackle, I would put Ed Healy who starred for Dart:­mouth in 1916. Jack Cannon, left guard at Notre Dame in l929, was a great all around man who gave every­thing he had in every ball game during the National Championship season. At center I . would put Alexander of Syracuse who played grade A foot­ball from ·19.17 to 1919. As Camion's running mate .at right guard, I pick "Swede"· Youngstrom of Dartmouth who also played from 1917 to 1919. Experts are practically unanimous in their choice of \"Vilbur Henry of Washington and Jefferson at right tackle Henry was a giant in size and he played all-American football in every game from 1917 to 1919. Rutgcr's famous negro end, Robeson, who starred in 1918 is my c~oice for Dclwig's running mate at right end •. I think the greatest quarterback I have ever seen is Gus Shaver who ended his career for Southern California last year. At left half I would put G.eorge Gipp, Notre Dame's immortal star who stands head and shoulders above every other football player ever turned out at Notre Dame. At the other halfback, I pick Marty Brill, also of Notre Dame, who played with the National Champions of 1929 and 1930 doing most of the blocking for those long runs of Marchie Schwartz's. 
Ernie Nevers of Stanford, who gave the Four Horsemen a real afternoon's work-out and otherwise distinguished himself as a great fullback, is my choice at· this position. 
10. Do you believe that the forward pass has made football more interesting? 
Yes. The use of the forward pass has opened up the game and made it more interesting to players and a great­er spectacle for the crowds. People may or may not understand the science and skill connected with line crash­ing and run~ing the ends, but they feel an instinctive thrill when a pass is thrown . whether or not it hits the mark. The open game generally has made football more interesting for the fans and the forward pass is a vital part of the open game. 
11. What is your opinion of the proposed abolition of the kick-off? 
I know from my experience as a player that the moment just before the kick-off is a thrill a player never forgets on a big game. · The new rules have largely done away with .injuries on the kick-off and I am entirely in favor of leaving the rule the way it is now. I think spectators, too, get a thrill out of that tense moment just before the kicking side charges for­ward and the game . starts. 
12. What sort of diet rules are enforced on the Notre Dame squad, and what hours are boys forced to keep? 
\o/e don't have any trammg table at Notre Dame in the strict sense of the word but the usual procedure in our dining halls is to serve the big meal at noon and the lighter meal at night. \Ve reverse this process for 

----~...·­

the football players so that they eat their lighter meal at noon and do not have to practice on a full stomach, an~ then they eat their heavy meal at night when they have a better appetite. But they get the same food that the rest of the student body gets. \"Ve 
have them in bed every night by 10:00 o'clock. except the night following a game when they arc allowed to stay up until 12:00. .They are all up in the morning at 6:30. 
13. How many plays does your quarterback have at his beck and call? 
\o/ e have· approximately 70 plays, most of which work either to the right or left, giving us a total of 140. During the course of a season, we run into at least five different defenses · and we find that usually only about twenty·of our plays will work against each of these defenses. In some cases, th.ere is only a slight variation in a play to make it work against all the five defenses and in those five forms, we consider this as five different plays. 
14. Mr. Anderson, millions of people know what goes on during a game but very few know what happens in the locker room during the half intermission. I wonder if you would describe that scene? 
\"Vhat happens in the locker room depends largely on how the game is going and whether we are. winning -or losing. I usually take the players one by ·one and tell them what mistakes they have been making and what things they have been doing right and should continue to do. Some players should be encouraged and others have to be ridiculed lightly ·to get the best out of them. It is easy to tell whether a player is giving his best or 
_ not, and to talk to him in the right way to get him at his peak, or to keep him. there. After going over the individual's mistakes, I usually call the quarterbacks aside arid. tell them what plays I think will work against the defenses we ·are meeting. , Then I usually give the team as a whole a little talk. This talk, more than the others, depends on whether we are winning or losing. If we are way ahead and going good, there is no need of delivering the Gettysburg Address. But if the team doesn't look so well, we sometimes have to bring out a little oratory to get them going.

All-America 
BY CHRISTY WALSH 
• Editor's Notc:-Thc All American Board 
of Football was founded in 1924 with Knutc Rockne, Glenn \Varner, and T. 'A. D. Jones as charter members. The present membership consists of Eddie Casey, Glenn Warner, \V. A. Alexander. Jesse Harper and Christy Walsh. 
At least one meeting has been held annually since 1924 and in the nine years every meet­ing has been conducted with a full member­ship present; players arc never selected by letter, wire, or proxy. But one lineup is named each year; no second or third team is selected. 
The eleven players receive handsome certi­ficates, gold watch charms, sweaters, and all­America blankets. Players not named in the lineup but worthy of all-America rating, receive Cards of Merit authorized by the Board. 
• The All America Board of Foot­
ball was born. in the year of the Four Horsemen! The first meeting was held as the curt.ain fell on the sea­son of 1924, and. it is little wonder that three Irish players were selected for the backfield, with Harold (Red) Grange completing the quartet. Since that year, no college -has plac~d three players on the All America team in the same season. 
Elmer Layden, Jim.my Crowley and Harry Stuhldrcher were selected almost by acclamation, but the following year the pendulum swung the ·other way and the· All America lineup show­ed no names from Notre Dame. The same thing happened in 1928 when the Fighting ·Irish touched their lowest rung in the football ladder, with four

Harry Stuhldrehcr, quarterback; Elmer Layden, fullback; and James (Sleepy.) Crowley, were all members of the Four

Arthur "Bud" Boeringcr was rated 

the best center in the land in 1926 
and received his All America certifi­
cates at Los Angeles game; and Johnny 
Smith, Irish captain in 1927, emerged 
as an All America guard following a 
five hour meeting of the Board in the 
Palmer House, Chicago. 
Then came 1929, the start of the 

long winning streak at Notre Dame. 
From the ashes of a four-game flop, 
this great, colorful squad of players 
rose to the heights of a national title. 
Army was the last contest on the 
schedule and the game was staged at 
Yankee stadium. But it may as well 
have been played at one of the ball 
parks in the arctic circle. Jack Elder 
became a nation-wide hero overnight, 
but it was the cool (or you might say, 
freezing) generalship of Frank Carideo 
and the marvelous play of hatless Jack 
Cannon that kept Army and the great 
Chris Cagle from skating their way to 
a touchdown. Carideo's hands arc 
still cold and my nose is still red from 
that game. 
• The Board meeting was scheduled , 
for New York City on the follow­ing day, but Knutc Rockne lay ill at home, and so his All America associ­ates entrained for South Bend where "Rock," propped high with pillows, turned the meeting into a spirited con­ference, and Carideo and Cannon re­stored All America prestige to Notre Dame, after a lapse of a year. 
little man. 
Frank Carideo and Marty Brill of the 1929 and 1930 national champions were the blocking forces which paved the way for Marchmont Schwartz," choice of the Board for 1931. Carideo was on the Board team in both years and Brill was named in 1930. 
Joe Kurth climaxed his three year's of first team effort "by winning the recogni­tion of the Board this year. 
In the photograph at the right, the Review presents two past and two future all-America stars. They arc Frank Cari­deo, Dick Walsh, Christy \Valsh, .Jr., and Marchy Schwartz. Christy and Dick arc cousins. One look at the determined set of thci~ respective jaws should be warn­ing enough to anyone who has to play against them in years to come. 
Unlike some players who make All 
America in their Junior years, only to 
slow down in the baccalaureate sea­
son, Frank Carideo was better than 
ever in 1930, and he stands today as. 
the only Notre Dame player selected 
in two consecutive years. 
Marty Brill, perhaps the greatest 
blocking halfback in modern footb:tll, 
went into the all-star lineup, due 
largely to the insistence of Knutc 
Rockne at the 1930 meeting. 
The following year saw the two­man precedent maintained with :Marchy Schwartz, swanky race-horse of the gridiron, in the backfield, and Capt. Tommy Yarr leading all candi­dates for the center spot. Notre Dame's quota of All America honors for 1932 is limited to a single player -but to Joe Kurth goes the dis.:. tinction of being the first Notre Dame tackle ever selected by the Board. 
B The policies. of the All America 
Board arc definite and independent. 'Membership on a championship team is no assurance of All America selec­tion, while on the other ·hand, players should not be penalized because they star with such formidable aggrega­tions as Southern Calfornia and Notre Dame. 
This Board does not claim to speak ex cathedra, nor do we overlook the fact that in some quarters prejudice exists against the practice. of picking

Yes! N. D. Has Irish Stars 
BY JIMMY CORCORAN 
(Reprinted from the Chicago Evening American) 
• \'Vhen Heartly ("Hunker") Anderson is around you can't kid the Irish of Notre Dame. \'Vhat's that, Oscar? There aren't any Irish at Notre Dame this year. 
\'Veil, now, don't let "Hunk" hear you. Yesterday he was discussing the subject just before his flock step­ped forth for another session of tum­ble-around prior to the meeting with Pitt. 
It seems that some one had com­municated to "Hunk" that down on Squirrel Hill in Pittsburgh, which is 
-where Pitt Stadium is located, the boys were laughing up the sleeves of their vests because of the synthetic Irish eleven that N. D. had this year. 
Being an old umbrage . taker, Mr. Anderson took high umbrage. He crinkled his washboard brow for the moment and then broke loose: 
ttSo there aren't auy Irisb around Notre Dame ibis year, eb? ''(! bo said that? Pittsburgb? ''(!ell, I'll sbow 'em. If they're uot careful I'll send a wbole Irisb tean"i agin' 'em Saturday mid tben they'll be sorry tbey ever said tbal." · 
Then "Hunk" waxed a little bit Gxlic and let it be known that he can do a ·lot of waxing on the "be­gorras" and the "Faiths" when he gets mad. 
He went on: 

ttShurc ami the man wbo said we have 110 Irish is going to be after get­tin' the lic/{ing of his life, the young SjJa!jJeelr. Faitb, aml I thiuk it's those Pittsburghs who are violatin' the good uame of St. Patrick Er.iu Go Bragb and Kayhe wiltl:m Shain." 
"Hunk" was almost out of Irish expressions by this time but he wasn't through talking. He hissed:

«Hunk" is rcally·Scotch-Irish himself, despite the Nordic name. 
• And then "Hunk" \vent on to 
orat~ on how he would toss a whole team of fighting Irish against Pitt if they didn't stop their back-· biting or backgammon or whatever it was "Hunk" ·thought they were doing down on Squirrel Hill. 
Anderson was merely warming up by this time: 
ttNo Irish on the team, eh? 'Veil's bow ·would tbey lilw to see this jJack in action.

"Hunk" paused for breath. He 
felt that he had won his point. 

Some one remarked that few of 
these fighting Irish had been heard 
from. To which "Hunk" replied:

Don't be surprised, then, if Pat Aloysius Anderson lets fly with a fighting Irish layout against Pitt Saturday. 
Anderson states that it is possible, but not likely, that the Irish may fall down on the job ·Saturday, but if they show signs. of faltering he'll dazzle. the Pitt Panthers by rushing in Poffenberger, Pfefferle, Riccobono, 
Schralli, Sheeketski, Melinkovitch, Na­bicht and Jaskwhich and let Pitt wrestle around with 'em for a while.

• ADDENDUM-There have been 
many requests at the Notre Dame athletic association office during the past year for accurate information concerning the various nationalities of the uFighting Irish." These re­quests have been multiplied many times in letters to radio sports broad­casters, newspapers, and other sourc;es of information. 
A survey made at the beginning of the season disclosed that 26 nation­alities were represented at that time on the Notre Dame roster. Of the 110 players invited back for practice, 4 3 were either all-Irish or part-Irish. 

So the term uFighting . Irish"· is no misnomer. It came into use back m 1909 when the team included such names as Collins, Duffy, Dolan, Dwyer, Edwards, Kelly, Lynch, Mil­ler, Maloney, Matthews, McDonald, Sulivan, and Vaughn., Notre Dame was playing Michigan. The \Volv­erines were leading, 3 to 0. 
Robert (Pete) Vaughan was play­ing in-the backfield for Notre Dame. Exasperated at Notre Dame's showing, he rushed up to the line, slapped them all on the back and exhorted: 
u\Vhat's the matter with you· fel­lows You're all Irish and you're not fighting!" 
A wandering reporter on the side­lines, following the teams-for in those days there were no glass-enclosed press boxes-overheard the remark and used it in his story of Notre Dame'~ great come-back and 11 to.· 3 victory.

The Review All-Opponent Tearn 
BY JOSEPH PETRITZ 
• The fortunate part, for this writ-
et·,.of naming the Qfficial Football Review's all-Opponent team annually is that he is not personally open to criticism from fans of other teams who thought so-and-so should ·have been pick~d instead of another player. 
\'V'e merely take the lineups and substitutions. for the various games and present them to the squad and coaches, .drawing up a consensus from their remarks and choices. It is our obliga.tioJ?-merely to put into words what they ·have--·decided. · ·· · · 
For example, a notice from a Coast paper came to our attention regarding the choice of ·Ernest (Pug) Rentner of Northwestern at right halfback rather than Erny Pinckert of South­ern . Calfornia on last year's team. Pinckert, said the·· .dispatch, helped to talk Notre Dame out of the game. He gave. "the rib" to the Irish team and they took it, according to this writel'. . Therefore, they would not consider Pinckert on their team, even though ~e was a _popular all-American choic:e.. They . were too incensed to do right by Pinckert. · 
Our only answer· is that Pinckert was a very popular choice when the selections were made. Orv Mohler, whose great work at quarterback took the Trojans down the :field thrice for their .two touchdowns and their :field goal, was placed on the team. Johnny Baker, who kicked the.:field goal which beat Notre Dame, was put on the team. Garrett Arbelbide, :whose :fine work at· right end went more or less u·nnoticed in the public prints, was pl:iced· on the all-opponent team. In Baker's case, the deciding factor was not his all-American status or his actual field goal. It was his fine exhi­bition of offensive guard play which impressed the Notre Dame linemen he blocked out o£ plays. Then, his. defensive play, his tackles all over the :field, his fast work on punts-these were the elements the players and coaches talked about. 
In the case of Pinckert, all said his. work was outstanding. Not a word. did this writer hear about his "razz­ing" Notre Dame players .until the. enlightened Coast writer brought it to our attention. Pinckert failed by 
-but ·a· few votes of becoming a fourth member of the Trojan squad to place ·on this selection. 
• This year's. team was unique in 
Football Review history in that eight of the 11 players were named al­most unanimously on the return of the team from Los Angeles. The other three were placed on the team with room to spare, although the competi­tion was closer than in the case of the oth~r eight. 
A· scarcity of outstanding centers made this position the easiest to pick. Joe Tormey of Pittsburgh, one of the Panther's well-publicized "cripple threats" before that history-making upset on Squirrel Hill, was practically the unanimous selection of the Notre Dame centers, guards, and backs. Before the game it was doubted if enough glue, string, and tape could be gathered to hold him together for 60 minutes. But he played 60 min­utes of the finest ·line play seen all season by the Irish. 
'ToJ;mey carries on the Pitt tradi­tion of fine centers. Last year, the Review selection was Ralph Daugh­erty of Pitt. At that time Tormey was giving Daugherty a battle for the position after being made over from a tackle the previous season.. Harbold of Navy, whose fine defensive work featured the game at Cleveland sta­dium, was the second choice. He played inspired ball and piled up those second half goal line thrusts like a tiger. He had been instructed evidently, however, to follow t~e Notre Dame quarterback as a_ guard against passes. On several plays, the quarterback faked to. the right or left and pulled Harbold out of position for the. other backs to go rolling "up the alley" which he had just vacated. This was the ·only point held against the Middy center. Capt. Oren Crowe of Haskell also played a great pivot game against tremendous odds. 

There were no Bakers among the 
guards this year, but Capt. Milton 
Summerfelt of Army came· the closest 
with his fine exhibition at Yankee 
stadium. "Even when we were three 
touchdowns ahead and Army didn't 
have a chance," said the Notre Dame 
players, "we couldn't leave Summer­
felt open or he'd ·come piling through 
to smear the play behind the line of 
scrimmage. He played hard, clean 
football and is a true sportsman." 
His position was impregnable all that 
afternoon. 
Capt. Jim Reedy of Navy played 

the game of his life in his home town, · . Cleveland, to i.vin the respect of the Irish players and to win the other guard position. This· was a tightly­
con tested race, with Arron (Rosy) 
Rosenberg of Southern California 
closest. AI Kawai of Northwestern 
played a beautiful game at this posi­

tion after being shifted into the line from quarterback only a few ctays before the Notre Dame game. Reedy's ability to protect Center Harbold on offense, to pull out fast and block terrifically on end runs, . and to pile up plays_ aimed at him, however, got him the nomination. 
• Ernie (Foots) Smith of Southern California played up to his press 
·notices and his all-American rating by 
making it· tougher for Notre Dame 
than any other tackle all season. And 
there were some fine tackles sent 
against the Irish this past season, a 
crop which compared favorably with 
last year's remarkable group. 
Peter Mehringer of Kansas, one of 
the unsung heroes of the 1932 cam­
paign, took second honors and the 
other tackle position iri'· the Review 
poll. He was a popular favorit~ with 
the Notre Dame tackles, ends, and 
halfbacks for his ability to stay uin 
there" on defense, and for his hard 
blocking on offense with the same 195 
pounds which won hiin the Olympic 
heavy-weight wrestling championship. 
Some of the :fine tackles who neces­sarily were left off the team despite outstanding play against Notre Dame arc \X'alton of Pittsburgh, Riley· of Nort4westcrn, Capt. Milo Bowers of Drake, Forsman of Carnegie Tech, Lincoln and Armstrong of Army, and Brown of Southern California. The fact that all of these lads got votes shows the kind of tackles they raise now days. · 
Dick Fencl, Northwestern's head­gear-less all-\X'estern wingman, was the most popular choice at end. He played an inspired game which kept his mates from going to pieces after George Melinkovich's 98-yard return of the opening kickoff had set the stage for demoralization. Fencl played with the cool, calculating clan of the veteran he is, yet his vicious tackling packed the fire of a freshman in his first big scrimmage against the var-

between Ford Palmer and Ray Sparling of Southern California, going to Sparling because of his added ability as a running threat on end-around plays. Both played fine ball against Notre Dame. It was Sparling's lot to succeed Francis Tappaan and Gar­rett Arbclbidc of the same school as the Review first team selection 
Close on the heels of Sparling and Palmer came Pittsburgh's two fine wingmen, T cd Dailey and Skladany, the former chiefly for his alert de­fensive work and interception of a Notre Dame pass for Pitt's second touchdown, and the latter for his 

·reckless, fiery defensive play. Edgar Manske of Northwestern and .Colin Stewart of Carnegie Tech also received votes at this position. 
Coming to the backfield, we find Oliver (Ollie) Olson of Northwestern practically the unanimous choice at fullback-and considerable variation 
. of opinion at the other three spots. Olson's brilliant punting was used as a lever to force Notre Dame back in­to its own territory time and again (Continued 011 j1agc 100)

The Managers 

John Sherman 
• Now, wait a minute. Just be­
cause the fellows who appear on this page have no football uniforms, don't let that stop you from reading this and getting the "low-down" on some of the "men behind the guns" -the student managers. 
, Most of you have probably never given a moment's thought to the fact that a football team, especially one from a major college, is composed of more than a number of players and a coach. But there is a group of men who take care of all the details that such a· team requires. For instance, "during the week of practice before a game a. great amount of equip11_1ent has to be hauled out to Cartier Field and so arranged that the coaches will not lose a second of the precious time· reserved for practice. 
Theri, all the business affairs of the trips must be handled by these mana­gers. And on some days, when the varsity is playing away from home, there may also be one or two reserve games in some distant city. The new Stadium in which you view the home games is managed by these men. 
But to go on with a description of 
Anthony Wirry 
all the managerial duties would cause Mr. Petritz to edit another book. Maybe a little history of the organi­zation is in order. /The present ..Ath­letic Managers' Association" .was e-s­tablished in ·1920 when "Rock" saw that football was becoming too big for him to continue being coach, director of athletics, trainer, equip­ment dispenser, and manager all at the same time. So he delegated the manager's duties to a group of loyal students, his other tasks to other men, and centered his talents on coaching.

which he ·inaugurated is still in usc. He always believed in competi­tion and any manager can tell you · that there is as much competition in his job as there is on the team. . A player rriay have only six or seven ahead of him to beat out for the first­string position but a manager has to come up through a group of seventy, all vicing for the same place-the senior m_anagcrship of ·football. 
Briefly, the system is as follows: the men are split up into four groups _;_seven seniors· who have complete 
Frank R. Buhl 

charge of one sport apiece, (except in football where three arc required) seven juniors, :fifteen sophomores, and about. seventy freshmen. ·The three lower classes work on all sports so that they will have ~he necessary ex­. perience to manage any of them. _The juniors rceive senior appointments at the end of the year, seven of the· sophomores are chosen to fill their shoes, and fifteen freshmen arc re­tained for the following year. Each class is responsible to the class above. 
. For the 19 3 i football season, An­thony \Y/. \Y/irry, Racine, \Wisconsin, was chosen Senior Manager of Foot­ball. In addition to this title, he is President of the Notre Dame Stadium Ushers' Club ex officio. Under him the efficiency of his men has not only been greatly improved because of new systematic methods which he em­ployed, but he has brought about greater harmony in his organization by forming a club so that the fellows could ~·get together" outside of wo_r~­ing hours and indulge in social actiVI­ties. As a token of his pop~larity, he was elected president at the first 
meeting.

The two associate football mana­
gers are Frank R. Buhl of Dayton, Ohio, and John B. Sherman of South Bend. Buhl has to s~e to it that the Stadium is properly taken care of, hire and fire the eight hundred men who are employed to act as ushers, gatemen, etc., and attend to a host of other details which the efficient way in which he has managed the Stadium this year bring up. He is also Secretary-Treasurer of the Ushers' 
Club. Sherman is in complete charge of all the practiCe sessions and Cartier Field. His job is none the less impor­tant but even brings in matters which require a keen and skillful mind to ac­complish. To -sum up the season in a few words, we can say "The team was never better managed than in 19 3 2.'' Clyde Lewis, a junior manager, ren­dered invaluable-service by accom­panying the team on all trips and

taking charge of the great amount of 
baggage usually carried along. 
In addition to this detail work, Lewis was an occupant of the press box at every game, where he utilized his technical knowledge of the game to keep statistics, charts, diagrams, and other data, confusing to the av­erage spectator, but invaluable to Coach Anderson in making plans for future games. Lewis and his aides kept statistics of every regulation 
scrimmage, so that Anderson had facts to back up his judgements or to help him form opinions of ·various players -downtown coaches' opinions to the contrary. 
The other senior managers for this year are: Burton M. Shinners, Basket­ball; John F. Kenney, Track; \Vf. Don. Martin, Baseball; James \Vf. Baker, Cross-Country and Tennis; Andrew 
E. O'Keeffe, Golf. A complete list of the junior m'lna­

gers is as follows: Clyde Lewis, Ed. Fisher, Ed. Mulvihill, Charles Quinn, Robert Kelley, Richard Hanley, and Fred. Sullivan. 
• The appointment of \Virry to the 
senior managership was a source of particular satisfaction to him because he had gone out for the same job in his high school days and had been rejected. It's like the fellow who fails to make his high school football team and then captains the varsity at col­lege, or the lad who can't be leader of his Boy Scout patrol and then becomes president of the country. 
The efficient work \Virry did during the past season is justification enough for a lot of second-guessing on the part of his high school authorities, not that this modest, quiet, efficient man is likely to hold it against them, or even give it a second thought. ·

Through Thick and Thin 
BY EDMUND STEPHAN 
(Editor Notre Dame SCHOLASTIC) 
• Everybody at Notre Dame talks 
about it but nobody has ever even attempted to define it. It is that something that wasn't the week before the team left for Pittsburg, and that something that was ·the week or so after it got back. Some people are trite enough to call it .. school .spirt." P.erhaps that's the closest way of get­tmg to the real thing, at that. 
. Every college that has ever had a 
football team has claimed that it has 
something in the way of an under­
graduate fidelity, a student bond, that 
can be approximated by no other in­
stitution. Notre Dame is no excep­
tion. You can't blame her for feeling 
that way, though. If you walked out 
onto her campus some October cve­
ni~g after.dinner with a traditionally 
bnght Indiana moon peeking through 
the clouds, with torches blazing from 
every other tree, with the band lead­
ing the boys down the line, with 
everybody in a sort of reckless mood, 
you might be inclined to admit that 
there's something_to it all. 
\'fe spoke of Notre Dame's band her marching band. Under Profes~ sor Joseph Casasanta, the lads with the blue and gold capes are known wherever Notre Dame men get to­gether. "Cas" knows what the stud­ents want and what the public wants; and he comes out with -something new every year. He and his machine arc an ess.enti~l part of Notre Dame :fight. Nothmg IS as spontaneous as a "Hike Song" or a "Victory March," nothing as touching as "Notre Dame, our Mother," after Hunk has just told the boys that the Army will have its hands full if the flu works its way out of the observation car. 
. .­
But the ·natural student pepper 
needs a little organizing. That is 
the jo~ of the tradition-preservir{g, 
energetiC Student Activities Council 
and Blue Circle, under the respective they had a nice bit of work in front of them. Nobody could get excited about the Carnegie Tech game; and when the team went slightly below its point-a-minute scoring, nobody lost any sleep over the approaching Pitt affair. Some of the old boys saw. the condition, but what could be done about it?· 
The break came. All that had to be said after Skladany and Heller and a few others did their dirt, and after everybody at Pitt had cut their Mon­day classes, was that the Irish spirit was dead. Right away somebody sug­gested a week's preparation for a Northwestern pep meet. Every hall on the campus combed the walks about the lake for wood. Even the buildings begari to look different. Placards stuck to porches and trees, to everything but the corn-flake. boxes in the Dining Hall. The janitors be­came Northwestern conscious-Sarin Hall's Alec was. ready to take Kurth's place if necessary_ to stem the tide of the Evanstoncrs. Hanley and his \'fildcats .never looked any worse-than they did hanging by their heels from Alumni hall's roof. The campus looked like New Orleans on Mardi Gras night. 

The bonfire was the night before 
the game. Even Governor-elect 
McNutt was sorry -he missed it. When 
the fireworks had gone off, and a 
flock of seniors crowded into Sorin 
hall, Father Farley told them the team 
had been in bed for an hour and · to 
take it easy. The next day was cold 
but the Irish. were hot. _ 

· \'fhethcr people know. it or not, 
Notre Dame spirit is not measured in 
terms of nation~l · championships. 
Three thousand students proved it a 
couple of years ago when they got up 
at four-thirty to welcome . home ·a 
team that had lost four games that . . season . a~d w~o were s'ecing Army laterals m thetr sleep. It isn't the students alone that are responsible for· 
They call it "school· spirit," that something whicb brings · the student body to its feetI 
fighting, behind the team in adversity,. that something which lies dormant when the team .is winning, and needs only the sting .of adversity to waken it into swaggering action. 
school. It is just something about Notre Dame. 
And probably the finest part of 
that something is its complete free~om from the sticky, maudlin sentimentality that can-and so fre­quently docs-mar an intangible exis­tence of this nature. Surely there is sentiment in the thing called Notre Dame spirit, but just as surely there is no weep-on-your-shoulder blubber. ~l~ays the spirit of the Fighting Irish IS h~e t~e play of the Fightng Irish: a thmg clean-cut, wholesome, sincere. 
. Expression of a swelling tide of feel­mg m the student body invariably takes highly virile form. The students ?emonstratc their loyalty, their "pep" m other ways than self-ballyhoo of .. b oy arc we workcd-up!" By that manner they make more convincing a spirit that is essentially honest.

is indicated in the numerous notices the Fighting Irish receive in the public prints, other 'than the sport pages and sport news syndicates. 
Cartoons for nationaly distributed magazines and national syndicates, editorials, and page one news stories about the fate of the Irish in their games indicate that the country is Notre Dame­minded at least during the football season.

Notre ·Dame-National Issue 
BY LAWRENCE PERRY 
Why do the crowds Flock to Notre Dame games and follow the Fighting Irish with their radios? The phe­nomenon of Notre Dame's tremendous drawing power is laid,by this ace writer of the New York Sun and Con­solidated Press Association to a number of causes which he outlines herewith. 
One of the phases of the football 
season just passed that has inter­ested the pubilc gcncr;lly and, in particular has amazed our economists, is an enormous drawing power of the Notre Dame eleven in a period of national depression when outlay of money for football tickets might logic­ally be expected to be one of the first items that would suggest itself in any scheme of retrenchment. 
Wherever the Irish have played the attendance either has taxed the capac­ity of the fields or in any case has crowded them to an unprecedented degree--the culmination, of cour~c, being the con test against \'X'est .Point when every nook, cranny and corner of the Y ankcc Stadium was packed with edged-in spectators and the con­ditions in the Los Angeles Coliseum -Notre Dame-Southern California game-in which scats were literally at a premium. 
~any reasons exist for this popu­lamy of the N otrc Dame team, a public attitude, by the way, which is not new but has existed ever since the ~oaching genius of Knutc Rockne hf~e~ the Fighting Irish to a .plane of .gndtron proficiency equal, to the best 
•.n the land and not infrequently stand-Ing aloof as supreme. . . ~rimarily Notre Dame is a Ca~ho­hc Institution and Catholics through­o.ut the nation take pride in its posi.:: tm~ among the football playing insti­tu~IOn_s of the country. And their pnde IS practical. They do not express It merely by talking, but in the.. morc 
practical manner of digging down in­to their pockets and producing four dollars and forty cents or 'vhatcver is the price of admission to arenas in which the Irish appear as one of the rival teams. Incidentally it might be said that it makes little difference who the rival is so that the outfit be one of calibre sufficiently impressive to insure that the Fighting Irish will have to live up to their nom de guerre. 
• . But, aside from Catholic support, Notre Dame teams have almost if not quite as heavy a following among those without collegiate affiliation and varied, if any, religious adherences, who know a good football team when. they sec one and have a who!esome desire to sec one as often as opportunity 
offers. They love football as a game, like to sec it played well and, above all, their enjoyment is heightened by the fact of having some university team to tic to. So they tic to Notre Dame as to no other college team in the 
country. 
It has been said that N otrc Dame "brought football to the masses" and there is more in this than many might think. So when the Irish play they turn out by tens of thousands; they buy the blue and gold Notre Dame pennants and for that afternoon­and usually all evening following the game-they arc Notre Dame folk. They ha,;c adopted the university at South Bend and they are a's loyal as any alumnus. 
Then, for that matter, there is the alumni body of Notre. Dame, a far flung group who with their families and friends form a not negligible crowd at games in which Notre Dame is represented. 
Finally, there is the sporting crowd, those who go to games of 'Yhatcvcr sort, football, baseball, hockey, prize

BILL DIETZ Haskell Coach 
The 1932 Notre Dame squad was the finest body of men I have ever seen on a football field. Their blocking, charg­ing, kicking and passing was most unusual, and their gen­eral team play from the stand· point of precision and execu­tion was a thing to marvel at, 

OREN CROWE Haskell Captain

NOTRE DAME HASKELL 

B The largest opening game score 
since 1926; one of the most over­
powering attacks ever loosed by a 
Notre Dame team so early in the year; 
those were the by-products of the 
process which ground Haskell under 
by a 73-0 score. 

For Notre Dame the game was the start of a new year, a new team, and possibly a new_ winning streak. No victory chain had the Irish under pressure; their slate was clear. But they went onto. the field against the scrapping, gallant Indians determined .to get off on the right foot and they 
made the grade. 

For Haskell, the game was the con­crete expression of the friendship which Knute Rockne bore for Lone Star Dietz, . Indian · coach. Rockne arranged the game several years back. It was Haskell's chance at the biggest­league in football. They fought with all the spirit and courage that anyone could ask, but no~ smaller team could stop the Irish that day. The strife for berths· on the first team was too

keen; the gridders couldn't slow up, each succeeding group of substitutes wanted to look better than their fellows. 
"Hunk" Anderson used his first team sparingly but· the second, third, and fourth elevens ran on relentlessly. Touchdowns came in showers for the Irish fullbacks. Melinkovich made three, Banas, three, and Red Hagan picked up two. 
It was an attack too· powerful for the Indians. They undoubtedly real­ized that for any team would have to. But they fought on, regardless of the mounting score. Make no mis­take about that. 
Captain Oren Crowe, and .little Bobby Holmes, midget backfield ace, earned lasting places in the ranks of fine opponents who have battled the Fighting Irish on their own sod. They waged a relentless battle against odds that were too much for .them; but their battle was not dimmed by the loss. 
Joe Sheeketski mak­ing the Red Terror, Bob Holmes, of Has• kell, play dead Indian in one of the few op­portunities the Indians had to handle the ball.

• ~..._A football massacre in which 24 
young Indian braves· from Haskell ran the Notre Dame gauntlet and took a 73. to 0 beating marked the 
initial appearance of the 19 3 2 Irish 
squad here Saturday. . A crowd of 'approximately I 0,000 watched the Green tornado, headed by Steve Banas and George Melinko­vich, swirl up and down the turf 
·which on·cc adorned Cartier Field to score II touchdowns and give the Indians a licking they will · never forget. . 
The Notre Dame scoring machine was in high gear from the start. Steve Banas put the !!-cylinder power plant in high just oric minute after the opening kickoff when he slashed his way off left tackle for 54 yards. His 74-yard run for ·a touchdown one minute. before the closing whistle brought scoring activities _to . a halt and climaxed one of the wildest and dullest exhibitions of football ever seen here or anywhere else. 
The contest had all the aspects of a track meet except the equipment which the players wore. Everytouch­down was a foot race with the speedy Irish backs outrunning their light, but fast Indian rivals. Like pacers, 
HEROES OF THE DAY 

• Along about the time the rescue work­
ers arc clearing up the debris after a terrific tornado, it is a rather hard j~b to decide the exact time that the wind blew the hardest. Picking a hero or a pair of heroes in a 73-0 triumph is just as simple. 
However, when any man, in any foot­ball game, averages 19 and a fraction yards every time he carries the ball, scores three touchdowns on runs of ten, and 7 4 yards and a successful catch of a long forward pass, he's a hero. Such a griddcr was Steve Banas against the Indians of Haskell. Steve did all this in less than 15 minutes of actual play. 
People don't make long runs without hav­ing blocking to clear their path. At the head of the phalanx that mowed down Haskell's defenders time and again, was Ray Brancheau, a hard-blocking, fast-run­ning right halfback. Brancheau collected a touchdown for himself, too, but it was disallowed because of an offside offense. 
the green-clad ball toters hit their stride at the line of scrimmage and never broke it until one, two or three Maize and Blue clad players pulled them down to the ground. 

• Hunk Anderson tried his hardest to 
keep the score down by making sub­stitutions on a big time scale. In all he employed 3 7 ball players during the 60 minutes of free style football. The game was instrumental in un­

covering some sophomore material that will be more or less useful before this year's chart is completed. Like their junior and senior brothers, these snippy sophs showed absolutely no respect for Haskell's defense and rambled at will. 
Haskell, its ranks ravaged by polit­ical influence which has inaugurated a program to reduce the school from an institute to a high shqol, w:is just a shadow of its former self. Outweighed 
'on an a veragc of 12 pounds per man, the scrappy but inefficient Indians were as much at sea as a cork in the: St. Joseph river. 
Little Bobby Holmes, 13 5 pounds of muscle and nerve, was the main . offensive cog in the visiting club. Possessor of a ·nifty pair of feet and

BILL WILLIAMS Drake Coach 
The Notre Dame team is the cleanest, best blocking team I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. Never, in my years of football coaching, have I. met a team so thoroughly sportsmen. l cannot emphasize this fact too much, my con­tact with them has been a pleasure I shall not soon for'­get. 

:MILO BOWERS Drake Captain 
The Notre Dame team is by far the best eleven we met this season. This year's team is, in my opinion, jus.t as -good iu ihat . of last year and I am con­vinced as good as the first Notre Dame team I played against two years ago, when they were still under the di­rection of their beloved master Knute Rockne. I have ·played against them three years and each time I learned a lot. They are a clean playing bunch and all fine sporsmen. 
NOTRE DAME 

DRAKE 
• The Drake Bulldogs came to Notre Dame Stadium this fall to wind up their seven-year series with the 
·Irish that Knute Rockne and Ossie Solem originated in 1926.. As in the other six meetings, the Des Moines team was rated on the short end of very long odds. 

Just· at the start of their season under a new coach, Bill \Villiams,. Drake ,was hardly at the top of their game. It is not expected that they would have beaten the Irish even if. they had been at their best, but un­doubtedly the score would have been less. For Drake has had a long habit· of making the going tough for Notre· Dame. · 
In the fall of 1929 when Rockne's National Champions were rolling along to an undefeated season, this Drake aggregation threw a major scare into the Irish by leading them 7 to 6 until the end of the third quarter of the game in Soldiers Field. Notre Dame went on to win by 19 to 6, but th~ fight was very h~rd all the way. 

• This year's game gave ample evi­dence that· the Bulldogs haven't

forgotten how to fight. They battled the over-powerful Irish for sixty min­utes and succumbed under such an avalanche of scoring only because the Notre Dame touchdown machine was in high gear that week and could not be sidetracked. 
In this game the Irish went to the air route for the first time. A long pass from Nick Lukats to Ray Bran­cheau brought a touchdown and early indications of Notre Dame's excel­lent. passing attack that :was to serve the Irish so well later in the fall.

NOTRE DAME 


CARNEGIE 

• The Scots were to give Notre 
Dame their first big test of the season. Critics were withholding judgment on the Notre Dame team till after the Carnegie game. The consensus of opinion was that if the 
Irish could man-handle Coach Steffen's eleven in a manner even approaching the Haskell and Drake victories, they were a great team, headed for brilliant heights. · 
\Vhen the game was over, and Car­negie had been given its worst beating of all time, the band-:-wagon climbing was on. There was· plenty of reason: Notre Dame had shown power and strength in every department.. The Irish had run, passed, plunged, and kicked like a great Notre Dame team. 
The victory cannot be taken too lightly in view of Tech's subsequent showing. Pitt, eastern nominee for the Rose Bowl classic, barely nose~ them out by a single touchdown. 
N. Y. U., favored to win: handily, had only a six point margin. Admit­tedly the Skibos improved considerably after the Notre Dame/game, but even at that stage of the ye1r they were a mighty good .eleven.

stampeding Irish swept over Carnegie.. 
Coach \Valter Steffen called it the 
best blocking any Carnegie team of 
his had ever faced. Considering all 
those excellences, Notre .Dame was 
really at a great height for the en­
counter. 
Carnegie is one of the .most consis­
tently hard-playing of ··Notre Dame 
opponents. In every Irish-Scot clash 
the team from Pittsburgh is a hard­
smashi_ng, never-quitting eleven. To 
find their team-play. still pervaded by 
that spirit despite a soaring Iris~ total 
was one of the most pleasant reactions 
of the game. The Scots were never 
back on their heels, admitting defeat; 
they fought with every resource in 
the repertoire to stave off the on­
slaught. 
It's an historic ser-ies, these Car­
negie-Notre Dame battles. Sprinkled 
liberally over the record of the games 
is a serving of the unusual. In 1926 
came the unforgotten upset of an un;. 
beaten Irish team. In 1928 Carnegie 
broke the unsullied record of Notre 
Dame on Cartier Field in the last 
game that historic field was to 
witness. 
And now, in 1932, a new mark has 
been made: the highest score of the series, and the worst defeat ever ·administered a modern Carnegie team.

Hunk Anderson of Jaskwhich's 66-yard

• Notre Dame, the prc-g~mc head­
lines said, was to be tested by Car­negie Tech today. Notre Dame came through the test by slapping a 42 to 0 licking on the Skibos, by far the worst blistering the Tech has taken since it began playing football. 
The badly bruised and lacerated vis­itors left the field without having en­croached on the scoring area after the first minute of play. On the first scrimmage Kokcn fumbled and Tech recovered on Notre Dame's · 10. yard line. This chance passed with an in­
'complctc pass over the goal line on third down. It was Notre Dame's ball on the 2 0-yard line-arid a· breeze the rest of the way. 
fl It wasn't long after Kokcn fum­
bled that the Skibos wished he 
hadn't done it. Mike was so provoked 
that he immediately went about being 
the star of the spectacle, at least 
statistically. The young man from 
Youngstown led the Irish ground 
gainers with a total of 116 yards, 
including a 5~ yard run for the first 
touchdown. 
Koken's 58 yard dash did not top the long distance stuff, however. This honor went to Jaskwhich, who scored the fourth touchdown by sprinting 66 yards after receiving a punt. The assembled 3 0 , 0 0 0 cheered him roundly. 
N otrc Dame made 2 0 first downs to 4-by Tech; gained 466 yards to 79 for Tech; completed 6 out of 11 forward passes for a total gain of 97 yards. 
• Notre Dame, which lost 115 yards 
on penalties in the Carnegie game last year, was set back only 60 today. No penalties were. called of either team until ncar the end of the first half. 
Carnegie had one accomplishment to lend balm, however. Notre Dame fell three points short of making its total for three games 180 and that total would have sent it into the Pitt game next week boasting a point-a­min u tc record. 

Obviously, Notre Dame showed the same superb blocking that has char-· actcrizcd its work for .years, and at all times displayed power, speed, in­telligence and all the other things of which national champions are made. · Even so,. the boys didn't bear down­~specially, thinking they had a job on

Year's Greatest Upset: Pitt Beats Irish 
BY EDWARD J. NEIL

• The panther, regal jungle ·cat and football team alike, is most dan­
gerous when wounded.  Cor~ered,  it  
bares  its  fangs  for the  last  fight  to  
the death.  

A mighty Notre Dame eleven, hailed the greatest in· the land, found that out for the first time today as the Panthers of Pittsburgh, battered and groggy, lashed out, in a dying fourth quarter effort that stunned the green grenadiers from South Bend, sent them . reeling down to a12 to 0 defeat and chalked on the pages of football his­tory one of the greatest upsets of all 
times. · 
Driven like sheep before the charge of 11 shepherds in bright green, the Panthers reeled through three periods of a struggle that held a mammoth crowd of 65,000 in the huge stadium on Pittsburgh's highest hill breathless with fear .for the home boys. 
Three times, once in each score­less quarter, the Panthers staggered back u~der the drive of a team they say in the mid-west is the best that ever came out of the Indiana univer-· sity where Knute Rockne founded the greatest of modern football dynasties.

HEROES OF THE DAY 

• \Vhen men arc standouts in a losing 
battle, they arc great men indeed. Against Pittsburgh, Mike Koken and Jim Harris were truly great football players.

he  has  been  a  standout  guard  but  it  is  
doubtful  if  the  qualities  that  have  made  

him that were ever in more prominence than against the Panthers. 
Always a fighter, Mike Koken slashed at the powerful Pitt line with everything he had for every minute he was in the game. Twice in the opening Irish drive he slashed inside the tackles for long gains. Opening the second half it was Kokcn, fighting, squirming, battering with all his small frame in every play that paced the Irish down to the Pitt 1 0-yard line, in the historic drive that failed.

against the bitter wind that swept the

"The two things that im· pressed me most in the Kansas­Notre Dame game were the fine· running of the Notre Dame baclts and the excellent blocking of the team as a

GEORGE ATKESON Kansas Captain 
"The Notre Dame team was one of 'the most skilled elevens I ever have had the pleasure of playing against and at the same time one of the cleanest playing.

• Football's entire world was look­ing on. Could the Irish still .lose

Ad Lindsey's Jayhawkers were a better grid club than nine-tenths of the world suspected. They were daring, and skillful, and rugged. Four min­utes after the kickoff they were out in front six to nothing. The team that hadn't been counted on to give the Irish a close battle before the season started was giving them all the com­petition that was wanted. The game was the 28th anniversary to a day of the original Notre Dame­Kans.as .game on old McCook field in Lawrence back in 1904. In that first encounter Kansas had been on a long end of a 24 to 5 decision.

Anderson's Irish ~ent ·after· the revenge in the old-style Notre Dame way: long runs. Lashed to a frenzy by Kansas' early score they went after touchdowns immediately. 

• The victory, while decisive enough, 
saw the Irish offense still wobbling in spots. The question of their ability to recover from defeat was settled satisfactorily, but the fans kept their fingers crossed on the matter of future strength, because the· fact remained 
that Notre Dame had not been impres­sive in their triumph. · It would take another week to· show things up more definitely. 
The game brought Notre Dame back into contact with the Big Six conference for the first time since the discontinuance of the Nebraska series in 1925. Next year another game with Kansas will bring the Jayhawk­ers to Notre Dame Stadium to open the long and rigorous Ir~sh campaign. 
\Vhen ·that game rolls around, it will be more than an ordinary opener if Kansas produces anything like as strong an eleven as the one which kept the Irish on edge at Lawrence with a forward passing attack that was al­ways threatening~ 
Your guess is as good as ours. The photog­rapher says that a Kansas thrust is being piled up by the Irish

• ·No football miracle flashed across 
the blue horizon before the 18,000 spectators in . the Memorial stadium here today, but one was started whose flickering lights, even in the waning moments of a bitterly fought game, shone with a warming splendor on a crew of Kansas Jayhawkers.

HEROES OF THE DAY 

• The comeback trail-is a steep one. Any 
team travelling that path needs leaders. As Notre Dame swung back against Kansas, Norm Greeney and Jack Robinson, gr~a t fighting lineman, filled the requirements. 
Greeney rose to his greatest heights in the second quarter when Kansas cracked through to a first down on the Irish three­yard line. Schaake, Kansas star, was held 
· for no gain. \Veaver lost a yard. Another play was piled up. Then a fumble and the Irish had the ball. In that ·great goal-line stand, Norm Greeney was a defensive demon. · 
Kansas ·boasted a fine passing game. It had brought them an early touchdown and carried them within short strides of another. All through the game the aerials threatened. Into that air battle, Coach Anderson sent Jack Robinson, towering scrapping center. Not only did he-cover the field on passes like a heavy fall of snow, but in the words of Anderson, Jack Robinson made .. five out of six tackles all over the :field in the last quarter." Robinson went to the :first team on that showing.

HEROES OF THE DAY 

· • Notre Dame's fight to comeback was 
still on. Leading the way in the second 
demonstration of recovery were George Me­
linkovich and Ed Kosky. . 
Forty-five thousand persons had barely 
found their seats, the aisles were still jam­
med, when George Melinkovich was off on 
the longest run of the year. Straight down 
the field from his two-yard line, the Utah 
bronco-buster, touchdown-bent raced 98 
yards to score on the opening kickoff. 
\Vhen the Irish finally got under way in the 
last quarter it was the same Mink who 
chalked up the long gains: 3 3, 16, and 7 
yards. 
An end who can do anything in a game, 
and who did practica1ly that much against 
the \Vild~ats is Ed Kosky. The Irish wanted 
a third touchdown badly against the 
Purple. It was Kosky on a beautiful play, 
sparkling with his brilliant timing and ball­
handling that produced the score. He took 
the ball from Koken on an end-around after 
a double spinner, cut into the line, and then 
lateral-passed to Jaskwhich far out in the 
clear for the· score. 
Paced by a brilliant 98-yard return of the opening kickoff for a touch­. down by George Melinkovich, a long­legged, loose-hipped fu1lback, Notre 
Dame turned back its old rival, North-. 
western, with a 21-0 victory here to­
day. About 45,000 sat through 
freezing temperature and a light snow 
which blanketed the stadium. 
It was a curiously effective Notre 
Dame squad which, although · win­
ning decisively, 'failed to satisfy its 
adherents. Blocking, always a decis­
ive factor in the Irish running attack, 
was ineffective today and the flashy 
Notre Dame backs were stopped cold 
at the line of scrimmage by a stub­
born Northwestern line until the final ··period. 
The Notre D~me line was equally stubborn, however. Pug Rentner was stopped cold from the outset and left the game Iate in the second period with a broken rib which probably ended the career of the Northwestern captain who was of all-American calibre last year but a failure this season. 
• .Northwestern checked the vaunted 
Notre Dame running attack by~ dropping the tackles and center a yard back, thus using a 4-3-1-2-1 defense. This · defensive formation was not effective against passes, how­ever, and the Notre Dame team went on to win in a battle of the airways. 
Hunk Anderson's men were sup­remely effective through this medium. They covered the frantic \Vildcat attacks through the ether throughout the -afternoon and then went on to win with a classy exhibition of ~econd story work. The second touchdown was scored by a pass and the way to the third was paved by another aerial. 
Melinkovich's return of the kick­off was football pretty. He caught Augustan's ·kickoff on t~e one-yard line, fumbled it momentarily, re­trieved it and went straight down the middle behind excellent blocking to his 3 0-yard line where his mates had opened· the vital hole into the field. 
He cut toward the sidelines until the ra1lying defense forced him back into the middle. The battle royal of

RIP MILLER Navy Coach 
Notre Dame kept us on the defensive practically through­out our game at Cleveland; largely because of the fine work of its hard-driving backs. I think that under better con­ditions, the score might have been even larger. 

JIM REEDY Navy Captain ·. 
Notre D:irne gave us a real lesson in how the Notre Daine system should be employed. It. was one of the finest exhibi­tions of team work I have seen in my experience. The Notre Dame sportsmanship was up to the usual high standard. 
NOTRE DAME 
-NAVY 

• .Cleveland's first big-_time foot­
ball game, marred by mud and rain; a splendid first half drive by Notre Dame's second team; a desper­ate Navy goal-line defense against the Irish regulars. Those are the high­lights of the Notre Dame-Navy game. 
Taking the game to Cleveland was something of a venture but the pres­ence of 70,000 fans and the knowledge that the bad weather had turned away other thousands, gave full assurance that northern Ohio appreciates color­ful, major football games. 
The game was in the nature of a home-coming for Cleveland boys. James Reedy, Navy captain, was hac~ to his native haunts, Norm Grceney, Joe Sheekctski, Mike Koken, and Jim Harris arc from spots close enough around to merit home-town boy titles. 
Sheekctski went home in amanner de-luxe with both Irish touchdowns to his credit. The others all showed their mudcak~d forms in action during the game.

year ago, when Miller was still instal­
ling the system, the Irish won by a 
20-0 score against a stubborn team 
that fought off other Irish scores 
throughout the game. 

This fall a similar defensive exhibi­
tion featured the Navy play. In the _waning minutes of the game they threw back thrust after thrust at their line with the ball almost on the 
goal line. · 

Ther·e was nothing· lost in the game 
from the old tradition· of the Notre 
Dame-series with the service schools: 
the underdogs were surprisingly strong 
that day and the favorites had plenty 
of -\vork in getting out in front. That 
has always been the way of things in 
the Irish rivalry with the service 
schools. 

The conditions of the day and the 
field were almost impossible. Despite 
the protection of a tarpaulin hauled 
from Notre _Dame to cover the field, 
the rain, and the churning of a high 
school game a few nights before, had 
left the gridiron a morass in. :which the 
two elevens were bogged. 

Joe Sheeketski, the hero of this game with both touchdowns to his credit, is shown on one of the eight trips he made with the ball for an average gain of 
4.4 yards.

New York TIMES) 
In the sloppy going of Cleveland Sta­di urn, Joe Sheeketski showed his home­towners an afternoon of Notre Dame half­backing done right. Two touchdowns on_ a run and a pass went into the books under his name; the only two· touchdowns Notre Dame secured. Defensively he was the 

same smart, hard-tackling secondary man he had been all year, rising possibly to even greater heights. 
Emmett Murphy's generalship was sup­erb . against ·the Middies. He guided his team down the muddy field with faultless precision early in the game only to lose the ball on a fumble. Picking the~ up. with 
an offensive rush he drove them straight back for a series· of long gains and a· touch­down. \'V"hen another drive was slowing down, he called a pass and Notre Dame scored again.

Notre Dame won clearly and de­cisively, rolling up the amazing total of twenty first downs and more than doubling the yardage gained by the midshipmen But it couldn't over­come the Navy pluck and a fighting defense which repulsed the Rambl~rs all through a second half played al­most without exception .in Navy's territory. 
Twice in the final period Notre Dame was held within inches of the. Navy goal line, and at the end a for­ward PU;SS from the Navy 16-yard line was grounded as the final horn blew. 
There have been few settings as 
wintry as that for today's game. 
The rain of the past twenty-four 
hours relented, but there came no dry­

down low · over the field, which had 
been transformed into a black quag­mire by the rain except where sawdust had been sprinkled to funiish a foot­ing for the players. 
In the back of the open section of the stands, behind the east goal post, the waters of the lake broke high over the breakwater like the wind­whipped ocean surf on a sandbar, and the players fought all through the afternoon in this cold, muddy setting. Under the circumstances, they turned in a brilliant exhibition of football.

The 1932 Notre Dame foot­ball team was well up to the high standards set by its pre­decessors. Perfect team work, in my opinion, was the out­standing factor o£ this great squad.

• A comeback drive, bursting with 
its own momentum, reached its 
height. Notre Dame, playing as few 
football teams have ever played, ap­
proached perfection on practically 
every play. 

Strangely enough, before the game Notre Dame was the popular choice -,-to lose. At Pittsburgh the Irish had been long-shot favorites to win and lost. In New York they were expected to lose and they struck with a fury that denied such a result. 
The reasons· for Anpy's being the· popular choice were very apparent. They had lost .to Pitt by a single touchdown, 18-12, . and they had scored against the Panther line that stopped the Irish cold. The Cadets had gone on to swamp Yale and Har­vard, the latter 46-0 with the Crimson considered one of the best teams of the fall in New England. 
·They had Pick Vidal and Johnny Buckler and Ken Fields at Army. And Evans and Kilday, the pair who' made almost every tackle . against Notre Dame last year.. 
The Irish, on the other hand, had wobbled along. through their victories without looking the least impressive­so the gallery said. In the week before the game, an epidemic of mild flu

cases hit the Irish squad. The public at large scoffed at the sickness as publicity ·material, but the fact re­mains that the players reported sick were really sick. 
• Harris, zyielinkovich, Murphy, 
V airo, and · a few more spent several days in bed. It couldn't have helped their playing strength any. Certainly on paper the Army figured to win handily. 
There was ~n old ~'tradition for Notre Dame to preserve that day, however, which off-set a lot of first class pre-game figuring: The Army had never beaten the Irish two years in a row. \Vith last season's surprise victory under the belt, their chance for turning the trick looked big. But Notre Dame holds pretty tightly to tradition. 
The biggest crowd of the season jammed into Yankee Stadium to watch an unbelievable offensive roll back the fighting, i~spired defensive stands of a really great cadet team headed by Milton Summerfelt, ·a superb guard. 
Unquestionably the most thrilling, most colorful of all Notre Dame games, the Army game continued this year to be a swirling panorama of color. 
Steve Banas spun out o£ this embarrassing situation for a four yard gain. Later he passed to Devore for a touchdown and punted out o£ bounds on Army's one-yard line to set up another score.

HEROES OF THE DAY. 

• Heroes on a day of heroes! Two rough, BY · tough, juniors, playing the game of their lives battered their share of the Army for­GRANTLAND RICE wards back on their heels every play. Ed Krause and Hughie Devore! 
Reckless courage guided by consummate skill made Krause more than a sensation. He was never out of a play. On every Army punt his towering body was flung desperately in on the kicker, rushing every punt. Offensively he rooted the Army 

guards completely out of play after play. The spark that made him great a year ago, blazed brightest in Yankee Stadium this year. He was Pick Vidal's shadow. 
Broken hand or not, Hughie Devore was offensively and defensively at his best . 
.. Fields loses five; Fields loses five more." Devore was doing th.e tackling. ..Notre Dame scores again"-Banas to Devore, far out in the clear. Then in the final quarter he stifled Army's attempts to fight back by intercepting a pass and recovering a fumble. 
• The Army today might just as 
well have tried to roll back 
Niagara Falls with a bucket and a 
sieve. 
In the presence of more than 80,000 spectators, a green tidal wave struck the Cadet platoon and left it com­pletely overwhel11.1ed. Even Notre Dame's wide margin of 21 to 0, the result of three touchdowns, doesn't quite· tell the complete story of South Bend superiority as the western in­vaders muffed two forward ·passes over the Arniy goal line that might. have almost doubled the score. · 
If Notre Dame's big, fast, smashing team was infected with the 'flu this should be the most popula~ disease ever known to the huri1an race. For 
this 'flu-infected horde in shining green looked about as weak and ill as a jungle full of lions, tigers, gorillas and king cobras. . 
They came on with a rush and a 
swirl of speed, power, weight and spirit that not only annihilated every Army attack but in turn hammered and battered the Army defense back and forth across the field all afternoon. 
• The greatest football crowd of 
the year, more than 80,000 spec­
tators who paid out close to ·$360,­
000, sat in a cold,. raw November 
~ind and saw more speed and power 
thrown together than any team has 
shown all year~ This Notre Dame 
team, beaten by Pittsburgh's Panthers, 
was out for Army blood today.· 
It proved this in almost the first 
move when every man in green struck 
with a rush and a crash that meant 
war to the hilt. 
The four horsemen of the past­Stuhldreher, Miller, Layden . and Crowley-had given way to the 4,000 horsepower of Melinkovich, Banas, Lukats, Koken, Brancheau and others, working back of a fast, giant line that ·provided open boulevards on play after 
play. · 
This Notre 'Dame throughout was 
barrel-chested, big-legged, powerful 
and fast with deception as well as 
speed. It ran up 17 first downs to 
the Army's three and the lone Army 
first down on. a running play came 
from the swift feet of Pick Vidal, 
who ran 31 yards at his first shot.

And lifts tbe Trojan glory to the

-HoMER. 

• Thus wrote the old Homer about · a victory at the old Troy. 
"Southern· California 13, Notre Dame 0." That is the writing of a new Homer. And the victory is that of a new Troy; It was not an aged, blind, wandering bard who carved out the newest pinnacle of Trojan glory. Rather it was a whirling, racing, gridiron dervish, 19 0 pounds of skilled, speedy youth, Homer Grif­
. fith, Howard Jones' great quarterback. Following the formula of his most famous namesake, Griffith guided the undefeated U. S. C. eleven through the air and over the land· to its nine­teenth consecutive victory. And ~he victory was no less glorious than any of the other eighte<:n. "Hunk" Anderson looked at the game's result as a victory "for the better team." His Irish, so he said, were out-played. \X'hen defeat comes that way, there is no need for explana­tion, much need for tribute to the superior machine. Following the peculiar rites of their cult, the ~etting public had made the

Irish the favorites. · The "why" of 
·that choice is hard to discover. At their peak for the Army game, two weeks previous, there was little reason to expect Notre Dame to stay at its bes~-form for the U.S. C. clash. That they were below that form is in no way an attempt to dim the glory of Troy, once again •'lifted to the skies." It is merely a. statement of an evident and an expected fact.. 
Two days befor·e the game, Ander­son picked the Trojans to win by 13 to 0. Coming from the man closest to the Irish situation, the prophecy bore much weight. In the light of the ultimate result, it was a startling forecast. But all in all, it was a common sense outlook by a sound gridiron expert who realized that the greatest heights are reached only once. And nothing short of the greatest perfection could stop the Trojans. 
As the Trojans outscored the Irish, they smashed an eight year tradition of the Notre Dame crew. Not since Nebraska's Cornhuskers turned back Notre Dame in 1922 and. 1923 has a team defeated the Irish. twice in as many years. Notre Dame had been the perfect football team to prevent Army from turning the trick; their sub-perfection could not withstand·the Trojans. 
Steve Banas, escorted 
by Emmett .Murphy, is making one of those frequent gains which netted the Irish more yards from scrimmage than the Trojans, but alas, not a victory.

MARK KELLY 
Host and all-American Joe Kurth, Notre (Reprinted from the Dame's right end and right tackle. Los Angeles EXAMINER) 
Facing the great team of the year, Host and Kurth threw into the fierce Irish defen­sive stand all the strength and skill that has 

marked their play for three seasons. They were two paramount reasons that the famed 
U. S. C. running game could make but a scant hu~dred yards. _ 
That these fighting leaders of the Fight­ing Irish had to close their careers in a losing game ·was unfortunate. But the. fact that they gave their. great best in a losing cause is probably as great a tribute as could be gleaned from any of the many victories 
they have helped to win. 
·II A great Notre Dame football team 
went down to defeat before a 
great. Trojan eleven yesterday, 13 
to 0. 
In one of the big upsets of the 
season, the sons of Troy came through 
in amazing fashion to beat this rug­
ged, powerful gang from South Bend, 
Ind., and to play faultless, flawless 
fotball against a team that made two 
bobbles and lost thereby. 
A long run by \Vfarburton in the 
second quarter put the Trojans into 
their first scori~g position and on 
fourth down, Griffith passed to Mc­
Neish for 31 yards and a touchdown. 
Nary an Irishman put a hand on Mc­
Neish as he took the pass on the two-· 
yard line and scooted across the Irish 
goal while 101,000 spectators yell~d. 
• The second touchdown came in the 
third period when in handling a quick kick -Koken fumbled the ball momentarily and it was recovered by Erskine for Troy. That was on the 26-yard line and in seven plays Grif­fith plunged over the left side of Notre Dame's line for the second touch~ down of the afternoon. 
Notre Dame became a scoring threat twice during the.game and each time late. Turning loose Melinkovich to receive, Koken and Lukats to throw passes, the combinations worked the ball down once to the Trojan seven­yard line only to have the Trojan de­fense stiffen and a fourth down pass drop incomplete behind the Trojan's goal. Two other long passes again put t4c Irish in scoring position, only to have the ball ag·a~n lost on an inter­ception by Griffith on the Trojan nine­yard line. 
Now the yardage figures tell rather a weird story-much like the Califor­nia-Trojan game wherein the Bears gained most of the first downs but the Trojans came up with the touch­downs. Notre Dame made twelve first downs, six from passes. Troy made four, none from passes if you count the touchdown pass not a first down. 
• But drop over ·to the kicking 
figures and there pick up the real story. It shows how Griffith and \Vfarburton punted and quick-kicked the Irish into hole after hole· to halt hard marches and to nullify every Irish advantage. Strangely, too, it was the quick kick that the Irish had been drilled to expect and block. 
.In kicking the Trojans came up with 13 kicks for an average of 45 yards as against 13 kicks for Notre Darrie with an ·average of 34 yards. In the return of the kicks Notre Dame gained but five yards all day as against

An Appreciation 
• \'{Tc find ourselves again without 
words adequate to express our thanks for the fine aid the Review has received from all sides in compiling this book, editing, printing, and get­ting it ready for distribution in ex­actly a week after the close of the season at Los Angeles. 
You need be no editor nor printer yourself to .realize the tremendous amount of detail which goes into a book of this kind, tremendous at least in view of the short space of time available in preparing for publication. 
It takes cooperation, real whole­hearted, self-sacrificing cooperation to fill such a large order-and, as in the past,-the Review received it from e_very side. Busy men, national figures, took time from their work to get their gratis contributions in for deadline. Campus writers, busy with their studies, writings for other publications, and extra-curricular activities, came through for the. dear old 0. F. R. just as if they were getting paid for efforts, or as if something more than 
the small fame we have to offer were hanging over their heads. 
There has been increasing praise streaming into the office of the Notre Dame Scbolastic all fall. The book has improved by leaps and bounds under Editor Edmund Stephan and his capable staff. That means only one thing-1 0 percent inspiration ·and 90 percent perspiration for the editor and·· his'staff. Yet Editor Stephan had time to do his excellent survey of student spmt, Managing Editor James S. Kearns took time to write the interhall story for the Review, as well as the entire section covering the nine Notre Dame games, and other features, and Feature Writer Bill Flynn wrote re­serve football and many sketches of the players. Sports Editor Leslie Rad­ditz wro.te ably• of the. men behind Notre Dame during the past season. Jack ·McElligott took time from his managerial and Scbolastic duties to handle his own inside story of the managerial_ staff. \o/e thank Walter Kennedy for his thoroughgoing story on freshman football and the «leg man" work connected with gathering t4is material. Eddie Moriarity made his difficult and exacting compilation of the statistics for the season-and had them on our desk Monday after 
· the Southern California game. 
---~-_..---~........ 
· Father Charles O'Donnell, president of the University; Jesse C. Harper, director of athletics; Coach «Hunk" Anderson, and Capt. Paul Host all willingly took time immediately after the Trojan game, iri the bustle of after-game activity, to prepare the. 
·statements they have written into the frorlt of the book. 
James E. Armstrong, alumni sccre­ary, whose duties arc manifold enough easily to keep ten men busy, forgot his delinquent dues long enough to explain the alumni reaction to the Pittsburgh defeat. Prof. Charles Phil­lips, nationally known author and lecturer, showed his usual bqyish enthusiasm when we asked him for a· contribution-despite the pile of stu­dent papers, the mass of quarterly gi·ades, unread proofs of his new book on Paderewski, and many other de­tails of his high-ranking position in the Notre Dame English department. 
To Edward Brennan, a life-saver last year and this, our thanks for his able handling of short sketches on the players, written in conjunction with the afore-mentioned Bill Flynn. 
To Art Becvar, Juggler art editor, our congratulations on and thanks for his excellent cover design and sketches sp~ttcrcd through the book. 
• Perhaps we are out of . order in 
thanking these campus and South Bend figures first for their contribu-_ tions, although at least a half dozen of them belong to the nation as much as to the University. Our failing is known in the athletic world as «stall­ing for time," or, more accurately in our case, stalling for words to express our appreciation to the many nation­ally known writers and artists who made time in their busy lives to help 
us beat· the deadline. 

Ted Busing, boundi.ng from coast to. coast to bring you his «simultan­eous journalistic" reports of the nation's outstanding games, gave pause in his rush to tell just how Notre D~me saved college football broad­casting for (this is) The Columbia Broadcasting System, and for others of the radio world. . 
George Trevor, the New York Sun's brilliant football writer, mailed us his resume of the Army game with the attached note: «This was written with the Football Review in ~i~d." 
\o/arren Brown, sports editor of the Chicago Herald and Examiner, shut off his radio to write a scathing denunci­ation of ·football broadcasting. \'{!'c earnestly hope Mr. Busing and Mr. 

· Brown never get together! .Or, for that matter, Pat Flanagan, ace sports broadcaster for \o/.B.B.M., Chicago, who explains in vivid details the pains the announcer and his staff go to,. so that you and you and you may have an accurate acount of every game. 
• Arch \'{!'ard, an intrinsic and inti­
mate member of the far-flung Notre Dame family, and sports editor of the Chicago Tribune, delayed prep­arations for a business and pleasure trip to Los Angeles long enough to explain that rules have not and can not beat his alma rnat~r. 
Bert McGrane, colorful Des Moines Register and North American News­paper Alliance explained for the Re­view, in the midst of his writing and officiating duties, how the coach­baiters fume,· forgive, and forget all in the twinkling of an eye-lash. 
Lawrence Perry, New York Situ. and Consolidated Press Association feature writer, discusses ·exclusively in the Review, the phenomenon of Notre Dame's tremendous drawing power. 
Fcg Murray of Consolidated· Fea­tures and \Verner Laufer of the News­paper Enterprise Association (N.E.A.) both took precious hours out of their daily routine to make exclusive draw­ings for the Review. Fontaine .Fox, beloved creator of Toonerville Folks, and Fred Neher of Life gave willing permission to the Review to reprint cartoons of theirs bearing .on Notre Dame. Cleveland's Mid-\Veel{ Review graciously allowed us to usc for our frontispiece its recent cover, a com­posite picture made by superimposing action pictures of Notre Dame foot­
ball stars one upon the other. 
Christy \o/alsh, intimate of the late Knute Rockne, waded through a thou­sand-and-one details at his New York office, preparatory to a three month's stay on the. Pacific Coast, writing his excellent piece for us just ·west of Chicago in a club car. ·

ers kindly gave the Review permission (Coutiuucd 011 j1agc 109)

Could he restrain the sports writers from enthusing· over the huge scores piled up in the first three ga!-'Des? 
Could the sports writers be . blamed for enthusing? Did they know that Haskell, Drake and Carnegie were not the rugged trial horses of old? 
If the Notre Dame coach was opti­mistic, had he not cause to be? His team had crushed its first three op­ponents under a total of 177 points. His men had missed only two assign­ments. Did he know that his perfect blockers and tacklers would fail him at Pittsburgh? 
• Is 'it a simple task to inspire a 
confident team which has smoth­
ered its . first adversaries? Did the 
Pittsburgh-Ohio State tie ·serve as 
much of a warning to Notre Dame? 
Did the Notre Dame coach stick 
doggedly to his starting lineup or to 
any certain combinations before or 
after Pittsburgh hurled that fourth 
quarter thunderbolt? \Vas he not 
striving for the winning punch in 
every position? Did he not employ 
every resource at his command? 
They didn't have the old Notre Dame spark. No. Not at Pitts­burgh. But, how about the Army game? The same coach was in charge. 
I thought Notre Dame was too 
chesty before the game at Pittsburgh 
and the game itself upholds this belief. 
I think overconfidence lost the ball 
game but was the Notre Dame coach 
entirely to blame? Remember all 
those newspaper stories about a point­
a-minute tearri, greatest of all Notre 
Dame teams, etc.? 1v1aybe the Notre 
Dame coach couldn't keep his' players 
from thinking they were as good 
as the papers said. 
I can't help but recall a day late ·in the fall of 1926. Army and Navy 
were playing in Chicago. Another 
Notre Dame coach was a spectator at 
that Army-Navy game while his team 
was playing Pittsburgh. That 1926 
Notre Dame team met a stunning 
jolt, 19-0, from Carnegie Tech. 
.So what? Oh, I just wonder if Notre Dame might not have lost to Pittsburgh regardless of the identity of its coach. I wonder if the Na­tional Association of Volunteer Foot­ball Coaches could have .produced the super-psychologist who might have keyed the Irish to. meet a heavyweight champion when onfy a lightweight. 
A HIKE TO THE RIGHT"... ! 
(ColltimiCll from page 51) 

• I may be wrong about the point 
of lowered attendance. I'm not so sure that anyone can place his fingers on all the causes. Look at Notre Dame. Through the br~adcasting of over four Notre Dame games a year over networks employing, as we do at Columbia, some 75 outlets for each broadcast, people are naturally de­sirous of seeing the team they hear and read about when the Irish visit New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and other cities. This holds true with other teams whichhave increased their national popularity through the broadcasting of their games. 
Many of them can, in my radio­minded way of seeing things, benefit by the three men high in the press box, combining to say ..They hike to the right"-and mean gate· receipts, acceptance by the public,. national championship rating, and publicity that reacts both in the box office and in the registration of future students. And, believe you me, Columbia will continue to do as Notre Dame does, ..Hike to the right games with the Irish."

Then there was an episode concern­ing a game in which Ohio State participated this year, in which Cramer was hurt, very early in the 
game, and carried off the field. 
A broadcaster went blithely along, throughout the afternoon, reporting that Cramer did this. Cramer did that, and Cramer did ·everything~spec­ially the kicking. 
After all, the radio broadcaster's paradise is' not any other place but California. 
Out there, any and all moments of confusion can always .be covered up by a· fifteen or twenty minute dis­cussion of the weather, though I know a fresh guy from Chicago, who was invited to help broadcast a ball game in Los Angeles, during the spring training season, and announced that he wouldn't use up any time telling about the sky-l~ne because he couldn't see it on account of the low hung clouds. 
However, such persons are not regu­lar visitors to broadcasting booths. Maybe it's just as well.

(Couliuued from page 89) blocking was still going on as men got up and were knocked down again. At the Northwestern 3 5-yard line the Notre Dame blockers had mopped up all but two men. They converged upon Mclinkovich who drifted through their snatching fingers and again cut back toward the sidelines. The rest of the distance was a race

was a team full of flame and fire, out 
to prove its place. 
Leading, 7 to 0, as. the third period 
started, Notre Dame's second touch­
down was even more. spectacular. A 
rush·of . Green \Vave first downs had 
carried the ball back to Army's 29.:.. 
yard line, well over by the sidelines. It 
was fourth down when Banas drop­
ped back to the 40-yard line, danced 
back and forth for a second or two, 
and then threw a long 45-yard pass 
that sailed well beyond the Army 
goal line into the waiting arms of 
Devore, a brilliant Notre Dame end. 
The Army defense was so com­
pletely fooled that two South Bend 
mates were standing at Devore's side. 
The debacle was now complete. Once 
more the Green tidal wave, still hit­
ting ~ith deception, speed and power, 
got under way. . 
A great kick by Banas planted the 
ball on Army's two-yard line. Fields 
dropped back of his goal to kick but 
a low pass eluded his hands, fell away 
and Harris, a Notre Dame guard, 
dived upon the ball for the third 
touchdown as Murphy again kicked 
goal. 
Later on in the third period; Notre 
·Dame passes sailed across the Army goal line into the· open arms of Bran­cheau and Vairo for two more t.ouch­downs, but in: each. case the ball bounded out ·to cut away two more touchdowns that only mechanical er­rors threw away. 
The Army put every ounce of fight it carried into this contest, but the Army was cqmpletely out-classed by a better football team, the greatest show of speed and force I have seen all year. 
.The great cr~wd~ filling every nook and cranny of the big Yankee stadium, with thousands turned away, saw the tide of battle start from the west at the first jump. Just after the Army had kicked off to Lukats and Banas. 
They came ori with a spin and a whirl that meant business. They fought for every foot. Time and again these big fast Notre Dame backs were tackled, only to carry on for another two or three yards before they finally· hit the green turf. 
• .. The Army· had no physical power 
to meet this wild charge of a team out to prove its place as one of the

greatest of the year. Notre Dame had something more than swiftness of foot and violence in assault. It had deception thrown in with an attack that was well drilled and well executed. 
Only a fighting Army defense· led by Capt. Summerfelt, who was all over the field, staved off two early touchdowns that seemed certain after western attacks that ripped and rushed along the ground · 
It was not until the South Bend team took to the air that a badly baffied Army team finally gave way. The startled crowd, expecting to see a flock of hospital recruits, struggling to stand up, suddenly looked upon more physical power than it had seen in years. 
The flock of invalids out of a South Bend hospital were knocking down and running over the same Army stars who gaye Pitt a scare and who ran over Yale and Harvard. Here was the chance for some testimonial turn­
. ing a hospital into. a set of athletes that could have cleared up a Malay jungle in 20 minutes. 
• The «flu"-stricken Melinkovich 
ran with the speed of a deer and the force of an African. buffalo. He was about as easy to stop as a tractor spinning at 60 miles an hour. He must have made more than .50. yards after he was tackled .. 
And he had able help. from the rest of his crew, Koken. and Banas, Bran­cheau and Sheek~tski, Lukats, Mur­phy arid Jaskwhich. Here was the team of all nations hurled against a line headed by.Kurth and Krause, two hard charging giants that ~ould open _a hole through granite. . 
·Capt. Summerfelt of the Army was­on top of the job all afternoon. He was tackling all over the field, but he had a hopeless job. His team was too badly overwhelmed. It was beaten back by too much man power, much more than the Army· could face. 
Notre Dame had come a long, long way since the Pittsburgh game. It _was· a different team this afternoon, a team that will give Southern Calif­ornia all it can handle. It provided the show today for 80,000 spectators who saw at last what a tidal wave can dC? when it finally gets under way.

(Contitmccl from page 87) were stopped and the ball taken away on downs. Again later this \Vas re­peated. Defensively Kansas was show­ing its mettle and if those rapier thrusts of the ·South Bend eleven, flashing beneath this friendly Novem­
ber sun, later counted with dazzling speed there was no· dismay felt about them. 
For Kansas followers had entered this stadium expecting a debacle. They were looking for the worst. Attracted only by the reputation of the Ram­blers, lured on by the name of. Notre Dame, they came, but among their expectation wasn't one of witnessing an actual tussle. 
And so the surprise was the more intense and the rriore lasting. They saw not Notre Dame but Kansas 

, spring first to the attack. That score board from which hung the numeral «6" beneath the name of Kansas had to be looked at twice before the spec­tators could be sure of their eyes . 
II The satisfaction of being in front 
wasn't long-lived, but it was there just the same ·and the crowd may have been reminding itself that only the University of Pittsburgh this season has succeeded in crossing the Rambler goal line. 
A few minutes later came that run by Lukats and then in the second quarter Sheeketski sprinted sixty yards for the second touchdown. In the third· period Melinkovich broke loose on one of those baffling drives, this time for seventy yards, for the third, and in the fourth quarter a march which contained long tackle . smashes by Sheeketski and Melinkovich sent the ball down to the Kansas 3-yard line from where 'Koken, on a wide end sprint, went .over. 
But these last two scores might not have developed had not a Kansas chal­lenge been foiled in the third quarter. 

· Down to the 3-yard line storm'ed the Jayhawkers but it was there on two plays the Rambler line held and on the next the ball bounced from the ~rms of Schaake and was recovered by Captain Host. 
It was following a bobble by Lukats, the ball being scooped up by the blond \'Veaver on the Notre Dame 3 6-yard line that Kansas began this threat which became more and more ominous. 
As in the first quarter, it was a pass 
99 

which sent . the Ramblers reeling. Smith hurled that ball to Schaake and the latter reached and clung to it with a desperation which could not have gone unnoticed by the spec~ators. 
Thirty yards were made up on the toss and the run, with Schaake being forced out of bounds on the 15-yard stripe by Jaskwhich, who overtook him from behind. 
In three line plunge~ . Schaake then cracked that Rambler line for a first down on the 3-yard marker. Three yards and another touchdown and the score at the time: Notre Dame 12, Kansas 6. 
• \X'hen Schaake drove through those 
blue-shirted forwards for that first 

down the Kansas bench jumped up 
and down like an angry sea. Substitutes 
were flinging sweaters in the air. Hats 
were sailing. The barid was trying to 
sneak in a note or two through a 
blanket of noise which swelled until 
it 'became deafening. . 
Three yards and four plays in which 

to take that ball across! 
The ball went back to Schaake and he hurled himself at the. line. Eager hands wer~ there to ·drag him down. He gave the ball on the next play to \'Veaver and the latter, too light for that sort; of work, lost a yard. Another ineffectual try and then came the fumble. 
Notre Dame "had staved off the score and Jaskwhich was quick to punt out of danger to the Notre Dame 47-yard line and immediately the Kan­sans, resorting to the. air again, ram­bled down the gridiron. Smith tossed another of his long passes, this time to \X'eaver and the latter was only stopped at the 22-yard line, but a second attempt to pass was disastrous. Notre Dame ends dogged Smith ··all about the field and finally he threw in desperation and threw . badly. Another pass was knocked. down and · Notre Dame recovered the ball on its 3 0-yard line. 
It was then lVIelinkovich raced the seventy yards for the third Notre ·: Dame touchdown and thereafter in the game Karisas was not to threaten. But it did all it could to check the score of the Ramblers. 
And yet the· crowd was still hark­ing back to the manner in which the Jayhawkers started this game. Steve Banas had kicked off to Smith and the latter returned the ball to his 3 0­yard line. (Continued 011 page 102) 

ALL-OPPONENT TEAM 
(Co~tiilluecl from page 69) so Northwestern could make scoring attempts. It was not Olson's fault 
they did not materialize or that Notre Dame pressed · back each time into \Vildcat territory. \X'hen Rentner went out of the game with a broken rib, the bulk of the ball-carrying fell to Olson and Jakie Sullivan, right halfback~ His forward passing left little to be desired-unless it was a receiver capable of pulling in his fast, low, accurate tosses. 
• Kilday of Army received several 
votes at this position, although his passing was rushed, he had little time to get his punts off, and his line didn't 
. support him on line bucks. His fumble in the end zone was responsible for a Notre Dame touchdown, but this lapse was not held against him­the blame went to the Army forwards for crumpling before Notre Dame's fast charging line. Olson took prac­tically all the votes at this position, with the rest going . to Kilday. 
There were several outstanding quarterbacks among Notre Dame's opponents, but Homer Griffith of Southern California was the only one who accomplished much in a Notre Dame game-and this team is picked strictly on a player's showing in the Notre Dame game, not on his season's record. 
The generalship of Felix Vidal of Army was questioned when he had run 35 yards to the Notre Dame 40 yard line and then called for three passes, instead of trying, at least orice, the play on which he made Army's longest· gain. He took the ball seven other times for a net gain of two yards. Bobby Hogan of Pittsburgh played but a few miutes of that game against the Irish, getting off a 75 yard punt from behind his own goal line, and running the team perfectly, but the fact that he didn't play more of the game, going in fresh· for only a few plays, kept him off of the Re­view selections. Griffith, Vidal, Ho­gan and Elmer Schooke of Kansas, who sc,ored on a pass, were the only 
· four players to receive votes at thi~ . position. 
Griffith's generalship, .ball-carrying, blocking, and pass defense work were all points. iti his favor. He proved himself capable of shoulde.ring . the 
-burden lifted ,froni the injured neck of ·Orv Mohler; 'even to the point of inspmng the Trojans as the diminu­tive former Soutl1ern California star had done last year and early this season. 
• No halfback averaged more than 
four yards a trip against Notre Dame's fine defense, Mike Sebastian of Pitt being the only one to conic close. His average· was brought up when he dashed 48 yards for a touchdown, but this feat was somewhat discounted in the minds of our .. experts" by the fact that \X'arren Heller, acting cap­tain, did most of the ball-lugging that day and, by his very frequency of attempts, threw the Notre Dame de­fense off guard to pave the way for Sebastian's run. 
Heller's fine work throughout the game gave him the nomination as the outstanding halfback· Notre Dame faced all season. 'George Kavel, Car­negie Tech co-captain, received the· bid at the other halfback for his rugged never-say-die spirit. Had he been playing behind the blocking he got in subsequent games, he might have made it interesting for .the Irish. He was smothered time and again for short gains; but showed a more per­sistent spirit than any other back the Irish faced all yaer. 
Jakie Sullivan of Northwestern, Cal Clemens and \X'harburton of South­ern California, Ken Fields of Army, Chung-Hoon of Navy, Sebastian of Pittsburgh, Bob Holmes of Haskell, Carnie Smith of J(ansas, and Wieland of Drake all received votes. This is interesting in one respect. It shows what the players think themselves of the stars who are publicized more greatly than the linemen. The players· and coaches can give a true estimate of a player's worth aside from press notices because they know of men on their own team who are ·getting credit for things they are not doing, and others whose brows never feel the ca­re~s of the laurel twig, as typified in printer's ink, but who are deserving of praise.

OFFICIAL FOOTBALL R E V I E W 
~t may be that I'm talking out of turn in this effort to reduce the Rockne system to its lea~t common denominator. But inasmuch as you are going to see the system doubly demonstrated when the Ramblers en­gage Uncle Sam's Midshipmen in the stadium Saturday, it seems to me not although amiss that you should be given at least a faint idea of what to look for where the famed Rockne sys­tem is concerned 
• Even though it has been deprived 
of the master touch of Knute 
Rockne, the Notre Dame eleven re­
mains the leading exponent of his 
particular systm. ..Hunk" Anderson 
assisted Knute long enough to become 
thoroughly acquainted with his meth­
ods, and is carrying on the Rockne 
tradtions as capably as could be ex­
pected. There arc those who say that 
the two defeats the Ramblers suffered 
last season and the more recent set­
back at the 'hands of Pitt would never 
have been forthcoming had Rockne 
lived. That, of course, must remain 
a moot question. . 

In fairness to Anderson, however, it must be recognized that new-addi­tions to the code of rules governing football have probably had something to do with curbing the amazing suc­cess of Notre Dame teams during the late years of Rockne's tenure. The full second .of hesitati~n between a shift and the pass from center inter­fered with the original Rockne doctrine of having his team so nearly in motion when a play started that a stop-watch could scarcely catch the· pause. And now the new limits on the use of the· hands · prevent the Rambler linemen from keeping their rivals constantly off balance. 
\Vithal Notre Pame has done· fairly well since the departure of its master, despite reverses at the hands of Army, 
Southern California and Pitt. Anderson is certainly not content with basking in the reflected glory of Rockne and you can bank on it, that when the season closes the Ramblers will be ranked wit~ the great elevens o~ the year! 
Incidentally this game marks the last appearance in the collegiate ranks of the handful of players who have had -any direct contact with Knute Rockne. Rockne's voice is still speak­ing faintly but distinctly. After t}1is year there will remain only a garbled echo.

1932 EDITION 
N.D., 12; NAYY,·o 
(Co11timtcd from jJagc 91) after each the attempt for the extra point from placement failed because of the wet ball. After a march by the men from South Bend had carried almost seventy yards in th_e first period, .with almost nothing used but straight hammering at the guards and centre from reverses and spinners, and. had ended with the recovery of Banas's. fumble by Dornin on the Navy ·26­yard line, Notre Dame had to wait for the second period for its first score. Th~ opening touchdown came fairly early in the period after an exchange of kicks had given the Ramblers the ball on their own 44-yard line. From there they marched without inter-· ruption to the first score. In this march one forward pass played a very important part. . It carne with the· ball on Navy's 35-yard_line and was from Lukats to Murphy, corning out of a fake spin­ner. The receiver was just inside the left wing back of Navy and the total gain on the play was almost twenty­five yards, with a first down resulting ?n the Navy ll-yard line. 
• From there, on the next play, Joe 
Sheeketski, starting from a deep formation, ran on a sweep around his left end behind one of Notre Dame's menacing waves of interference. At just the right moment he changed direction, cut in through tackle, and crossed the line st.anding up. without a Navy hand touching him. 
A fine punt by Nick Lukats paved the way for the second Notre Dame score. It came with the ball near his own 40-yard line and the Navy re­ceiver was afraid to touch it as· it 
· bounced througli the black ooze of the gridiron. The Notre Dame ends had no such fears and both of them landed on the ball on Navy's 3-yard line. Clark· punted out game~y and well to the Navy 44-yardline, but the Ramblers came back from there. . 
Jim Leonard had gone in to replace Steve Banas and he started the march by ·slanting off his right tackle for almost ten yards He ha.d luck· with him. \Vhen he was finally tackled, the ball popped like a rifle bullet from his hands, but went outside .. before any one touched it, so· it still·belonged . to Notre Dame. 
B Starting from there, and with leonard and Luka ts doing the lion's share of the carrying, the South 
Benders punched their way to a first down on the Navy 9-yard line. On the next play Emmett Murphy, who was running the Notre Dame team, called for a pass. 
Navy had been covering passes pretty· well, but this time Sheeketski sneaked over into the right hand corner of the field all alone and the 
·pass came to him clean and free. He made the catch on about the 4-yard line, turned and popped over into the side of the end zone all alone for the touchdown.·. Murphy missed the first try for the extra piont and Lukats tried this time with no better success. 
That was the story of the .scoring and it was largely the story of the game, for Navy, try as it would, could not work itself into a scoring position all through the play. Chung­Hoon, the fleet Hawaiian halfback, went in at the start of the second half along with other fresh Navy backs, but the mire gripped him around the ankles and he was never able to get started. 
Instead, Chung-Hoon tried passes 'fom all sorts of desperate spots, in­cluding his own end zone, with lit­tle success Notre Dame sent in its entire first-string line, which had been held out of the first half, and Melinkovich and Brancheau as the second half started, almost an entire new team. And this new team was 
able to keep play right at Navy's door­sill through the remainder of the game, but never was able to cross that final strip of whitewash which meant another score. 
Even under 'the circumstances, the Notre Dame team was impressive to­day. The backs handled themselves with the poise that former Notre Dame backs h:ive had.· \Vhen they de:­cided to cut in, they slammed in with a lightning burst of speed that gave them extra yardage and they accom­plished what they did through the second half almost entirely without 

_the aid of a forward pass. The forward lines, both of them, performed well for Notre Dame and there is not the slightest doubt that Army is facing the hardest assignment it has had this season with next week's. game. Notre Dame is a brilliant foot­ball team-one· that had the ability and cl1e courag~ ·to rise even above the handicap of today.'s weather. Navy played most of the game on the defensive. On a dry ·field the middies might have shown a bit more. 
Faced by insurmountable odds, the Navy left deeply impressed on the minds of this middle western crowd an impression of· high courage and fight. 
• Campbell ·was especi_ally great at 
secondary defense and Harbold, playing almost the entire game at centre, stood up under the main pres­sure of the Notre Dame attack. The goal line stands of the losers in the final quarter will be vivid for a long while in football's history. 
The first period was fairly even, 

with the exception ~f Notre Dame's 
great march halfway through it and 
which the excusable fumble, by Banas, 
of a wet ball stopped. Play stayed for 
that entire period betw~en the 20-yard 
lines and Navy was on a par with the 
victors at its close. 
Then carne the second~period rush 

of the green-shirted men from Notre 
Dame with their winning points. Just 
once in this period Navy penetrated 
Rambler territory, a pass from Clark, 
which was intercepted by Sheeketski, 
ending this advance. The rest of the 
time was spent in Navy's half of the 
field. 
Navy had a job getting out of its own territory at the start of the third period after receiving the kickoff, but a quick kick by Borries and a 15-yard penalty against Notre Dame accom­plished this, for a . while. Chung­Hoon had gone in and Navy was throwing passes from all over the. field. At the close of the period .the middies had crossed midfield on that penalty which had been inflicted for roughness in tackling Chung-Hoon, but the march petered out before the period's cl6se. . 
Chung-Hoon dropped back to pass and half the Notre Dame line rushed him. One of the green shirts butted the ball in his hand and it dribbled four feet forward to where Harris gathered it in for Notre Dame on its 
own 46-yard line. From that point on 
the South Bend men were constantly 
on the offensive. 
Ari offside penalty against Navy helped, and then Kokeri cut back through his left guard for a first down on Navy's 32-yard line. Koken and Brancheau, on three plays, made it first down at the 17-yard line and Melinkovich picked up 3 more yards before the period closed. 
Borries saved the situation. for a (Co111im1Cd 011 page 108)

The tab.;. ulation got its start when Vcjar re­ceived a punt and returned it 18 yards to Notre Dame's 42-yard line. After the ball had been carried out of bounds Koken went through his right tackle, reversed the field, and pranced 58 yards to the goal line, no pursuers getting within gunshot. Kokcri added the point from placement. · 
SECOND TO.UCHDOWN -The second team couldn't get another touchdown in the first quarter,· but got thi~gs. in shape for early delivery in the second quarter. The ·second counter, like the first, was placed under way after V cjar had received a punt. Kokcn then tossed a pass ·to Rascher, the heave and run being good for a gain of 3 1 yards. A pass, Sheeketski to Vcjar," added six yards as the quarter ended. At the start of. the second period Kokcn .went over right tackle for first down on Car­negie's 13 yard line. Koken made 
four, then a plunge by Kokcn. and a lateral failed. It was Notre Dame's ball on the nine yard line, on the left side of. the :field: 
• V cjar took the ball, ran wide past 
the center of the field while five rceiv~rs fanned out to points of van­tage. Sheckctski had stationed himself to the right and about five yards in front of the goal posts. Joe was un­
. covered and it was an elemental task to toss to him for the touch.down. Koken added the point from place­mcnt. 
THIRD TOUCHDO\'V'"N-Aftcr its second touchdown, Notre Dame sent in its entire first team, and when the quarter was nine minutes old the first stringers had accomplished touch-. down No. 3. After receiving the ball on a punt, Lukats, Melinkovich and Brancheau started a parade, with Me­linkovich and Lukats contributing spurts of 9 and 15 yards, respectively. On fourth down ~ith two yards to go, Lukats made it first down on Car­negie's six-yard line; Brancheau made four, Melinkovich stumbled for the loss of a yard. Lukats carried the ball to the one-inch line. Then Mclinko­vich plunged over center for ·the touchdow:n. Jaskwhich added the 
point. 

FOURTH TOUCHDO\'V'"N-This one. came after eleven minutes in the second quarter. Mihm punted to Jaskwhich, who ran 66 yards to a touchdown. The Irish blocking was so efficacious that no challenge was 
given the wily Notre Dame first string quarter in his long sprint. Jaskwhich added the point. 
FIFTH TOUCHDOWN -Five 
minutes after the second half got under way Notre Dame registered No. 5. " Krause recovered .a i fumble on · Car­negie's 45-yard line. Then a march started, featured .by a 27-yard run around left end by Melinkovich. The touchdown was produced . by Bran-

SIXTH TOUCHDO\'V'"N-Penal­tics caused some delay in the sixth touchdown, despite the · thrilling as­pects of a pass, Lukats to Vcjar, which. was good for 21 yards and another, Lukats. to Melinkovich, which netted 2 5 yards. As the third quartcr neared the end, Lukats passed to Host for a gain of 21 yards. Lukats carried the ball· to Carnegie's seven yard line as

(Contiuucd from j1age 95) 77 for Troy. That tells some part· of the story, does it not? The -Trojans made t;heir breaks through superior line charging. Both were good stout lines, but the individual work of Smith, Brown and Rosenberg was out­standing over that of any Notre Dame lineman, while Youel at center came up with the best game of the year. Sparling and Palmer, the Trojan ends, were superlative in getting down under the kicks of their backs and here, too, was a tremendously telling advantage. 
• .Toward the clos~ of the game there 
was a lot of bitter feeling shown and one Trojan and one Irish player were ejected for the good of all hands. 
Notre Dame had the better of the passing with seven completions out of 17,. while Troy. completed but one out of eight, but that one was the touchdown pass that sailed down the field to be caught on the dead run by McNeish, with nobody ncar him, and a ·Notre Dame secondary caught by surprise in the precision ·of the play's execution. 
·The Irish came primed to win this one and even up for last year's defeat. They worked hard, gave all they had, but were quick to admit that they had· bumped into one of the toughest ball clubs they have· ever met. The Irish players were unanimous in de­claring that the Trojans will have 
·. little trouble defeating· Pittsburgh in their last hurdle toward an undisputed national ch:_~mpionship rating on Jan­uary 2. · Incidentally this was the nineteenth straight victory for the

Jones-coached Trojans and ends their season undefeated, with the Pitt game figuring on the next year's record~ 
• Koken and Lukats led in, indi­
vidual ground gaining with Melin­kovich of Notre Dame outlegging and outspeeding the Trojan pass defense to haul down pass after pass and prove himself the good back that experts had him rated throughout the season. Koken at times pulled away from his interference and backed up, yet got away with it because of his drive. plus the fact that the Trojans were not charging the passer as they had done in other games of the season. They preferred to ,use their man· power in covering receivers. 
Coach Anderson, true to promise, started his secondary backfield and throughout the first quarter the teams battled each other on even terms, neither being able to gain from their running plays and the Trojans pick­ing up a 3 0-yard advantage after the fourth exchange of punts. 
• Into the fray came the first string 
backs as the second · period got under way and they started a· con­certed march from their 20-yard line down into Trojan territory only to be halted on the Trojans' 39-yar.d line. · On fourth down Jaskwhich punted to \Varburton and the little, cotton-topped quarter streaked down with a 39 return to the Irish 34-yard line. Then he cut over the center of the Irish line for· another 15 yards and the Trojans were a scoring threat. In three plays Griffith wound up tos-. sed for a loss ·as he faded back to pass only to find the receivers blanketed. and himself chased for a 7-yard loss. On fourth down from his 31-yard line Griffith passed to McNeish-the 
· same pass that gave Troy a touch­down 3 years ago when Duffield used it to Apsit. It went because the Notre Dame secondary and even the safety man allowed MeNeish to get between them and the. goal line and take a perfect pass over his shoulder for the 
first score. . 
The half ended about 3 minutes later. 
• Back came the Irish with their 
first string backfield to get ~hat touchdown back in the third period. The quarter had just. got under way when a quick kick by Griffith was partially blocked by Kurth. h zipped past the line flying low and down to the Irish 26-yard line where Erskine fell on it for the 'Trojans. He took the ball away from three Notre Dame men, diving with his 215 pounds right through them to snatch the oval and hold it while the pile was unscrambled. 
Bright tried a pass to Griffith and the latter made a one-handed stab only to have the ball get away as Griffith raced over the sideline stripe. 
Sparling, on his old rever.se play, gained 8 yards. Griffith, using ·a spinner, smacked the right side of the Irish line for a first down on the Notre Dame I 0-yard line. Clark hit center for three. He tried the same spot for' three more. Griffith then shook off· two tacklers to plow to the one-yard line. On the next play and 'fourth down Griffith went over center for the touchdown. Sinith missed goal. 
The Irish took the kickoff, failed to gain and were on the spot when the return punt from Griffith was downed by Sparling on the Irish one­yard line. From this hole, the Irish kicked back to their 3 3 -yard line. The Trojans went to the air, had three passes knocked down and gave posses­sion to the Iris~ on the Irish 20, a Griffith punt going over the goal line. 

Up and down the field the play see­sawed with the Trojans trying a 40­yard field goal that was far short, with Ernie Smith making the attempt. The Irish then started their open passing and complet'ed two in quick succession to bring the ball down to Trojan territory. Another pass from Vejar to Sheeketski gave Notre Dame a first down on the Trojan five-yard line. S~eeketski tried a wide end run only to · bump into Curt Youel who tossed ·· him for a six-yard loss. 'Vejar's pass,

• It was on again the next time the 
Irish came into possession. A long pass from Lukats to Mellnkovich was

successful and gave the Irish a first I down on the Trojans' 13-yard line for a net gain of 24 yards. On fourth down V ejar ran wide and heaved ·a pass deep into the end zone ·that was ruled incomplete after Sheeketski had bobbled it, bounced it up and down and another Notre Dame man caught it.

Another quick kick from \'\Tar­burton caught the safety man too ! close in arid· the ball rolled down deep into the Irish territory,_ ·about the 22­yard line and with the closing seconds of the game on them the Irish could not overcome ·this break and were passing desperately as the final gun barked, ending of one of the best and toughest ball games ·of the 19 3 2 season with both teams at the point of utter exhaustion. 
It was the largest football crowd of the season and it was treated to sixty minutes of real thrills by the two best football teams in the country.

Kurth, strangely enough, is one of the three players among the first 22 on the Irish squad· who did not cap­tain his high school team. More strangely still, he receved the deciding votes from Harry Newman and Ted

Isadore \V/einstock, a burly fullback,

spinner for 15 to the raider 45-yard

Then Sebastian, a substitute from

of the ailing captain, Paul Reider, 
raced for Notre Dame's end. 
One ·halfback. blocked out Paul Host, raider end ~nd captain. Sebas­tian sped for the far sideline. .Quickly he cut back, stepping daintily out of the arms of three headlong tacklers, and his battered mates had time to get in front of them. \V/ith fiendish pre­cision, they cut down the Notre Dame secondary and Sebastian dashed across ·the goal without a hand having been 
laid upon hin:. 
It was an amazing shock to Notre 
Dame and the great throng as well 
but there was more to come, swifter, 
almost than· it takes to tell. 
Passing desperately, as soon as he 
got his hands on the next kickoff, Al 
McGuff, a substitute halfback, hurled 
his second effort straight into the· arms 
of Ted Dailey, one of Pitt's two 
mighty end~. · 
Dailey took the ball on a dead run 
as he came up from Notre Dame's 25­
yard line, and in a flash was over the 
goal. 
Both attempts at the extra point 
were blocked. 
Perhaps the strangest picture of all 
was the sight then of a Notre Dame 
team, its assurance and cohesion abso­
lutely ·destroyed, passing wildly like a 
bunch of high school kids in a demor­
alized effort to come back. · But the 
Panthers, exhausted, picking each 
other up laboriously after each play, 
had enough left to stop that kind of 
play and remain in Notre Dame terri­
tory until the final whistle. 
Never before has a Notre Dame 
team of modern history been scored 
upon twice in one minute. Nothing 
like it has happened to the green raid­
ers since Southern California, last fall, 
caught Notre Dame in the 'last period 
and came from behind to overcome a 
two-touchdown lead and win out~ 16 
to 14. 
\'V'ith laterals and line drives work­ing neatly, but for small gains, Notre Dame drove 3 8 yards to Pitt's 25­yard line in the first quarter; marched and passed 50 to the Panther 18 in the second quarter; drove 40 yards to within eight of the goal in the third; and was pressing again after a 40-yard inarch in the fourth when the light­ning struck. 
Almost at the start of the fourth period, Pittsburgh was in a hole that seemed bottomless. Trying to punt; after another desperate · stand, Bob Hogan was driven back to his one­foot line. But he tried again, and through the arms of the raging Notre Dame forwards, he sailed a punt 70 yards in the high, cold wind to the Notre Dame 33-yard line. 
Notre Dame, through its early power, had a wide edge in first downs, counting 16 to Pitt's six. Notre Dame gained 173 yards from scrimmage, 
.Pitt 164. Notre Dame completed 10 out of 29 forward passes for 85 yards of gain, while Pitt tried only three and completed none.

The shock-troopers reappeared and continued firing with almost as much effect as the regulars.

It is interesting to note that Melin­kovich and Banas, bbth fullbacks, were the leading ground gainers, de­spite the fact that their average often times suffered when they were called upon to step . the ball out of bounds.

' (Continued from page 79) speed galore, this diminutive ball car­rier was a constant threat and several times broke away for gains of :five yards or better. He carried the ball on four out of five plays and never gave up, . despite ·the fact that the Anderson steam roller kept piling on a handic"ap which swelled to gigantic proportions before the end of the third quarter has been reached. 
• Capt. Oren Crowe and Harley 
Pierce were the only regulars in the Haskell lineup to go the route. Both were strong on defense and whenever an Irish ball carrier failed to get away 
·for a long jaunt it was generally Pierce or Crowe who obstructed his path. 
Steve Banas and George Melinko­vich, the two leading contenders for a first string fullback job on the 19 3 2 Notre Dame team, staged a duel of their own during the contest, each crossing the Haskell goal line three times. Between them they accounted. for six of the 11 touchdowns regis­tered by Notre Dame. 
However, Banas gets the palm for individual brillian~y. He was in ·the game for less than 15 minutes and . carried the ball but seven times, yet he averaged 19 5-7 .yards on each oc­casion. His two runs of 54 and 74 yards were the outstanding cogs in the Irish attack. · 
Banas scored the opening touchdown on a nine-yard run around left end which followed his 54-yard dash. He also registered the second Notre Dame counter when he snatched a 20 yard pass from Mike Koken and breezed 
__..--over the last chalk line yards ahead of ----------~ the nearest Haskell player. Then Me­linkovich took over the fullback job. 
• Just three plays were run off be­
fore the Tooele, Utah, speedster marked up his first touchdown. \Vith the ball on Haskell's :five-yard line, about two yards in from the east side­line, Mclinkovich took the . ball and 
instead of going.out of bounds plunged headlong into a background of gold. jersies to dent the goal line. No less than :five Indian players w·ere hanging onto the big fullback as he crashed

banged through guard for 2 3 yards and a touchdown. Then Al McGuff, a recruit with lots of class, drifted out behind the Haskell secondary and tucked in a 26-yard pass from Mur­phy for another six pointer. Melin­kovich smashed through right tackle for six· yards and another touchdown and then retired to the sidelines in favor of Lowell .Hagen, a fullback from Monroe City, Mo., with the drive of a tractor and the speed of an antelope. 
This recruit showed contempt for his predecessors and in two plunges from the Haskell 11-yard line he hung up 12 points to bring the total 
· number of touchdowns scored by Notre Dame fullbacks to eight. 
• Neither Brancheau or Sheeketski, the first two right halfbacks, could 
"' score, although the officials. did take a six pointer away from Brancheau because of an offside penalty. How~ ever, John (Red) Tobin, a rough, tough Irishman from Janesville, \Vis., saw to it that the right halfbacks were not forgotten by dashing 16 yards around end for the 1Oth touchdown of the day. Banas' 74-yard run off left tackle concluded scoring activities for the day. 
The only time during the game that Haskell .threatened was in the second period when it recovered a fumble by Chuck Jaskwhich on Notre Dame's 40-yard line and advanced the ball 14 yards on five plays.· 
• Statistics show that Notre Dame 
gained 67 3 yards from scrimmage while the best Haskell could do was 50 yards. This is a near record for ground gaining in the present era of collegiate football. The Irish scored 23 first downs to Haskell's three and averaged better than a point-a-minute in the scoring column.

time at the start of the final period 
when he intercepted Koken's pass and 
gave Navy the ball on the 13-yard 
line. Instead of kicking, however, 
Navy chose to gamble on shaking a 
man loose with a pass. One was in­
complete and the next, made on third 
down, with Chung-Hoon passing from 
his end zone, was intercepted by Rob­
inson on thl;! midshipmen's 33-yard 
line. 

From there, with Melinkovich and Koken carrying most of the time, Notre Dame marched steadily to a first down inside the 5-yard mark, but it · couldn't score. Koken \vas stopped · by Borries, Melinkovich was stopped with a short gain in a sweep· at left 
·tackle, and the ball changed hands on 
downs when the same player was 
halted at his right guard; 
• Chung-Hoon kicked out to the 
33-yard line and back came the 
Green wave of power, the same two 
players doing most of the carrying on 
tackle slants and j~bs at the guards, 
this time making a first down at the 
6-yard mark. Here, Leonard went in 
for Mclinkovich, but even the fresh 
player was unable_ to ·make enough 
ground through that Navy line. 
Leonard went as far as the 2!h-yard 
line, and on the final try, Slack and 
Campbell smothered Koken at his 
right tackle to take the ball a foot or 
so away from a score. 
Jim Bentley was rushed in to kick for Chung-Hoon and his high effort carried the ball to the 3 6-yard line. Sheeke~ski and Koken brought it back to the 27, with Brooks spilling one play for a loss, and as the end of the game drew near, Koken dropped back for a last pass, a flat one to the left, which struck the ground. untouched and was covered as a Navy player fell on it with the final horn of the umpire ending the game.

(Continued from j1age 104) 
could be no holding Notre Dame from 
ultimate victory, no matter how long 
Pitt's desperately fighting line held 
off assaults that grew in intensity 
through each quarter. 
Running brilliantly, Koken, chief . ball carrier in the second string array 
that started in ·the backfield in place 
of the regulars, twice·. ripped inside 
the Pitt tackles in the opening drive 
that bogged down 23 yards from the 
Pitt goal. 
In this as every other Notre Dame drive, the Irish could not shake off Dailey and Joe Skladany, probably as fine a pair of ends as any Irish eleven ever faced. Time and again, as the limber-hipped K<?ken, Brancheau, Me-­linkovich and the driving Banas headed for the clear, one or the other of these ends, sometimes with the aid of \Veinstock, Panther fullback, nipped in just in time to get the ball carrier from behind and spoil what otherwise might have been more of Notre Dame's famed "perfect" scoring plays. ~ 
Anderson replaced his second string backs, Vejar, Koken, Sheeketski, Banas, through the second quarter, putting Lukats and Jaskwhich and Melinko­vich into the backfield in the second quarter and he started Leonard at full­back in the second half. 
But try as he would, Anderson could figure no combination capable of evading Pitt's grand ends, or mus­tering a line that could push the Pan­thers aside down around the 20-yard mark as easily as they did in midfield.
