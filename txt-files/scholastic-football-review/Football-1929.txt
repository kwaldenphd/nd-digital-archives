To The Metnory of Rupart Mills . '15 
Rupe, who was · a four spo~ts letterman at Notre Dame, went to his death July 21, 1929, in·a vain attempt to save a friend from drowning. 
That he was a true son of Our Lady was shown not only in his heroic death, but in every act of his campus and later life. 
May the memory of Rupe Mills be a vivid example for Notre Dame men ·of the future to follow.

VY congratulations to one of the finest 
c.JCJb Notre Da11ze tea11zs of all ti11te and to the splendid coaching staff headed by To11z Lieb, that carried on so -u;ell and effectively in 1ny absence. In fact, I believe that Lieb, Chev.igny and Voedisch did the co{lching while I just helped .a little._ 
· Every 11te11tber of the tea11z lived up to the finest traditions ofour great school and .. I have every reason to feel proud ·of their sea-son's 1vork. · · · 
The student 1nanagers, the band; the so­called Scrub~ and Fresh.inen also did yoe11tan service and 1vere a vital part in the suc~e~s­ful season. ·

CAPT. JOHN B. LAW, NOTRE DAME, 1929 
. LfS.captain of the Notre Da.~ne footballU ~ tea1n of 1929, 17'!ay I say _that I have . . never played against 1nore. capable and 1nore sports1nanlike tea1ns than have been 1ny pleasure to compete with this year. 
In spite of the rather obvious disadvant­ages to be sur1nounted this y~ar, I feel th.at I have, in 1ny o~v1z s1nall way justified the position given 1ne, made possible, however, only by the 1ne11~bers of the tea11~ ~vhose loyalty and dauntless fighting spirit never once slac!?..ened. 
To the faculty and studf!nt body I can only say that it 1'vas their spiritual-support and splendid co-:operation that 1nade this seaio1~'s clean slate possible.

16 OFFICIAL FOOTBALL REVIEW-1929 I' 

KNUTE K. ROCKNE 
Head Coach 

Courage and thoroughness evident in his every action are the two qualities that have gone to make Knute Rockne the peerless ~ootball coach. 
The former trait was more conspicuous this year, perhaps, than ever before. After l~sing four games in 1928, Coach Rockne came back and risked his very reputation on the hardest schedule ever lined up for a modern day fo<?tball eleven. The way in which he stuck by his team while in excrutiating pain this Fall, and the respect the players themselves have for him, also point to this quality in Coach Rockne. ·He pleaded with his physicians to let him go to the six games he missed during his illness and it was harder for him to stay at home than it would have been to go. Suffering torments that very few out­side of his direct associates appreciated, he attended practices in his car to lead his men on, to be a fitting example for them. 
The way the 1929 team conducted itself in the Navy, Georgia Tech, \Vis­consin, Drake, Northwestern and Army games speaks louder than mere words of the thoroughness of Rockne's teaching methods. He told them what to do in every situation, and they won with the power that comes from knowledge.
0 

His record of success speaks for itself. His men fight for him because they know that he is battling for them; they battle successfully because he has taught them how to fight scientifically. 
THOMASLIEB 
Ass't. Coach 

ccA man can afford· to be sick with a helper like Tom Lieb around." 
And never did Coach-Rockne speak a truer word. To~ ret~rned to his· alma mater just at the right time and the fruits of his work were evident in every game that Notre Dame played during the past season. 
He had .been at· Wisconsin when a powerful Crimson line forced the ·breaks that beat Notre Dame in 1928; this year it was his line that beat Wisconsin. He took charge of the team in six of its nine games, and six times he brought his men home victorious. At practice he was all over the field at once, now with the line, now with the backs, now at a scrimmage, always complete master of the situation. 
His dressing room . talks were almost on a level with those of Rockne .him­self. Inspiring talks they were, that made the players go out to the :fight ready to do or die for Our Lady and for their disabled Rockne. 
It was a lucky day for Notre Dame when Tom Lieb decided to come back into the fold. 




THOMAS A. MILLS 
Ass't. Coach 

A man of many parts is Tommy Mills. His comprehensive knowledge of football and his keen eye make him one of the best scouts in the game, and the information he brought. home from his expeditions was directly responsible for a large share of Notre Dame's great 1929 defense. · 
His ability t.o teach intrica.te plays to reserves and Freshman teams stamps him as a great instructor of the sport. His understanding of the Rockne system, his love of boys, and his genial make-up make him the ideal coach. The players respect his word and at the same time. take him on as a real pal. 
Notre Dame and ~ockne never had a better friend and helper than Tommy.. 
JOHN CHEVIGNY 
Ass'!. Coach 
When the entire 1928 backfield of Brady, Niemiec, Collins, and Chevigny finished play­ing for Notre Dame last year~ Jack Chevigny decided that it·was up to him to do something about the situation. 
So he stayed around this Fall and whipped into shape one of the greatest backfield com­binations Notre Dame has ever had. Frank Carideo, Jack Elder, Larry Mullins, and Marty Brill will all tell you how much of their success they owe to the t~aching of this 1928 s~ar. 
During Coach Rockne's illness, uchev" was indispensable. He drilled the backs just as Rockne would have drilled them, and he co-operated with Tom Lieb at games as none . other could. Playe.rs who' saw him wear himself to the point of exhaustion time and a.gain during the 1928 season respected his wishes and gave him discipline and attention that was remarkable for one who was one of them a .few months previous. 
JOHN CCIKE" VOEDISCH 
Ass'!. Coach 

Avery, very quiet, but very, very efficient young man is John ulke'·' Voedisch, who does most of his work with the ends on the s.quad. 
One of the b~st ends ever to play at Notre Dame, ulke" knows enough of the finesse of the flankman's job to develop a really outstanding set of ends this year. He was quick to master the new shift that Rockne gave to the wingmen this year and the exact manner in which he taught it to his pupils aided very materially in the deceptiveness ·of the 1929 team's attack. · · 
He always had six or eight men ready to step into any game at any time and hold their own against the most powerful open running attacks of Notre Dame's nine powerful opponents. · Not only this, but he had men who could go in and catch passes when they were needed. 
E~ds ha.vc· aiways "been vital factors of Notre Dame teams and under Voedisch they have gained rather than lost in importance.

The Players 
CAPT. JOHN LAW 
Right Guard 

In John Brendan Law, the tradition of fast, scrappy, really great guards, the tradition of Anderson, and the two uClipper" Smiths found a noble perpetuation. Not as big as most guards, Law made up for his lack of size by his speed, his fight and his cleverness. There is no department of guard play in which the compact N cw Yorker is not a master. To his perfect physical co-ordination he added a degree of brain-power which even coaches do not look tor in their guards, much less the general public, with whom the idea of the udumb guard" still prevails. It is incn like Law, few as they are, who are slowly dispelling this notion that the guards are the dullest men on the team. It is not an ex;­aggeration to say that Johnny Law's mind is as keen and fine as that of any quarter-back in the country. 
As captain of one of the greatest of Notre Da~c's great teams, he served well as both a leader and an inspiration. The very sight of him outplaying men anywhere from 10 to 50 pounds heavier throughout the entire season was more than enough to inspire the men he led. 
\Vords cannot be .framed to describe him as a leader; his qualities of leader.., ship arc too obvious. H~ will go down in football history as one of Notre Dame's greatest captains. 
·' 

JOHN. CANNON. · All-American 
Left Guard 

Figuring prominently in every play, offensively and defensively, Jack was chosen unanimously for All~American honors by leading sports writers. Play­ing continuously without a headgear, he was an outstanding figure and a most important member of the forward wall. Cannon, Capt. Law, and Moynihan formed a. pivot trio in the line that was unsurpassed by any team in 'the country. 
On defense, Jack showed unusual.'ability to gauge plays and was continu­ally next to the opposing ball carrier on the bottom of the pile. There is hardly a game which can be called his best; he was steady and consistent throughout the entire season, his third on the varsity team. 
Jack Cannon's personality, courage and football ability will live long in the memories of Notre Dame football enthusiasts and followers. He will be re­membered in years to come as a sterling guard and one of the second Rockne edition of Seven Mules. · 
FRANK CARIDEO All-American 
Qziarter-Bacl?.. 

One hears of ideal quarter-backs, but rarely comes across one. Always there is something lacking, but in Frank Carideo the ideal is approached just about as closely as possible.· 
A quarter-back's job is to direct his team-to use his head; his next most im­portant work is to block. In these two departments of the game, Carideo knows no superior and few equals. But where most quarter-backs leave .off here, he just begins, for, besides his directing and blocking ability, this chunky lad has the faculty of punting, passing, running, and kicking extra points after touchdown along with the best in the country. 
Surely it is a long time since any field general has been able to do all of these things and do them well. Carideo's handling of punts is a thing to watch in wonder, and his clear, confident voice is an urge to victory-a call to battle. His cool calmness never deserts him and the driving lash of his voice is never ruffled. 
Little wonder it is, then, that he was the unanimous choice of the .A:ll-American pickers this fall, and the most talked-of football general m the country. He's a great man, this Frank Carideo of Notre Dame. 



TED TWOMEY ·· Left Tackle 

In every school and on every team there are men who are known as "tough" -not in the grosser sense of the word, but in connotation which we of Notre Dame have given to it, namely, that they have infinite coura-ge and can give plenty while taking as much. 
This is what we mean when we say that Ted Twomey is the toughest of the tough. For this giant, so genial off the playing field, is truly a figure to be feared when in action. Not at all flashy or sensational; spectators cannot un­derstand why it is that many who know call ~1im great. Nor can they under­stand why, along about the end of the first quarter, tl;te opposing team is not hammering very much at Ted's side of the line. 
Only those who have played against him or seen him perform at close range can appreciate his ability. His forearm ••shiver" is about as gentle as a caress with a steel beam, and the fierce smash of his tackle is like the charge of an enraged bull. 
\'V'hen tackles who have held a larger place in the public's eye have long been forgotten, Ted Twomey will still be remembered with awe and respect by those who know his real ability. He was prominent on the All-Ap1erican selections due to his consistent play this year. 
JOHN ELDER 
Left Half 

. \Vhen Jack Elder is a bit older, he will be able to look back upon his collegi­ate career as one of the greatest any undergraduate ever had. Reminiscing, he will see tha.t he was the co-holder· of two world records in track, one of the greatest sprinters of all time. 
But the greatest thing he will see, and will be able to call his own, is the fact that he made himself a football player by sheer hard work. Although endowed with worlds of speed, ..The Rabbit" was not a natural football player. He found difficulty in cutting in an open field, and could not block or pass. 
Jack worked at these things, however, and worked hard where another man might have given up and rested on his track laurels. The fruit of his labor was reaped this year when, unstopped by any of Notre Dame's nine powerful foes, he stamped himself as a real football player and one of the finest all-around backs of the season. 
He takes his place with the few great sprinters who rose above mediocrity when they donne,d cleats instead of spikes. 
LAWRENCE MULLINS 
Full-B~ck 

One of the greatest and most versatile a.thletes ever to attend Notre Dame, .. Moon" was·a vital member of the ..New Four Horsemen" backfield of Rockne's this fall. 
uRock" had needed a full-oack in the middle of the '28 season and he had turned to Larry, who was then pla.ying half-back. That this rangy, speedy Californian delivered as a plunger: is a fact known. to all gridiron followers. 
Time and again he knifed through opponents' lines for substantial gains, and, once past -the line of scrimmage, it was a marvel to see him revert to type and become a half-back again, dodging, twisting, side-stepping, and stiff-arming. He was undoubtedly the best blocking full-back on the squad, he was an out­standing pass receiver, and an unequalled defensive back. 
To his many physical qualifications he added as keen a mind and as fine a football intellect ·as ever graced the classic bodies of Notre Da.me's other "greatest of the great." 



MARTIN BRILL 
Right Half 

..Marty" is the type of back coaches dream of and pray for, but are lucky enough to get only about once in a generation-the type that is steady rather than brilliant, firm rather than flashy, the kind that does the work and lets the glory go to his rna tes. 
Despite his work-horse duties at right half, Brill's play was so flashy at times as to draw comment even from the uninitiate.-Big, strong, rugged, he made an ideal man for the Rockne system which calls for a right half that can block. 
Possibly lacking in the finesse of Chevigny and Herndon, he made up in sheer strength and determination what he was missing in the fine points of his position, and so took his place with these two Notre Dame immortals. 
His greatest stock in trade was, of course, his blocking, but his backing up of the line, his pass receiving, and his ball-carrying-especially against Navy­went to make him a great all-around back. He came here from Penn State because he ..wasn't getting a break there," and showed the world what he could do. 
Next ye-ar he'll show them some more. 

RICHARD DONOGHUE 
Right Tackle 

One of he flashiest Freshman players at Notre Dame in the days of Christy Flanagan, but handicapped by injuries last year, Dick came to the front this season and distinguished himself as. one of the most reliable men on the squad. 
He has the size, weight, coolness, good judgment, aggressiveness, and football sense that go to make the ideal tackle. ·He knows how to use his hands on de­fense and has the faculty of breaking through an opponent's line to smear the strongest power plays directed at him. 
Dick played in every game this fall and never made a wrong move at any stage of the season. In the thick of every battle, his ruggedness is shown by the fact that he went through the season uninjured by any of Notre Dame's nine powerful opponents. 




TIM MOYNIHAN 
Center 

\'\fe could formulate no greater tribute to the prowess of "Big Tim" than that made by \'\falter Eckersall, nationally known foot­ball authority, in the Chicago Tri~uue the day after the big center broke his ankle against Northwestern. Eckersall says: "It was a costly victory, however~ as Tim Moynihan, one of the best centers in the country, suffered a broken bone in his right ankle. This in­jury is bound to handicap the Rockne eleven for the struggle with Army in New York. 
"Moynihan's passes always were accurate. He was ever mindful to make sure of his passes before crashing through to take off . the secondary defense. He frequently was down the field under punts and was ·a good tackler. He knew when to play his position in the line and when to pull out to help break up forward passes." 
His reckless custom of starting behind his own line and hurd­ling over the scrimmage pile to· nab the ball-carrier for a loss is what cost Tim a chance to play in the Army game. It was on one of these air excursions that he snapped the bone in his right ankle and thus ended his Notre Dame career. 
In his three years with the varsity, Tim met some of the best centers in the country, but he bowed to none. ..Rock" will have to look a long time to find another like this scrapping Irishman from Chicago. 
JOHN COLRICK 
Left Eud 

John Colrick is not a new name in Notre Dame sport annals. Johnnie is · one of the ablest and most versatile athletes that ever represented the Irish. In 
addition to his football letters, he won three monograms in basketball and 
three in baseball, and served as captain of the diamond club last year. 
At the left wing of Coach Rockne's forward wall, Colrick was dependable at all times on defense and was one of the best pass receivers on the squad. His work during the past season was the equal of or better than his two preceding years at end. John gave good account of himself in every game, catching passes that brought the crowd to its feet, and stopping every play in his territory. 
While apparently easy-going and almost indifferent, he was in reality the hardest type of worker. He leaves behind him a most enviable record as a Notre Dame athlete. 



TOM CONLEY 
Right End 

In this quiet, reliable Philadelphian, the tradition of Boland, Maxwell, and McNally found another worthy wearer of the Blue and Gold. A player of un­questioned ability when he first came to Notre Dame, he did not rest on the laurels he had gathered in his sophomore year when he achieved that distinction, rare indeed among sophomores, of making his letter in football. R~ther he continued to work and study the position he played, until he now bids fair to · be one of the most finished ends in the country next year. 
As it was, his playing this year toward the close of the season stamped him as one of the best in the Middle \Vest. Tenacity~ courage, and persistence are but a few of his q~alities. Frustration or defeat serves rather to spur him on than discourage him, as was demonstrated in the Southern California game when a pass labeled ...touchdown'' slipped off his reaching fingers. But 'he came back to catch two even more difficult tosses, one of them resulting in Notre Dame's first score. 
Most ends are a bit one-sided inasmuch as they are specialists in some one· or 


two departments of end-play while their work in other departments is only mediocre. \Vith Conley, however, such is not the case; he is possibly the finest all-around end that the squad boasted this year. · 


MARCHMONT SCHWARTZ , Left Half 
It is seldom that a sophomore makes a letter in football at Notre Dame; it is even less often that he ranks :is one of the 'leading backs of the country. Such, however, is•the case with Marchmont Schwartz. 
His rise to prominence was rapid and justified. A good blocker, a good kicker, a most consistep.t runner, and one of the best passers in the country, it is not strange that he has risen to the heights in this, his first year of col­legiate· football. 
But if there is one thing that causes this earnest, hard-working boy from the South to stand out more than any other quality, it is his coolness under fire. No matter how trying the situation; Marchy Schwartz is always cool, calm, 
. calculating, never flt;ist~red, never hurried. It is not logical that a Southerner should be so, and really, he is not this way by temperament; rather it is his will that forces his body.to obey. 
· March is almost . a sure. bet to play w.ith the first eleven for the next two years when, according to the present outlook, Rockne should turn out a.t least 'two rp'ore championship. teams.

OFFICIAL FOOTBALL REVIEW-1929 

JOSEPH SA VOLDI 
Full-Back 

After his great showing in the \Visconsin game, sports writers called Joe the "\Vandering Italian," and he certainly did an unusual amount of wander­ing toward. enemy goal lines during the course of the season. 
Joe really found himself this year. "He had seen some little action with the reserves during his Sophomore year, but was not espeCially promising. This season, however, found him a hard-hitting, plunging back who was continu­ally straining for extra inches when carrying the ball, and blocking well when his teamma~es were toting the oval. 
Defensively, too,. he showed remarkable ability and was one of the best known full-backs in the country. Against Indiana and Navy he got off to a good· start and he thrilled the packed stands of Soldiers' Field as he led the way to victory over \Visconsin. Injured at Georgia Tech, he was not in the line-up for the Drake game, but was his old self the rest of the season. His high dive over the line of scrimmage in the Carnegie Tech game scored the lone touchdown that won for Notre Dame and, incidentally, won for him the nick­name, "Jumping Joe," which seems likely to stick with him the rest of his life. 
THOMAS KASSIS 
Right Guard 

Never did a more willing worker or a scrappier player than Tom Kassis per­form for Notre Dame. After plugging along at center for two years with but fair success, he was made over into a guard this Fall and disting~ished himself in practically every game by his fiery play. 
As understudy to Jack Cannon he played all season with the shock troops and stood out always for his spectacular tackles behind the line of scrimmage and on punts. The offensive work of a guard is nevu as noticeable as his de­fensive pla.y, but anyone who knows the game and watched Tom this year will tell you that he was in there on every Notre Dame drive, leading the inter­ference on end runs, holding on passes, or charging on line bucks to open gap;. ing holes for the backs. · 
A sprained ankle in the Wisconsin game necessitated his removal from the field, but, although the injury seemed to get worse each week, Tom was always back in the lineup ready to fight to the end for his team, his school, and his coach. 


FRANK LEAHY 
Right Tackle 

The original tough luck boy of the Notre Dame squad, if there ever was one, is found in Frank Leahy, varsity tackle. · 
Although very light in weight-too light almost fo~ a tac_kle-Frank wanted to play and he showed enough stuff in spring practice to put him first among the candidates for his position. Even before the season had opened, though, he received a shoulder injury that was to hamper him all year. He had just re­covered somewhat from this·hurt and was going great in the Drake game when he twisted his ankle very painfully and had to take another forced vacation from active work. 
These setbacks would have discouraged most men, but not Frank. He always ~arne back for more and was in there at the end of the season fighting as hard as at the beginning, handicapped almost overwhelmingly, but battling his heaviest opponents to a standstill. 



MANFRED VEZIE 
Right End 

"Mannie" started the past se~son in top form against Indiana and Navy, but a week later in the \'\Tisconsin game he suffered a recurrence of an old knee injury that was so serious as to prevent his playing again until well along in· the schedule. 
His work in the Northwestern and Army games was up to his usual standard of steady, driving play, and he certainly had the sympathy of all his followers that his leg had to go bad on him while he was doing_such good work. 
He proved his ability in the -1928 season and everyone at Notre Dame knows that without this injury jinx he would ha.ve had a far better year than he did. His rather unstartling showing this year, however, will not detract in the least from Notre Dame's respect for him as one qf its greatest ends and a fine fellow. 
Next season will see "Veze" back at his old post where h.e will form the nucleus for another fighting Rockne line.

28 OFFICIAL FOOTBALL R E V I E. W-1 9 2 9 . 
BERTRAM METZGER 
Left Guard 

The "watch charm"· guard they call him, and like a diamond watch charm he is small and very valuable. A lot of high school coaches would consider Bert Metzger too small for their team, but, to the Great Coach, if a man has the stuff, nothing else matters. 
Bert Metzger's trail was not an easy one; he has been up against some of the best players in the country, ever since he has been out for football, but he 
· ·. carried on and finally gained recognition. To do so required his attaining well nigh perfection in his finesse, for in no other way can a small man hope to play gua.rd. But to his finesse he added a body small but hard, a mind sharp and keen, and courage, both mental and physical. 
As Captain Law's capable understudy he has gone f.ar this season, and it is not too much to expect him to gain national recognition next year. Already he is a part of the Notre Dame tradition of small, fast, smart, tough guards. The Smiths, Hunk Anderson, and the other great guards can look upon his work from the pinnacle to which we of Notre Dame ha.ve raised them and they can find that it is g~od that the tradition did not die with them. 
AL GEBERT 
Quarter-Bac/{ 

The story of Bud Gebert is as old as the Dome is old, the story of years on the reserve squad and the sternest competition. But these failed to break his spirit and he plugged along finally to come through. 
His rise was not phenomenal or rapid; ra.ther it was like the growth of a .great tree, slow, sure, and perfect. His sole asset when he started at Notre Dame was a keen football mind, a real quarter-back's mind that analyzed quickly and completely. He worked, though, until he had developed his blocking and speed to the point where "Rock" could not help but recognize it. 
As the leader .of the shock troops, Gebert distinguished himself and his team. In most of the games his entire team was used a.nd in all of them the backfield played. Their work under Gebert was so outstanding that it drew the recogni­tion of football followers all over the country; the shockers were seldom scored on and always made consistent drives agai~st Notre Dame's strongest opponents. 
The heady 'work of Bud Ge~ert is what sustained ~he second team attack until such time as the "New Four Horsemen" went into battle, and no one will ever know just how much he contributed to Notre Dame's success this Fall. 


PAUL O'CONNOR 
Right Half 

Handicapped throughout the season by a :variety of injuries, this sturdy, silent New Englander nevertheless carried on. One of the hardest ruiming and blo~king backs in the country, O'Connor's work was not flashy, although at times the steady flowing stream of his consistency was rippled with flashes of . greatness, as at the Northwestern game, when his slashing run of 40 yards paved the way to Notre Dame's first touchdown. 
His self-sacrificing attitude was demonstrated perfectly in this run when, instead of cutting over the middle of the field, he followed the teaching ·of Rockne and permitted himself to be tackled out of bounds. He might ha.ve cut in and run 40 more yards to a touchdown and personal glory, bu~ there was a chance of being tackled ncar the sidelines and "Rock" had told him to run outside when in a position like this. His sacrifice had its reward on the next pla.y when Joe Savoldi got away on a reverse for a score. 
As a member of the 1929 shock troops, "Bucky's" work stamps him as an­other of Notre Dame's great work-horses -the right half-backs who· block for the other fellow. 



JOE NASH 
Center 

Just another reason why Coach Rockne was optimistic this year is found in Joe Nash, shock troop pivot man. 
He had distinguished himself time and again during the '1928 season by his all-around heady play and notably by his 60-yard touchdown run against Drake on an intercepted Bulldog pass, but this year he outdid even himself. 
In every game he _got the call with the bruise-absorbing shockers, who never get such a lot of credit, but who are in there for a purpose. He received a very painfully sprained ankle in the Drake game, but· was back again the next week to relieve Moynihan and to perform his usual wearing-down duties against the Southern California Trojans. \Vhen "Big Tim" broke his ankle in the Northwestern scrap, Joe was right there to fill his place and he bore the brunt of the attack and defense against Army in the finale. 
It's spirit like this that makes Notre Dame a winning team and his passing, with that of Moynihan, is going to leave a vacancy in the Notre Dame ranks that will be hard to fill. · 
... 



REGIS McNAMARA 
Left Tac:kle 

Don't let the first name fool you folks. If ever an unsuspecting infant was misnamed, Mr. McNamara of the shock troops was some so years ago by fond parents, who, in all probability, never dreamed that their son would grow up into a big, raw-boned footballer. 
At any rate, his fellow players have decided that ..Mac" is much more fitting moniker and have attached it to this fighting Soph who does his work at left tackle with the shock troops. Filling in for Ted Twomey, we tell you, is no easy assignment, but McNamara did it about as well as any one could ha,ve this year. · 
He was aggressive, fast, deceptive, and smart all the time he played with the second club and never failed to have his man considerably softened up for Ted to finish. 
Mac played easily as much ball as any other Sophomore lineman and will be counted on to do big things for ..Rock" and Line Coach Tom Lieb during the next two seasons when he will cavort in Notre Dame's new stadium. 
TI-IOMAS KENNEALLY 
Quarter-Back 

Small in body, but great in mind and brain power, Tom Kenneally rated second to none as a chooser of strategic plays. Handicapped by his size throughout his early career, Kenneally got his start with a hall team where he was first noticed by Rockne. This year he came through nobly with the var­sity squad. · 
Realizing that next to using his head, a quarter-back's most important job is to block, the earnest Tommy concentrated on this department and this sea­son his blocking was excellent. Competing with two of the best quarter-backs .in the country, he did not see as much action as they did, but at every oppor­
tunity he added further proof to his ability. · 

· His sensational run in the Northwestern game, after he had perceived ~hat the man to whom he was to throw a lateral pass was covered, was a striking indi~ation of the hair-t~igger quickness with which his brain functions. 


EDMOND COLLINS 
Left E1zd 

Another member of the team following in the footsteps of an older brother was Eddie ·Collins. Some years ago ..Chuck" Collins was holding down one of the wing positions on Notre Dame's varsity. 
Along ·came little brother Ed, not so little at that, to demonstrate that foot­ball is a decided family trait as far as he is concerned. He is a great defensive end-no opposing team carrying the ball on those sweeping flank plays ever got by him and many of these formations were smeared behind the line of scrimmage as he broke through fast and sure. 
In addition to being poison on defense Ed was no novice at the art of pass­
1

catching, and was also very capable as ·a swift, heady leader of interference. Completing his third year on the varsity, Ed has written another glowing chapter in the volume of brother history on Notre Dame teams. 



BERNARD LEAHY 
Left Half 

"The greatest find of the season and another Chris Flanagan," said· Coach Rockne as he watched Bernie Leahy perform in the first Freshman game this year and far be it from us to dispute ..Rock's" word. 
Bernie had the misfortune to be playing at the same time as Jack Elder, how­ever, and although he could match the ..Rabbit"· at everything else, he didn't have quite the speed that was in Jack's flying legs. For .this ·reason, he spent most of the year as a reserve man, but ,at every opportunity he·demonstrated qualities that mark him as a man possessing triple threat ability and more. 
One of the best passers, kickers,· and runners on tl~e squad, Leahy is also a good defensive back and a hard blocker. He should see plenty of action whe!l he closes his career at Notre Dame next season. 

JOHN O'BRIEN 
Left End 

If Johnny O'Brien never does another thing on the gridiron, his name will go down among Notre Dame's immortals as the man who scored the winning touchdown against Army last year and the only player ever embraced by Coach Rockne. 
But "Tex", as he is more familiarly known, was not content to rest on his laurels. He was out every da.y this season working hard and was a .constant threat to Notre Dame's nine opponents. By dint of much hard labor, he has brought himself up to a level with the best all-around ends on the squad. He can block to perfection, he is a good defensive man, and he has mastered the little finesses of Notre Dame ends that go to throw opponents off their guard and pull them offsides. 
Primarily a track man-the best hurdler on the squad, in fact-O'Brien has joined the ranks of the very few cinder artists to attain fame on the gridiron. He won the Army game his Sophomore year and has another chance to per­form next season. 
AUGUST BONDI 
Right Guard 

Gus is another of the "watch-charm" guards that distinguish Rockne­coached football teams. Only five feet nine inches in height, he has the drive and defensive qualities that distinguished John "Clipper" Smith, All-American and captain in 1927. 
A guard never has much chance to distinguish himself, especially when his lot is to understudy Capt. Johnny Law, but Gus gave good account of him­self whenever opportunity knocked. He has plenty of fight and his snappy talk in the line is an inspiration to his teammates. 
Bondi will leave Notre Dame in June. with the satisfaction of knowing that he made good in the school where football competition is the keenest in the world.

GEORGE.VLK ·· ... ·Right-End : · 

The despair of. radio announcers and reporters, George Vlk was a real joy to Coach Rockne _and ~11. N~~~~-J?a~eJoll.o:wer~ ?u:ing the past se~son,. 
\Vith Manny Vezie out of ~he. gam~ f1 large part· of the time with ·.hi~. Leon Errol trick knee, George alterna_red with Tom Conley. and handed in some very creditable performances. He was given jus~-a bare outside chance of making good last se~son .when he ro~p~d al?out ~ith the reserves, but he came up fast in spring practice and was' playing with 'the varsity and shock troops a large part of the time this fall. . · · 
Unlike many wingmen, George -ha~ ~o specialty. He is a good defensi~e man, a ca.gey pass receiver, and· a smart blocker. Players as consistent as· Vlk are few and far between, and his steadiness promises much for next year when he will wind. up his Notre Dame. career. 
CLARENCE KAPLAN 
Right Half 

\Ve warn you, don't be misled if you see a slight, unassuming lad wearing large shell-rimmed glasses and answering to the name of Clarence. For the chances are it's none other than "Cap" Kaplan one of the most promising Sophomore backs on the squad. 
He was robbed of a chance to score the first touchdown of the season when he caught Carideo's pass just a. foot past the end zone against Indiana, but he showed some real stuff in the \Visconsin game when, as he started around left end and found his way blocked, he reversed his field and picked up 13 yards to put the ball in scor.ing position. .. · 
«Cap" has keen footb~ll sense, he is a real triple-threat man, and a good blocker and tackler-an exceptional one considering his lack of weight. He was hampered by a s~oulder ~njury this yea~, but always came back for more, and will return for still more next fall. 
Any Soph with a monogr~~ at Notre Dame has quality, and Clarence Kaplan is no exception. 




NORBERT CHRISTMAN 
Quarter-Back 

.. Chris" is a smart young quarter-back who just finished his first year on the team. Hailing from Green Ba..y, \Vis., where the snow flies, the thermometers drop, and the Packers win pro championships, it was only logical that he should don the moleskins at Notre Dame. 
Norb had not only the atmosphere but the ability to play the pigskin game, .and he traveled with the team the whole season. Inexperienced at the begin­ning of the year, he did not sec much action, but in the N orthwcstcrn game his chance came and he grasped it. Sent into the game in the third quarter, he turned in a clever piece of generalship, directing the plays that led to Notre Dame's last touchdown. 
\Vith the experience gained this yearand the natural ability he has already shown, Christman should develop into one of Notre Dame's ablest signal callers. 
\ 
GEORGE SHAY 
Full-Bacl~ 

There have been many good football players at Notre Dame. There have been some about whom clung that mystic aura that is greatness, but it is doubtful whether there has ever been a better defensive full-back at Notre Dame than George ..Dinny" Shay. 
When Dinny was a. Freshman his defensive work against the varsity in scrim­mage so impressed one of the coaches that he said if he' were to have a team composed entirely of All-American players, he could not have or. wish for a better defensive back than Shay. · 
His blocking is good, his plunging fair, and his open :field running, nothing· much at all, but the way he backs up a. line is really great. Rugged, hard, quiet, he has come and gone, and the outside world has known him but little. 
But those who have played against or with him will remember him for what he really is-one of the greatest defensive backs of Notre Dame history. 


ALLAN HOWARD 
Fulf-Back 

AI followed the footsteps of Larry Mullins all the way from California to Notre Dame and a full-back position with the varsi~y squad. 
Since he .was a comparative newcomer to football, not much was expected of him early in the season, but he soon developed an a.ggressiveness and de­termination that carried him up among the leaders in the· Rockn~ backfield. 
His first game was against Wisconsin and here he first showed the spirit that was to carry him on against Georgia Tech, Drake, and Northwestern. In all of these games, particularly the Drake one, he carried the ball well, blocked effectively, tackled precisely, and showed proficiency in every depart,ment of the game. 
His showings in the Drake and Northwestern games give promise of a _future of note in his remaining two years at Notre Dame. 


THOMASYARR 
Center 

\Vith two experienced pivot men ahead of him in the persons of Tim Moynihan and Joe Nash, Tommy saw little action in the closer games this fall, but showed the makings of a center of distinction when he had the

Traveling with the ustadiumless champions" throughout the season he gained a wide range of experience that should help him considerably. dur­ing the next few years. He used his weight and broad shoulders to good advantage in the Drake and Northwestern games where he saw most of his action this year, arid to clear him of a false charge, we might diverge at this point for a moment. 
One of his center passes had got away from him in the \Vildcat game and put the Purple in scoring position. Later, when the ball was fumbled by a Notre Dame back and recovered by a Northwestern lineman for a touchdown, Tommy was immediately blamed for the affair, but we got it straight from the quarter-back that Yarr made no miscue on this play, but rather that one of the backs did. · 
His well-balanced proportions of brain and brawn coupled with his natural and developed ability should put him with the first string. for the next two years. 

JOSEPH LOCKE 
Guard 

Locke is another of the consistent linemen who saw action with the shock· troops during the past season. Joe is not the beefy type of lineman, but re­lied on speed and headwork to carry out his assignments on offense. And when the other side had possession of the ball, it gained very few yards through his section of the line. · 
If the spirit to fight hard at all times has anything to do with the making of a successful football player, it was one of the reasons that Locke was .. up there." Quiet and unassuming off the field, he rose to the heights of fire and dash when he donned a suit ·to become .a literal tower. of strength. 
His presence on the squad next year, his last at Notre Dame, will be wel­come indeed. · 
ARTHUR McMANMON 
Right Tacl?..le 

Preceded by a brother, .. Big John" ·of the famous Seven Mules of 1924, Art was not entirely devoid of background when he came to Notre Dame !ast year. 
Plenty of beef, added to his height, was combinel with a-ggressiveness and fight to make him one of the most dependable men on the squad. He was in the starting lineup with the shock troops whenever they performed and was out­standing for his blocking, defensive work, and especially for his ability to open holes for the backs. Many of Savoldi's and Schwartz's longer runs were made through the gaps opened by Mac. 
\Vith two more years of competition ahead of him, Art will undoubtedly be a star lineman in the Notre Dame wall and will carry on the McManmon tra­dition started by his big brother;

ALCULVER· 
Left Tackle 

On~ of the best reasons why ..Rock" said at the beginning of the season that he would have the toughest team in football history and one strong in re­serves is found in AI Culver. 
\Veil .()ver six feet tall -and better than 200 ·pounds in weight, Culver has the requisites that go to make the perfect tackle. Like numerous other Sopho­more candidates, though, he was reminded that only eleven men can play with the first string and that Seniors and Juniors must be given first choice when there is any doubt as to whom to use, because the second year men will get their chance by and by. 
He played bang-up ball in the chances he got this fall and marked himself as a man to keep in mind next year when another Seven-Mule Team is being ?rganized to charge before another set of Horsemen. · 
The Trainers 

"Doctor" Joe Abbott and his crew of trainers may not be miracle workers, but they come mighty close to this mark with their overnight cures of bad sprains and bruises. Joe, who is next year's track captain, ex-president of th~ Monogram club and not really a doctor at all, has charge of all those mysterious violet rays, electric· pads, reducing machines, and scientific hot water applica­tions that clutter up the training rooms. 
Dr.· Frank Summers and Dr. Frank Powers ha.ve done some remarkable work along the black magic line during the past season as have the three "masseurs," Marshall Kizer, Gene Howard, and Roy Cook. 
Naturally a fast man, Joe is always the first on the field when a player 'is taking the count and he usually has the patient well on the road to recovery when the others draw up. They all work fast, though. If you don't think so, try this sometime: take the first unconscious person . you run across, bring him to his senses, diagnose his case, and give him. first aid. all in two very short, fleet­ing moments. 
That's just one of the little routine functions of the training sta.ff that go on week after week.

The Cheer leaders 
A very tall, but very limber young man dressed all in white trots out be­fore a packed stadium, gracefully obliges with a smooth cartwheel, turns around, and takes a bow or two. He is joined by four immaculately togged assistants, and, under their direction, a mighty cheer goes up. 
There you have it. Dan· Barton and his four scintillating helpers showing a football-mad ·conglameration ·of persons how to give vent to their feelings in the most effective way. · 
The cheering at the Chicago "home" games and at the season's record­breaking pep sessions played no little part in the success of "The New Four Horsemen." Smiling Dan, the world's best yell-producer, played no small role in the production of these ground-rocking roars. 
He was very capably assisted by Art Goulet and Ed Madden, Juniors; and Sophomores Powers and Kennedy, all of whom will do their stuff next season during the first year of home football in the new Notre Dame stadium. 
Give 'em a hand, folks, they'v:e earned it.

·The Band 
The University Band, under the capable direction of Prof. Joseph J. Casasanta, was a real record-breaker this year. 
It broke its own record for size with a membership of 85. It made :five trips to games-three to Chi­cago, one to Evans ton, and one to New York-another new mark. It played before an average audience of about 80,000 persons in its :five appearances to set a season's total of approximately 400,000, a record that will stand for all bands for some time. 
And if the organization did not set a new standard for quality of music offered and smart drilling, we are no judge of either. Director Casasanta. had a wealth of last year's men to work with this year · and . used them to the best possible advantage. 
On four successive Saturdays the unit had to play songs of Drake, 
Southern California, North:western, and Army as well as At pep meetings and at games, the band was an inspira­learn new formations for these schools. This was no ordi­tion to the student body and to the team as well. There nary task, but the combined efforts of Prof. Casasa~ta, was nothing but praise for the organization this year as Pres. Harry Busscher, and Drum Major Henry Tholen made it sent the ((Victory March" and Director Casasanta.'s own it look easy. uHike Song" ringing through the crisp Fall air.

An interesting story was told ·in a Chicago newspaper office concerning Notre Dame's showing on Oct. 26, the big day. It seems the sports editor had decided to run all of his reserve game stories under a single head and thus keep them together rather than scattered all through his sheet. \Vhen press time rolled around, he found that he had four stories-three of them were Notre Dame's and two of them Irish victories. 
This comprehensive schedule that the Reserves play is but another exhibition of the genius that is Rockne's. Realizing that actual competition under fire· against an­other team representing another institution, is the best way to bring out the best that is in his men, he also re­alizes that so large is the squad that it is impossible for them all to get this experience in the varsity games. Hence the reserve games which have indeed pro"duced_ results. It was from the ranks of the reserves that some of Notre Dame's brightest stars arose. Leppig, Flanagan, Elder and Nash; Law, Colrick and Vezie are but a very few of the names that have achieved prominence after an apprentice­ship on the Reserves. 

And last, but most important, comes the hardest and 
. yet the most valuable thing that the Reserves do; namely, act as the scrub team for the varsity. \Veil-nigh every week, one or more reserve teams learn the plays that the varsity's opponents will use on the coming Saturday, and all that week the Reserves will shoot these plays at the varsity in live or dummy scrimmage, thus enabling the varsity to acquaint itself with the offense they will meet on the following Saturday. This is no easy task, but under the inspiration of men like Chevigny and Lieb, and always with the realization that "Rock's" presence hovers over the field whether he is present or not,. the Reserves have time and again helped win games in which they did not play. 
Rockne HearS Navy Game on Special \Wire 

Lying in bed list~ning to his team win an important in­tersectional game was a new experience for Coach Knute Rockne, but that was all there. was left for him to do on the afternoon of Oct. 12. 
It was the week-before the Navy game that the Notre Dame wizard first had been stricken with the congestion in his leg, and when the time came for his boys to leave, he had been told by his doctor that to accompany them to Baltimore would be to remain bedfast all season. Re­luctantly accepting the lesser of the two evils, "Rock" did not, however, put the game entirely out of his active mind. 
He arranged to ha.ve a leased wire to Baltimore con­nected to the phone at the side of his bed, and Saturday morning he talked to every. man on the ·squad, offering bits of advice, encouragement, and last-minute strategy. 
Came the game. Here was Rockne, 800 miles from the scene of battle,: helpless. . There was his team .that had looked none too impressive the week before against Indiana -anp there was one of the greatest Navy elevens in the Academy's history. . \Vould his men be equal to their great task· without him to guide them? 
·It seemed they might not when the Middies rushed the shock troops off their feet and scored in the first quarter. The invalid leader frowned. Then came the report that the first team was in, and right after this the news that Carideo had. completed his· spectacular pass to Elder for a touchdown and had tied the ·score with his kick. He was all smiles now. 
\Vhen lvlullins plunged over Navy's go~l a while later to put· the game on ice, he lean~d hac~ and sighed. a long, satisfying sigh o_f relief. Y.es, sir, they were a great bunch of ·boys. And "Rock" must be a great teacher and leader when his boys can play like they did at Navy with­out him there :to point out each move.

Notre Datne-A Teatn That Packs 'Etn In 

.. Panoramic view of the 120,000 crowd that jammed Soldier ~ield to see the Notre Dame-South~rn California-game. 
. What Jack Dempsey was to boxing, what Babe Ruth is to baseball, what Bobby Jones is to golf-that is what 
Notre Dame represents to football. 
The crowd loves action, fighting h~arts, and the faculty for coming back when defeat seems inevitable, and Notre Dame teams have never failed to show these qualities. That the 1929 team wa~ no exception to the rule is shown by the fact that they packed in a total audience of 600,000 persons, or an average of over 65,000 at each game, to set a new mark that won't be broken for some time. 
. uThe New Four Horsemen".·opened their season before a Homecoming crowd of 20,000 at Bloomington, and the ~ext week a sellout gathering of 80,000 saw them beat the· Navy at Baltimore. Coming into their uback yard home field" in Chicago, Oct. 19, they romped about before 100,000 pairs of eager eyes to beat \Visconsin. 
The following week, 70,000, the largest crowd ever to witness a sporting· event in Pittsburgh, saw them _play Carnegie Tech. It was the first time the Carnegie stadium, built in 1.925, was filled. Thirty-five thousand saw them get revenge from Georga Tech at Atlanta· on Nov. 2. Their fame thus far drew a crowd of 45,000 to the Drake game the next week, and following tha.t they equalled their own record -with a conglameration of some 120,000 souls at Soldier Field when they played Southern California. 
Chicago's intersectional clash with Washington did not stop 50,000 persons from turning out Nov. ·23 to see Notre Dame wrestle with the Northwestern \Vildcats. The 80,000 pasteboards for the traditional Army game in New York were sold out before the season opened and an added 200,000 applications were re~urned to their senders. 
The last three games were all sellouts, for that matter, a striking tribute to a team that came back after losing four games the previous year and fought its way to the top of the heap again. 
. The mobs go fo.r winners and for teams that never quit when they are fighting a losing battle. They want to see football played scientific~lly, but. not if the elements of fight and daring are lost. The keen knowledge of the game and the inspiration Coach Rockne gives his players combines both of the elements th~t the public wants. 
That is why 600,000 persons went milling through the turnstiles of the nation's largest stadia this year. Notre Dame football satisfies-but it is not mild.

The Manager~ 
\Vith Notre Dame playing every game of its 1929 schedule on the road, the task of the student managers was a gigantic one. 
Too much credit cannot be given to head mana.ger, John Quinn and associa.te man­ager, Bernard Conroy, for the efficient way in which they took care of the countless details of the trips to Bloomington, Balti­more, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Evanston, New York and Chicago. 
Every week trunks had to be packed, rail­road, hotel, and eating reservations made, and a thousand and one other details taken care of. \Vhen the team was not. traveling,· it was practicing at home, and equipment had to be ha.ndled, scouts and others who did not belong had to be kept off the field, and players had to be checked in. 
Besides the varsity trips, there were eight reserve games on foreign fields and two at home to be handled. These trips were handled by the 'following Junior managers: Tom Ashe, Robert Balfe, Dan Halpin, Jack 
Hughes, Joseph Lauerman, Bourke Motsett, and Jack the staff; contrary to general opinion, the managers are 
Saunders; and these Senior managers: Anthony Kegowicz, something more than mere valets to the players.

OFFICIAL FOOT.BALL REVIEW-1929 

Scenes from early ga~es on Cartier Field. 
ttThe Passing of the Old-'' 
By RonERT E. G9RMAN 
Cartier Field, hallowed soil at Notre Dame, is now merely a tradition. The historic old battlefield, scarred by the cleats of many an Irish immortal, has finally yielded to the growth of football~a growth in which one of those immortals, Knute Rockne himself, has been instrumental. 
The nation-wide following which Notre Dame teams 

enjoy today makes it difficult for us to believe that there was ever a time when a Notre Dame football team was -not an attraction. Such was the case, however, back in the days when the University was scarcely a wind-break on the Indiana prairies. Interhall football at that time was more popular than interscholastic competition, and the number of spectators that assembled to watch the varsity play could usually be accomodated on the players' bench. Foot­ball, like checkers, was then distinctly a game to play 
rather than to watch. 
In thos.e days Notre Dame played such teams as the Illinois Cycling Club, Englewood High School, and the Indianapolis Artillery. The advent of such all-time Notre Dame stars as Hering, Eggeman, and Salmon served to arouse interest in the sp~rt, and \Visconsin, Northwestern, Indiana, and other ·present-day opponents of the local school were added to the schedule. As more and more people were attracted to the games, which were then held on a :field known as Brownson Campus, the need was felt for an enclosed :field. 
University officials wrote to alu_mni for help in this 
project. It was at this time that \Varren Cartier, of the 
class of '87, donated the plot of land which, under his 
name and the name of Notre Dame, was to achieve un­
dying fame. Bleachers were erected for each game as the 
only permanent seats at that time were in a baseball grand­
stand at one end of the :field. 
Cartier Field, as such, was a distinct improvement, but it, too, became inadequate when the bewildering· genius of a. ·second brilliant coterie of stars headed by Dorais, Eichenlaub, and Rockne himself, com­

manded the attention of the entire football world. Accordingly, Jesse Harper, who was then head coach, in 1915, erected perma­nent stands seating 1,000. 
These seats, together with 1,000 more which were addc;d in the follow­ing year, sufficed until 1919. In that . year, Rockne, who had mean­while become head coach, . promised that if he were · allowed to erect another 5,000 seats he would pay for them with the re­ceipts from the next two games. After being granted th~ desired permission ..Rock" carried out his end 

\Vfarren A. Cartier 

of the bargain. Since. that year the seating facilities of the :field were gradually enlarged until the stadium reached its ultimate capacity. 
And now the Cartier stands arc being torn down to sat­isfy the ever-onward stride · of progress. Cartier itself passes, but the permanence of the Cartier Field tradition has been insured by the grid· genius of Gipp, Rockne, Eichenlaub, Dorais, Kiley, and other Notre Dame men of might; by the Four Horsemen and the rest of the famous 1924 championship combination; by ·the phenomenal record for consecutive victories; or by any one of these factors alone.

J. ARTHUR HALEY 
Bus. Mgr. of Atbletics 
Next fall Notre Dame .will open another era in its foot­ball history,· when the 1930 team moves into its new stadium. New traditions will take their place with those of the past Notre Dame fields and new heroes will join the school's immortals. who have brought glory to Our Lady on the sod of theold gridirons. A new policy of having five games at home to four away will be introduced and such terms as ((The Ramblers" and ((The Nomads" will go into discard.-· 
Although construction work is well under way on the new stnictutc, a definite name had not been chosen for it, as this book went to press. Probability that it will be. called simply ((Notre Dame Field" has been expressed by authori­ties, however. The new amphitheater located just south of the old Cartier field stands will cost in the neighborhood of $700,000 and will scat 60,000 persons in its first form. \Vith an eye to the continued popularity of Notre Dame football, the structure will be· built so that it may be en­larged around the outside to hold 80,000, ·and, with the addition of decks, to seat 120,000. 
Every possible convenience has ·been provided in the plans of the new Notre Da~e stands. They are rcctangu-· lar in shape so that spectators may be as ncar the playing field as possible. Thirty-six portals will facilitate handling of the crowds; dressing rooms, a first-aid hospital room, concession stands, 18 handball and squash courts, storage rooms, and other necessary offices will be found .under the seats in easy access to the field. The glass encl~scd press stand will accomodate 250 reporters and will be fitted with ind~vidual telegraph jacks, electric heaters, and three 

' broadcasting booths. 
The edifice is designed strictly for football and the playing field, ten feet below the exterior' grade, will con­tain no track or baseball facilities. Electric scoreboards built into the stands at both ends of the field will give the usual statistics as relayed by ·phone from the sidelines. 
Excavation work was finished early in theFall a·n:d foot­ings for the superstructure have been laid ~0 that work on the stands thc~selves may be carried on in the remaining months before ·the portals are thrown open next September. Ralph Sollitt & Sons, South Bend contractors, are super­vising constructi(?n work, and the Osborne Engineering Co., of Cleveland, Ohio, drew· the plans. Possibility that railroad spurs directly to the field may be laid to accomo­date out-of-town spectators has been expressed. 
The extensive work. of financing the new structure is being carried on by J. Arth_ur Haley, business manager of athletics; Rev. Michael A. Mulcaire, C.S.C., Ph.D.; chair­man of the. athletic board of control; and other faculty members. A very attractive offer for box seats over a ten­year period has·. been offered and many loyal followers of Notre Dame football have responded to assure the success of the new structure. 
The new stadium represents a dream of Coach Rockne's realized.: In. his playing days, as he was chasing the passes of Gus Dorais all over the playing field, he never thought that soine ·day his teams would win fame that would lead to his ·first ·stands of 5,000 seating capacity. Once he had these, though, he kept going until he got the present Cartier stands. Never satisfied, he started to plan for a stadium that would take its place with the nation's best; ·and he will have just that in this new home of Our Lady's foot­ball warriors. . 
According·to present plans, the U. S. Naval academy teain will dedicate the new stands next year and many of the outstanding elevens of the country. will meet Notre Dame's future teams in the ((House builded upon •Rock'." 
At the St. Joe Valley Notre Dame club's annual testi­monial banquet for the team, December· 5, Coach Bill Ingram, of Navy, stated that he hoped: the Naval academy might be represented at the dedication of the new stadium by a regiment of midshipmen. He said that he will do everything in his power to have the midshipmen in. attend­ance at this game. 
Pat Page, Indiana's head coach; said that he is looking forward with pleasure to his game with Notre Dame in the new stadium next fall. At this writing, Indiana and Navy are the only two· teams booked definitely for games in the new arena, ·although Drake is almost a sure bet to be on the horn:e schedule of the 1930 team. Contests .with two 'other prominent elevens are pending and will be announced before Christmas. 
Coach Rockne has stated that he will never book another tough schedule, but from all advance indications it.would seem that he 1s broadcasting just another of his famous bear stories.

OFFICIAL FOOTBALL REVIEW-1929

Freshm.an Football 

A new syste111 of practice was introduced to Freshman football men this fall by Coaches Tommy Mills and Bill Jones. In former· years, the Frosh had been employed largely as ufall guys" for the varsity. Each week they would learn the play of the enemy that scouts had brought home, and, after mastering these formations as well as possible in a week's time, they would scrimmage with the varsity. 
Time showed this to be not only a bad thing for the yearlings, ·but now and then unfortunate for _the varsity. The green-jersied lads could not organize their team play effectively enough to make any sort of headway against their older and more powerful colleagues, mimy were in­jured on jumbled· signals, and the varsity did not get the opposition it wanted-at least on defense. 
\Vhen the big boys took the ball; however, a different story was told; the varsity got more resistance than it could handle! Even today you hear stories on the campus· about how Torn Kassis wanted to clean up on All-American Bud Boeringer, and how Dick Donoghue outplayed the whole varsity line before the Army game of 1926, when they were in their first year. 
So this fall, Tommy and Bill kept their Freshmen over in a secluded corner of Cartier practice field and let them turn their vigor into other channels. They drilled on fundamentals; men who played full-back in high school merely because they were big, were shifted to tackle if they belonged there, the Notre Dame style of play was taught the men, and in general, they prepared for spring practice when they will' themselves be varsity material. 
Some 200 men reported this fall when practice started and immediately they were put to work preparing for the annual fall classic known as the Freshman-Varsity game. 

\Vith but a week· to organize these 200 lads from Holly­wood to Naugatuck, the Freshman coaches were unable to make much of a classic of this contest and the varsity ran up a 96 to 0 score. The rapid improvement in the Frosh ranks and the judicious weeding-out that Mills and Jones engineered in a week's time were shown in a second game ·when the varsity, too, was better organized, but which it. won by only a 72 to 0 score, making 3 6 points in the last quarter against the tired yearlings. In both these games individuals stood out who later were to dis­tinguish themselves as real material for Coach ··Rockne to usc next year. . 
They had distinguished . themselves quickly, too,· for the squad was shaved to a mere 80 in short order. These seven-odd squads were put to work right away on funda­mentals. They learned Navy and Drake plays for use in scrimmage against the varsity, but otherwise ·went through much the same routine as the varsity itself. 
The number of real football players who came to light during the fall speaks well for next season's prospects. A pair of smart, inspiring quarter-backs were found in Herb D'Avignon, who prepped at Mt. Assumption Institute, Foust, N. Y., and Laurrie Vejar, from Hollywood high, at the other end of the continent. 
Steve Banas, a native Hoosier, is in a fair way to step into Jack Elder's well-worn shoes next fall at left half, and Roger Beirne from Peddie Prep, Hightstown, N. J., showed the left ends who will return that he is not to be taken lightly. A brace of Badgers are John Tobin, of Janesville, and Fritz Staab, of Madison, who did big things at right half and full-back, respectively.

make a strong bid for the plunging job next spring and fall. . A wealth of good ends was found in the searchings of Mills and Jones. · Bierne, already mentioned, probably heads the list, but John Abbatmarco, New York; Bernie Bresson, \Vooster, Ohio; Ed Donnelly, Bloomington, Ill.; Currier Holman, Salix, Iowa; and Francis Donoghue, Auburn, N. Y., brother of Dick and ~ern on the varsity, were all outstanding. · 
At the tackles, the following did some very commend­able work: Chuck Bassett, Stratford, Conn.; Chauncey Brantfort, Milwaukee, \Vis.; Bernie Cousino, Erie, Mich.; Sam Goldstein, Chicago, Ill.; Joe Kyrth, another Madison, \Vis., chap; Michael Leding, South Bend; and Bill Smithers, 
·Yonkers, N. Y. Some mighty fine guard material for next year, rests in Bud Bansbach, Springfield; Ill.; Jim Harris, Belaire·, Ohio; Bill Pierce, Sherman, Texas; Bob Terlaak, Cleveland, Ohio; Harry \Vunsch and Oscar Zoss, brother of Abe Zoss, of the varsity squad, both of South Bend. Frank Buder, Tilden Tech, Chicago, star; Ed Agnew, Loyola, Chicago; and Ed Amyett, who came from down in Memphis, lead in the ball-snappers' derby.

Dear Harvey: Perhaps you remember uway back when" spectacle and pa.geantry didn't have their present position as ubetween the halves" festivity. \Vhen I saw the release of the balloons and pigeons by Notre Dame at Soldiers' field last Saturday, my mind galloped back to the days when I was still a student in the old prep school at Notre Dame and all _of us, preps and collegians alike, made a mad rush under the grandstand as soon as the half ended. 
There an enterprising South Bender sold sa:ucer pies, ham sandwiches, and coffee. The latter was piping hot, served in tin cups: For 15 cents the hungry student had a feast. 
\Vhat was probably the first attemp·t at organized root­ing at Notre Dame took place in 1900 in a game against Beloit. Song parodies were written by upperclassmen and rehearsed at what we now would call a upep rally." One 
of them still sticks in my mind. It was .sung to the pop­ular ragtime ditty of uHello My Baby, Hello. My Honey, Hello My Ragtime Gal/'· an:d ran: 
Hello AlFortiu, hello John Farley, Hello, the whole darued team; Seud tts tbe uews by wire, Beloit is left in tbe mire. If we defeat tbem, we will entreat tbem Not to go bome aml cry; So, CajJtain, maul tbem And we'll j1rocure the rye. 
\Ve did maul them, all right, but lost the state cham­pionship to Indiana. Fortin, then. captain, is now a promi­nent engineer in New York.

Too bad our friend who signs himself uNotre Dame Alumnus" wasn't around the week before the Southern California game to see some REAL pep, although we have very little to say against the enthusiasm of the crowd at the game itself. Really, it wasn't half bad, come to think of it.

OFFICIAL FOOTBALL REVIEW-1929 
Interhall Football 
«They play on class teams, dormitory teams, corridor teams-any kind of teams as long as they play football." \Vith these characteristic words, Knute Rockne explains how and why more than 800 men play football each fall at Notre Dame. 
\Vith the same words, ..Rock" exposes a system which 

-has not only mystified. the average football fan, but many a fellow-coach as well. The plan is nothing more than an arrangement whereby all of the players on these les~er teams, which compete in an interhall league, have a chance to learn the game and to play it. The following spring they have ample opportunity to show the results of added experience in spring practice. If they make good they are invited to join the varsity; if not, they are «farmed out" to the interhall league for another season. The important thing is that Coach Rockne has an ever-developing source of material on hand. · 
Interhall football at Notre Dame is not a new institu­tion. The storied history of die school, even before 1900, is crowded with incidents that typify the intense rivalry which prevailed in interhall competition. In the earlier years of the league a. Sorin-Corby clash for the hall title was as bitterly fought as a Notre Dame-Southern California battle of today with a national championship at stake. Gradually, however, inter-scholastic football arose to claim the major share of attention at Notre Dame as well as at other universities. 

\Vith the assumption of what Notre Dame men have al­ways considered a sacred duty-that of wea.ring the Gold and Blue in athletic warfare against the representatives of other schools-interhall football was not discontinued. On the other hand, the system· was maintained not only to supplement varsity athletics, but also to give every student of. the university an opportunity to play supervised f<;>otball. 
Instead of being dwarfed into insignificance by the spec­tacular growth which has marked the exp:tnsion of inter­collegiate football, the interhall movement has profited by this progress. In fact, the only pha.se of interhall football that remains the same from year to year is the spirit of the participants. 
The greatest single advance in interhall .football came i~ the years shortly preceding the war when the university initiated its policy of furnishing equipment to the players. This integral function of the system has been gradually developed until today the equipment room for the hall gridders resembles the «plant" of. a large university ..

The outcome itself of the grid derby was somewhat out of the ordinary. The adjective "unusual" when applied to the victory of the Off-Campus eleven is meant in praise rather than in disparagement. Year after year. the "Day Dogs" enter the "flag" race with the odds all against them. The hall elevens have a distinct advantage over them in that they not only have a better opportunity to organize but also to practice. The Off-Campus division in the past has turned out good teams, but it remained for the 1929 edi­tion to make history by. winning a pennant for Father Heiser's office. 
\Vhen Crosby's forty-yard victory pass had been snared by Beesely who subsequently deposited it across the Sopho­more goal line in the championship clash, it was "Journey's End" for the Villagers. Their own particular .Victory March had ended in a well-earned championship. At that, their title-gaining efforts were but a shade better than those of the Sophomore Hailers, who a week before had held them . to a tie and necessitated .a play-off. 
The champions played six games. Two of them, one against Brownson and the other against the Sophs, .were scoreless ties, while Carroll was defeated, 12 to 6; Howard, 8 to 0; an~ \Valsh, 7 to 0. The narrow. margin by which 
Off-Campus trod the championship ·path is indicative of 
the type of football which marked the season this year~ The games, with but few exceptions, 'Yerc battles to the last whistle. 
Previous to 1929 the task of supervising the league has been in the hands of one man. With the intention of cen­tralizing the labor of administering over the league, Coach Rockne, in September of this year, created a board of directors composed of the twelve rectors with the Reverend Raymond Murch, C.S.C., as chairman. In addition, Mr. Rockne appointed George Keogan, head basketball coach, to be director of the hall system. As the "Judge Landis" of the circuit, Mr. Kcogan decides all disputes and protests, and assigns the fields and officials for the contests; while Father Murch arranges the schedules. 
In placing added stress upon interhall football this fall, Mr. Rockne assigned the coaches so that each team in the league might profit by the instruction of a man from the varsity squad. These men and their assistants arc mem­bers of the School of Physical Education of the university. By this work with the hall teams, they obtain the practical coaching experience required in their course. 
In the following list of coaches the first named in each case is the varsity representative, and the second is his co-worker: Lyons, Conley and Dilley; Freshman, Brill and Brown; Off-Campus, ·Lyons and Fitzgerald; Sophomore, Koken and Reaume; Howard, Carideo and Janishcski; Mor­rissey, Griffen and Eaton; Brownson, Yarr and Jachym; \Valsh, Savoldi, Flynn and Hahan; St. Edwa.rd's, Kosky, Carr and Harris; Carroll, Kaplan, O'Connell and Artwan; Corby, O'Brien and Maroni; Badin, F. Leahy, \Valsh and O'Connor. 
One of. Mr. Rockne's motives in having a varsity man in contact with each team in the league was continually to be on the lookout for promising material. The product of the hall circuit is a fighting ball player more often than a finished star, for "fight" rather than "finesse~' is the char­acteristic of this lca.gue. This fits in nicely with the plans of the coaching staff, for they find that a player with plenty of spirit will ordinarily be an apt pupil in regard to football technique. 
From start to finish, a different spirit seemed to prevail during the past season. That 1929 was to be no ordinary year in interhall history was indicated early in September when over 400 answered "Rock's" call and were issued equipment. Throughout. the campaign the competition was keener and the teams more evenly matched than ever before; while Mr. Keo"gan and his board of directors estab­lished a new era in efficiency in their management of the league.

JACK ELDER 

Bloomington, Ind., Oct. 5.-There was a hustling and a bustling in the hall of the famous Notre Dame grid heroes today-those illustrious Rockne warriors of other days, George Gipp, the Four Horsemen, Christy Flanagan and Johnny Niemiec were preparing to welcome a newcomer. 
Jack Elde1·, down here on the gridiron, another son of Notre Dame, was doing just what they had done before him. He ran the Crimson of Indiana into the sod, 14 to 0. 
Perhaps he. didn't possess to the same degree the all­around greatness of Gipp, the keen insight of the Four Horsemen, the shiftiness of Flanagan, the power of Niemiec. But he had enough of all of that in addition to sheer speed of foot to beat the Pagemen practically single-handed. 
Twice Elder got away for touchdowns .and he dominated the play as long as he was there pumping his :fine legs with a dancer's grace to outstrip the Crimson for repeated gains. 
In the second quart~r the trim-looking Elder, who still holds a. 75-yard dash record, swept around right end for 20 yards to a touchdown. And it wasn't the fleetness· alone on this occasion. ·He cut back to near .center after swerv­ing wide to evade three crimson-shirred lads who had ideas of impeding his· path. 
Elder more than doubled that effort in the third period, running 60 yards to a touchdown. He shot through left tackle as if. propelled ·from a catapult, hesitated just a split second as he faced the secondary defense, and then ~truck out to the right.. He soon had three of. the backs hopelessly outstripped and just one remained, Balay, who decided to inake a desperate lunge as Jack was widening the gap yard by yard. He sprawled a foot behind Elder on the green sod. 
Makes Lo11.g Pass 
In addition to that he occasionally zipped through for 10 and 2 0 yards and also did some passing. It was a pass from Elder to Mullins that placed the ball within scoring distance previous to that first touchdown jaunt in the sec­ond quarter. Elder tossed laterally to Mullins, who streaked down the side line, passed all but .one Indianan, who forced him out at the 25-yard line. 

Outside of Carideo, who _kicked the two extra points from placement, Savoldi, and Mullins, the victory was all Elder. The Hoosiers couldn't stop him because they couldn't even get their hands on him. . 
. Indiana, however, was a losing team from beginning to end. To top off a brilliant offensive that apparently needs only polishing, the Rockne men held the Page men to three downs and each of them was due to forward passing. T ak~ ing cognizance of the fact that Notre Dame gained 351 yards by rushing in spite of a penalty total of 110 yards there obviously is little to say for Indiana. · 
It was a sad homecoming indeed. \With thousands of old grads among the 20,000 who filled most of Memorial Stadium, they had little to exult over than the gay decora.: tions that met the eye at every turn.. 
Just'once did the Pagemen really threaten and that was due to one of two serious fumbles by Carideo. He bobbled 
a. punt that McCracken recovered on Notre Dame's 33­yard line. Balay heaved a pretty pass that Brubaker snatched out of the air with a tremendous lc;ap from be..; tween two Irishers to advance to the IS-yard line. There the advance came to grief. 
But even that wouldn't have meant much if the Ram:.:: biers had eliminated several mistakes by the Ramblers;~ Carideo fumbled on Indiana's 8-yard line after running sixty yards following an intercepted pass. But why go into that when it ended as it did.

Notre Da1ne 14 Navy 7 
Going into battle with what was heralded as the greatest Navy team in years, without the hand of their stricken coach, Rockne, a fighting Notre Dame team proved itself more than equal to the task at hand in a manner that cannot be praised too hi~hly. 
Rockne had fallen prey to a painful and dangerous congestion · in his right leg, an ill that was to keep him away from several mor.e games during the season, as he had reluctantly consented to staying home when told by his physicians that the trip to Baltimore would disable him for the rest of the season. 
Navy, with all but two regulars back from the team tha.t had held Notre Dame to a seven-point victory in 1928 was confident of victory. \Vhen the Midshipmen rushed the shock troops off their feet to score in the first quarter, their swagger seemed to

Today, before 80,000 spectators, another great Rockne team that still needs more polishing," rushed and ripped its way through a savage· Navy defense to win by 14 to 7. 
In the first period, Rockne sent in his shock troops with only one regular in the lineup. These shock troops were not quite good enough to hold back a strong Navy team, so the Navr:led, 7 to 0, when the second period opened. But at this point, Tom Lieb, acting for Rockne, who was· sick at his home,· back in Indiana, sent .in another set of flying horsemen. · 
This new stable includes Carideo, Elder, Brill and Mullins. You will hear a lot more about them before the season is over. They .had far more speed and driving power than even a strong Navy defense could handle. They rushed and crashed and zig-zagged their way· for two touch­downs and they threw away at least two inore by fumbles and heavy penalties. 
F-ztmbles, Pe1talties Costly , 

They went through the line like streaks of sunlight, to flash and fade only after substantial gains. They ran the ends and they threw passes all around the lot, but fumbles and penalties killed at least two chances for other. scores. 
The play that led to Notre Dame's first touchdown was one of the finest ever seen on any field. Brill, Mullins and Elder had rushed and passed the ball something like 50 yards to the Navy's 8-yard line. Here the Navy rallied and charged in with such savage fury that the South Bend march was halted for the moment. 
On the .next pla.y, the fourth down, Carideo, who might be another Stuhldreher, stepped back for a forward pass. As he got into position with his arm up, he was knocked to his knees by a Navy forward, two other Navy forwards half covered his body. In the meantime the fleet Elder was running out on a wide slant toward the Navy goal line. After the manner of another Houdini, Carideo in some way worked himself partially free. He wriggled and twisted over to one side, and, still on one knee, he threw a long slanting pass to Elder, who had crossed the goal , line in the corner of the field. It was one of the greatest plays anyone will look upon for a long, long time. 
Carideo l1ttercepts Pass 

It was Carideo again who paved the way for Notre Dame's second touchdown near the close of the third period. He came in like a streak of wind· to intercept Spring's pass and carried it on to Navy's 32-yard· line. Then Brill, another great back, went to work. He hit tackle for seven yards and then circled Navy's end for 17 more. 
This brought the ball to Navy's 8-yard line as the period ended. As the fourth period started, Schwartz and Mul­lins carried the ball to Navy's one-yard line, and on the next play Mullins dived clean over the hard-scrapping Navy defense for the westerners' second score. Carideo kicked· both goals. Rockne put a fast and powerful aggre­gation on the· field when his first string was in operation, and with a little mor~ polishing it will be hard to stop. 
The Navy team this year.is strong but it c:ould not make headway against the South Bend defense when the regulars cam·e in. The battle this afternoon was a riot of noise, color and action. Close to 80,000 people packed the huge stadium and the .wild frenzy of the midshipmen lasted up to the· final play. Bill Ingram has a t'eam that will be hard to beat from this point on, a. well-coached, hard-fighting, aggressive outfit, but he had no chance today against the bewildering speed of Notre Dame with its delayed passes, shifts and quick starting. attack.

JOE SAVOLDI 

Joe Savoldi, a pudgy lad from a place called Three Oaks, Mich.,· probably will become famous as the \X'andering . Italian or some such thing. 
Mr. Joe-wandered around Soldiers' field yesterday like one who came to see all the sights. He saw them, a~d in_ seeing, let 90,000 spectators have a glimpse of a powerful. Notre Dame grid army, 'Yhich marche~ over, around and­through the best resistance that a University of Wisconsin eleven could offer. It wasn't enough by the distance_ of the moon, ·and when the final pistol barked in the haze of· an' Indian summer dusk, Mr.. Joe and his cosmopolitan squad were out in front by 19 to 0. 
The stocky, speedy \X'andering Italian _and the others came to avenge what a Badger team had done to Notre Dame's satellites a year ago. They did it in the rough, driving, relentless nianner you might expect from a Knute Rockne team. No more could be ·asked of them. · 
Sco1'es o1t Loug Ruus 

Savoldi, a sophomore, was~'t alone in his sightseeing, but at least he was the leader. There was a back named Jack Elder who conducted one -goal seeking expedition. There was a large number of other backs who did things. There was an endless string of linesmen. who opened large holes through which the backs could gallop. But the \X'ander­ing Italian from Three Oaks stood out as a bellwether, be­cause h~ not only crossed the Cardinal goal line once, but twice, the first on a forty-yard dash _and the second on a sizzling 71-yard sprint~ 
\X'hat \X'isconsin did against this persistent attack of the Rockne army was nothing.· At the start the Badgers made ·a threat and fumbled when a touchdown· against Notre 
Dame's second string· starting eleven seemed immin:ent. The. break probably was .disheartening. At any rate, the Badgers sagged down. Their line couldn't hold, espe­cially at the tackles. .Their ·backs could make no appreci­ab_le headway.._In. t_he third period they were actually weary. In ·the fourth they pick~d up a bit and threatened~ ~ut t~e threat faded. At best it was only a bid for a con­solation touchdown. 
-Lusby Pu1tts Well 

\X'ith a be_tter line \X'isconsin's b-acks might h~ve gone places arid seen things as did_ the \X'andering I tali an and the dancing Elder. There were times when a youth named Oman, who started and finished for the Badgers, was able to carry on by himself. The energetic _Lusby. was no loafer as a ground gainer or a punter. H. Rebholtz occa:­.·sionally kicked holes in Notre Dame's wall. His brother, : Russell, in-a few spots ran and outkicked the best Notre 
Dame had. But none of this was sustained. The South 
Benders always were ~ble to· stop it after a flurry. This' 
ability to stop things accou~ted for the fact that the vic­
tors had twelve first downs against nine for the Cardinal 
clad. ­
Notre Dame contributed its first bit to the day's damage 
in the middle of. the first quarter. This was when the 
\X'and~ring Italian, who is supposed to be a second stringer, 
shot out of a hole and toured 40 yards to \X'isconsin's goal. 
The next came early in tl~e third quarter, when Elder did 
as Savoldi had done. Elder ripped off 43 yards before he 
quit~ Then a. few minutes later Savoldi exceeded· even 
himself. He raced 71 yards before falling exhausted over . his opponents' goal.

Irish vengeance was obtained and Notre Dame's glorious football traditions upheld before Pittsburgh's greatest sports crowd at the stadium yesterday. Carnegie Tech's most magnificent fight went for naught, when with one lightning thrust the South Bend marvels wiped out the bitter memories of 1926 and 1928 with a third-quarter touchdown and a 7 to 0 triumph over the Scotch. 
The great bowl never saw such sights a's were on display yesterday. Sixty-five thousand maniacs, with divided emo­tions, agreeing in admiration of the splendid drive and co­ordination of the victors, and the soul-stirring, never-say­die battle of the vanquished. 
Thrilling to the sparkling runs of the elusive Elder, the wild plunging of the jumping Joe Savoldi and keen-:­minded generalship and remarkable· kicking of Carideo, and the wonderful defensive display by Jack Cannon: 
It was a great te:;tm that· Knute Rockne sent onto the field yesterday, a team that was ready to go to the very brink for the man who sat helpless in a wheel chair by the side lines. 
Peerless Notre Dame 

Rock-bound line, impregnable ends, a b~ck:field whose motto was .. ever forward." Keen direction,-ability to give as well as take, a seizing of the one big opportunity. That was Notre Dame yesterday-the peerless team, fit succes­sor to all that have gone before. · 
All ho~or to the lads who could face it without flinch­ing, fight it back until the issue remained in doubt to the very end, and stay on their feet uritil the finish. Elder the winged-foot, the ghost, flitting through a broken :field. until he placed the oval in position of Savoldi's inspired plunging. 
Savoldi a Hero 

Savoldi, who took up the burden of scoring the touch­down, single-handed, dived over a massed defense, with reckless disregard of personal injury, until, one last chance remaining, he· catapulted through the air yards off the ground, and tallied a hard-won touchdown. 
Such wild line bucking. had seldom been seen here, , nor has Carnegie's desperate efforts. to stop the Notre :Qame dervish. As often. as Savoldi left his feet in his onward rush, so did the Plaid linemen rise to meet him. 
Four times he sailed into space. .Three times . he was met head-on, and brought to earth. But each time he wa·s gaining precious inches. On the final attempt the Tartans could not bat him down quickly enough, and over he went. That.was enough to win, for Carideo remained master of the situation the rest of the game. 
Notre Dame was pushing forward again as th~ game ended, having worked their way clear to the Plaid 3 2 at the close. · 
They might have gone over again with another five minutes. · 
As .Elder dived at left tackle for the last play of the game, he was stopped under a pile of red-jersied figures. 
It was Carnegie fighting .to the end. 
Beaten by a better team. 
But defeat with honor.

lutematioual News Service Feature 
Grant Field, Atlanta., Ga., Nov. 2.-Eclipsing even their own previous record for brilliance, Notre Dame rallied here this afternoon to defeat Georgia Tech's Jackets, 26 to 6. It was a great team, that bunch of fighting Irishmen from up South· Bend way. They flashed an offense that was dazzling and on the defense they were concentrated poison. 
Tech's Lead Brief 

For a few brief and fleeting moments the 35,000 fans were treated to the thrill of Tech leading Notre Dame. But it was only a temporary lead.· Those Irishmen gathered themselves together and set grimly to their task. 
Neither team scored in the first quarter, although Notre Dame launched a drive from its own 20-yard line and sus­tained it to the very shadows of Tech's goal. There it was beaten down and broken up by the valiant efforts of the Jackets. 
About the middle of the second quarter Mullins fumbled and Maree recovered for Tech on Notre Dame's 19-yard line. The Jackets wheeled into the midst of an offensive that netted them their· only score. 
Both Teams Offside 

Mizell bucked ·the ball out of bounds and Thomason was held to a yard at center. Then Mizell passed to Jones, lacking a foot ·of a first down. Both teams were offside on· the next play, but Thomasa~ plunged into the thick of the Irish line and when they measured, Tech had its first down on the 9-yard line. 
Thomason and Mizell were. stopped in their line th~usts and Tech again was fo'rced into the air~ This time the Jackets completed a pass on the one-yard line. Dunlap sacrificed· two yards bucking out of bounds. Thomason in two plays' finally forced his way over .. It was Tech 6; . Notre Dame 0. 
Two plays after the kick-off, Notre Dame tied the 
\¥Triter 

score and, with a burst of brilliance that stunned the fans, Brill ran 28 yards to return the kick to his own 40-yard line. Mullins went off right tackle for six yards, finally being stopped by Maree and Mizell. 
Then Elder, the great Notre Dame back, broke off right tackle, squirmed through a field of would-be tacklers and raced 53 yards for a touchdown. 
Cmmo1t Blocks 

Just before the half ended Cannon partially blocked 
Mizell's punt and it was Notre Dame's ball. on Tech's 31­yard line. The Irish found the going rough. Losing a yard on two tries at the line, they trie~ a long pass, but it failed. Then Tech was penalized five yards and the Irish derived enough encouragement from· that to complete a pass on Tech's two-yard line. It went Carideo to Conley. Mullins on his first try 'bucked the ball oyer for a touch­. down and again Carideo failed to make the extra point. But· it didn't matter; Notre Dame ·w.as out in front to 
s·tay. 

Notre Dame scored one touchdown .in ~he third period. and added another in the fourth for good measure. In the third the scoring came when Carideo took a punt on his own 25-yard line and ran 75 yards to score. This time the Irish annexed· the extra.·.Po~nt and. were ahead~ 19 to 6. Carideo kicked for the extra point. 
N.D. Gets Last Score .. 

Early in the fourth quarter· a. l5~ya~d'penalty threw the Jackets back to their own 11-yard line and on four· plays Notre Daine wound up its· scodng. This time· it was Schwartz wlio bucked through: the· line and wiggled· eight yards for ·the touchdown.. _The try· for the extra: point was good and Notre Dame had· its victory margin, 26 to 6.

Last year when Freddy Collins broke his arm, Coach Rockne gave Larry Mullins his big chance with the varsity· against Drake. His work, you will recall, was phenomenal. 
This year, ..Moon" just carried on from where he had left off last season. His line bucks, his passes, his end runs, his remark­able open field work, and his outstanding defensive play were cli~axed when he whisked himself 23 yards through a broken field to cross the goal standing up for Notre Dame's final touchdown against the Bull­dogs. 
Larry averaged better than seven yards each time he took the ball in this battle.

LARRY uMOON" MULLINS 
For three periods, a stubborn, desperate little band of Drake university footballers actually outscored the best that the mighty Ramblers of Notre Dame had to offer in the way of shock troopers and regulars, too, yesterday at Soldier Field, but it was not enough. 
The final score was: Notre Dame 19; Drake, 7; but it 
fails to indicate the desperate fury of the Bulldogs' stand· 
during the first three periods of the ball game. Drake _led 
7 to 6 at the end of the third period, and the game which 
Mr. Knute K. Rockne had scheduled perhaps to give his 
Ramblers a ubreak" in a tough schedule, a ..breather" for 
his troops,-held the 50,000 spectators breathless with 
anxiety. 
The regulars, with Larry Mullins, Marty Brill, Jack 
Elder and Frank Carideo operating as the ball carriers, had 
done no better than hold their own against the dogged 
Drake warriors during the third period and things began to 
look a bit alarming for the Notre Dame followers.

Then came the perfect football play, with Elder, who 
had been staggering around previously without going any­
where in particular, sprinting over. the line with what later· 
proved to be the winning touchdown. Notre Dame, once 
in the lead, put the ..crusher" on thereafter and before the 
game ended compiled another touchdown. 
Larry Mullins, the Pasadena Paralyzer, wa'i the author 
of this score, after a s·mash through center had carried him 
into an open field and some beautiful open. field running 
had enabled him to sprint 23 yards over the Drake goal

Drake, with the Rambler shock troopers forming the opposition, got a break shortly after the game got under way, ·when Al Howard fumbled and an unidentified Bull­dog clutched and recovered the bounding oval on Notre Dame's 40-yard line.

direction of Notre Dame's goal line by reeling off 8 yards 
on a delayed buck. He w:as on the Irish 28-ya~d line be­

Bulldogs Take Lead 

Van Katen and King made it first down on the two­yard line on three smacks at the line. Van Katen was stopped dead on his next attempt, but his next try carriea him over the goal line and Captain Jack Barnes place kicked for the extra point without delay to give his teaqt a 7 to 0 lead. · · ·

Getting Ready For The Trojans 

In this season of superlatives-you know, the toughest team playing the hardest · schedule before the largest crowds-it would certainly be an oven:ight of the highest order to omit mention of the greatest "pep week" in Notre Dame hist~ry. 
Surpassing in size and noise made even the great week of "Army game pep" in 1928, the 1929 Southern Cali­fornia game enthusiasm exposition started on Tuesday be­fore the Soldier Field battle, was climaxed on Thursday, and anti-climaxed on the day of the game itself. Jerry_ Parker, aided by the Student Activities council and the Blue Circle, supervised this mammoth week-long cele­bration. 
The first official "Rockne Day" in Notre Dame history wa$ observed on Tuesday with a special Mass in Sacred Heart Church, a torch-light parade, and. individual hall cheering. \Y/ednesday was largely a day of organization with the various halls bringing in ·lumber by the truck­load for Thursday's gigantic fire. In the afternoon it was decided that Sophomore hall's 30-foot pile contained more inflammable material than the equally high Off-Campus heap and both were given silver loving cups symbolical of first and second places, respectively. 
\Y/illing workers fell to immediately and gathered all the wood into one great heap surrounded by railroad ties and telephone poles, soaked the whole with crude oil, and waited for Thursday evening to come. After dinner, on this history-making night, the band went the rounds of the halls and students fell in behind until all 3,000 were on hand with some 5,000 townspeople at the scene of the blaze. A match was touched to the oil-soaked wood and soon ever-mounting tongues of flame were licking the sky. 

As at all well-organized pep meetings, the band played, the crowd sang and cheered, alumni talked, and everyone had a fine time. If you don't believe this, cast a glance on the picture below taken from the speakers' stand. 
. Elaborate plans, some of which were carried out, were laid out for the game itself. Students in two sections of the Soldier Field stands were supplied with many-hued cards and instruction slips telling them what card and color to liold up when a certain number was flashed by the stunt leader. In this way, the two sections were to form a Trojan Horse, a four-leaf clover, various greetings, and some silent cheers. 
In the excitement of the moment, however, (the mo­ment when Tom Conley tied the score with his touch­down) the boys became excited and filled with the desire to throw something aloft. Hats cost money and the cards were free, so up went the pasteboards, sailing about in a maelstrom of riotous color much like giant, tinted snow­flakes.· It was tough for the stunt committee, but the impromptu demonstration really looked, as one young feminine fan exclaimed "very swelL" 
The parading of the band and the ~elease of many col­

·ored balloons and white pigeons from a. gigantic drum also added their bit to the pagentry of the game. It was a grea·t week and its result certainly justified. its being. Those cynics who don't believe in student demonstrations might refer to the score at the top of the page after next and be converted to the right cause. ·

Notre Datne 13 Southern California 12 
Perhaps Notre Dame and Southern California are not the two best football teams in the world, but to say that they were on the afternoon of November 16 is to digress very little, if any, from the absolute truth. 
Every move they made was flawless, exact. They incorpor­ated into one thrilling hour everything that stands for football. They played hard, clean football all the way through, never ask­ing any quarter, never complaining on breaks of the game, never disputing a decision-just fighting for all they were worth and loving· it.

·The 1929 renewal of the Army-Notre Dame game, which has became THE classic of football, saw a glorious climax to a. glori­ous Notre Dame season. 
The Cadets rose far above anything they had done previously and battled to the end like true soldiers in a vain attempt to overcome the lone score of the da.y made on Jack Elder's brilli­ant run in the second quarter. 
Both lines were i~ there fighting as they had never battled before, Army with its Perry and Messinger and Notre Dame with its Cannon and Twomey standing out head and shoulders above .the two struggling masses.

Yankee Stadium, New York, Nov. 30.-A briiliant dash along the field by Jack Elder, fleet Notre Dame half, who intercepted a forward pass on his goal line and ran for a touchdown, gave the Irish a. 7 to 0 victory over Army today, and crowned the South Bend eleven, unbeaten and untied, as the grca~cst of the 1929 season. 
Snatching the ball from the hands of a waiting Army end, Elder churned the frozen gridiron with flying cleats, sprin tin'g past the baffled Cadets 1 0 0 yards to cross the goal line. Frank Caridco, Notre Dame's All-American quarter-back, booted a placement goal for the extra point. 
Aside from this one amazing play which swept the Irish to victory the two teams fought each other to a standstill before 85,000 spectators in Yankee stadium this bitterly cold afternoon. 
. Red Cagle Stm·s 

Captain Christian (Red) Cagle, was the outstanding star of the game offensively and defensively, but even he could not get free of an alert Irish secondary defense. 
Jack Cannon, Notre Dame's great guard, stamped him­self as a certain All-American choice by his great play on both defensive and offensive. Playing without a headgear, he was in more than half of the plays in the game. 
The break of the game came in the middle of the second· quarter. Cagle and Johnny Murrell had ripped up the Notre Dame .line and carried the ball to the Irish 19-yard line at the start of the period, but there the stubborn South Bend defense proved impregnable and the Cadets lost the ball on downs.. After three tries at the \'Vest Point line had been· stopp~d without gains, Carideo dropped back to punt. 
George \'Vashington Perry, Army's 207-pound right tackle, broke through the line and pushed Jack Elder into Carideo just as the Notre Dame quarter-back got his kick away. The ball bounded crazily over the frozen turf and went to the Army on the Irish 13-yard line. 

. Sc1·eam of Delight 

Cagle tried the line and then Murrell, but only two yards were gained. Then. the Army captain dropped back to the Irish 3 0-yard line and flung a long pass tg Carlmark, who was waiting on the Notre Dame goal line. There was a scream of delight from the Army side of the field as it seemed that a touchdown would follow. 
One did,-but it was not the Army which scored it. Cut­ting over in front of Ca.rlmark, Jack Elder leaped high into the air as though to knock down the pass, but landed on his ·feet with the ball in his arms. Side-stepping three Cadets who flung themselves at him, Elder cut over. to the west side lines which he reached at his 20-yard line. There were many Army men, dashing toward him by this time and there was no hint of what was to follow. 
\'Vith one eye carefully cocked on the white chalk mark 
-beyond which he might not step, Elder opened up with ·a burst of speed similar to those which carried· him to inter.:. collegiate sprint honors on the cinder path. He 4as cov­ered 100 yards in better than ten seconds many times, but it never meant as much to Notre Dame as his· 100-yard dash did today. Now and then Elder had to slow up and side-step to let a Cadet tackler ·past him, but when he re1clied mid-field he was free of the packand had Gaptain Johnny Law running beside him for protection. He crossed the Army goal line standing up. After Carideo had kicked the ·goal for the extra point there was never a semblance of . a score by either side.

Considering the class of opposition the team met this fall, this mythical eleven, picked from Notre Dame's nine foes, might well be called an All-American one. It is not hard to select eleven men from the Indiana, Navy, \X'isconsin, Carnegie Tech, Georgia Tech, Drake, Southern California, N orthwestcrn, and Army teams that will stack up with almost any All-American outfit in the country, but, of course, there are objections to putting the na­tional rather than "opponent" label on our selections. 
Notre Dame did not play everyone in the country and there are players with other unbeaten teams, like Sleight of Purdue, Donchess of Pittsburgh, and Ackerman of St. Mary's, who are almost the unanimous choice of the ex-. perts for national honors. Then, .too, Notre Dame did not play itself and we arc forced to leave off men like Carideo and Cannon who really belong with the All-American stars. 
But, as we· said, we think we. have a team here that will compare favorably with most of the "all" teams and that could give good account of itself in a-game with any of them. In picking our All-Opponent team, we were guided not only by our own observations, but by the suggestions of the Notre Dame players themselves and of Notre Dame scouts who saw these foes in action practically every week. 
The outstanding work of Capt. Chris Cagle, of Army, in all games this year, and especially in the llliriois, Yale, and Army games, which Army lost, stamps him as tbe out­standing back of the country. A_s leader of the Cadets he combined all that is great in football: a keen insight on the garrie, ability to perform every function of the half-back, and especially a spirit of. pcrsevercnce against th~ most disheartening breaks of the game. He always-carried· on and was never discouraged. \X'e arc honored to name him captain of our star opponent team. 
His mates, George Perry at right tackle, and Edwin Messinger at right end, were the only two among our opponents to make any consistent hea~way against the powerful left side of the Notre Dame line made up of Cannon, Twomey, and Colrick or Collins. It was Perry that pushed Elder into Carideo's kick in the game this Fall to bring about Ariny's greatest touchdown threat of the day. He and Messinger st<?_ppcd every attempt' to pierce the right side of the Army line and together 'they make an ideal combination. One without the other would not be as effective as they were· during the season just passed. 
Russell Saunders, second probably only to our own Frank Carideo as a field general, gets the call at quarter­back. His all-around, heady and consistent play during the season makes him real All-American timber. His greatest feat was his 95-yard return of a kickoff against Notre Dame that almost put Southern California in a tie with Rockne's men. · Francis Tappaan, his teammate ,at left end, is a wing­man of almost unanimous All-American choice. \X'hen we asked the Notre Dame tackles, ends, and half-backs who the greatest end they met during the season was, their re­ply was always instantanco_us and decisive, "Tappaan." The New Four Horsemen had more trouble taking him out of their sweeping end runs than any other flankman in the country. 
Dick Nesbitt, of. Drake, finished his career with the Bulldogs this season as one of the best right half-backs in the country. Playin·g without a .. headgear at all times, he won the respect of the Notre Dame team and those who saw him play on the merits of· his ·all-around ability and real Bulldog spirit. His passing was a constant threat, his excellent punts, which avcra.ged over 50 yards, and his hard, clever running, which brought him an average of nearly four yards, stamp him as a great ·player, one worthy of the. All-American honors he would get if playing with a more prominent club. . 
Another Drake man, \X'aldo Don Carlos, although not heard of much in All-American circles, was the sparkplug of a ·fighting Drake line that held Notre Dame's best at bay for three hard quarters and that won another Missouri Valley Conference title. Of him, Tim· Moynihan, Notre Dame's center who met some of the best pivot men in the country says,. ((Don Carlos is the best center I· played against all year." An. accurate passer, he was an aggressive defensive man and was ·always -down on· punts.· · 
From Carnegie Tech's' stone wall line we pick two of the Gibralter rocks who gave Notre Dame such resistance at Pittsburgh. , They are the Skibos' fiery leader .and right guard, John Dreshar, and left tackle John Highberger. In the Notre .Dame game they were constantly causing trouble both on offense and defense and in Tech's other contests_ they were superb· in all departm.ents of the game. 
A full-back's job is to pick up small· yardage when 
needed, to block, and to back up the line on defense. In

Feg M·urray Votes For Notre ·Datne 

By FEG MuRRAY 

(Editor's Note: This tribute by Mr. Muruy is reproduced here through the courtesy o£ Mr. Murray himself, the Metropolitan Newspaper Service, :and the South Bend Nt"rvs-Timt"s in which it appeared December 6.) 
..The End of the Trail!" But how different from James Earle Fraser's famous statue of that name, with the half­clad Indian bent -low over his tired horse out of the snowy, wind-swept plain! The Horseman of Notre Dame ~nd his steed, Rambler, are both tired, to be sure, and they came 
.to the end of the trail on an icy, ·wind-swept field, but it was a trail that lead to victory, and so both horse and ~ider are proud and happy. The lorig, long trail that began last Oct. 5, only ended on Nov. 30 with Notre Dame's toughest game of all, against an inspired Army team, and don't kid yourself that the Irish's job of keeping thei~ slate clean against the eleven Biff Jones thre·w.at them, aft~r playing eight hard games in a row, was any easy task. 
That 95-yard dash of Jack Elder's was~'t just a..break," and who can tell what Rockne's men might have uncovered had they not got" those precious seven points through that lucky (for them) pass of Cagle's? 
I think that Notre Dame is deserving of the 1929 Na­tional Football Championship because the Rocks of South Bend went through the toughest nine-game schedule any team in the land faced, without losing or tying a game. 
Notre Dame's First Football Team 
By JOHN E. BERGAN 

Standing, left to right: J. J. Hepburn, end; George Houck, tackle; Edward Hawkins, guard; Frank Fehr, center; Patrick 
J. Nclso, guard; E. P. Melady, tackle; F. H. Springer, end. Seated, left to right: H. M. Jewett, half-back; J. E. Cusack, quarter-back; H. B. Luhn, coach, captain and half-back; and Ed Prudhomme, full-back. , 
The great football team representing Notre Dame this year with its squad of 100 men can turn its eyes backward to the one representing the Blue and Gold in 1887, the year of the inception of football at Notre Dame, to the time when eleven men composed the football team because there were but eleven suits in the University. 
·At a meeting held in Brownson hall in March, 1887, ten students of the University decided that the school should be represented by a football team. The suggestion was approved and Brother Joachim was petitioned to provide the team with a football. He tried but his efforts were in vain, for there was not a pigskin to be had about the campus or in the city of South Bend. He did not know how to make one (nearly everything was made in th~ community in those days) so an order was sent to Chicago for the ball. The finances for the ball were raised by pop­ular subscription and from the treasury of the literary society. The ball did not arrive for two weeks and when it did come its owners were disappointed in its shape which resembled that of a modern basketball. 

The organizers were undaunted by the brisk weather of March and began active practice for the organization of Notre Dame's first varsity. Fifteen fellows answered the call for candidates for the team but only eleven men were given suits. 
Weeks of practice followed and by the middle of April a fair team represented the student body on the gridiron. The field then was on the present location of the Hoynes College of Law. Two rocks formed the outside bound­aries and two trees served as the goals. Later, two old poles formed the goal so that kicks might be made. A rail fence was erected and served as the outside marker and as bleachers when the game became dull to the spectators. 
During the days of practice there would never be enough men on the :field for an opposing team, so innocent by-standers were grafted into practice so that the team could have its workout. Whether these men knew how to pla.y the game did not matter. They needed no suits as the. uniforms worn by the varsity were much like baseball suits of ~oday, cotton stockings completed the attire. Headgears, shoulder pads, and cleats were unheard of and a noseguard was occasionally used. 
Practicing with men of their own school became dull and much clamor was rife· as to carding a regular game with some other school or some team from the neighbor­ing city of South Bend. Harry Luhn, who captained :the team and acted as coach, booked a game with the strong Shamrock A~ C., of South Bend. 
The game was, indeed, a gory affair. It was played on Notre Dame's home field and turned out to be a bitterly fought contest. 
Before the. game, the rumor was circulated at Notre Dame that the South· Bend bunch had been boasting that they were coming out to clean Notre Dame so well that there would not be anything left. These rumors were so rife that the home team rooters came well armed and the officials from South Bend failed to put in an appearance. In their places were chosen the-Villagers' cheer-leader, who acted as referee, and John Burke, janitor of Brownson hall, wh() was umpire.. 
The game certainly had its arguments and disputes. It lasted fully two hours and a half. Notre Dame finally managed to win, 8 to 4, Joe Cusack scoring one touch­down and Luhn the other. The contest was particularly hard on the string of substitutes, for men were laid out with astounding regularity. Only very open and conspicu­ous slugging was noted by the officials. Notre Dame finished the game with ·nine men, all of whom were com­pletely and beautifully battered. up. 
Two regular games were "played with Michigan later that year, but the light and inexperienced team ·could not cope with the heavy, aggressive Wolver~nes and succumbed by scores of 24 to 6 and 4 to 0. _However, the team did some very fine playing and merited much comment from the boys of Michigan. 
·In these games there were no mass formations, even the uflying wedge" was unheard of then. Kic~ing and end runs were the plays most frequently used. 
. . 

The fo.otball at Notre Dame had gained quite an im­petus and by the next year Notre Dame won the champion­ship of Indiana and Illinois by defeating the ·Harvard school, of Chicago, 20 to 0. This game. was played at Notre Dame and was witnessed by 500 people, the largest crowd ever to view an athletic contest in the state ·of Indiana. Prudhomme, the full-back,· and Fehr," the cen­ter-rusher, were the stars of this fra.y and accounted ·for all of Notre Da.me's ·points. The tackling. in this game was vicious but no· slugging was noted; Forty-five minute periods were played and South Bend men did the officiating.

Thirteen Receive Hering· Medal· Contest A wards 
One of the big events of spring practice at Notre Dame is the awarding of the Frank A. Hering medals for pro­ficiency in various departments. Mr. Hering, donor of the medals, was captain at Notre Dame in 1897 and coach at the ~arne time. He continued his coaching activities dur­ing the next two years and since then has been one of the most loyal of the many dyed-in-the-wool fans. 
Thirteen medals were given this year in the following departments of the game to the following players: 
Punting-Eddie O'Brien. 
Place-Kicking-Clarence Kaplan. 
Passing-Marchmont Schwartz. 

Pass Defense-Emmett Murphy. Pass Receiving-Alfred Grisanti. Center Passing-Thomas Y arr. Full-backs Taking Ends in-Paul O'Connor. Quarter-backs Taking Out Secondary-Norbert Christ-

Rockne-Trained Coaches Have ·Good Year 
ByJOSEPH s. PETRITZ 
· The increased use of the Rockne system of football has enlarged the demand fo.r coaches· trained by the old master until the list of mentors who received ·their scho-oling ·at Notre Da.me has become the most important in college cir­cles· toda:y: Bcsid~s tho~e at: various high schools and prep institutions;throughout the country,over 75 .for_iner.wearers of the Blu.e and Gold are .instructing university and college teams i!l :t~e finer points. of the popular Fall sport. . 
.That .thi~. dem;nd. is-justified is .shown by. a. gl~nce over the.long list of su_cccsses ·these men have made during their c:arcers and especially this.past season.· It is not uncqmmon t~ see ~s manyas three or four former stars from the Rockne stables o~ the same c~ach_ing staff; in fact, it is quite the r:u~e rather than. the. exception-where any Notre D~me men are employed. 
Right here at Notre Dame, Tom Lieb, Jack Chevigny, Ike Voedisch, and Bill Jones, handled the 1929 champions during a most rigorous season. Lieb and Chevigny had charge _of the team in six of its nine games and brought it through all' of them without a slip. Voedisch has de­veloped a set· of ends that can take its place with any in the country, and Jones has helped Tommy Mills build up one of the best Freshmen squads in Notre Dame history. 
The story of how Jimmy Phelan, '26, upset the pro­verbial dope bucket all over the Big Ten-or Big Nine as it may be called now-to win Purdue's first conference championship is certainly one for the books. He attributes a large share of credit for this showing t.o Noble Kizer, guard on the Four Horsemen team of 1924, and Mel Edwards, another former Rockne star. Purdue wasn't given an outside chance at the beginning of the season, but. had the conference crown cinched a week before the sea­son ended and by finishing its schedule undefeated, made a claim to national honors second only ·to Notre Dame's. 
In addition to Kizer, every member of the championship 

Four Horsemen eleven is passing on to posterity the tricks of the system that won him undying fame. Harry Stuhldreher, quarter-back, is now doing big things as head coach at Villanova college in Pennsylvania, where he is assisted by Ed Hunsinger, who teamed with him at right end. Bob Regan, of the famous 1924 shock troops; is also giving Harry a hand as an assistant coach. Their team . won from such strong opponents as Oglethorpe, Loyola, Catholic U., and Duke, and tied with Boston college during 
_the past season. 
Don Miller, 'right half Horseman, is backfield coach at Ohio State now after his three successful years at Georgia Tech, and Edgar Miller, right tackle with the Seven Mules, is an assistant coach at Navy. Elmer Layden, full-back, and J~e Bach, left tackle, have charge of the strong Duquense eleven that showed a· distinctive Notre Dame trait, perseverance, by marching 90 ya.rds in the last two minutes of play to tie a stubborn \Vfest Virginia team this Fall. 
Jimmy uSleepy" Crowley got off to a promising start at Michigan State where he took up the reins of head coach this Fall. uchuck" Collins, left end, has charge of the gridiron destinies of North Carolina. university and is being assisted by Bill Cerney, shock trooper of 1929. The Chapel Hill boys knocked off such aggregations as Georgia Tech, last year's national champions, Virginia Poly, North Caro­lina State, South Carolina, and Davidson, losing_ to Georgia by only one touchdown. 
Adam W-alsh, captain and All-American center, and John Weibel, left guard in the Seven Muie team, arc assistant coaches. The former is at Yale and the latter at Vanderbilt. \Vfalsh went to the Bulldogs this year fr~m Santa Clara, where he ~as head coach during a successful regime, and was the first outsider in some time to join the all-Yale staff of mentors. The work of his powerful line, which the critics say improved 50 per cent this year, was largely rcsponsibl~ for a gratifying season that saw one of th~ Blue's hardest schedules in· history. 
The team they arc talking about out West is little St. Mary's which one writer has termed, uthe Notre Dame of the Coast," and which has just completed a highly com­. mendable season that saw its goal line uncrossed and that makes St. M~ry's a potential ~ember of a. big four, consist­ing of California, Stanford and Southern California. This team is coached by Ed uSlip" Madigan, who finished his playing career here in 1920 and who is assisted by Frank 
Andrc~s of the 1918 eleven. I 
Another big team from a small school on the coast is Santa Clara, who held St. Mary's to a 6 to 0 score and beat Stanford this ~cason for the second time in three years. Maurice uclipper" Smith, another Rockne pupil, has charge here and is assisted by Larry Shaw, a Notre Dame man. 
Harry Mehre, '22, head coach, and Frank Thomas, '23, assistant mentor, pulled their Georgia eleven along at a fast clip this year and beat, among oth~rs, Yale with Adam \Vfalsh's line and all, Chuck Collin's North Carolina boys, ~nd Georgia Tech. 
\X'hile Gus Dorais didn't learn his football from Rockne, 
he did learn it with him on the team that startled the· foot­
ball world with the Rockne-Dorais forward pass combina­
tion, and he is assisted by Harvey Brown, captain in 1924, 
and John Frederick, '28, in the gridiron instruction business 
at Detroit university. His teams won 21 straight games up 
until they met the Oregon Aggies this year and they lost 
by only one touchdown, 14 to 7, when their winning 

streak was broken. ·Their long list of victories started ·just after Notre Dame had beaten them in ·1927. ..Hunk" Anderson, '22, who helped ..Rock" for four years a.t ·the beginning of his coaching career, has the situ­ation well under control at St. Louis university with his Notre Dame helpers, the famous Christy Flanagan of 1926, and .. Chili" \X'alsh, '2 8. ..Hunk", Christy and .. Chili" work with the line, backs, and ends, respectively, and their 
Billikins managed to take the count of Oglethorpe, South 
Dakota State, and Coe during t~e course of an off season. 
Gene Oberst, '24, and Forest Fletcher, track star who 
finished in '12, guide the \X'ashington and Lee Pres~dents 
in their pigskin activities; Chet \X'ynne, '22, and John 
McMullan, '26, handle the fate of Creighton's el~ven; Joe 
Boland, guard in '25 and '26, and his teammate, Frank 
Mayer, are at the College of St. Thom.as in St. Paul, 
Art Bergman, '20, is an assistant in the same. town at 
Minnesota university; and Harry O'Boyle and Luke Kelly 
help out at Holy Cross. . 
There are some 3 5 or 40 others, both head coaches and assistants, in la.rge and small colleges throughout the country who helped t~ put Rockne football on the map and who are doing much to keep it there with their own teams. And don't forget ..King Knute" the teacher of teachers who showed this brilliant array of mentors the fundamentals of the game that they all love so much and teach so thoroughly. 
Although flat on his back during the major portion .of the season his influence was felt strongly and will be as long as his pupils stick to. the principles h~ taught them. Most of his men consistently are successful, a few of them are not, but they can't go wrong if they stick to the ad­vice he gave them when they were playing for him.

By LAWRENCE PERRY  
A  picture-Notre  Dame arrives  in  Pittsburgh.  The  

Union station is crowded. A band of clear-eyed, well set­up young men debouch from the train. Two red caps, headed by a policeman push a wheel-chair through the crowd. The team stands waiting as Tom Lieb, a sculp­tured specimen of humanity, appears on the car platform bearing in his arms a chunk of a man with brown ·slouched hat pulled down over his eyes. 
Several players rush to the car steps but Lieb shakes his head. He is doing the job alone. He steps down to the platform and gently seats his burden in the wheel-chair. Rockne! A little fluttering cheer goes up. 
A motor car awaiting at the door. Lieb lifts his old teacher and now his chief into the car. The door slams. 
Now the' Pittsburgh Athletic Association. Sixth floor. An ante-room filled with men talking quietly and smoking. A physician comes out of a bedroom. . 
..Rock will see you and you and you," the medic says, singling out the lucky persons. . 
On the bed, in yellow and cream striped pajamas, reclines Knute. At one side a magazine. On the other a box of cigars. He is smoking a cigar. His face has the bloom of health and his blue eyes were never more blue, neve: more clear. · 
Now comes a group of new stories which shall not be told here because Knute will want to spring them·at dinners and -so forth later and it would be a crime to take the bloom off . 
Later. A· motor car rolling to the Notre Dame bench. Tom Lieb. lifting Rockne into his wheel . chair where throughout the game he sits like some incapacitated Napoleon. But brain still working. Later still. The car swallowed in the midst of cheering, gyrating ·Notre Damians.

Chapel Car Used on . Baltimore Trip 

So that their hurried return trip from the Navy game 
at Baltimore might not be without its Sunday Mass, the 
Notre Dame team was supplied with a traveling church 
in the form of a chapel car. 
Playing every game on the road, these God-fearing boys 
had to rush home each week in order to be ready for their 
next trip. Sometimes they heard Mass after getting honie, 
other times, they stopped on the way or, as at Chicago, 
they observed the ~ord's Day before leaving for the cam­
pus. \Vhen they left Baltimore Saturday night after the 
game, they were stumped for a while, but the Baltimore 
& Ohio railroad company came to. their rescue Sunday 
morning. · 
\Vhen the entourage reached \Villard, Ohio, the mobile 
church, which is shown above, was hooked onto their train 
and they enjoyed the unusual experience of hearing Mass 
en route. The chapel car contains everything essential to 
celebration of the Mass;· and everything is of the finest 
material that the great Pullman company could find. The 
car was built for the use of many of the highest digni­
taries of the Catholic Church who attended the Eucharistic 
Congress iri Chicago. 
Mass for the team was celebrated by Rev. William 
Maloney, C. S. C., registrar of the university, who accom­
panied the team to Baltimore, with special permission from 
His Excellency, Most Reverend Pietro Fumasonu-Biondi, 
Apostolic delegate in Washington, D. C. 
Since this unusual incident, authorities of the University 

have received numerous letters from all parts of the couri­.try complimenting the school of Our Lady on the won­derful example her sons gave to the youth of America on 
this and other occasions. 
They come from all over to pla.y under Rockne. In the first string back field, we find Carideo, from Mt. Vernon, 
N. Y., Elder from Lebanon, Ky., Mullins from Pasadena, Calif., and Brill from Philadelphia, Pa. In the line we have Colrick from New Jersey, Twomey from Minnesota, Can­non from Ohio, Moynihan from Chicago, Law from Yonk­ers, N. Y., Donoghue from Auburn, N. Y., and Vezie from Pennsylvania. 
c:cThe Fighting Irish" 
ByT. VINCENTMclNTIRE 

The term .. Fighting Irish" has been applied to Notre 
Dame football teams for years. It first attached itself 
years ago when the· school, comparatively unknown, sent 
its athletic· team away to play in another city. Sports 
writers used the term in an ironical, unsympathetic way. 
At that time ..Fighting Irish" held no glory or prestige. It 
was given by sports writers in the same sense that the crowd 
would give a head of cabbage to a ..ham" actor. 
The years passed swiftly and t_he little school began to 
take a place in the sports world. Journalists suddenly 
woke to find the cabbage transferred into a beautiful bou­
quet of shamrocks. The ..ham" actor no longer took his 
bow to an indifferent audience but answered the 'curtain to 
an enthusiastic crowd. ccFighting Irish" took on a new 
meaning. The unknown of a few years· past had boldly 
taken a place among the leaders. The unkind appellation 
became symbolic of the struggle for supremacy in the field. 
. ..Fighting Irish!" Recall the associations of the. term. 
Think of John T. Mitchell, Robert Emmett, \Vol£ Tone, or 
Edward Fitzgerald, fighting Irish all! Review the strug­
gles qf an indomitable race crushed under the cruel heel of 
an empire's boot. \Vhat does the term imply? Does it 
not recall the Easter of 1916, when sixteen «fighting Irish" 
were backed against a wall in Dublin barracks and shot to 
death? Doe~ it not recall the gallant struggle for existence 
while famine and foreign law clutched savagely at the 
throats of a stricken but unconquered Ireland? 
The term while given in irony has become our heritage. 
The implications of ..Fighting Irish" are too much like our own struggles for recognition to be so easily ignored. We are criticised on _every side for using the term but the critics gave us the name. They too, see that it has more than one application. Too late they seek to retract what they gave in irony a few years ago. ·Realizing that the name CCFighting Irish" has taken a significance they never _dreamed of, they now seek to disparage us ·again by other terms. ..\Vandering Nomads" we are called...Ramblers," uGalloping Gaels,'.' and uFighting Irish-Italians" are made · use of to describe us. None of the terms stick. We hope they will not. One by . one, the sports writers will come 
back grudgingly to the old name. 
The ethnologists object to the name on the grounds that 
the Irish are in the minority on the football team. ·The 
Savoldis, Carideos, and the Schwartz's, they say, are not 
Irish, and so are not fighting Irish. For that matter Yale 
'teams are not c~Bulldogs," Wisconsin players are not 
UBadgers," or Northwestern uwildcats." Our name is 
merely an identifying one which has been glorified on many 
a field of battle. So truly does it represent us that we are 
unwilling to part with it. With the Moynihans, the Leahys, 
the Cannons, and the Collins' to justify the name, let us 
go down through history as the .. Fighting Irish" of Notre 
Dame. The term is our legacy, won by grim unyielding . struggle. The name honors us. . Let us honor the name. And we are sure the Eichenlaubs and the Rocknes, the Eggemans and the Stuhldrehers of the past will be with us; and, too, the Carideos and the Schwartz's and the Savoldis of the present generation.·

86 OFFICIAL FOOTBALL. REVIEW-1929 I 
! 

In the Spiri~ of St. Francis Xavier 
Here at Notre Dame, we take our football seriously. That doesn't mean \Vall street fashion, as a betting propo­sition; or Carnegie-Report fashion, as paramount to other interests; or C. C. Pyle fashion, as work instead of play. To recall to your minds just wha-t football means to Notre Dame, we reprint a couple of paragraphs frorp the Bulletin of October 8: · 
..Notre Dame football is a spiritual service because it­is played for the honor-and glory of God and the exaltation of his Blessed Mother. \Vhen St. Paul said, c\Vhether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all for the glory of God,' he included football as well as everything else that is not sinful; and when we make our morning offering of all the thoughts, words, and actions of the day to God, we include honest recreation as well as food and drink and study. Tradition at this school has made this spiritual service more intense because daily Communion and prayer have been made a part of the training schedule, each game is dedicated to some Saint, and the shocks and bruises and disappointments of the season, as well as the glory of victory, have been offered for the Poor Souls or for some particular soul in affiiction. 
..What part does victory play .in this service? The combination of consistent victories brilliant, gritty play­ing, and man-killing schedules has given Our Lady's team the largest and friendliest p-ublic following in this country. And as sports writers scratch their heads ove~ this phe­nomenon, they come closer and closer to acquainting the public with the ideals that dominate both the school and the team. Catholic schools know what makes the. differ­ence, and when they seek a coach from Notre Dame they invariably ask: .. Is he a daily communicant? Is he likely to extort a good spiritual infl_uence on our school?" 
This year's season has furnished a brilliant example of the spiritual service of Notre Dame football. With an attend­ance of 570,000 spectators at nine games, and a capacity attendance of 122,500 at one game and 300,000 applica­tions for the 80,000 scats at another, there is no doubt about . the popularity of the team. Press comment has been, for the most part, exceptionally friendly, and there has been notable absence of two features of a generation ag~ caustic comment or a conspiracy of silence on the part of the press. Furthermore, the press has been eager for more material than·it could have on the spiritual side of the 
players. 
Scores of communications have told us of the edification that has come from observation of the spiritual side of Notre Dame football. One man is thrilled to see a player go up from. the benches to serve a Mass when a. priest comes out alone; another is moved profoundly when three guests at his home turn down his .wife's hot sausages and cakes because they want to receive Holy Communion the morn­ing after the· game; a high-school team writes for the ««medals the Notre Dame men wear;" a nun writes that her pupi~s arc praying_ for the coach and. the team; priests here 

and there all over the country, urging their parishoners and their Holy_ N·ame Societies to frequent Communion, quote the example of the team. 
Tomorrow is the feast of St. Francis Xavier, one of the first followers of St. Igna.tius, and the Apostle of India. He is said to have converted more than a million· people. He did things in a large way. St. Ignatius won the heart of Francis when he was a brilliant, somewhat worldly-young student at the University of Paris, by repeating to him constantly, u\Vhat shall it profit a man to gain the whole world if he suffer the loss of his soul?" And that is the spirit in which the members of the team of 1929 arc asked by their school to· accept the national championship. One hundred years from now, some pokey scholar may dig out of an ancient I!lagazine an account of the fleeting glory of the football championship of this year; but the players will have eterl!al glory in Heaven if a hundred years from now they will be surrounded there by fans, total strangers to .them now, whom they won to love of God. In this spirit, then, thank God tomorrow in Holy Communion for the championship of 1929.

1,3 00 Praise 1929-Cham.pions at Testim.onial Dinner 
Over 1,300 persons paid tribute to Notre Dame's 1929 football team on December 5 at the university dining-halls, the occasion being the annual testimonial banquet to the 'I team by the St. Joseph Valley Notre Dame club. It was..the largest crowd ever to attend one of these dinners in the six
'I 
years that they have been given. The dinner was unique not only in size, but in· the fact that Coach Rockne was unable to attend it due to illness that had kept him away from the team most of the fall. His absence enabled the notable speakers present to express their true feeling toward him without any embarrassment, al­though he was listening in to the talks on a radio at his bedside. Highlights on the program of excellent speakers were the talk of Jimmy Phelan, a former Rockne pupil who · showed Purdue the way to its ~rst Big Ten championship this fall, and the one by Rev. Charles L. O'Donnell, C.S.C., president.of the University of Notre Dame.· Phelan very generously stated that : ui bring from Purdue and from Purdue's players, the word that we con­sider Notre Dame the greatest team in America today, and Purdue claims nothing more than the championship of its own little league and of Tippecanoe county." Father O'Donnell, before launching into the body of his talk, in­sisted that Purdue consider itself at least the co-holder of the national title with Notre ·Dame. ·.· · '· · ·. The main part of Father ·a~Donnell's-" speech consisted in a defense of college athle~ics as consider~~ und~r: t,he 

headings of crowds, its support of scholastic and other cur­
ricular features, ·and commercialism in athletics. He gave 
figures to show that in spite of the tremendous increase in 
number of those attending games, football still belongs to 
the schools and not to some intangible heterogeneous mob. 
He pointed out that athletics had been supported by sources 
other than itself for a long time and that it was only fair 
that athletics should repay some of its debt to these sources, 
the scholastic departments of the university.· He con­
cluded with a strong argument .to the effect that com­
mercialism is not the motivating force in college athletics 
today, giving as proof the new Notre Dame stadium which 
will cost in the neighborhood of $700,000 and which will 
not enable Notre Dame to make as much money as it could ·playing aw:iy from home. 
Paul Castner, president of the Notre Dame club of St. Joseph Valley, was the presiding officer at the dinner and \Varren Brown, sports editor of the Chicago Herald-Exam­i1ler, was the toastmaster. Other speakers were H. 0. uPat" Page, coach at Indiana, \Villiam uNavy Bill" Ingram, coach a.t Navy, Capt. Lawrence .. Biff" Jones, Army coach, Judge \Valter P. Steffan, ~arnegie Tech coach, Harvey T. Woodruff, columnist with the Chicago Tribu11e, and Hon. Harry C. Leslie, governor of Indiana. 
All of these men spoke in glowing terms of Notre Dame's 

current and past successes on the gridiron and of their re­
spect and love of Coach Ro.ckne. Among those invited, 
who were unable to attend were Hon. James Walker, mayor

1930 Grid-Card Announced 
At the end of the 1929 season, Coach Rockne said that he would never line up another tough schedule for his team. On December 14, after a meeting with the faculty board of control, he came forth with a ten game card that takes its place easily with that of 1929, and with any other his teams have played. 
Five of the games will be in the new stadium now under construction and five of them will be on the road. Southern Me.thodist university, one of the best teams in the South this year, will be the first to trot onto the sod next fall, and after them, Navy will dedicate the new arena. 
Three teams. from Pennsylvania, Carnegie Tech, Pitts­burgh, and Pennsylvania-are on the card with Indiana and Northwestern of the Big Nine, and Drake, Missouri Valley champions. The 1930 team will close its season with the annual Army game in New.York on Nov. 29 and an­other on the coast with Southern California the following week. 
Southern Methodist university~ Pittsburgh, and Pennsyl­vania are the only additions to the 1929 schedule and Wis­consin and Georgia Tech are the teams dropped. 
Following is the complete schedule: 
Oct. ·4-Southern Methodist at South Bend. 
Oct. 11-Navy at South Bend. 
Oc~. 18-Carnegie Tech at South Bend.

Sidelights on the Season 
For the second time in five years, Notre Dame has been awarded the Jack F. Rissman trophy symbolical of the national championship. Mr. Rissman bases his ratings on the strength of the team and its opponents rather than on percentage. Purdue was rated next to Notre Dame and Pittsburgh third. 
Statistics are always interesting, at least sometimes. Dur­

.ing the past season Notre Dame scored 145 points to its opponents 3 8, making 20 touchdowns to six for the oppo­sitiOn. Southern California was the only team· to score twice against the first string line; Georgia Tech scored once on the first club, and Navy, Drake, and Northwestern each once on the shock troops. Notre Dame made 1 0 8 first downs to its opponents 59; 2,307 yards from scrim­mage to their 843, and completed 18 passes out of 80 for J91 yards, while the enemy completed 29 out of 110 for 380 yards. 
Two of the longest runs of the season were made in Notre Dame games-Elder's run for 100 yard against Army, and Saunder's, of Southern California, for 95. Elder also got one for 60 against Indiana and one for 53 in the Georgia

Tech game. Cariedo ran back a Northwestern punt for 80 yards and a. Georgia Tech kick for 73. 
Elder's pass to Conley in the Southeni California game was good for 53 yards and is probably the longest com­pleted by a major team this year. While on the subject of Elder, we might point out that" he led the team's scoring with seven touchdowns. Savoldi was next with six. . 
Jumping Joe Savoldi, the full-back who plunges, then gallops, was the best ground-gainer in the country during the season. He was given just an outside chance of making good last year when he spent his time with the reserves~ He averaged around four yar:ds this year. 
Jack Cannon, left guard, and Frank Carideo, quarter­back, were two of the most prominent All-American .se­lections of the year. · Both were almost unanimous choices of the experts. Ted Twomey, Tim Moynihan, Joe Savoldi, and Capt. Johnny Law also came in for a lot of honorable mention on the mythical elevens.

Sidelights on. the Season 
Twomey and Cannon were invited by Dick Hanley, Northwestern coach, to play on his team of Eastern stars against an eleven of Western luminaries on the Pacific coast, January 1. Elder was asked to play with a Midd!e­Western team. against some Southern stars during the holi­days but decided that he has had enough football and will spend Christmas with the folks in the old Kentucky home. 
The entire left side of the line consisting of Colrick, 

Twomey, and Cannon; two centers, Moynihan and Nash; 
right guard, Capt. Law, right end, Tom Murphy, and 
left half Elder will be lost to the team for next year and 
Coach Rockne will probably sing his usual song of woe .next fall before the season opens. 
Although Indiana is considered the football capital of the world with its Notre Dame and Purdue, there is not a single Hoosier on the former school's traveling squad and only three on th~ entire roster. Abe Zoss, of South Bend, is one of these and he was to have gone along to Bloomington for the opening game, but remembered that Oct. 5 was New Year's for him and had to stay home. 
The Nebraska Cornhuskers stopped off at South Bend on their way to their game with Syracuse university and were guests of the Notre Dame team at lunch before their hosts had to hop a train for Baltimore and the Navy game on Oct. 10. The Cornhuskers also worked out for a while on Cartier practice field, evidently getting some good out of their short drill-they beat Syracuse, 13 to 7. 
Tom Shaughnessy, a Notre Dame graduate and man­ager of the Chicago Blackhawks hockey team, had his puck-chasers at Notre Dame for a ten-day training session at Cartier .field. It snowed most of the time and the boys went through calisthenics in the gym. 
In 'speaking of the proposed plan for scoring one point for each first down, Coach Rockne said, ui underst~nd that the American League will score a point for each man left on base next year." 
This was the second time in two successive seasons that Notre Dame beat both· service teams,' having taken the count of both Army and Navy last year.

Colrick, Cannon, Law, Moynihan, Carideo, and Elder were placed on the Indianapolis Star's All-Indiana team and received attractive desk sets as rewards for their good work. Collins, Cannon, Moynihan, Twomey, Carideo, Law, and Brill were all placed on t~e United Press first All-State team. 
Tommy Mills and Bill Jones, freshmen coaches will cheer ..Rock" somewhat with what they claim is one· of the best Frosh squads in the history of the school. They gav~ out 44 numerals this fall and say that they can fill some of the gaps left in the line by graduation. 
Over one-fourth of the university's total enrollment played football with the varsity, reserves, Freshmen, and hall teams this fall. Eight hundred uniforms were issued by the equipment office. 
Although the team traveled to the Navy, Carnegie Tech, Georgia Tech, and Army games in sleepers, it is not true that the players sing .. Home, Sweet Home," every time they see a Pullman. 

The university band had a great time on its trip to the Army game and played in the lobby of the McAlpine hotel every time it got a chance. The organization broadcasted over a national hook-up, paraded on Park-Avenue;·and got a big kick out of tearing around the city in busses with a police escort. 
AI Culver, shock troop tackle, is the son of Bill Culver who played the same position for Northwestern in 1892-93­
94. Ed Collins, left end, is the brother of Chuck, one of Notre Dame's best flankmen and a member of the Seven Mules of 1924. He is coaching at North Carolina now. 
Eddie Shea and Frankie Garcia, two of the nation's -lead­ing featherweights, were scheduled to appear in a benefit show at the Notre Dame gym as we went to press. Their bout tops a good program carded for Dec. 20. 
Art Healy, who throws away all those ticket applica­tions, says that if the 600,000 who saw Notre Dame play this fall were placed end to end they would probably holler for 50-yard line seats_in the new stadium.

OFFICIAL FOOTBALL REVIEW-1929 
The Notre Dame first seven squads weighed -13,436 pounds this season, or approximately six and one-half tons. The average weight of the players was 174% pounds, thei'r average height five feet, 10% inches, their average age· 20 years. 
John Colrick, left end on the football team, closed his athletic career at Notre Dame with nine ·varsity letters to his credit, three each in football, basketball, and baseball. He was . captain and first baseman on the diamond club this year, and played center with the basketball quintet. 

Dick Donoghue, varsity right tackle, has two brothers playing footQall here. uBern" is a reserve half-back and Francis is one of the most promising ends on the Freshman squad. · Jack Cannon's brother, Dan, is another reserve half~ back. 
Much of the wood collected for Notre Dame's biggest bonfire the week preceding the Southern California game was given to the needy of South Bend and the blaze still surpassed anything of its kind ever seen here previously. 
A Chicago daily surprised Coach Rockne one morning with the news that he was to be' the recipient of a check for .$40,000, his ucut" of the gate recipts for the year that were said to be $800,000. Both Mr. Rockne and the uni­versity authorities denied the report, stating that he is on a straight salary and that when expenses are paid, the pro-. :fits of the season will be a great deal less than the reported amount. 
John Colrick, left end; Joe Nash, center; and AI Gebert, quarter-back; will all be in the lineup of Jimmy Phelan's Mid-Western star team that will play a team of South­\Vest luminaries during the holidays. 
Frank Carideo, All-American quarter-back, showed his versatility in an early-season basketball game when he scored Notre Dame's :fiftieth point against Albion. Notre Dame won, 59 to 11. Tom Conley, right end, was teaming with Frank at guard with the third team. 
Seventeen members of the football ·team were given the usual rigorous initiation into the Monogram club at the close of the season. They are: Brill, Culver, Kaplan, How­ard, Gebert, Kenneally, Kassis, Frank Leahy, Locke, McManmon, McNamara, Metzger, O'Connor, Savoldi, Schwartz, Vlk, and Y arr. The two senior managers, Johnnie Quinn and Bernie Conroy, were also initiated. All of the players named will be back next year. 
The Student Activities Council, under the direction of its president, Robert Hellrung, will emphasize the neces­sity of organized cheering and singing at basketball games this season so that the students will give good account of themselves next fall when the new stadium is opened. 
Jack Elder was presented with a football given and auto­graphed by Nancy Carrol, of talkie fame, for scoring the most points in the Army game. \Varren· Browri, jn mak­ing the presentation at the recent testimonial banquet, offered to thank her personally for Jack.

these qualities are combined in a high degree. Throughout the \Vildcats' succ·essful season Bergherm's work was in great evidence. He rounds out what we consider an ideal backfield: a smart quarter-back who can run, pass, and kick as well as think; a. set of fast, shifty half-backs who can block and tackle as well as carry out the usual triple­threat assignments; and. a. plunging full-back who is smart defensively and who can clear the way_ for other ball­carriers. 
To complete our line, we pick John Parks, left guard and captain at \Visconsin. Small but scrappy, he supplied the inspiration that pulled together a faltering Badger eleven on more than one occasion this Fall. He is one of the school of smart .. vest-pocket" guards and distinguished himself this season with a comparatively weak team. 
In the controversy· over who should be on the first . eleven a great immber of other outstanding players were 
discussed by our advisors and they are mentioned here as 
some small recognition of their great ability. They are 
as follows:

The-Holiday Season 
Reaches Its Climax 
at CHICAGO'S 
MORRISON HOTEL 
Madison ·and Clark Streets 
Tallest Hotel in the World-46 Stories. High 
N
O PLACE in the hemisphere is· better identified with the spirit of old­fashioned hospitality than the Madison and Clark intersection.. Here the 
famous old Boston Oyster House, the Morrison's historic restaurant, has been a favorite rendezvous for over half a century. Its cheery, cordial atmos­phere has developed a "personal" character· throughout the entire hotel. 
Rooms, $·2..50 up,{ each with bath 
The strategic location of the building has so enhanced the revenues ~rom subrentals· that they pay all the ground rent, and the saving· is passed on to the guests. ·Rooms are rented at a fraction of the rate charged at other leading hotels for similar rooms. Every room is outside, with bath, circu­lating ice-water, bed-head reading lamp, telephone, radio set and Servidor. Every floor has its own housekeeper, and garage accommodation is abundant. 
·The Terrace Garden and Boston Oyster House 
The fame of this location is largely due to the individual character· of the Ter~ace Garden, which has won national celebrity with its delicious menus, vivacious dance music, and brilliant entertainments. The Cameo Room, seating 2,000, offers ideal conditions for fraternity meetings and banquet's.
