'81' Overview 
The Dreams Never Die 
By JOHN HEISLER 
We dreamers have our way Of facing rainy days And somehow we survive 
There are plenty of optimists in the world today. And then there is Gerry Faust. 
How optimistic is he, you ask? He's a gee-whiz, back-slapping type who could grab 11 third-graders off a street­corner sandlot and tell you he could win a national championship with them. That's how optimistic he is. 
Many Notre Dame fans doubted the sincerity of Faust's gushing enthusiasm when he first arrived on campus. They shouldn't have-because that's the only way Gerry knows how to operate. He's the first to admit he finds redeeming qualities in every person and situation he faces. 
Faust's weekly press conferences fea­tured a regular litany of praise for the next opponent, its coaching staff and its great talent. That's coaching rhetoric for you. But that's Gerry Faust, too. He made a 1-7 Georgia Tech team sound as imposing as USC or Penn State. 
He .came to Notre Dame and dared to dream big dreams. He dreamed dreams of unbeaten seasons and na­tional championships -because they were the only kinds of seasons he knew. The dreams died hard-but the opti­mism never did. 
"I've loved every minute I've been at Notre Dame, except for the five Satur­days we lost," he pronounced as the Irish jetted to Miami for their season finale. 
It didn't turn out to be the season he expected, but Gerry didn't really change. He nurtured those dreams, in spite of the losses. And somehow he survived. 
We keep the feelings warm Protect them from the storm Until our time arrives 
Never is heard a discouraging word -that's Gerry Faust's credo. He lived it through a season that included more rainy days than sunny skies: 
• "All we can do now is try to win the rest of them from here on out," said Faust after his team lost at Michi-gan. "We can still have a great season. I'd like to win them all." 


• 
"I certainly don't plan to throw in the towel because we've lost two games," said Faust after his team fell at Purdue. -"We've got to continue to improve and there's no question in my mind we can do it." 

• 
"We could still end up having a heck of a year," said Faust as his team approached the Florida State game with a 2-2 record. "We've got a heck of a schedule ahead of us, but we could have a great finish if we win the rest of them and play a highly-ranked team in a bowl." 

• 
"I'm encouraged," said Faust after the Irish record went to 2-4 in a close loss to USC. "If we can have five more wins at the end of the season, we'll have had a great year." 


Bobby Bowden: 'Gerry Faust is going through a normal transition period. The guy has too much quality going for him andtheschoolhastoo much quality not to turn things around.' 

• "I'm a positive thinker and I ap­proached the season hoping to be 8-0 after this game," said Faust after a win over Georgia Tech left his team 4-4. "But I'm elated to win. It feels great no matter what your record is." 
Even after falling behind Miami 30-6 and finally losing 37-15, Faust did his best to keep things upbeat: "I was proud of the way our kids played in the second half. They didn't give up and they kept their heads up." 
The dreams died ever so hard. 
Then one day the sun appears And we come shining through those lonely years 

Faust had to work extra hard to keep the faith through some of those frus­trating Saturdays on the sidelines. But 

Joe Paterno and Gerry Faust exchange greetings prior to the Penn State-Notre Dame contest. 
there were plenty of individuals, most notably his fellow coaches, who under­stood. 
USC's John Robinson detected "some­thing about the look in his eye after the game that impressed the hell out of me." Penn State's Joe Paterno could empathize, too. 
"He's had a tough baptism," Paterno told a Philadelphia columnist on the eve of the Irish-Nittany Lion match. "He's going through exactly the same sort of thing I did. You try to do too much too soon and you try to do every­thing yourself. There were times I thought my first year would never end. 
"You play people out of position, you put in way too many plays, more than your team can handle. He'll get through this okay, though. He's a good coach." 
Florida State's Bobby Bowden had ideas of his own: 
"Gerry Faust is going through a normal transition period. The guy has too much quality going for him and the school has too much quality not to turn things around. It's not his fault and it's not ·Notre Dame's. I know it will work out." 
Like the words to the Barry Manilow song "I Made It Through the Rain" said, all Faust had to do. was wait for the day the sun would appear. It would take time, and patience would be the key. 
I made it through the rain And found myself respected By the others who Got rained on too And made it through 
Gerry Faust learned plenty in his first year at Notre Dame. He made some mistakes-and admitted them. Even though stubbornness is a Faust characteristic, Gerry was smart enough to know he had to make some adjust­ments and changes -or else. 
He learned he had to become tougher with his players: "Everyone told me that college players were so much more mature, that you couldn't treat them the same way I had. treated high school kids. But you still have to have disci­pline and there are plenty of times you still have to be tough with them." 
He learned firsthand the difficulty of platooning quarterbacks and defensive lines: "It was great when we won. But in the end we had to look at our con­tinuity. I like the idea of being able to go at least two deep at every spot, and having the confidence to use those peo­ple when the game's on the line. But we couldn't do that the first year. Maybe after a couple of seasons when our players are more ingrained in our sys­tem, it will be different." 
He learned the importance of speed: "The Florida State game taught us a lot. If you can't match their speed, you better have something else to combat it. That's when we started looking at what a guy like Joe Howard could do. And I'll guarantee you we'll be looking for more people who can do those kinds of things." 

Joe Paterno: 'He's had a tough baptism. He's going through exactly the same sort of thing I did. You try to do too much too soon and you try to do everything yourself. There were times I thought my first year would never end. 
'You play people out of position, you put in way too many plays, more than your team can handle. He'll get through this okay, though. He's a good coach.' 
He learned about the leveling of talent, the parity in the college game: "Everyone always says what great ath­letes Notre Dame has. That's a tough point to argue. But everyone else has great athletes at this level, too. We overpowered some teams we played in high school. But that doesn't happen here. I learned to respect the talent of every team we played." 
He learned about the difficulty of playing a kamikaze schedule: "Every­body on our schedule gets fired up to play Notre Dame. ·They've all got a chance to beat you if you're not ready. That wasn't true at Moeller. We knew we could win certain games no matter who we put on the field." 
He learned that a multidimensional 
offensive system doesn't necessarily 
mean an awesome offense, at least not 
right away: "We probably did try to do 
more things than we were capable of 
mastering, particularly the first year. I 
had forgotten that our teams at Moeller 
had been using the system for 18 years. 
That's a lot different than coming to 
Notre Dame the first year and trying to 
put it all in right away. A couple of 
years from now when all our players 
are more accustomed to what we do, 
we can expect more." 
He learned how to lose. The six 
losses his '81 Irish suffered equaled the 
six games he lost in his last 10 years at 
Moeller. But, more importantly, Faust 
learned how to respond to losing: 
"It was so foreign to me, it had oc­
curred so infrequently that I let it get., to me the first few times last fall. I let it affect me too far into the next week, and I finally realized I was letting it affect the players, the other coaches and everyone else around me. I had to get used to the idea of putting a loss behind me after Sunday. I had to bounce back on Monday morning and be ready to go ·at it again, no matter how tough it was 
for me." 
When friends are Izard to find and life seems so unkind Sometimes you feel afraid 
Gerry Faust didn't enjoy much about 
going 5-6 -and he has no plans to 
endure another season like it. · ·-.. 
"I can't wait to get started next year. 
I've thought about being 5-6 ever since 
the Miami game ended and none of us 
will be able to put it out of our minds 
until we get things going in '82 and 
redeem ourselves. 
"I wasn't happy with our first year, 
and I know our players couldn't have 
enjoyed it very much." 
In Faust's behalf, there were in­
tangibles that made it particularly diffi­
cult for him in 1981-in addition to 
the usual assortment of injuries and an 
obviously-testing schedule. 
No one could have predicted the media blitz that would ensue when Faust took over-nor the resulting love affair between Faust and the average fan that went with it. Yet, as even Faust would admit, a great deal of the publicity came about because of Faust's own omnipresent optimism. Anytime Gerry attempted to caution anyone not to become too enthusiastic because, after all, he had never coached a college game-it was lost in the flood of good feeling that his personality created. 
It was. obvious to everyone that Gerry Faust was the consummate nice guy. Irish fans figured there was no way he wouldn't be a smashing success. 
Faust also wishes his Irish hadn't be­come the top-ranked team in the coun­try after only one game. That was an­other handicap he could have done without. It was as if Notre Dame had climbed all the way to the mountaintop after a single week -and there was no­where to go but down. Ev.en Faust's history of magical motivation wasn't enough that week. 

Michigan made mortals of the Irish the next Saturday in Ann Arbor-and it ended up taking nearly half the sea­son to build back the pieces again. 
"It would have been nice to have won that first game by only a field goal or maybe a touchdown," Faust later sug­gested. "That way there would have been something to work on, things to point to that had to be improved. Everything almost went too well against LSU, at least on the surface." 
As Ara Parseghian once said, there is no way to accurately describe to some­one what it is like to be head football 
coach at the University of Notre Dame. You simply have to experience it your­self. 
That's exactly what Faust's first year turned out to be-an experience, one which will benefit him tremendously in the future. As much coaching expe~i­ence as Faust had, there was no way for him to know what it would be like until he went through a season on his own. It made no difference what Parseghian or Dan Devine or anyone else might have suggested-none of it really meant anything to Faust until he had spent his first 11 Saturdays on the sidelines. 
Someday, a couple of decades from now when Gerry Faust hangs up his coaching hat, he'll probably chuckle when he thinks about some of the things that happened in that first year at Notre Dame. And he'll remember some of the things he learned during that initial fall of football under the Golden Dome. 
But, for now, there's no time for Faust to reminisce. 
As the '82 opener against Michigan n_ext September 18 looms in the dis­tance, Faust will continue his worka­holic attitude toward his job. He'll shake a lot more hands and kiss a few babies and continue to exhort friend and foe alike to root for the Irish. 
But, somewhere inside him, that de­sire to succeed that so consumes him on Saturdays will burn a little stronger. After all, Gerry Faust doesn't like hav­ing 5-6 chalked next to his name any more than anyone else likes it. 
And Irish fans everywhere will be watching to see just how much he has learned. 
Just aim beyond the clouds And rise above the crowds And start your own parade

LSU 

A Dream-Come-True Debut 
By GARY GRASSEY 
It was the best of times. 
The excitement and expectations sur­rounding the opening of the 1981 Notre Dame football season had reached their peak. 
The return of most of the starters from the 1980 Irish squad that had made such a strong run at national championship honors provided the le­gions of Notre Dame fanatics with hope for similar fortunes in 1981. 
But it was the presence of one dy­namic, ebullient man, whose storied past had been told and retold around the nation for the past nine months, that brought the emotional buildup to Notre Dame's home opener with Lou­isiana State close to frenzy. 
Gerry Faust, the architect of one of the most successful high school football programs in the country (his teams at Cincinnati Moeller lost a grand total of 17 games in Faust's 18-year tenure) whose fondest dream had always been to coach at Notre Dame, was making his debut as head coach of the Fighting Irish. And all of Faust's supporters and critics-those who felt high school coaches had no business jumping into a Division I program the caliber of a Notre Dame-and even his players and coaches were about to Jearn for the first time under game conditions what foot­ball under Faust was all about. 
Almost everything went off accord­ing to plan. 
At the traditional pep rally Friday night before the game, the arrival of more than 10,000 Irish rooters forced the festivities outside Stepan Center on the Notre Dame campus onto an adja­cent set of basketball courts. The over­flow gathering made more noise than the campus had heard in years on any­thing but game day. 
The next morning, just a few hours before kickoff, Faust stepped into the bright South Bend sunshine for an un­announced tour of football festivities at Notre Dame, to shake a few more hands and to sec firsthand what it was like on campus the day of a home game. 
Finally, just before 1:30 p.m., Faust led his newly attired blue and gold squad through the tunnel and most of the. student body onto the field in Notre Dame Stadium for his first game as head coach. 




About 25 or 30 rosaries later-"! must have said one every five minutes out there," Faust later recalled-third­ranked Notre Dame walked away with · a 27-9 victory over Jerry Stovall's LSU Tigers. While far from flawless, the win was as satisfying as it was relieving to Faust and the Irish, whose first hurdle was now complete. 
LSU took the opening kickoff and promptly marched nowhere in three plays from its own 23 before quarter­back Alan Risher was hit by Irish linebacker Joe Rudzinski. That collision caused a fumble that was recovered by defensive tackle Kevin Griffith at the Tiger 20. 
Five plays and 1:27 later, Faust's brand-new motion offense, complete with a wingback and two quarterbacks, rolled into the end zone on a seven­yard pass from sophomore quarterback Blair Kiel to fullback Larry Moriarty. The touchdown pass was the first ever for Kiel, the youngster who had helped lead the Irish to success as a freshman under former coach Dan Devine by starting the last nine games of the 9-2-1 1980 season. Harry Oliver, one of ten Moeller High School alumni (nine of them on the Irish roster) to dress for the ballgame, converted the extra point to give Notre Dame a 7-0 lead less than three minutes into the contest. 
The Tigers made little headway on their next possession after the kickoff and were forced to punt. Kiel and the Irish took over on their own 28 and unleashed Faust's offense with the execution, deception, and lightning­quick precision everyone had hoped to see. 
Wingback Tony Hunter, a junior from Moeller, raced around left end for 13 yards. Kiel hit tight end Dean Masztak on a rollout for 10 more yards at the Tiger 49. Sophomore tailback Greg Bell smashed through the line and sprinted 41 yards down the left sideline. Hunter took a pitch to the right for seven yards to the LSU one­yard line where junior co-captain Phil Carter banged in for the score on the next play. Oliver's conversion made it 14-0 with 7:43 left in the first quarter. 
Stovall's team might have folded up for a slaughter right there. But like the previous week, when the Tigers battled Alabama for 60. minutes despite an early deficit before succumbing, LSU bounced back. With Risher running the option for ·good yardage and with the help of an Irish personal foul, the Tigers moved to Notre Dame's 32-yard line. Wideout Orlando McDaniel took a reverse 17 yards around the right side and LSU was in scoring range. 
Two plays later, though, the Irish defense, reminiscent of a . year ago,

stopped the drive as cornerback Stacey Toran picked off Risher's throw to McDaniel in the end. zone for a touch­back. 
After an exchange of possessions, Notre Dame took a Tiger punt on its own 31 and began to move. With quarterback Tim Koegel, another Moeller alumnus, at the helm, Faust's strategy clicked again. Koegel hit Hunter twice for big gains on pass plays and Hunter showed he could run the ball as well, carrying once for 13 yards and pounding across the goal line from a yard out midway through the second quarter for a 20-0 Irish lead. Thanks to a heavy rush, Oliver's place­ment was wide right. 
Kiel returned to action when Notre Dame got the ball back. But an errant pass to Hunter was picked off by fresh­man safety Jeffrey· Dale at the Irish 42. After a sack, Risher scrambled out of trouble and hit Lester Dunn at the 12 for a 37-yard gain. Three runs and a face-mask penalty left the Tigers with fourth down and less than a yard to go for a first down at the Irish two. 
But All-America middle linebacker Bob Crable, perhaps the finest player ever to come from Moeller, made his third consecutive stop by breaking up a pitch from Risher to halfback Jesse Myles to give the ball back to Notre Dame. 
"You get down inside the twenty or around the twenty-yard line and you can't score-that's frustrating," moaned Risher after the game concerning the Tigers' offensive failures. "There was never any doubt we could get back in the game. But we made big mistakes." 
LSU's mistakes cost dearly in the second half. Kiel was picked off on the second play of the third quarter by James Britt at the Irish 22. Britt's re­turn gave the ball to LSU at the Irish nine, but Risher muffed a snap from center and overthrew a receiver on third down, forcing the Tigers to settle for a Mark Johnston field goal from 23 yards. The Irish led 20-3. 
The Tiger defense quickly stopped the Irish on three plays and got the ball back for the offense at the LSU 30. On third and 10, Risher was inter­cepted by Toran for the second time at midfield. 
Two runs by Carter netted 16 yards. Koegel hit Bell and fullback John Sweeney for first downs. From the LSU six-yard line, Koegel then rolled left and found another old high school buddy, senior Dave Condeni, on a div­ing catch in the-back of the end zone for the. touchdown that put the Tigers to rest. Oliver's extra point made it 27-3. 
For the rest of the afternoon, Faust used most of his bench, including three 

I!I 
more quarterbacks, and ball control football to wind down the clock. The Tigers got a meaningless touchdown on a 26-yard sweep by Eric Martin with 23 seconds to play to account for the final score. ­
"I feel a little bit more .. relieved," said Faust after the game. "It was a great thrill running out of the tunnel into Notre Dame Stadium. It's the greatest feeling in the world." 
His dream had come true and any words about the game itself were hard to come by in the post-game interviews because of au· the emotions that sur­rounded the spectacle of his first after­noon on the sidelines. 
"I had a great time today," Faust said. "I found out you can't get away with some things in college you did in high school. I thought the defense played excellent. Kiel and Koegel both played very well. They executed beau­tifully considering the fact that they are playing under a new offensive system." 
Emotion ran high among the players as well. 

Alan Risher: 'There was never any doubt we could get back in the.game. We just made big mistakes.' 

"This one was like a Southern Cal game," said Crable. "Coach Faust is a very excitable man. Everybody knows that. He's so dynamic that the excite­ment rubs off on the whole team. He gets the players, the coaches and the fans excited, but the thing that helped us the most today was our preparation." 
Tony Hunter, another Faust dona­tion from Moeller, saw things another . way. 
"I think I saw coach crying five times today," said the junior wingback. "He is living a dream. As a sophomore at Moeller he told me how much he wanted to coach at Notre Dame some­day. I'll do anything for him. I have faith that whatever he wants me to do -run, catch-will be the best thing for the team." 
The rotating quarterback situation which generated 376 yards of offense for the Irish sat well with both Kiel and Koegel (a combined nine-of-13 passing for 130 yards and two touchdowns). 
"It's a lot of fun," Koegel said.

Then came the news from Madison. Top-ranked Michigan, Notre Dame's next opponent, had lost to Wisconsin. 
The Irish,  after just  one  game under  
Faust,  had  a  chance  to  be  the  top

Perhaps  this  was  the  perfect  end

No one amongst the faithful leaving Notre Dame Stadium on September 12 would have dared to think otherwise.

Tony Hunter's first look at wingback produced 42 rushing yards and the third Irish score of the afternoon. 
"Everyone has an opportunity to get involved in it. Blair and I each knew at least a series in advance when we were going in. As for me personally, I feel like I contributed." 
But the reality of Notre Dame's con­stant penalties (10 for 106 yards) and other miscues was on the minds of the Irish veterans. 
"We made a lot of mistakes out there today that were costly," Crable said. "We have our sights set on a national championship, so we've got to play better. If we can't obtain our goal, it's

Ann Arbor Ends the Honeymoon 
By KELLY SULLIVAN 

Were the skeptics right? Was the Gerry Faust story really too good to be true? 
It had taken only one game for the man from Moeller to go from being the top high school coach in the coun­try to coach of the top-ranked college football squad in the nation. Wiscon­sin's upset of Michigan the previous week, coupled with Notre Dame's im­pressive debut over LSU, sprang the Irish to the top of the polls. 
But it took only one more game-a humbling 25-7 beating by the Wol­verines-to put a damper on sport's success story of the year. Notre Dame became the second of a half-dozen teams to fall from the top spot during the topsy-turvy '81 season. 
Inside the locker room there were tears. Outside, throngs of reporters lined up at the door. 
"It was bound to happen, sooner or later," said one. "With a schedule like that, he couldn't win them all," said another. 
They waited anxiously to witness Gerry Faust's reactions after his first college loss, his first Notre Dame loss­reactions of a· man who barely knew the meaning of the word. 
"I don't know what he'll be like," offered dejected linebacker Bob Crable, who played for Faust at Moeller. "I've never seen him after a loss." Crable's squads compiled a perfect 36-0 mark during his four years there. 
Faust walked into the pressroom. He was drained, physically and emo­tionally. He was visibly upset. But he was gracious. 
"Is this hard, Gerry?" a writer asked. 

"It's not easy," he replied, managing half a grin. "I'm not used to losing like this." 
The man was not used to losing, period. The defeat ended a personal

Sophomore Steve Smith didn't have his best day at quarterback, throwing a pair of interceptions and only four completions in 15 attempts ••• 

34-game winning streak dating back to 1978 when Princeton High School beat Moeller, 13-12. "But that streak isn't what makes it so hard," he emphasized. "It'd be just as hard to take if I hadn't lost in two or three games. We're not in this game to lose." 
But on this day, the Irish simply were not in this game for very long. They were outplayed man for man in front of a national television audience and the third largest crowd in Michigan Stadium history. They were physically dominated in a way few Notre Dame teams had been in recent seasons. 
"There's no excuse," admitted the Irish coach. "Michigan played better football than we did today. They blocked better, they tackled better. They made us not look good." 
Mark Zavagnin: 'We let them get the momentum early and couldn't take it away from them. We thought we'd done that when we stopped them on that first drive. But we hadn't.' 
And they did it right from the start. Michigan took the opening kickoff and marched 70 yards up the field. The drive came up empty on the score­board (they missed a field goal from the 30). But Coach Bo Schembechler's doubts were put to rest. 
"We didn't get any points out of that drive, but it proved to our team that we had the right stuff to win," he said. 
Their "stuff" eventually. came to­gether. Michigan exploded for four touchdowns-a pair in the air to All­America speedster Anthony Carter, and a pair on the ground, as the Wolves rushed for 304 yards to Notre Dame's 70. 
"Once Michigan got going they .out­played us in every aspect," Faust ex­plained. 
"We let them get the momentum early and couldn't take it away from the~," said linebacker Mark Zavagnin. "We thought we'd done that when we stopped them on that first drive. But we hadn't." 

And the Irish had troubles on the other side of the line, too. The offense bogged down repeatedly. There was little resemblance to the motion ma­chine. that ran___roughshod over LSU. There was little continuity, either, as quarterbacks Tim Koegel and Blair Kiel both tried their hand at igniting the attack. 
"It was a good idea last week," said Faust, about the quarterback rota­tion system that produced 27 points the previous Saturday. "When things go well, they're great ideas. When they don't, they're lousy." 
A few other ideas backfired on the Notre Dame coach. Faust tried a fake field goal on his team's first possession, but holder Dave Condeni floated a pass to wingback Tony Hunter. It was. too high, and Hunter fell down in catch­ing it five yards short of paydirt. 
"I really thought it would go," Faust explained. "It was wide open, but we just didn't execute it properly. If we had, it would've been six." 
He tried a wingback option pass by Hunter in the third quarter. It was intercepted, setting up the Wolverines' second score. 
"I guess I didn't do a very good job of play calling," admitted Faust. "We were just grab-bagging, just trying to get something to work, trying to get some momentum." 
Had the Irish not put up a score in the final 7:4;2 (an eight-yard strike from Koegel to Dean Masztak), Faust's second college game would have marked only the second shutout against Notre Dame since 1965. 
"We needed an errorless game," said guard Mike Shiner. "We didn't get it." 
"Michigan played with more inten­sity," confessed Koegel. "They had been embarrassed by Wisconsin. We came in here ranked first, with every­one telling us how good we were, and ...." 
And the rookie coach's honeymoon with college football offiCially ended. His assistants tried to console him, telling Faust every coach has days like this once in a while. He said he hoped they were right-that they'll only be once in a while. ­
"A loss sure humbles you quickly," he admitted, and immediately added, "I don't need to be humbled anymore."

:) * * * * 
It was a story so familiar to any Notre Dame fan. But the plot of this story had a bizarre twist--:-the tailbacks' names were Smith and Jones, the re­ceiver was Bryant, the quarterback Campbell and the colors gold and black. 
Notre Dame, the team of intercep­tions and last-minute intercessions, was on the low end of this final score. The victor was Purdue. 
"I've won a lot of games like this at Cincinnati Moeller," recalled Irish coach Gerry Faust. "But this is a heck­uva time for it to· come back at me." 
A heckuva time, especially for a team that had been ranked first in the country barely a week earlier and for a rookie coach who had chaperoned 12 senior proms since the last time one of his high school teams dropped two straight games under his guidance 
"We were ready. We might not have been at our peak, but we were ready emotionally," offered Irish linebacker Bob Crable, who never experienced a single loss in 36 prep games under Moeller coach Faust. "We were up for this game, but we simply didn't execute well again. 
"You can have all the intensity in the world, but if you don't execute well you don't'do well." 
Yet, for a while during the game, it seemed as if st:ch postgame confessions were going to be out of place in the Irish lockerroom. Still feeling the sting of a 25-7 thrashing by the Wolverines 

Bob Crable and Tim Marshall close in on Purdue tailback Eric Jordan. The Boilermaker sophomore contributed 28 rushing and 29 receiving yards, while Crable made 12 stops and Marshall added four.

The scrambling of sophomore Scott Campbell caused headaches for Notre Dame's defense much of the afternoon in Ross-Ade 
Stadium. Bob Clasby gives chase on this occasion. 
of Michigan the preceding week, the 
Irish rode the perfect six-for-six passing 
of Tim Koegel to a 7-0 halftime ad­
vantage. . 
Failing to mount a significant of­

fensive in the first period, the Irish 
drove 71 yards in 11 plays during their 
only legitimate possession of the second 
quarter to earn their seven-point mid­
way edge. Koegel connections to· split 
ends Dave Condeni (21 yards) ·and 
Mike Boushka (25 yards) paced the 
three-minute drive, which freshmap 
Chris Smith capped off with his first 
career touchdown on· a one-yard dive 
off right guard. 
"We thought we could come out and 

do it in the second half, but we came 
up short," remarked tailback Phil 
Carter. "We played with more intensity 
this week, but we still haven't put things 
together." 
·yet Carter certainly could not be . blamed for not doing his fair share. 
The Tacoma, Wash., product engi­
neered an individual three-play, 50-yard 
scoring drive late in the fourth quarter, 
Scott Campbell: 'I have to be honest. I was throwing that pass to Everett Pickens in the end zone. Bryant just reached up and grabbed it. He came up with a great play.' 
culminated by a 30-yard touchdown jaunt which many thought would seal Purdue's fate with less than three minutes left to play. The 200-pound junior finished the day with 113 yards, the sixth 100-yard single-game effort of his career. 
But Carter's show was but the open­ing act for what the Boilermakers per­formed during the closing minutes on their Ross-Ade Stadium stage. 
In a game full of turning points and critical moments, the Boilermakers' final drive had more than its share of suspense. One of the most critical mo­ments came on second and 10 on the Purdue 43-yard line. With Scott Camp­bell back to pass and all of his receivers covered, the Purdue signalcaller scram­bled back ·some 10 "yards. Spotting an open man downfield, Campbell con­nected with receiving specialist Steve Bryant, who was scrambling himself, on the Irish one-yard line. 
Thankful that intentions don't count on the football field, Campbell ad­mitted, "I have to be honest. I was throwing that pass to Everett Pickens in 
the end zone. Bryant just reached up 
and grabbed it. He came up with a 
great play." 
"There were two guys right on him," 
remarked Irish strong safety Dave 
Duerson, a mainstay in the defensive 
backfield. "I just credit Campbell and 
Bryant for making that work." 
Following a six-yard loss and a pair 
of incomplete passes, Purdue coach Jim 
Young was faced with the task of 
choosing a fourth-down play from the 
65,000 that were being suggested 
throughout Ross-Ade Stadium during 
the Boilermakers' last timeout. The 
voice Young listened to was that of re­
ceiver coach Dick Dullaghan. 
"The flanker (Bryant) comes in mo­
tion, turns and runs back to the out­
side," Young outlined after the game. 
"If he is covered, Scott goes to the tight 
end." 
Finding Chris Brown one-on-one 
with Bryant, Campbell had to look no 
further for a receiver: "Since Steve was 
in man-to-man coverage, all I did was 
lay it up there and let him go for it." 
Brown, who was filling in for injured 
veteran John Krimm, recounted the 
play from his angle. "I gave Bryant a 
hit, and then followed him into the end 
zone. But I turned around too soon­
when I looked back at the quarterback, 
the ball was going right over my 
shoulder." 
Yet just a touchdown did not a vic­tory make for the Boilermakers, who chose to try for two points and a win rather than a kicked extra-point and a deadlock. Young relied on the same play the touchdown was scored on, but from a different side. 
"Basketball helped me on that last catch," said Bryant, recalling how he outstretched the Irish defense for the game-winning conversion. 
"He threw two perfect passes," re­marked Faust about Campbell's final two tosses. "I thought we had it pretty well covered, but the passes were per­fect." 
For the Irish, the final score marked the first time they had lost a one-point game since a 7-6 loss in . 1963, to, of course, Purdue. For the Boilers, the final outcome avenged an 8-7 rain­soaked Irish victory in 1971 in which Notre Dame blocked a punt in the end zone for a touchdown and clicked on a two-point conversion pass with 2:58 left in the game to dash Purdue's hopes for a major upset over the heavily­favored Irish. 
Despite the loss, Faust remained ever-philosophical: "Yes, we've lost two in a row, so we have to improve and prove ourselves the comeback team of the year." 
Now there's another familiar plot.

Michigan State 

Bouncing Back in Style 
by RICK CHRYST 

When Gerry Faust looks back on his first football season at Notre Dame, he won't remember having much fun during the last few days of September and the first few of October. 
Like Notre Dame Monday morning quarterbacks around the country, the new Irish head coach was left to con­template the consequences of two con­secutive losses on a season that had begun with so much promise. 
Those six days before the Michigan State game must have seemed like years to Faust-because all he could do was work and wait for the opportunity tp shake the sting of the Michigan and Purdue defeats. Notre Dame hadn't lost three straight games in 18 seasons, and Faust had no plans for it to happen this time around. And he didn't mind letting the Irish players know it. 
Two-and-a-half hours after the open­ing kickoff, Faust and his squad had a 20-7 triumph over the Spartans-as well as some needed peace of mind­safely in hand. 
For the fans in the Notre Dame stands, the victory provided a welcome return to the .500 mark. For the 115 Notre Dame players dressed on the west sidelines, winning that ·game had become more than simply another Saturday romp on the grass. 
"Let's just say he (Faust) showed everyone that he meant business," said Irish captain Bob Crable. "He told us · we had reputations to uphold. If some­one were to test him, he would have taken drastic action. That's how mad he was. Everyone finally realized it was time to buckle up the chin straps. They realized the position he was in." 
Indeed, if ever a game was won off the field, this was it. Riding an emo­tional roller coaster that had traveled from the elation of being the top­ranked team in the nation to the soul­searching of losing two in a row, it seemed impossible for the young Irish squad to climb that emotional ladder for the fourth week in a row. Yet, that's exactly what it did. Faust was not alone in providing the necessary incentive. 
"It was kind of emotional in the lockerroom before the game," under­stated Crable. "Van Pearcy (freshman wingback) had drawn a portrait of Coach. Faust. We signed it and had it framed, and then we presented it to him before the game. At the same time, we announced we were dedicating this game to him-for all the hard work and effort that he was putting in. It was as emotional a lockerroom as I have ever been in." 

Michigan State ended up with only 21 net yards rushing against the Irish ­ and  
Bob Crable proved one of the main causes.  
17  




Having waited all week, the Irish wasted little time in putting that emo­tion to good use. Senior defensive end Kevin Griffith recovered a Tony Ellis fumble on the first play from scrim­mage, and eight plays, 23 yards, and four minutes later, sophomore Greg Bell went over the Spartan goal from one yard out to boost Notre Dame to a lead it never relinquished. 
"I thought we had to establish some­thing early," commented Michigan State coach Muddy Waters about the simple dive play which proved to be the begin­ning of the end for his Spartans. "In­stead, it took us a whole half to re­cuperate. It was a bomb that exploded in our face." 
That explosion's repercussions still were evident on Notre Dame's second series, as Bell and his teammates took less than two minutes to travel 70 yards and put the Irish up by 14 points. The native of Columbus, Ohio, gained 51 of his 127 first-half yards in the drive, with the last 32 coming on an unmo­lested third-down jaunt through the heart of a porous Spartan defense. Bell finished the day with 166 yards on 20 attempts, and that didn't include a 75­yard touchdown run early in the second · period that was caiied back because of holding. Those figures pushed the Irish offense over the 300-yard rushing mark for the first time all year, and Notre Dame's 394 total yards and 21 first downs were its best numbers in four games . 
Michigan State, on the other hand, could manage only one first down on the ground all day, and the Spartans finished with a meager 72 yards over­land for the afternoon. Griffith was the bulwark of the revitalized Irish defen­sive front, as he knocked down two Bryan Clark passes to go with two fumble recoveries. 
"It was a good feeling to win," smiled the Kettering, Ohio, native after the game. "We didn't do anything different today th~n we have in the last two games, though. We had a good week of practice and, despite last week's loss, we had good enthusiasm." 
While the Irish may not have done anything different, Waters knew that a definite change in the game plan was in order if his Spartans were going to stay in· the contest. In fact, the new strategy paid quick dividends, as Clark found split end Daryl Turner behind a pair of Notre Dame defenders. The end result of his 63-yard spiral was a Michigan 


State touchdown with only 1:05 left in the half. But, in what proved to be one of the 
more important single minutes of the 1981 season, a poised Irish squad came through when it reaiiy counted, getting Oliver in position for a 38-yard field 
goal attempt with only five seconds on the scoreboard. The left-footed senior from Cincinnati promptly gave the Irish three points, but far more important than the benefits on the scoreboard was the psychological payoff. 
"I really liked the way our team responded after their score," analyzed Faust, who later was presented the game ball. "As far as the game as a whole is concerned, I was impressed with the way our kids rebounded. There comes a time in every football season that a team has to show its mettle. We ex­hibited a little bit of the character of a Notre Dame team today." 
It was this character and intensity which allowed the Irish to coast to their second triumph of the season in the second half. The Notre Dame offense controlled the ball for nearly 20 min­utes of the final half, and only another Oliver field goal (his second of the game -and the year) gave Notre Dame's scoreboard operator a chance to ply his trade. The final 30 minutes couldn't have been more pleasing to Faust, who saw his team play keepaway for the final 5:33 of the game, finishing with the footbali on Michigan State's 16-yard line. 
"We weren't even considering scor­ing," replied Faust to the anonymous boos in the stands at the end of the game. "With 16 seconds to go, ali we wanted was the victory. If some people want to worry about the point spread that's their problem." 
Faust also ·slowed down long enough to address another unseen group­namely, those armchair quarterbacks whose presence had been felt, if not openly acknowledged, this first week in October. 
"I didn't even think about the pres­sure this week, even though I had a ticket for China,"· kidded Faust. "The last two weeks have been tough, but the players .and the student body have bent over backwards. The true Notre Dame family will always remain behind you." 
Faust could only hope he had put the prospect of losing behind him as well.

Bowden's Oktoberfest No· Picnic 
By JOHN GATES 
The greatest day in the 28-year coaching career of Bobby Bowden just might have been Gerry Faust's worst. 
"To me,· personally, this is the big­gest win I'll ever have," said Bowden, Florida State's quotable head coach with the down-home, Southern style. "Having wanted to coach all my life, you can imagine what respect I have for a place that produced the likes of Knute Rockne-and a tailback named Ronald Reagan. 
"This one puts us up there with the best of them." 
The Seminoles' 19-13 victory in Notre Dame Stadium-on the heels of Florida State's 36-27 win at Ohio State the previous Saturday-without question marked the high point of their '81 campaign. They would finish out their Oktoberfest schedule-as Bowden liked to call it-by dropping four of their last six games. 
But for Faust, the preseason anticipa­tion continued to turn into midseason frustration as the Irish fell to 2-3. 
"We're getting better," he asserted, "but it's hard to be optimistic. I just never dreamed we'd be two and three at this point. 
"First, though, I've got to keep my­self up. It's been hard for me. I'm just not used to losing." .: 
Faust's Irish had hoped they could move the ball against a Florida State defense that had given up 458 passing yards to Ohio State and 464 rushing yards to Nebraska. And everything went according to form early as Dave Duerson brought back the opening kickoff 36 yards, Notre Dame quickly moved to the Florida State 26 and Harry Oliver bounced a 43-yard field goal off the top of the left upright. 

"That was the first time I thought 

about  the  luck  of  the  Irish,"  said  
Bowden.  
But that  was  as  offensive  as Notre  

Dame's attack would get in the first 30 minutes. Despite 72 rushing yards from Greg Bell, five of Notre Dame's seven first-half possessions ended in Blair Kiel punts. The only other serious threat fizzled when a fourth-down Tim Koegel pass from the Seminole 27 fell incomplete. 

Meanwhile, Notre Dame's defense 
was gearing up for an expected aerial 
barrage from Florida State quarterback 
Rick Stockstill, who had thrown 25 
completions for 299 yards against Ohio 
State. Stockstill wasted little time, 
throwing on his first four plays and 
including 10 passes among the 13 plays 
he ran in the initial quarter. Only first­
half interceptions by Mark Zavagnin 
and Chris Brown deep in Irish terri­
tory saved Notre Dame. But it finally 
took a 25-yard Mike Rendina field goal 
with 3: 16 left in the half to knot the 
score at three apiece. 
"We came out dry so many times 
there, for a while I felt like a baseball 
coach whose team left 15 runners on 
base," Bowden cracked. 
All that changed in the second half 
as Florida State's well-conceived game 
plan came to fruition. 
After the Irish edged ahead 6-3 on 
another Oliver three-pointer following 
a Mark Zavagnin interception, the 
Seminoles went to work. They did it by 
completely changing their offensive phi­
losophy after lulling the Irish to sleep 
with their short passing game. 
"I didn't think we could start out by 
sustaining drives on the ground," main­
tained Bowden. "So we threw a lot 
early and we had their linemen think­
ing pass, pass, pass. Their front four 
lost some of its discipline because of 
the pass rush, and that's when we went 
to our running game." 
After gaining only six rushing yards in the opening quarter, Florida State came back with 244 in the final ·three. · Stockstill, after throwing 20 first-half passes, threw seven in the last two periods. And tailback Ricky Willhims accounted for I 01 second-half rushing 
yards on his own to set the tone for the 
Seminole strategy reversal. 
"Early in the game, their linemen 
were coming hard on the passes and 
ignoring the run," noted Stockstill. "So 
we started running the draw and they 
were running past it." 
Irish defensive end Kevin Griffith 
had his own version: "We just didn't 
control the line of scrimmage after the 
half. We didn't have the same amount 
of pressure on the quarterback as we 
had in the first half." 
Once Oliver's field goal gave Notre 
Dame the early second-half advantage, 
Florida State began to make its running 
game go. The Seminoles needed less 
than three minutes and only six plays 
to go 80 yards and take the lead for 
good. Williams did most of the damage 
himself by ripping off runs of 20 and 
33 yards. 
Bowden's crew came right back for a 
field goal on its next possession, as only 
a procedure penalty with the ball on 
the one kept Florida State out of touch-down range. A key first down during that march came about, thanks to a 14-yard dipsy-doodle pass from running back Cedric Jones to Stockstill. 

The Seminoles missed yet another opportunity to put points on the board a few minutes later when a Rendina field-goal try from 34 yards went wide right after the Irish had fumbled on their own 22. Then it was Notre Dame's turn to put on an impressive drive. 
The 80-yard Irish march got off the ground quickly, when a Kiel pass for Mike Boushka drew a penalty flag and a 32-yard interference call against the visitors. 
"That was the second time I thought about the luck of the Irish," quipped Bowden. ·.' 
With Kiel throwing and Bell and backup wingback John Mosley running and catching, Notre Dame traveled to within a yard of paydirt-where Bell accounted for the six points and a 13-13 deadlock. 
"Midway through the third quarter I thought we had them," said Seminole defensive tackle Gary Futch. "But they seemed to regain the momentum after Mike (Rendina) missed the field goal and we got called for interference. They seemed to come alive again after that, and I think we knew we were in for a dogfight." 
Florida State's ensuing possession ended in a Rohn Stark punt that went out of bounds on the Notre Dame five -and that poor field position ended up the Irish downfall. Working from perilously close to their own goal line, the Irish managed one first down on a Larry Moriarty 18-yard burst-before a James Harris interception of a Kiel pass set the Seminoles up on Notre Dame's 31. 
"The pass was thrown in the flat underneath the coverage," said Harris. "The quarterback looked me right in the eye, so I was a little surprised· he still threw it." 
In any event, the Seminoles needed only five plays to reac}:l the end zone­with fullback Mike Whiting grabbing a five-yard toss from Stockstill for the score, his second of the day. 
The Notre Dame faithful retained some hope when Rendina missed the extra point to leave the Irish only six points away. But three possessions­with both Kiel and Koegel trying their hand under center-didn't advance the Irish past their own 45. The two quarterbacks managed only 41 com­bined passing yards on five completions in 18 attempts, with two interceptions. 
"A team of our caliber shouldn't be going one-for-14 on third-down con­versions," remarked Kiel. "Their de­fensive backs did a great job of con­tainment, but we shouldn't have that many breakdowns in key situations." 
As frustrated as anyone was Irish senior captain Bob Crable, despite his 19 tackles-"We would knock them out for two plays and then we would let up and they would blow by us on third down. We just had too many mental breakdowns. 
"I guess I understand this, but I just never expected it. It's all like a dream ... a nightmare. We're not used to it. T keep waiting to wake up." 


The Irish spent much of the afternoon trying to pressure Seminole quarterback Rick Stockstill, with Bob Crable (left) and Tim Marshall each taking his turn. 

Notre Dame's injury situation-with a lengthy list of starters missing from the game-didn't help. But Faust didn't want to alibi: "We knew going in that we were in pretty bad shape physically. We just hoped to get through it." 
Instead, it was the Seminoles who got through the afternoon to become only the third team since 1943 to emerge victorious in their first visit to Notre Dame Stadium. 
"This Oktoberfest ain't so bad, yet,'' said Bowden, referring to his October slate of opponents that included -in addition to Notre Dame-Ohio State, Pitt and LSU, all of them on the road. 
"This is the greatest thing that's happened to me. I never believed we'd be where we are (4-1). I figured we'd be 2-3 at best. I expected to be feeling pretty bad by this time."

Everything But a Win 
By JOHN HEISLER 

For the fourth time in five games, the scoreboard put the bad news up in lights for Irish football fans to see. 
Yes, Notre Dame had lost again, this time 14-7 to USC thanks to a Trojan touchdown with less than five minutes to go in the game. 
Yes, the Irish now stood 2-4-not exactly where Gerry Faust had hoped they would be. 
But, for a variety of reasons, it was a whole new Faust who came off the Notre Dame Stadium turf with his hopes renewed. The shaken, dishevelled Faust who had faced the media after Michigan, Purdue and Florida State had given way to a Faust who was mustering as much pride as he could in defeat. 
"Today our team came of age," he noted, with looks of confidence and self-assurance replacing those of pain and anguish that accompanied the pre­vious three losses. 
"We're going to be okay. This may not have been a win today but it was the best football we've played all year. We executed very well. I can't ask them to play any better than they did." 
After a half season of having lots of little things go wrong, consider the things that finally went right for Faust and his team against the Trojans: · 
• 
Notre Dame found some con­sistency at quarterback where sopho­more Blair Kiel started and went the distance. He completed 12 of 23 at­tempts for 115 yards. "It helped my confidence all the way around knowing I was going to play the whole game," said Kiel. "It made me feel good to be able to go out and set my own tempo." 

• 
Faust and his staff junked the idea of playing gifted junior Tony Hunter at wingback after a five-week experiment. This time-:-mainly because of injuries to pass-catchers Mike Boushka and Dave Condeni-he opened at split end and made five catches for 76-yards. ''Tony looked like the Hunter of old catching the ball out there, didn't he?" asked Faust. 

• 
The Irish finally came into a game with a clean bill of health. Five -regu­lars-guard Randy Ellis, tailback Phil Carter, cornerback John Krimm, line­backer Joe Rudzinski and tight · end Dean Masztak -who sat out the Flor-




USC's Marcus Allen didn't gain an easy yard all afternoon in his visit to Notre Dame Stadium. Though he led the Trojans with 147 yards and scored the first USC touchdown-that effort marked his lowest single-game yardage total during the regular 
season. 
ida State game all came back to start against USC. 
• Notre Dame suffered through no interceptions and only one lost fumble, 

·that with 11 seconds to go. The only penalty called against the Irish was taken deliberately and was refused by 
usc. 
• 
The Irish held their own in the trenches against the mammoth USC of­fensive and defensive lines. The total yardage figures showed 312 yards for Notre Dame and 264 for the Trojans. 

• 
Notre Dame allowed only 46 pass­ing yards, its best effort of the season in the pass defense department. Even­tual Reisman Trophy winner Marcus Allen, though he gained 147 yards, had his lowest single-game output of the '81 campaign. "He's a great athlete but we did a good job against him," said Faust. 

• 
Notre Dame's Phil Carter matched Allen yard for yard and finished with 161 of his own. "I've never played against a player who is so quick," said USC linebacker Neil Hope. 


To put it simply, the entire after­noon was encouraging -to Faust, to his players and to the Irish fans. A 2-4 ·record somehow was easier for every­one to stomach with the notion that at least Faust's team finally was headed in the right direction. That feeling had been absent the first three times the Irish came up on the short end of the score. 
Notre Dame's defense was masterful in a first half that ended with no scor­
24 
ing. Both times the Trojans penetrated Irish territory Faust's crew came through with critical third-down plays. 
Midway through the first quarter­after USC had driven from its own 20 to the Notre Dame 28 -USC coach John Robinson ·faced a third-and-13 call. But Mike Larkin zipped through the protection untouched and zapped Trojan quarterback John Mazur for a 14-yard loss. 
The next time USC had the ball it moved 43 yards to the Irish 37 where it confronted a third-and-two situation. This time Tony Belden trapped Allen for a four-yard loss. Both big plays for the Irish knocked USC out of field-goal range and forced punts instead. 
The Trojans made a big play of their own on Notre Dame's first possession when freshman Jack Del Rio sacked · Kiel for a 13-yard loss after the Irish had advanced to the USC 35. The only other threat produced a missed 20-:yard field goal by Harry Oliver after Notre Dame had traveled to the USC two, thanks mostly to 37 rushing yards by Carter. 
Robinson after the game described it as "a heavyweight fight that wouldn't be decided until the 12th or 13th round." His Trojans recorded the first knockdown midway through the third period with a potent left-right-left com­bination. 
First, Mazur scrambled for 24 yards~ Then, fullback Todd Spencer slipped through the middle for 27 yards. Finally, Allen skittered around the right side for 14 yards and six points. 
But the Irish wasted little time com­ing off the canvas. They took the kick­off and needed eight plays to traverse the length of the field to tie the game, Carter carrying the final five yards after personally accounting for 31 others on the march. 
That left the fourth period for the two teams to slug it out toe-to-toe. The Irish missed a chance to go ahead on points on the third play of the quarter when Oliver missed another three-point opportunity, this time from 24 yards. 
But USC finally pressed the Irish to the ropes when a David Pryor punt was downed on Notre Dame's three-yard line. Four plays later, after Kiel was forced to punt from his own end zone, the Trojans took over on the Irish 44. Allen got 21 yards on the first play and Spencer surprised the Irish again, one play later, by countering up the middle for 26 yards and the deciding score. 
"The last thing I said in the huddle was, 'Watch the fullback on the trap,'" said Irish linebacker Bob Crable. "They shouldn't have gotten an inch with the defense we were in. But it was one little breakdown -that's the way it has been all year." 
"We don't give Spencer the football more than once a month," said Robin­sO'n. "But when people really focus on Allen like Notre Dame did, you have to do something." 
Though less than five minutes re­mained, the Irish weren't yet down for the count. A Joe Howard 56-yard kick­off return immediately put thein in enemy territory, but Carter couldn't negotiate the necessary yardage on fourth-a.nd-one from the USC 33. 


"It was the right call," said Robin­son. "It just didn't work." · 
"And all we ·needed was three or four inches," said a frustrated Phil Pozderac, shaking his head after the game. 
Kiel gave it one more shot in the final minute and completed three passes to push his teammates to the Trojan 26. But the football slipped out of his grasp as he lay pinned on the ground after scrambling for a yard, and Chip Banks recovered with 11 seconds remaining. 
The Monday morning quarterbacks thought longingly of the two short field goals that went wide. Both combined wouldn't have won the football game, but. they certainly could have changed the Irish strategy in the final period.. 
"The first one I just missed," said Oliver. "And I should have waited on the second one. The snap was a little high and the ball wasn't quite in posi­tion when I kicked it." 
But it wasn't a day for long faces in the Irish dressing quarters. ­
"I feel like we've improved 200 per­cent over what we've been doing," sug­gested offensive guard Mike Shiner. "We came off the ball today like we never have before. I think they· (the Trojans) knew they were in for a dog­fight from the first play." 
Crable echoed his teammate's 

thoughts: 
"We've improved so much over the year that it makes it hurt that much more to lose. We played our guts out and just didn't come out on top." 
"Give credit to USC's defense," added Kiel. "They stopped us and didn't let us do the things we wanted to in the fourth quarter. I can't fault anybody. It was just two great football teams out there. I don't think we ever let up or lost any momentum. We just didn't win it." 
Robinson agreed with Kiel's assess­ment of his defense. 
"Our defense gives up a lot but it's hard to score on. We absorb and ab­sorb and absorb. We get wounded a lot, but we usually hold on." 
He also had a word of encourage­ment for the rookie coach on the other sideline: 
"Things aren't going very well for Gerry Faust right now, but he'll get things going. There was something about the look in his eye after the game that impressed the heck out of me." 
Faust had to have a pint of blood drained Sunday from his previously­injured knee, thanks tQ a sideline colli­sion Saturday with USC linebacker Chip Banks. "We were both on the ground, and we looked at each other and asked each other if we were okay," laughed the Irish head· coach a day later. 
Faust wasted ·little time bouncing back to his feet that afternoon -and neither did his football team.

A Whole New Arsenal 
By JOHN LE\VANDOWSKI 
"/ just don't want our kids to get down. I don't want our coaches to get down. If you learn from a loss like that, you can make these kinds of games worth­while." 
-Gerry Faust following Notre Dame's 25-7 loss to Michigan 
* * * 
"Florida State is an excellent football team. I was really impressed with their team speed. They've got skilled athletes with great speed in key positions." 
-Gerry Faust following Notre Dame's 19-13 loss to Florida State 
* * * 
Gerry Faust may have had only five college games under his belt, but the 46-year-old Notre Dame head coach proved to be a quick learner. 
It didn't take him long to find out that losing wasn't to his liking. He also 

· discovered firsthand that the trend in collegiate football is toward total team speed. 
With those ideas in mind, Faust and his Irish unleashed a handful of top secret offensive weapons against the 
U.S. Naval Academy. And Bob Crable, Notre Dame's secretary of defense, led the Irish stop troops in keeping the Middie artillery under wraps all after­
noon. 
The '81 season had been billed as the year of new looks for the Irish­a new coach, a new revamped offense and new blue jerseys. But Navy re­
ceived a few more surprises than it bargained for in its 38-0 loss to Notre Dame. 
First, freshman speed demon Joe Howard made a surprise start at split end and ran circles around the Middie secondary. He caught five passes for 115 yards. 
Then, Tony Hunter played tight end, his third position in three games, as if the spot had been created just for him. 
Finally, Greg Bell resurfaced in the lineup at wingback. 
And the man who enjoyed the new faces in different places the most was quarterback· Blair Kiel. He took ad­vantage of the new situation by putting on his best passing performance of his 
· young collegiate career. 
·~.·. 
.· >J 

Freshman Joe Howard wasted little time once he earned his opportunity to play wide receiver for the Irish. He made five grabs for 115 yards and one score and notched another touchdown on an end-around play. 
Kiel, who performed admirably in a close loss to Southern California the previous week, threw for two touch­downs in a 13-of-25 passing effort and ran for another score to key the vic­tory. No one appreciated the lineup changes more than the Columbus, Ind., native. 
"Tony (Hunter) can help you any­where and a talent like Joe Howard should be used somewhere," said Kiel. 
Although it was the offense that stole the headlines, it was the Irish defense that set the tone of the game early. Following the opening kickoff, the Middie offense netted just five yards in three plays. The defense gave the of­fense excellent field position as Bumper Schiro got a hand on Steve Fehr's punt, and the Irish took possession at the Navy 45. 
Notre Dame didn't waste any time showcasing its new split end. On the first play from scrimmage, Kiel hit Howard on a square-out good for 34 yards and a first down at the Middie 11. Howard's natural abilities were quite evident on the play, as he beat Elliot Reagans to the corner and then had ample time to come back for the under­thrown ball. 
Following a Phil Carter run that ad­vanced the ball to the seven, Kiel scrambled to the one on a determined run, hulling for the goal line, after being flushed out of the pocket. On the next play, Kiel called his own number and the Irish were out in front and never looked back. 
Just six minutes later, the Irish reached paydirt again. This time, Howard showed that he knew not only how to catch the ball but also how to run it, too. Kiel threw a crunching block at the corner as the Clinton, Md., flash motored around right end for 13 yards and the score. 
"It worked exactly as it had in practice," explained the exhausted neo­phyte receiver. "It always seemed that just one guy would come through. I wasn't sure whether to cut inside him or not-he stopped when I stopped, and then I just beat him to the corner. I didn't see Kiel's block but I heard it was a good one. All I saw was bodies flying." 
Notre Dame's physical strength proved one of the keys to the game. Navy, which saw its record fall to 5-3, certainly had the bruises to prove it after a physical and injury-marred con­test. 
"I think we just got overpowered again,"· explained Navy coach George Welsh whose squad suffered its 18th straight setback at the · hands of the Irish. "Notre Dame is just too good for us." 
The mismatch continued on the first Irish possession of the second quarter. Notre Dame put together an impres­sive 83-yard scoring drive that was magnificently orchestrated by Kiel. The gutsy sophomore signal caller was five-of-six throwing the football in the drive including two fine tosses to Hunter. 
On a third-down play from the Irish 19, Kiel drilled the ball down the middle to Hunter who was sandwiched between three defenders. The 35-yard completion put the Irish back in busi­ness at the Navy 46. When it appeared the offense had bogged down, it was again the Kiel-to-Hunter combo that did it. On a fourth-and-two call at the Middie 27, Kiel executed a beautiful play-action pass as he lofted the ball over a linebacker to Hunter who took it in midstride and carried it the dis­tance. 
The Fighting Irish notched one more score to increase their halftime advan­tage to 28-0. The scoring drive took just one play and' it consumed 11 sec­onds. Following a Middie punt, Kiel reared back and hit Howard at the 18. He eluded two tacklers and skipped into the end zone for 52 yards and his second touchdown of the afternoon. 

Meanwhile, Notre Dame's defense kept the Navy offense at bay. The Middies registered just one first down while mustering only 15 yards on the ground before intermission. 
Crable, who recorded 14 tackles, knew the team was ready. 
"I think last week (Southern Cal) was a tremendous letdown," he said. "We played so well, but not well enough to win. We seemed flat before this game, but we held a team meeting and got our heads screwed on straight. This team just had something to prove to itself." 
It was the punishing Notre Dame de­fense that got the ball back in the second half. Linebacker Mark Zavagnin blasted through the line five minutes into the second half and forced quar­terback Marco Pagnanelli to cough up the ball on the option-and Joe Rud­zinski pounced on the loose ball at the Navy 23. 
The Middie defense held and the Irish settled for a 37-yard field goal by 
Harry Oliver, extending the Notre Dame lead to 31-0. The Irish closed out the scoring with 
9:30 to play when Tim Koegel capped off a 40-yard drive by hitting Larry Moriarty with a 20-yard swing pass over the middle. 
Kiel finished the afternoon with 225 yards passing while directing the Notre Dame offense to 442 yards, a total yardage figure that would rank as its best of the year. The Irish defense sur­rendered a meager 123 yards (also a season best), including just 36 yards on the ground. 
"We didn't specifically intend to pass as much as we did," explained Kiel. "We just decided to take advantage of what Navy gave us. Fortunately, the pass routes we used were effective ones. A lot of credit has to go to the re­ceivers and the offensive line. They gave me a lot of time to throw and our re­ceivers came back on a few floaters." 
Navy received plenty of tricks on a brilliant Halloween afternoon, -but there were no treats for the men from An­napolis. For Irish fans, though, the biggest treat was 5-9, 165-pound fresh­man Joe Howard who masqueraded as a split end. 
His was a name for Irish fans to remember.

Georgia Tech 
Not Just a· Regular Joe 
By MICHAEL KEANE 

It was almost ironic that, in the final home game of the careers of the Notre Dame seniors, a freshman made the big play which lifted the Irish out of their first-quarter lethargy and led them to a 35-3 victory over Georgia Tech. 
For the second straight Saturday, Joe Howard became the most talked-about Notre Dame football player as he caught only two passes for 154 yards and two touchdowns. 
Howard's accomplishments were hardly the only story of the game. This Georgia Tech contest was a haiimark for several reasons. 
First, it was the last scheduled meet­ing between Notre Dame and the Yellow Jackets, thereby putting at least a temporary halt to a rivalry begun in 1922. 
Also, this marked the last home game for the Irish seniors. Then there was the added dimension of revenge for the 3-3 tie brought by a lating Howard deep and he just turned sophomore wingback John Mosley

final quarter, when Irish linebacker Bob Crable intercepted a Stu Rogers pass and returned it 33 yards to the Tech 26. From there senior Tim Koegel, who had started four of the first five games, engineered a six-play drive which ended when· he hit Mosley for a 14-yard touchdown, making. the score 28-3. 
Faust then worked to get as rriany seniors into the game as he could, a mission he accomplished. 
Three seniors stood out on the next Irish possession as Koegel, who went six-of-seven for 64 yards, hit tight end Ron Mishler and split end Tim Tripp for big gains. The completion to Tripp marked off the final 10 yards of a 52­yard touchdown drive. For Mishler and Tripp, the receptions represented re­spective milestones in their Notre Dame careers, Mishler's catch qualifying as the first of his career and Tripp's the first for a touchdown iu his four years at Notre Dame. 
The last score came with 10:43 re­maining in the contest, and the rest of the game featured wholesale substitu­tions for the Irish as all the senior walk-ons played. 
"They work hard every day during the week and get no recognition on Saturdays, so it's great that we were able to get everyone on the team in­volved," commented ·Crable. 
The day was also special for Crable. The 6-2 middle linebacker finished the day with 13 tackles; ·leaving him three shy of Bob Golic's -career record. The Cincinnati native had his second career interception, as well, and he left the field to a rousing standing ovation from the student body. 
It seemed Crable was one of the few players who did not set a record during the game. Besides the Howard recep­tion record, Georgia Tech freshman tailback Robert Lavette tied a Tech 
record for most receptions in a game 
and set a record for a Notre Dame op­
ponent by grabbing 14 passes for 58 
yards. 
The victory raised Notre Dame's rec­

ord to 4-4, the first time the Irish had 
been at the .500 level since the· fourth 
•week of the year. The game also marked.· the second straight week the Irish had thoroughly defeated an oppo­nent on the scoreboard, and the win kept Notre Dame's bowl hopes alive. 
"I think right now our biggest goal 

is to get to a bowl game. But the only 
way we are going to do that is to win 
the rest of our games," declared Crable. 
Curry commented, "I'm not on the 

selection committees but based on what 
we've seen the last few weeks, Notre 
Dame certainly would qualify." 
Faust, remembering how far-reach­

ing in:edictions hurt his team early in 
the year, stayed away from making 
bowl projections and concentrated on 
his team's play: "We're very pleased 
with our progress. We've been improv­
ing each week on the field. We feel like 
we can score anywhere on the field, 
which helps us immensely." 
Inevitably, the conversation turned 

back to the two-week-old. saga of Joe 
Howard. His coach reflected on the 
dimensions the freshman added to the 
Irish offense. "When you have a man 
at wideout like Joe ' Howard, he's a 
threat for six on every play. When they 
~ouble cover him, it opens up our other: 
receivers)' 
Howard seemed anything but be­

wildered by his most recent accom­
plishments. 
"I feel great these last two weeks. 

It's like I'm back in high school. I 
have a lot of confidence now and it's 
picking up in every game." 
And so it was that a little child led them....

Air Force 



Fending Off the Falcons 
By BILL MARQUARD A dogfight. How else could one describe a 
tighter-than-expected battle between the Falcons of Air Force and the blue and gold barons of Notre Dame? 
"I sure don't feel like we were just in a 35-7 ballgame," sighed Irish Coach Gerry Faust in the aftermath of the contest. "That was an exciting game­too exciting." 
Could this be an example of Faust building up a less-than-formidable Irish opponent after soundly defeating it on the football field? 
Hardly, when one realizes the final score was a far cry from the scant 14-7 advantage the Irish enjoyed with less than 14 minutes left in the game. 
Hardly, when one realizes the Air Force mounted a persistent 16-play, 80-yard drive to snap the 11-quarter string of consecutive frames without allowing a touchdown which the Irish 

. had fashioned over the last three games. 
Hardly, when one realizes the Fal­cons shut down Notre Dame's long passing attack, particularly the Blair Kiel-to-Joe Howard combination, and allowed a long pass of only 26 yards all afternoon. 
"They were really prepared for us. We couldn't get anything deep," re­marked starting quarterback Kiel, who completed five of 13 passes for 66 yards despite spending 48 hours in the hospital with a severe virus the week before the game. 

On the other side of the tunnel, Air Force coach Ken Hatfield didn't feel well, but for a different reason. "I'm just sick about that final score. I think we played better than to come up with that." 
The Irish·. jumped to an early ad­vantage in the game on the strength of two Phil Carter scoring runs in the first half, the second two-touchdown day of the junior tailback's career. The first capped a 59-yard drive on Notre

back. We made some changes in our linebacker Bob Crable and scuttled nine 

yards into the end zone. 

"I gave him a good shot, but I just didn't grab him and put him down," explained Crable, who had an otherwise memorable game in setting Notre Dame's career tackle record. "We drifted or floated a little too much on defense -Air Force is a good team." 
"During that long drive I was really sucking air," said defensive end Tony Belden after catching his breath in the lockerroom. "I got the wind knocked out of me once and kept going, but when it happened a second time I had to come out just to catch my breath." 
"Our offensive line came back into the huddle and said their defense was dogging it," related Antoine. "We sensed they were tiring and took ad­vantage of it." 
But the Falcons took a tad too much of an advantage, for the Irish suddenly found their second wind and exploded for three fourth-quarter touchdowns, their highest single-stanza outburst of the season. 

Gerry Faust: 'Air Force did an excellent job of preparing for us. . . . But when the chips were down we came through.' 
Tim Koegel, spelling a worn-out Kiel, directed the Irish 71 yards in four plays for a Greg Bell touchdown and an­other 14-point Notre Dame advantage. 
"I'm a little tired," offered Kiel after the game. "I think they took me qut of the game at a good time-I certainly wasn't going to complain." 
And when: the Falcons' second­chance scoring effort stalled on the Irish 40, Notre Dame decided to put a lock on the scoreboard for the balance of the game. Koegel directed his troops down the field for a five-yard Larry Moriarty touchdown run, and freshman quarter­back Ken Karcher had the easiest job of all, han~ing off. ·to classmates Chris Smith and then Mark Brooks to engi­neer a two-play, 32-yard scoring march. 
"They came ready to play, on of­fense and defense," said Carter, who topped the 1 00-yard plateau for the third time this season· and eighth in his career with 156 yards. 'They were ob­viously prepared for us, especially our Phil Carter, Greg Bell and John Sweeney celebrate in the end zone as the Irish win their third straight, a 35-7 triumph thanks to a late Irish rally. 

passing game. But our running game 
worked pretty well, so we didn't have 
to rely on the pass." 
Ironically, both teams' air attacks 
yielded to their ground counterparts, 
the Irish gaining 276 yards on the 
ground and only 110 in the air, while 
the Falcons ground out 166 rushing 
yards and only earned 61 through the 
air. And when it came to the trenches, 
Notre Dame discovered two outstand­
ing rookie performers in Joe Bars and 
Mike Gann. 

"I think all of the freshmen played well," offered defensive end Kevin . Griffith. "Especially when they weren't 
prepared to play such a major role." 
Bars got the nod at linebacker when 
second-stringer Rick Naylor (a starting li~eup replacement for Joe Rudzinski who had recurring shoulder problems and did not make the trip) went down with a bruised thigh in the first half. Gann was summoned by the Irish coaches when Griffith took a shot to the knee and was rested for precau­tionary measures. 
"Air Force did an excellent job of preparing for us," remarked Faust after his Irish had climbed above the .500 mark again with their third straight win., "They had a week off and had won two straight games-those were big things we knew we'd have to cope with . 
"But when the chips were down we came through."

Penn State 
Close to an Irish Classic 
By KELLY SULLIVAN 

The 1Oth week of the 1981· season saw Notre Dame preparing for yet an­other of the country's best teams in Penn State-the fifth Irish opponent ranked among the Top 20. It also pitted Gerry Faust against Joe Paterno, one of the most well-known and most suc­cessful coaches in the college game. That might have been a disturbing thought to some coaches, but not Notre Dame's optimistic head man. 
"Anytime you get the opportunity to go up against a giant like Joe Paterno, it's a real honor," he told reporters that week. "I consider it a thrill just to be able to stand on the same field with him." 
There were other reasons Faust was wearing a smile. His team was riding a three-game winning streak that put its record over the .500 mark for the first time since the LSU game. The offense had compiled some impressive statistics in recent outings. And, despite a 5-4 record, bowl scouts still had eyes on the Irish. 
Yet the Notre Dame players were concerned about more than bowl in­vitations. They were concerned about respectability. Yes, they had beaten Navy, Georgia Tech and Air Force on consecutive Saturdays. "But we really wanted to beat Penn State badly," re­called fullback John Sweeney. "We wanted to show people that our last three wins weren't flukes, and that we could play with a good team." 
Notre Dame's bid for a fourth straight win failed. However, their bid for respectability did not. The game was as close as the 24-21 final indi­cated. 
"It was a classic," offered Paterno. 

"Yeah, it was a heck of a game for 


spectators but a heartbreaker for coaches," remarked Faust, who saw his squad drop its fourth game by seven or fewer points. "I'd sure like to be on the other side of those close ones for a change." 
Coming up short again understand­ably upset the Irish coach. But neither Faust nor the more than 84,000 fans who jammed Beaver Stadium that after­noon could have been disappointed with what they saw. They got offense­and plenty of it-right from the start. 
Penn State took the opening kickoff and, thanks to a couple of big plays, went up 7-0 only 40 seconds into the game. The Irish returned the favor on ,I their first series. Quarterback Blair Kiel

But, while Notre Dame sputtered for a time, the Nittany Lions rolled on, building a 1 0-point advantage in the second quarter. It mattered little to Penn State that top rusher Curt Warner was sidelined with an injury. His back­up, Jon Williams, enjoyed a banner day; he gained 192 yards, the highest totaled by any back against the Irish all season. 
However, Notre Dame came to life, and a seesaw battle ensued. Tackle Tim

Marshall recovered a Penn State fumble that set up a Kiel-to-Tony Hunter score right before halftime. Linebacker Bob Crable intercepted a Penn State pass that set up a Kiel-to-John. _Sweeney strike right after the half. The Irish gained control of both the scoreboard and the momentum. 
And they threatened to put things out of reach for Penn State, driving to the Lions' four-yard line with about 10 minutes remaining. 
But from there, things quickly turned sour for Notre Dame. Faust's troops couldn't punch the ball over in three tries, and on fourth down, they passed up what looked like a sure three points. 
"A field goal would've just set it up for a tie," explained Faust. "We're not out there to tie, we're out there to win. We only had a half yard to go-when you're that close, you've got to go out there for the win." 
However, the Irish got nowhere on their next play. Penn State put on a tremendous stand that stopped Greg Bell cold and swung momentum back in the Nittany Lions' direction. 
They intercepted a Kiel pass on Notre Dame's next possession. "It wasn't the smartest play on my part," admitted Kiel. The turnover marred an otherwise fine showing; he threw for 183 yards and a pair of touchdowns that day. "I tried to lob the ball to Phil (Carter) and I never should have." 
And then, Williams' best efforts came at the worst time for Notre Dame. He brought the Lions down the field, gain­ing a total of 46 yards on three plays early in the drive. They quickly moved the ball into the end zone and took the lead for good. 
"We didn't play very well at all on that last drive," admitted Crable. "In fact, we played lousy. And I don't know why." 
Joe Paterno had a guess. "Our kids thought Notre Dame might have gotten a little tired on that drive. But that's what football games are all about. Two teams are in there slugging it out, and when one gets some momentum, they go with it." 
The Irish were forced to go home with a 5-5 record-and forced to wait another week before discovering if their bid for a winning season would be suc­cessful. 
Faust, who'd seen measurable im­provement in his team since its last de­feat, admitted that this was one of his toughest losses. 
But, without hesitation, he · added, "They're all tough."

Miami 






No Fun in the Sun 
By KELLY SULLIVAN 
There were no tears this time, as there had been after early-season losses to Michigan, Purdue and Florida State. Gerry Faust had learned to deal with defeat a little better by now. 
He said he even learned from defeat. "I learned I don't like to lose." But the lesson was a painful one for him and his players. 
He stood amid reporters on the floor of the Orange Bowl, where his team had just been clobbered 37-15 on na­tional television by Miami. He had just concluded his first season at the school of his dreams with a 5-6 record, Notre Dame's first losing season in 18 years. Only four Irish coaches prior to Faust had finished a schedule with more de­feats than victories. 
"I sure don't want to go down in his­tory that way," he admitted. "There haven't been many tougher years for me as a coach than this." 
Few expected the 1981 schedule to be easy on the man from Moeller, but a 5-6 record? "I don't think anyone thought this was possible," said All­America linebacker Bob Crable. "We had almost everyone back from last year. When you have everyone back you're supposed to improve, but we didn't do a very good job at that." 
"I was 5-5 during my sophomore year in high school," remembered quar­terback Blair Kiel. "But I can't ever re­call having a losing season." 
"This really hurts because it was supposed to be a good year this year. We were supposed to go out and win 
it all."  ·  
*  *  *  
Miami  coach  Howard  Schnellen­ 

berger said the stage was set for some­
thing "classical" to happen. For his players, on NCAA probation and banned from postseason play, the Notre Dame game was their substitute bowl, their chance to vindicate a 32-14 drubbing by the Irish the previous year in South Bend, and a chance to show the country that the Hurricane football team had arrived. They accomplished all of the above. 
"This is the greatest day in Miami football history," claimed the coach. 
"I've been waiting for this for four years," shouted senior defensive end Tim Flanagan. "We finally did it." 
"This wraps up four years of hard work toward respectability and national prominence for us," explained All­American safety Fred Marion. "When I first came here we couldn't even stay on the field with Notre Dame." 
Miami not only stayed on the same

field, they also marched up and down it, churning out 462 yards of offense, compared to 200 for Notre Dame. They put on one of the best halve~ of football ever played against the Irish, rolling up a 30-6 halftime lead on three Dan Miller field goals, a pair of Jim Kelly touchdown passes, and a four­yard run by flanker Mike Rodrigue. 
That scamper came on the Hurri­canes' first possession, and, in response, Notre Dame's Greg Bell returned the ensuing kick-off 98 yards for a score. The extra point was missed. It was 7-6. It never got any closer. 
Kelly, a junior slinger from East Brady, Pa., proceeded to tear the Irish secondary apart with his record-setting passing. He hit 17 of 25 for 264 yards (238 in the first halO. 
Phil Carter: 'We knew they were a good defensive team. We knew that we had to go out and execute. We didn't do it.' 

"He's one of the best, if not the best, we've played," praised Notre J:?ame cornerback John Krimm. "His biggest asset is the way he read our coverages. He was checking off all day, and he usually made the right decision." 
"Kelly puts the long pass on the money better than anybody I've seen," echoed Crable, stalwart of the defense which, on this day, gave up its most points in three seasons. "Besides, our pass coverage was no good and our pass rush was no good. What else is there?" 
There was an equally disappointing performance on offense. The Irish failed to cross midfield until the second half. They scored only on Harry Oliver's 36-yard boot in the third quarter, and Dave Duerson's 88-yard interception return in the fourth. 
Kiel was 1 0-for-25 in the air for 90 yards, 77 of them to split end Joe Howard. The sophomore quarterback also threw two interceptions, and went to the sidelines after one of them, on Notre Dame's first series. Faust sent senior Tim Koegel in to replace him. 

Kiel admitted he was surprised by the move, but that (unstable quarterback situation and the game itself "typified our whole season -up and down, shaky and disappointing." 
Koegel failed to generate the Irish, though, and Kiel came back in. Still, nothing worked. 
"We knew they were a good de­fensive team," said tailback Phil Carter, held to 33 yards rushing on 12 at­tempts. "We knew that we had to go out and execute. We didn't do it." 
And the Irish were at a loss at ex­plaining why. 
"Miami was just as good as USC and Penn State and Michigan," offered line­backer Joe Rudzinski. "But we should have played better. It was real frus­trating getting beat like this. This loss doesn't sit well with me." 
"You can't put your finger on any one thing," Crable said. "It's just devas­tating to realize you're a part of the first losing team in decades. It hurts." 
The seniors were forced to end their Notre Dame careers painfully. But their younger teammates insisted the wounds would heal, the Irish would recover. 
"This isn't the end of Notre Dame," Rudzinski emphasized. "This was just one bad season and I know we'll be back next year. Notre Dame's out for the season, but not out forever." 
"This is college football tradition at its best," added defensive end Jon Autry. "We will follow our tradition by bouncing back and being No. 1 again. This is Notre Dame." 
However, the Irish won't easily for­get the important lesson taught them by Michigan, Purdue, Florida State, South­ern California, Penn State and finally, the Hurricanes. 
"We learned that you win and lose on the football field," reminded Kiel, "and that the Notre Dame tradition can't win it for you."

Notes on Notre Dame 
Irish Items: Football '81 
By JOHN HEISLER 

• 
Notre Dame senior linebacker BOB CRABLE proved to be the most decorated Irish All-American in 1981. He was a first-team pick on squads chosen by the Associated Press, United Press International, the American Foot­ball Coaches Association (the Kodak team), Walter Camp, Football News and Tlze Sporting News. Senior corner­back JOHN KRIMM was a first-team pick by Tlze Sporting News and NEA (Newspaper Enterprise Association) and an honorable mention choice by the Associated Press. Junior strong safety DAVE DUERSON received third-team mention from Football News, and se­nior tackle PHIL POZDERAC also was an Associated Press honorable mention selection. Split end JOE HOWARD was chosen for Football News' fresh­man All-America team. That publica­tion's Sophomore All-America squad included cornerback STACEY TORAN on its first team and tailback GREG BELL and defensive end JON AUTRY on its second team. 

• 
BOB CRABLE also was one of four finalists for the Lombardi Award which eventually was won by Kenneth Sims of Texas. The other two finalists were Sean Farrell of Penn State ·and Billy Ray Smith of Arkansas. Though Crable was invited to attend the De­cember 10 awards banquet in Houston, he chose to stay home and attend Notre Dame's annual football banquet that same night. Notre Dame athletic direc­tor GENE CORRIGAN served as the University representative at the Lom­bardi affair. 

• 
At the football banquet, sponsored for the 62nd year by the Notre Dame Club of St. Joseph Valley, BOB CRABLE received the Most Valuable Player award. It marked the second straight year he earned that honor from 


Notre Dame's National Monogram Club. PHIL POZDERAC was named the Outstanding Offensive Player, while JOHN KRIMM was honored as the Outstanding Defensive Player. All three awards were presented on the basis of voting by Irish players. 
• 
The Notre Dame squad also elected its captains for the '82 season-and a trio ·of seniors will share those duties next fall. Tailback PHIL CARTER and linebacker MARK ZAVAGNIN will join DAVE DUERSON as tri­captains for Gerry Faust's secpnd Irish team. Carter also shared that post with Crable in '81. 

• 
JOHN KRIMM, defensive end KEVIN GRIFFITH and MARK ZA­VAGNIN all were honored for their academic achievements. Krimm was one of six Division I football players to receive a $2,000 NCAA post-graduate scholarship announced January 1. He also received the scholar-athlete award from the Notre Dame Club of St. Joseph Valley. Griffith received the John H. McMullen Award, presented annually to the Notre Dame player who best exemplifies the spirit of the scholar­athlete who has contributed his skill and ability both on the field and in the classroom. . 

• 
JOHN KRIMM received first-team Academic All-America honors from the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA), while KEVIN GRIFFITH was named to the second team. Krimm boasts a 3.7 grade aver­age (out of a possible 4.0) in philoso­phy, while Griffith has a 3.3 in govern­ment. Both eventually plan to attend law school. Zavagnin earned honorable mention status on the NCAA District 4 Academic All-America squad-with Krimm and Griffith both receiving first­team designation on that unit. 


• Notre Dame's '81 schedule ranked 

28th on the NCAA's final standing of Division I schedules, with Irish oppo­nents compiling a .550 percentage last fall. Past and future Notre Dame oppo­nents on that list included Penn State (1st at .679), Miami (5th at .627), Florida State (7th at .607), Pittsburgh (9th) and Georgia Tech (17th at .568). The '82 Irish schedule adds Pittsburgh (11-1), Arizona (6-5) and Oregon (2-9) -while losing LSU (3-7-1), Florida State (6-5) and Georgia Tech (1-10). 
• 
Here is where Notre Dame ranked as a team in each statistical category: 71 st in total offense (3 28.1 yards per game), 55th in rushing offense (180.5), 72nd in passing offense (147 .6), 64th in scoring offense (21.1), 37th in total de­fense (293.5 yards allowed per game), 68th in rushing defense (166.3), 16th in pass defense (127.2) and 32nd in scoring defense (14.5). 

• 
Despite the difference in records, Notre Dame's '81 team actually out­touchdowned its '80 counterpart. The Irish scored 31 touchdowns on their way to a 5-6 mark last fall after scoring only 27 six-pointers on their way to a 9-1-1 regular-season mark in 1980. 

• 
BOB CRABLE finished his career with 521 tackles, an all-time Notre Dame record. He had 167 stops in '81, and his totals each of the last three years rank among the top four single­season efforts in Irish annals. The Cin­cinnati native started 34 straight games to finish out his career-and led the Irish in tackles in 31 of those contests. 

• 
Notre Dame finished fourth in the nation in kickoff returns with a 25.4­yard average. GREG BELL's 28.5-yard average marked the best by a Notre Dame player in the kickoff return de­partment in 13 years. Had he returned one more kickoff he would have quali­fied for the individual NCAA rankings where he would have stood third. · 



Bob Crable John Krimm Dave Duerson Phil Pozderac Greg Bell 

Blair Kiel Joe Howard Stacey Toran 
• 
GREG BELL's 98-yard kickoff re­turn against Miami marked the third longest in Notre Dame history, the longest by an Irish player in 51 years and the first by an Irish player in eight seasons. DAVE DUERSON's 88-yard interception against the Hurricanes stands as the fifth longest in Notre Dame history. BLAIR KIEL's 96-yard pass to JOE HOWARD against Georgia Tech stands as the longest ever in Irish history. 

• 
PHIL CARTER now stands 13th on Notre Dame's career rushing list. He heads into his senior season with 1,694 yards. TONY HUNTER ranks fourth on the career receptions list with 78 for 1,390 yards and a 17.8-yard average per grab. BLAIR KIEL's 73 punts last fall mark the most ever by an Irish player in a single season. HARRY OLIVER finished his career with 24 field goals, second behind Dave Reeve on Notre Dame's career charts. 

• 
Notre Dame, as a team, lost only six fumbles during the '81 season, tying a 40-year-old Irish team record for least fumbles lost in a season. The Irish defense earned the distinction of hold­ing USC Reisman Trophy winner Marcus Allen to the lowest single-game yardage total of his 11 regular-season outings last fall. He managed 147 yards against the Irish that day. 


o Notre Dame·· drew 354,450 fans to its six home games last fall. That consistent average of 59,075 per game ranked 24th in the nation. The 105,888 fans who watched the Irish pla:r Michi­gan in Ann Arbor formed the fifth largest crowd ever to sec Notre Dame play football. The 84,175 figure at Penn State stands 22nd on that list. 
• Notre Dame's '81 schedule in-eluded four teams that played in bowl games-Michigan (Bluebonnet), USC (Fiesta), Navy (Liberty) and Penn State (Fiesta). Three other teams on the slate came close to qualifying for post-season play. Purdue owned a nifty 5-2 mark at midseason before losing its last four. Florida State would have qualified for the Peach Bowl if the Seminoles had beaten Florida in their season finale. And Miami's 9-2 mark would have earned it a bid if the Hurricanes hadn't been on NCAA probation. 
o Notre Dame stood 4-2 in home games played last fall and 1-4 away from Notre Dame Stadium. That over­all figure marked the first time in his­tory the Irish ever owned a final 5-6 mark. 
• 
BOB CRABLE was named the As­sociated Press Midwest Player of the Week on defense for his 13-tacklc per­formance against Georgia Tech. PHIL CARTER was named the Amateur Athlete of the Week by ESPN and Owens-Corning for his 156-yard effo_rt against Air Force. Notre Dame re­ceived two $1,000 scholarships from Chevrolet in the names of BOB CRABLE and JOE HOWARD for its two '81 appearances on ABC-TV. Crable earned his against Michigan while making 20 tackles, and Howard earned his against Miami for making five receptions for 77 yards. 

• 
DAVE DUERSON played more minutes than any other Irish player in 1981, with 345 to his credit. Next on the list were BOB CRABLE (308), STACEY TORAN (300), TOM THAYER (275), MARK FISCHER (271), MIKE SHINER (270), MARK ZAVAGNIN (270), PHIL POZDERAC (264), ROD BONE (249) and TONY

'82 Captains 
They'll Lead the Irish Back 
By GARY GRASSEY 

Notre Dame football players are a restless lot these days. Coming off the first losing season in 18 years of Irish football has left the team and the coach­ing staff feeling only one thing-the fever to get back on the field and redeem themselves. 
While nobody has to remind the coaches about the lapses in concentra­tion and intensity which plagued the Irish throughout the 1981 season, there are three new captains who are de­termined to communicate to the 1982 squad members that there will be no repeats of last year's problems. 
Seniors Phil Carter, Dave Duerson, and Mark Zavagnin form the trio elected by their teammates to give leadership to Notre Dame football this season. Carter, a starter at tailback since his sophomore year, is a repeat selection for the captaincy. All three should rate as pre-season All-America choices. 
"The main thing I do as captain is go out and· lead by example," says Carter. "By going out and working hard at my position, hustling, and doing the little things-that's how I would want everyone else to do it. I think this year, it's not going to take too much motiva­tion to get everyone working hard be­cause we've got a lot to make up for." 
In fact, Carter, Duerson, and Za­vagnin each represent a leadership-by­example style of football that makes them the perfect choices for a Notre Dame captain, according to their coach, Gerry Faust. 
"I couldn't have asked for three better men and representatives of the University," says Faust as he prepares for his second season as head coach. "They exemplify the tradition and spirit of the job and Notre Dame." 
Carter, one of just seven two-time captains in Irish history since 1900, is somewhat the veteran of the trio. But his role as. a team spokesman, he claims, is no more important than any­body else's_.:._just more visible. 
"I know Dave and Mark are very good . leaders themselves," says the Tacoma, Wash., ·native. "Dave is an excellent speaker and a great player. Mark is just the kind of player who's always there-he's consistent and never gets hurt. 
"Dave and Mark are more quiet than Tailback Phil Carter becomes Notre Dame's seventh two-tim~ captain. 


I. am," he adds. "I'm more of a 'rah­rah' and outgoing~ type sometimes, but our styles are pretty similar. We're each trying to play hard all the time at our positions both in practice and games." 
Carter has battled through two in­jury-marred seasons in his career, but a lifetime 1,694-yard rushing total puts him in 13th place on the all-time Irish groundgaining list. His fight with in­juries and his workmanlike ball-carry­ing performances demonstrate the heart Gerry Faust likes to see in his players. 
"Phil is an outstanding talent who will have a tremendous senior year if he keeps working the way he always does," says Faust. 
"The major letdown of my career has been the injuries," explains Carter. "We've been fortunate to have people like Jim Stone and Greg Bell around to 
~-·-~~--, 
do the job. My main goal for this year, which I've been working at, is to stay healthy all season and for the team to be successful, of course.'' 
A 1 000-yard season would put Carter into second place on. the Notre Dame rushing list and no doubt bring the Irish back to winning form. 
Duerson has been a mainstay in the Notre Dame secondary since earning a starting berth at cornerback midway through his freshman campaign. The 6-3, 200-pounder can play any spot in the defensive backfield, but his strong suit is the strong safety slot. Duerson also rates as one of the nation's top punt returners. 
"Being voted captain is one of the proudest feelings I've ever had," says Duerson. "Knowing that I was selected by my peers to be a leader is just a great honor.'' 
Last season was one of the most frus­
trating experiences in Duerson's career. 
His individual stats on defense (55 
tackles, two interceptions, five blocked 
passes) were overshadowed by the 
squad's inability to gel as a unit, espe­
cially compared to 1980 when the Irish 
defense was one of the best in the 
country. 
"One of the biggest jobs for a cap­
tain is getting people ready to concen­
trate," offers Duerson, a Muncie, Ind., 
resident. "We need strong senior lead­
ership, but like I've told a lot of the 
seniors already, we need leadership 
from every last senior on the totem pole 
-not just the captains. There were 
times last year I didn't think we had 
enough of that.'' 
Duerson takes his football seriously 
and has been heartened by the work of 
the returning Irish players during the 
off-season. 
"From the moment we stepped back 
on campus after Christmas, every day 
the players have been working in the 
weight room," he reports. "Some things 
I think we were hurting in last year, 
like strength and quickness, we've' al­
ready started to turn around. My style 
of leadership is strictly by the book­
all work-so I'm glad to see everyone 
pushing himself now. I can't wait to 
get back on the field." 
Throughout his career, Duerson's 
play has been remarkably consistent. 
He is an outstanding talent in baseball 
and basketball as well as football, but 
his major personal goal at Notre Dame 
remains in the classroom in the College 
of Arts and Letters. 
"Making the Academic All-America 
team would be the biggest achievement 
for me, besides winning the national 
championship," he says. "I didn't quite 
make it last semester and I was dis­
appointed.'' 
"Dave is as intelligent a player as he 
is a student," says Gerry Faust. "He 
has to constantly make adjustment calls 
on the field from his position. There 
aren't many players around who handle 
that spot as well as Dave.'' 
Duerson isn't cautious at all when he 
thinks about what will be in store for 
Irish opponents this fall in the way of 
Notre Dame improvement as a team. 
"Most people have never seen Notre Dame as losers, especially the students who are here now," he says. "Mark and Phil and I believe deeply that we can be as successful as we want next season. We've got to say that with a force that will make everyone else believe it, too . .·. "It was always my biggest dream to play football here and I want to go out a winner," he adds. "We're mad, we're upset, and we're embarrassed with last seasori. We're going to put all that 
behind us." 


Str_Qng safety-Dave Duerson also has been Notre Dame's top punt returner each of the last three years. 
Mark Zavagnin steps into a unique ·personal opportunity in 1982, not just 
as the heir-apparent to the tradition 
established by former Irish All-Ameri­
'cans Bob Crable and Bob Golic,· to 
name a couple. Like Crable and Golic, 
Zavagnin will captain the Irish ',from 
the middle linebacker slot as a senior. 
Stepping out of Crable's huge shadow 

of awards and recognition is an oppor­
tunity Zavagnin relishes. Moving from 
his weakside post · to the middle, he 
claims, won't bring about any drastic 
changes. 
"I've learned so much from Bob 

these last few years as a player; a cap­
tain, and a person," says Zavagnin, an 
Evergreen Park, Ill., product. "His rec­
ognition was all well-deserved. But this 
is a chance for me, I think, to see what 
kind of player I really am. I'm pretty 
confident because I have played the 
middle responsibilities quite a bit be­
fore." 
Zavagnin has covered numerous re­

sponsibilities in his first three seasons. 
As a freshman, he earned starting 
berths in two games and has been a 
fulltimer since his sophomore year. The 
6-2, 225-pound Zavagnin has been sec­
ond only to Crable in tackles each of 
the last two years, earning great marks 
as a pass defender and for his ability to stop the run. 
. "Mark is a terrific tackler with great football instincts on the field," says Faust. "He's been a leader just by his presence and dedication to the game. He was a natural choice for captain." 
Last spring, Zavagnin was chosen as the Hering Award winner as the top Irish linebacker during April workouts. His work on special teams paid off with a touchdown against Army after a blocked punt two years ago. And his nose for the ball resulted in three inter­ceptions last season. 
"I think I've improved some each year, but you're never satisfied when the team isn't doing well," he explains. "Nobody at Notre Dame is used to losing football games, and at times I think that hurt our concentration last year as well as our confidence. 
"As captains, Dave and Phil and I probably won't have to work as hard to get everyone's mind _on football after last year," he adds. "We have a lot of veterans coming back (nine of 11 starters on defense) and I think we can be as good as we were two years ago as long as we're consistently ready to play mentally." 
Like Duerson and Carter, Zavagnin is resolved to make consistency an Irish trademark in 1982. 
"I like to think I'm a lot like Dave Duerson on the football field," says Zavagnin. "We've both played a lot these last few years. Neither of us are very outspoken, but . we come to every practice and every game ready to play." 
Playing at a school close to his fam­ily and friends in the Chicago area has made Zavagnin a believer in Notre Dame, a quality he'll no doubt ably express in his role as captain. 
"I always tell people that there isn't a finer place to play football or get an education than Notre Dame," he says. "The people here treat you like they're your brother. Anything the coaching staff tells you, you take it as the truth. It's a great honor to be a captain." 
In one way or another, Phil Carter, Dave Duerson and Mark Zavagnin each embody the essence of Notre Dame greats of the past. While none of the threesome is vocal, their intensity and dedication should rub off on all their teammates in 1982. 
"We've got some things to prove this year," offers Zavagnin. "The one thing I know is that you can never keep Notre Dame down for long. We've come back before." 
If the 1982 captains are any indica­tion, Notre Dame will come back again. 
'82 Preview 



The Second Time Around 

By JOHN HEISLER 
Every time Gerry Faust" starts to get optimistic about the 1982 Notre Dame football season, all he has to do is take one look at the schedule. A single, quick glance is enough to make him shudder a little bit-and then shudder some more. 
Start with Bluebonnet Bowl cham­pion Michigan -and add perennial Big Ten opponents Purdue and Michi­gan State. The rest of October includes Miami and Arizona at home, then Ore­gon and Navy on the road. November begins at Pittsburgh versus the Sugar Bowl champions and finishes in Los Angeles at USC. Sandwiched in be­tween those two are a home date with Fiesta Bowl champion Penn State and a trip to Air Force. --· . 

Seven of the 11 worked their way · ·­to winning '81 records; five of the 11 went to bowl games. Overall, the 11 teams finished 77-48-1 for a combined .615 winning percentage. If Faust likes the idea of testing his teams against the best-and he claims he docs-then Notre Dame's '82 agenda should grant his wish. 
Yet, even if that schedule brings a few furrows to Faust's brow; the per­sonnel he has to attack it should prompt more of a grin.· 
Nineteen of Notre Dame's 22 starters from 1981 will be back next fall. In­cluded. among those 19 are 11 individ­uals who were in the starting lineup when the Irish faced unbeaten Georgia in the '81 Sugar Bowl. 
Tops on the list of graduation losses are All-America linebacker Bob Crable, cornerback John Krimm and offensive

He joined Faust's staff on the recommendation of Bill Walsh, the San Francisco 49ers head coach. Tom Lichtenberg will take over the running backs, in addition to coordinating the Notre Dame offense. 
Hudson will concentrate on building depth at the receiving slots -since starters are back at each spot. Hunter will be the veteran at tight end, after moving there a year ago following the midseason knee injury to Dean Masz­tak. The former split end will make Notre Dame one of the few teams in the nation with such a speedy, deep threat at that position. 
Sophomore Joe Howard surfaced at midseason to average an amazing 27.2 yards on 17 catches. He's back to give the split end job a substantial dose of quickness. Juniors John Mosley and Bell return at wingback with their combination running and rece1vmg skills. Sophomore sprinter Van Pearcy will receive his first serious look after missing his freshman campaign with a knee injury. · 
Solid senior John Sweeney points for his fourth season as the starter at full­back. Since the player at that position often relayed plays from the sidelines, both Larry Moriarty and Mark Brooks earned their share of playing time last fall. The return of all three makes that spot as deep as any on the team. 
Tri-captain Phil Carter hopes for a 
·healthy senior campaign after a variety of leg ailments cut into both his sopho­more and junior years. He's one of the best around when he's physically sound. Sophomore Chris Smith displayed plenty of potential as a rookie and doubtless will be a key to Irish rushing fortunes for '82. 
Another new Faust assistant, former 
Miami head coach Carl Selmer, will 
serve as head offensive line coach this 
fall. He'll have a senior-dominated crew. 
with which to work in that area. Se­
niors Mark Fischer at center, Randy 
Ellis and Mike Shiner at guard and 
Tom Thayer at tackle-all starters as 
juniors in '81-return to anchor the 
Irish offensive front. Pozderac· will be 
missed at right tackle, but senior John 
Putzstuck-his backup each o( the 
last two seasons -is back. Junior Mike 
Kelley, a late-season replacement for 
Ellis while a. knee injury healed, also 
will help. 
Experience will be a strong point on 
the defensive side of the line as ,well. 
The Irish front four for the last half 
of the '81 season was comprised of Jon 
Autry and Griffith at end and Marshall 
and Clasby at the tackle slots. That 
quartet returns intact-with Griffith 
receiving an additional season · of eli­
gibility since he sat out the '80 cam­
paign with a knee injury. Senior Pat 
Kramer also merited an extra year after a shoulder injury curtailed his con­tributions last fall. Sophomores-to-be Mike Gann and Mike Golic saw plenty of late-season playing time, and senior Jeff Lueken is another possibility after rebounding from knee surgery last April. 

Look for a triumvirate of Zavag­nin, Joe Rudzinski and Rick Naylor at linebacker-with Mike Larkin also lending a helping hand in many situa­tions. Zavagnin inherits Crable's spot in the middle after holding down the weakside job the past two seasons. But the Irish tri-captain should have no problem adjusting; he played that posi­tion all last spring while Crable rested a shoulder injury. He played it well enough to make ·12 tackles and earn the defensive MVP award in last year's Blue-Gold spring finale. Jack Shields is another veteran who can handle the middle spot. 
Three incumbents return to the sec­ondary: senior tri-captain Duerson at strong safety, senior Rod Bone at free safety, and junior Stacey Toran at cornerback. Two-time letterwinner Chris Brown is the likely replacement for Krimm at the other cornerback posi­tion. Joe Johnson played more minutes than any other freshman on defense last year-so watch for him to pro­vide plenty of support. 
The only change in the defensive 
coaches features Greg Blache handling 
the defensive line after tutoring the 
running backs a year ago. Blache takes 
over for Bill Meyers who accepted a 
position as offensive line coach for the 
Green Bay Packers. 
Harry Oliver's placekicking chores 
probably will fall to senior Mike John­
ston, while Kiel is back as the Irish 
punter. 
Forty letterwinners return overall for 
Faust and his staff. 
Though spring drills and preseason 
fall workouts always bring about some 
changes, the '82 Irish edition appears 
to be one of the most senior-dominated 
teams Notre Dame has fielded in years. 
On paper, Faust conceivably could start 
as many as 15 seniors next fall-Carter, 
Sweeney, Hunter, Thayer, Ellis, Fischer, 
Shiner and Putzstuck on offense and 
Clasby, Griffith, Kramer, Zavagnin, 
Rudzinski, Duerson _and Bone on de­
fense. 
Seven of those individuals-Bone, 
Carter, Duerson. Hunter, Kramer, 
Sweeney and Zavagnin -are three­
time monogram recipients. 
The experience is present-includ­
ing a full year of indoctrination into 
the Gerry Faust system. Notre Dame's 
second-year head coach hopes that com­
bination will make all the difference 
beginning September 18 when Michigan 
comes to town.
