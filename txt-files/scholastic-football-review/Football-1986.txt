. '86 SEASQN· OVERVIEW 

17zis is the time to remember Cause it will not last forever These are the days to hold on to Cause we won't Although we'll want to -Billy Joel 
Some day somewhere down the line, 
Lou Holtz will remember back to his first 
season as the football coach at Notre 
Dame. 
It won't be remembered as the best of times, but it won't be recalled as the worst ·of times, either. For, more than anything, Holtz is a realist. 
After all, who could have better dealt . with the sweeping gamut of emotions produced by the 1986 season than Holtz? When Jim McKay first uttered the now­famous line on ABC's Wide World ofSpons about the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat, he must have had Notre Dame's '86 season in mind. Only the Fighting Irish kept seeing replays of the skier crashing on ·the downhill run. Holtz's team skidded down the home slope more than once last fall. Yet he kept his cool Saturday after. Saturday, when he and those around him had every reason to lose theirs. 
Part of the bargain in hiring someone 
with 16 previous seasons of head coaching 
experience is that HoltZ figured to have 
seen just about everything on a football 
field. But the '86 season managed to throw 
a few new twists his way. 
Just as college football appeared on the 
verge of knighting Michigan's 11 defensive 
starters, Notre Dame promptly went out in 
its season opener and didn't punt once 
against that blue-chip unit. 
Just when Holtz thought he'd seen all 
the 11th-hour losses assigned to him for the 
year, a two-point nail-biter at LSU 
produced yet one more. Seldom at a loss 
for words, Notre Dame's head coach was 
. . . .

. . ·. .··.. .
Creating Those Elusive Times To Remember 
by John Heisler 
flabbergasted this time. His· most memora­
ble postgame critique? "You've gotta be 
kidding me." 
And just· a week later, aro·und the corner 

from the bedlam in the Notre Dame locker 
room of the Los Angeles Coliseum, Holtz 
coolly and .calmly _accepted the miraculous 
38-37 Irish win over USC. The victory 
didn't even make a winning season out of 
the '86 campaign, but maybe it did even 
more than that in reaffirming that all those 
hours spent drilling on the practice field . hadn't been for naught. 
Holtz couldn't help but think that the 

USC_ triumph might make believers of a 
youthful team that had been told time and 
time again to keep its collective head up, 
that someday the breaks would fall for the 
Irish. Yet, even in that giddy setting, Holtz 
kept it all in perspective. While his charges · 
celebrated their fourth consecutive victory . over the Trojans, he also understood ­even though the official announcement didn't come for several days -that his team's success might have ended the tenure of his counterpart, Ted Tollner, at USC. With that in mind, Holtz related a story long after the final whistle had blown: 
"I told the squad the other day about 

the peanuts cartoon where Charlie Brown 
comes out and says, 'Man, I saw the 
greatest game. This team was getting ·beat 
all day. With eight seconds left, they had 
the ball on their own six-yard line and they 
went 94 yards for a touchdown. Everybody 
was jumping and screaming and hugging 
each other.' · 
· "And Lucy looked at him and said, 
'How did the other team feel?' · 
"We know what it's like because we've 

been on the other side a few times this 
year. Believe me, we've been there." 
Realism. Perspective. Call it whatever 

you like. Lou Holtz helped make some 
days worth remembering. 
. . . 
Sometimes its so easy To let a day slip on by But this is the time you 'II tum back to and so will I And those will be the days you can never recall 
Every Notre Dame football coach that 
comes along has to find out for himself. 
Ara Parseghian tells the story often -how 
you can't describe. what the job is like until 
you've sat inthe chair and experienced it. 
Part ofit involves living up to the 
expectations of a storied tradition~ Part of it 
involves pressure -self-imposed or 
otherwise, because of what the Rocknes, 
Leahys and Parseghians did in the past. 
Part of it involves the simple will to win 
that any coach brings to his job. 
So, who better to assess Lou Holtz's 
adjustment in that role than someone who 
knows him as well as anyone, his son 
Kevin, a junior at Notre Dame?· · 
"I've never seen him work so hard as 
he did this year," says the younger of Lou's 
two sons. 
"Maybe he felt he had to do it that way because of the close games, thinking that · spending an extra hour here or there might make the difference. 
"It was such a strange season, because 
usually you have one game a year that's a 
tough loss and really frustrates you. This 
year there were five. 
"I think it was awfully hard after 
coming so close against Penn State and 
then having to go to LSU ·and ·lose another 
close one. He even questioned his own 
coaching ability a little bit. He'd say, 'Is it 
something I'm doing wrong?' 
. "In the beginning, he had the attitude, 
'Let's try to do the best this year with what 
we'.ve got.' By midseason, it was more like, : 
'I'm going back to iny old ways of . 
coaching and we'll. get it done and the 
talent will come.' Later in the year, I think

he saw more bright spots. Even if the team lost, he seemed to be able to see the positives -like the defense against Pitt. 
"I don't think he got as depressed here as he has at other places. Maybe it's the whole environment here-knowing that even if the team lost on Saturday that the world wouldn't end. He always felt we would bounce back, there were bright spots, it would all come around.". 
And how does a son describe a father who already has been profiled seemingly by every major newspaper, magazine or television station?

~Lou Holtz 


"He's always moving, very fast-paced, a type A personality as they say," says Kevin. 
"But even with his hectic schedule, he cares a lot for the family and it's important to him to spend time with all of us. There · are things he'd like to do and just doesn't get time. He went scuba-diving once and loved it, but he just never gets the chance. 
"He likes to stay busy, no doubt about that. He may come home during the season at 10 o'clock and everyone else in the house may be asleep. He may sit in his rocker and doodle plays for two hours. 
"He relaxes on vacation when he's playing golf. But if you put him in the house for a week he'd tear it down and build it back up again. That's just the way he is. 


"But I think he understood how 
demanding the job would be. He sat down 
with all of us before the season began and 
talked about how hectic it would be. He . 
knew he wouldn't see as much of any of us 
in the family as he wanted to and he wanted 
to make sure we all understood we had to 
work a little harder to find time." 
********** 
Coaches in every. sport stress the carryover effect of the last game of the season. That's why Lou Holtz couldn't have dreamed a more profitable end to the '86 · · campaign than the emotion-charged Irish win at USC. That one contest did ever so much to make it easier for Holtz to accurately assess the progress inade by the Notre Dame program in a year's time: 
"Sometimes you feel like the only thing that really matters in ·athletics is ·whether you win or whether you .lose. History isn't going to record that this. was a football team that showed tremendous courage,' that played awfully well' against extremely fine opposition. . 
"Going into the year, we knew we had 
lost an awful lot from the previous year's 
team. On paper, those losses were of great 
consequence. ·We had lost Allen Pinkett, 
the all-time leading groundgainer here. As 
it turned out, the young man who started 
every game at fullback in '85, Frank · 
Starns, didn't play at all last year because 
of injuries. We only had one offensive 
lineman back in Shawn Heffern, and to . begin the year our quarterback situation wasn't the most stable." "That was just on offense, and yet our ~ <?ffense ended . up averaging 411 yard~.. a 

·game against a very difficult schedule. Our 
offense was exceptionally productive even 
though we didn't have anyone coming back . 
at tailback who was both healthy and 
experienced. In fact, we ended up starting 
two freshmen (Anthony Johnson at 
tailback, Braxston Banks at fullback) part 
of the year -and those were the only two · 
running backs we signed last year. 
"Defensively, I thought we played the run fairly well, especiillly considering we had lost Eric Dorsey. But our inability to stop the pass proved very difficult to overcome. Our punting was not what it needed to be-l don't remember many punts over the last six games longer than 34 or 35 yards. . 
"But the one thing that stood out to me : was that I felt we were a pretty good football team after the open date. I didn't feel we really were a good team the first five weeks-we weren't where we really needed to be. But after we took care of some things during the open date, I didn't feel bad at all about having my name next to this team. The last six weeks we played very well. We played as well as any team in the top 15 during those six weeks. But it seemed like all the teams we played were in the top 15. 
"More important than that, the teams 

we played played outstanding football 
against us. Penn State didn't make a single · 
turnover against us. LSU played exception-. 
ally well against us, and USC made very · 
few mistakes. I thought our comeback 
against USC was all the more amazing 
because we didn't get any help from USC 
in coming from 17 points down. We.had to do it all ourselves. 
"I think everybody is excited when they : play Notre Dame-you expect that. The teams we played also played· with an air of confidence. When you put excitement and confidence together, you usually play pretty well. Ifwe can create.an element of doubt in the minds of our opponents, then I don't think you 'II see teams come in here and play error-free football the way:they did last year. 
"We played hard ourselves, but we didn't always have that confidence on our side in critical situations. But, I will say · this-in the fourth quarter against USC our offense played with more confidence than we had. all year. We had more big plays, great catches, fine decisions and they all came in critical situations. That's the first time I saw us play with the air of confi­dence we should have. We played with it in spurts earlier in the year-but never in critical situations. 
"But, you have to remember we lost some fine athletes off the Notre Dame team · from the previous year and we also lost some games by pretty one-sided scores. So I don't know if our players-or myself-felt we could make that jump all at once. 
"If we're going to get better, we have to understand why you lose Close games. First, you have to acknowledge that the other team played very well against us. But, there are three characteristics that usually accompanied every close loss. 
"One, there was usually an error in the kicking game. Early in the year, it was a missed field goal, a blocked punt or a punt return by the other team.. 
. "Two, there usually was a critical turnover that hurt us. Look back at the fumble just before the half at Penn State, the interceptions at Michigan State, the goalline stand against us at LSU. We would be behind and we were always fighting to get back into it. The fact we put ourselves in position to win so many times is a tribute to our players. Somebody can always say, 'Well, you didn't :come that last step.' That's true, but maybe we just weren't good enough from top to. bottom. 
"Third, we usuaily gave up ~. iong play that hurt us-the touchdown passes at Alabama and the long one against Penn State and even the one at USC. · 
"In addition, we also had some critical : calls that took points off the board for us­the kickoff return against Penn State, the field goal. that was taken off the board · against LSU. We didn't make an exorbitant amount of errors, but the ones we did make all seemed to come at criticaltimes. And they probably stood out. more because the other team didn't seem to make. those kind of mistakes against us.:It's not like ou~ · . opponents didn't make mistakes-they just never seemed to make many against Notre Dame. 

·4 
. . --~...._.._______ 

"Our performance the last six weeks exceeded our expectations. I knew the schedule would be difficult, but the error­free ball that people played against us also exceeded my expectations. 
"Normally, during the course of a year, you play a few teams that don't play well against you. !.can't think of a team that· didn't play its best game against us. That made it tough week after week." 
That's Holtz's analysis, take.it or leave it. He takes the good with the bad, the bad · with the good. He points out the pluses and the minuses and goes from there. There are no regrets, noexcuses.:.:...he's· a matter-of-· fact coach with an outlook to match. · 
"It's like anything else. The question now is, 'Where do we go from here?' We aren't going to stay the same, we're either going to get better or worse. We can sit here and cry and complain about how tough the schedule is and how many holes we 

. have to fill. Or we can work that much 
harder to do what we have to do to start 
winning those close games. 
"I tell our players time after time that 
winning those close games is going to make 
the difference every time. It's going to be 
like that every year with our schedules the 
next decade. With a little bit of Irish luck, 
we realistically could have been sitting at 
10-1 last season. But I'm not sure if we 
were I0-1 that we would have addressed 
some of the problems that needed to be addressed. When you start out 1-4 you're forced to address them and that's not a bad thing. You've got to go through fire to make steel and our players did that." 
. Some day somewhere down the line, Lou .Holtz will remember back to his first season as the football coach at Notre Dame. 
In the meantime, he's more concerned about creating days he can smile about for all the right reasons.

Joel Williams knew it. 
Steve Beuerlein felt it. 
Tim Brown believed it. 
The rest of the Notre Dame football 
players understood, too -and for that 
matter, so did those on the Michigan 
sideline. 
The scoreboard said the third-ranked 
Wolverines had beaten the underdog 
Fighting Irish by 24-23. 
Yet, 59,075 emotionally-spent and duly­
impressed fans applauded the Notre Dame . 
players after the contest more vociferously 
for an effort that didn't even count for a 
victory than they had for many recent 
efforts that did. 
Maybe, just maybe, it marked the most 
prolific leap ever taken by a Notre Dame 
team from the end of one season to the 
beginning of the next. The Irish didn't just 
stick their heads out of the ashes of the 58­
7 disaster against Miami in the Orange 
Bowl. They came full circle by wiping 
away the memories of that '85 finale in one 
fell swoop that earned the respect of even 
the Wolverines. . 
"I was in awe of some of the things they 
did," admitted Michigan flanker John 
Kolesar. 
In all, the near-perfect mid-September 
afternoon in the sunshine of Notre Dame 
Stadium had nearly all the trappings of a 
dream-come-true debut for Notre Dame's 
new coach. 
With the ABC Sports cameras beaming 
the contest to the entire nation, both Lou 

Holtz and Michigan boss Bo Schembechler watched their teams perform far better than . either had a right to expect for opening day. · 
Schembechler had argued that the Irish 
had an advantage because no one knew 
exactly what Notre Dame would do, 
especially offensively with Holtz stalking 
the .sidelines and calling the plays himself. 

The Script Read, .'Rising From The Ashes'· 
by John Heisler 

After three years of ups and downs in his Irish uniform, senior quarter­back Steve Bauerlein left no doubt in the Michigan opener that he would prosper in the Lou Holtz system. He threw for a career-high 21 completions plus 263 yards (just four below his personal best)·and led five drives of 63 
yards or longer.

.it.,, 
·-Tim Brown 

"Every time the offense came off the field, we were craving to get back in there." 
Brown, the gifted junior flanker who got his first taste of the multiple roles in which Holtz envisioned him, agreed: 
"Put it this way. We had the same guys here last year, and we never did any of this stuff. After the first series (Notre Dame drove 75 yards in 13 plays with Brown himself scoring from the three), it was like, 'Hey; this is gonna be fun. This is a picnic.' Don't get me wrong-I'm not putting their defense down because it's real good. 
Containment like this play by Irish tackle Robert Banks on Michigan tail­
back Jamie Morris helped Notre Dame limit the Wolverine back to no· gain longer than eight yards. 
But it was our day, and we knew it." 

Holtz had argued that Michigan had a . legitimate national championship­contending team with a defense suspected of being impregnable. Both proved correct, yet who could imagine that Notre Dame's new-fangled offense-call it the power wishbone or whatever you like -could wreak such havoc on the Wolverines' widely-lauded defense the first time out of the gate? 
Actually, the only team to stop the Irish turned out to be the Irish themselves. Michigan's·defense certainly didn't-and Schembechler couldn't remember the last time a Wolverine opponent had gone 60 minutes without punting. 
"The word that came to mind on the sideline was 'crave,' " said Beuerlein, the senior Irish quarterback whose 21-of-33 passing numbers for 263 yards easily matched Michigan counterpart Jim Harbaugh's 15-of-23 for 239.

Keeping Wolverine quarterback Jim Harbaugh under wraps seldom proved an easy task -whether it was Marty Lippincott (above) trying to block the passing lane or linebacker Ron Weissenhofer (below) sizing up the option possibililities. 
On their way to 27 first downs and 455 total yards, the Irish ran every which way : from every kind of formation. They ran a little option, a little wishbone, a little power sweep -and as beautifully as Beuerlein handled the offense and threw the ball, he even resorted to a nifty little shovel pass on a key third-down play on that noteworthy opening series. 
Notre Dame managed three touchdowns against a team that permitted only five during the entire '85 regular season. It managed 23 points agains~ a defense that didn't give up that many to its first five '85 opponents combined. · 
Said Williams, who grabbed a Beuerlein shot-put-style pass for a third-period touchdown: 
"Somebody said we couldn't hit, that we didn't like to compete, that all we could do was study. Hey, Notre Dame football is­back. There are not going to be any more . lackadaisical efforts around here." 
Yet, the little black cloud that seemed to follow Irish teams in recent years hadn't completely disappeared. In fact, it kept Notre Dame from winning this contest handily. So much for the luck of the Irish. 
With the score tied at seven in the second period, Holtz's troops had marched 58 yards down to the Michigan 15. But, on second and eight, flanker Reggie Ward took a pitch to the Wolverine six before fumbling the ball away. 
After Michigan scored on its initial 
second-half possession to take a 17-14lead. 
came one of those. bizarre kickoff plays. that 
are seen once a season. Like a little pop fly 
toward the sideline, the ball never even .. 
reached the Notre Dame 20, and it died

Notre Dame's offense proved downright awesome for an opener. It espe from superb offensive line play (blocking by Shawn Heffern and Tom Freeman above) and the all-around talents of Tim Brown (below), who led Notre Dame with 65 rushing yards. 
"It just kind of landed in no-man's land, 

between two lines of our players," said 
Holtz. "You couldn't kick a ball there if 
you tried. Then it hit and bounced crazy." 
Harbaugh :wasted little time, hitting 

Jamie Morris in stride for a 27-yard score 
on the first play to give the Wolverines two 
touchdowns in six seconds. Yet, those 
would be the last of the Michigan points ­
as the Irish defense bent but never broke 
the rest of the way. 
The final four Notre Dame possessions 

proved the ones that all the Irish wished 
they had back to play over again. 
After Williams' touchdown reception 

had pulled the home team to within 24-20, · 
Notre Dame's next foray began with a 
screen pass to Mark Green that produced · · 
29 yards. But later, on second and seven 
from the Michigan 21, Pernell Taylor lost 
the handle on the football after gaining six 
yards to the Wolverine 15. 
Beuerlein got the next attempt going 

impressively by hitting Brown for 32 yards 
and Ward for 16 more. But the 65-yard 
drive ended when, on third and six from 
the Michigan eight, Beuerlein aimed a pass 
for Brown in the corner of the end zone on 
~ throw designed either to drop ·right over 
the receiver's shoulders or be barely long. 
Instead; the throw came up short and,' with 
Brown looking back into the sun, Michi-· 
gan's David Arnold intercepted. · · The next time, after beginning from 
their own 30 with Beuerlein completing 
four straight passes for 42 yards, the Irish 
again found themselves at the Michigan · 
eight facing a third down with five minutes 
left in the game. Then came the controver­
sial play of the game as Beuerlein rolled to 
his left and threw across his body to a wide-open Williams in the back of the end zone. 



Williams caught the football -there was never a question about that. But no television replays or game films conclu­sively showed whether Williams got one foot down first in the end zone ~ as Williams and others claimed he did -or whether he was out of bounds, as back judge Frederick DeFilippo ruled. John Carney kicked the obligatory field goal from 25 yards for the final 24-23 margin, but that didn't end the debate on Williams' non-touchdown catch. 
Maybe the best argument came from a Michigan ballboy, who Holtz, Beuerlein, Williams and others all claimed said the play should have been ruled a touchdown. 

"I looked down and saw my left foot in," Williams claimed. "Then I chopped my feet and stepped out of bounds. My right foot may have been on the line, but I got one foot in first. 
"They were hesitant to make the call. People were in the way of the official. He stood there. I knew immediately that he didn't know. I knew it was six points, and I couldn't even believe it." 
Both Holtz and Schembechler found a touch of humor in the situation. 
"I couldn't see, that's why I wear bifocals," said Holtz. "But the Michigan ballboy said both feet were inbounds and I've always believed Michigan runs an honest school." 
"I just want you to know that if the the Notre Dame lockerroom, and justifiably so. 
officials called him out in Notre Dame  
Stadium, then he was definitely out," said  
Schembechler. ·  
Amazingly, the Irish had yet another  
chance, thanks to Michigan's only turnover  
of the day (a fumble by Bob Perryman at  
the Irish 26) -after a gutty 38-yard  
completion to Kolesar on a third-and-six  
call from the Michigan 22 seemingly had  
sealed the fate of the Irish. Wes Pritchett  
recovered with 1 :33 left, and the final  
march began with a Beuerlein-to-Alvin  
Miller hookup for 33 yards.  
But a costly procedure penalty from the  
Michigan 29 and a·couple of incompletions  
prompted a Carney field-goal attempt that  
fluttered off harmlessly to the left from 45  
yards out at the :13 mark.  
"I just didn't get it done," Carney .said.  
"I didn't get it up enough. It would have  
been a great way to win Coach Holtz's first  
game. I kind of feel like I owe him one."  
In between the miscues, Notre Dame's  
offense played nearly flawlessly -a fact  
that seemed even more incongruous  
considering the reputation of the Michigan  
defense. The Irish played with a confidence  
and an excellence in execution that belied  
the idea that this was a downtrodden 5-6  
football team trying to compete with a  
veteran Wolverine unit that would go on to  
the Rose Bowl with a Big Ten title in its  
pocket.  
"Let's get one thing straight, gentle­ 
men," Schembechler chided the assembled  
media ­who very nearly got their  
storybook ending. "We came into a hostile  
stadium playing against Notre Dame and  
not knowing how they're going to line up  
on offense or defense. We're playing a  
game in which every otherwise neutral  
observer would like to see Notre Dame  
win. But no matter how you add it up,  
we're going out with a victory. You can say  
all the other things you want, but it's a  
helluva lot better to be going out with a  
victory."  
If only Holtz had known what a familiar  
refrain his postgame remarks would prove  
to be throughout the rest of the season. He  
spoke of pride and disappointment. He  
spoke of never seeing so many little things  
go wrong at so many wrong times. He  
spoke of not having moral victories at  
Notre Dame.  
It was left for Schembechler to pay the  
ultimate compliment to the Irish in defeat:  
"This is not a team devoid of talent. If  
the cupboard is ba're here, then we've made  
some terrible choices in recruiting because  
we tried to get most of the players on this  
team. They'll win a lot of games this year ·  
even against a tough schedule. This guy is  
a great coach, we all know that. He knows  I  
how to line 'em up and play 'em."  
So, the ~rish stood 0-1 -yet the feeling about how that mark had come about was  I  
ever so different. Heads were held high in  I  

 j  
I  

"I feel great about the rest of the season," admitted Beuerlein. "I've got this big lump in my throat thinking about what it would have meant if we had won this .. · game. But maybe it's enough for right now to know we belong out there." 
Boy, did they ever belong. Ifeffort and hustle and desire counted for touchdowns, the Irish would have made the scoreboard light up like a pinball machine. 
"They were fun to watch," admitted Michigan's Morris. , 
As Notre Dame's Robert Banks asserted, the fight was back in the Irish. Indeed. 
So, welcome to the world of Notre Dame football, Lou Holtz. And thanks for the memory-even if it wasn't a win. 
Holtz, in fact, nearly proved the soothsayer. 
"I had a script in my mind," he said. "that if we won this game, we would come from behind to do it. But it just wasn't meant to be." 
And as gaudy as Notre Dame's offense proved, the defense didn't turn out to be half bad, either. Stunned by the double­touchdown, six-second blitz midway through the third period, the Irish defenders hung tough the rest of the way through four Michigan drives. 
As the late-afternoon sun and the applause of the Notre Dame Stadium fans wafted over the helmets of the Irish players as they left the field, somehow there was a whole lot more to this opening afternoon than a Michigan victory and a Notre Dame defeat. 
Joel Williams knew it. 
Steve Beuerlein felt it. 
Tim Brown believed it. 
The Irish were back.

It will be remembered as a Krumm-y day for Notre Dame football. 
Irish fans, though, would just as soon forget about the afternoon of September 20 in East Lansing, Mich. 
For the second consecutive week, Notre Dame came within the proverbial eyelash of a thrilling, last-second victory. Instead, Lou Holtz's squad was left 0-2, teary-eyed and wondering what might have been. 
"I'm tired of being close," Irish defensive tackle Wally Kleine said after­wards. "Close just isn't good enough." 
But for the moment, close remained the hard, cruel reality. 
Back From the Brink Empty-Handed 
By Scott Dupree 
Last week it was second-ranked Michigan, 24-23. On this warm, overcast Saturday, it was Michigan State 20-15 -to the utter delight of 79,895 delirious die­hards in sold-out Spartan Stadium. 
Those fans witnessed a game that was anything but an aesthetic masterpiece. Certainly, it stirred few memories of a Spartan-Irish clash 20 years earlier, a contest labeled by many as one of the greatest games in all of college football lore. 
No, this game turned out to be full of flags and fumbles, miscues and muffs, twists and turns. A little dab of everything to keep a national television audience entertained and, as it turned out; on the edge of its collective seat. 
As the final score would indiciate~ it · was 20th-ranked Notre Dame that commit­ted most of the costly errors. As well as the Irish had played in_ their heart-breaking but confidence-building-loss to Michigan, they were equally inconsistent against the Spartans. 
A couple of days after the game, Holtz used an analogy that put his team's blunders into proper perspective. 
"Sometim-es when you start playing with a stick of dynamite, the stick doesn't

always wait until you throw it to explode,"­
he reasoned. 
· Indeed, at times in the first-half, Notre 
Dame seemed as flat as one of Holtz's open 
cans of Diet Coke. 
Anyway, despite their disappointing 

play, the Irish still had a shot, a legitmate 
shot, at winning for the first time in 1986. 
But on a Michigan State team that boasted 
the likes of Heisman Trophy candidate 
Lorenzo White and standout signalcaller 
Dave Yarema, it was a slow-footed 
cornerback named Krumm who literally 
stole victory from the Irish. 
· Todd Krumm made a pair of key 
interceptions, one in each half, that 
propelled his team to victory. 
Late in the first quarter, with the Irish 

leading 3-0, Krumm picked off a Steve 
Beuerlein pass and scampered 44 yards 
untouched for the score. Then with 1:30 
left in the game, and Notre Dame trailing · 20-15 but driving deep in Spartan real 
estate, Krumm tip-toed in front of receiver

another Beuerlein pass. That play, at the 18-yard line, sealed Notre Dame's fate. 
"This is one of the few times in a football game that there's no doubt who the most valuable player is," Michigan State coach George Perles told the press. "Todd was the hero of the game. 
"I'm so proud of him. He's shy and quiet, and he 'looks like a movie star. Some guys run a 4.4 40, but you can't measure smarts." 
Krumm, of course, was elated in the jubilant post game lockerroom. 
"It's an incredible feeling,'' he said. "To beat such a great team like Notre Dame, with all that tradition. It's a memory I'll · have for the rest of my life." 
Krumm's performance drew rave reviews from all corne~s. including Beuerlein, twice the victim of Krumm's smarts, 
Said Beuerlein of Krumm's second intercept: "That guy simply made a great play. Milt Jackson made a good move on the guy, and I led him toward the sideline. 


The play developed just like we thought it would. I thought we were going to pick up 
15 or 16 yards on the play. But he (Krumm) timed it just right." 
So while Beuerlein and a: host of others credited Krumm with a brilliant play in the closing moments, the senior quarterback took full responsibility for the first intercept -one that resulted in seven Spartan points. 
"The first interception was dumb on my part," Beuerlein said. "I threw it without really looking. The ball was in the air a lot longer than it should have been. That play put us in a hole, and we had to play catch­up." 
And the Irish never quite could. 

Holtz said the first-period interception threw his team out of sync until about midway through the third quarter. That doesn't leave much time, especially when half of your offensive attack -in this instance, the running game -is virtually non-existent. 
Notre Dame netted 65 rushing yards less than Michigan State's White gained by himself. With the Irish ground game ineffective, the Spartans, Krumm in particular, were able to concentrate on the air traffic. · 
"We weren't able to blend the run and the pass at all," Holtz said. "Let me tell you, it's difficult to win a big game just throwing the ball. You've got to be able to run the ball equally well. That's all there is to it." 
Irish doldrums, however, weren't simply a result of ground game troubles. Mistakes, in all size and shapes, proved to be the decisive factor. 
There was a Beuerlein-to-Brown second­quarter bomb that put the Irish in excellent field position. At least it looked that way at first. A procedure penalty brought it back. 
That was the most critical of the seven flags thrown against the Irish. 
There was a muffed quick kick. Although a nifty idea, it wasn't a pretty sight. On third down in·the.third quarter, Holtz cleverly ordered Beuerlein to kick out of the shotgun formation. 
The Spartans· were, indeed, surprised. As it turned out, they were. pleasantly surprised. Beuerlein's punt shanked out of bounds 19 yards downfield at the Irish 39. It led to a Spartan field goal, which made the score 13-3. 
''Another one of my beautiful plays today," Beuerlein said. "I had been booming 'em in practice; that's why coach Holtz called the play. They never suspected a punt, so there was no pressure put on me. I just missed the ball."

Both teams exchanged fourth-quarter touchdowns, making the score 20-15 and setting the stage for Notre Dame's lengthy, heart-breaking drives. 
"Our football team played hard, but each time we went to the brink, we came away empty-handed," Holtz said. "We had hoped to get better from one game to the next, but that wasn't the case this week. Still, we had a chance right up until the end." 
''We had hoped to get better from one game to the next, but that ­wasn't the case 
this week. '' __:_ Lou Holtz 

Two emotionally-draining losses in seven days. An 0-2 start. That's something only two other Notre Dame teams in this century had done. Wearly combatants in the Irish lockeroom were deathly quiet after the game. 
Not a sole had expected to lose the first two, and not in such dramatic fashion. 
"I never thought we'd be 0-2," whis­pered linebacker Mike Kovaleski, the team captain, to one of many reporters asking the same question. "It's not good enough to say, 'It was close, we hung in there.' If we say that, we'll never be a good team. We have to be tough in close games, and learn to win them.''

NOTRE DAME-41-, PURDUE-9. 
. . . 


Notre Dame was mad as heck and wasn't going to take it imymore.After coming so close, but not quite far enough to win, in their first two games, the Fighting Irish were ready to throw a few punches. Even mild-mannered flanker Milt Jackson, who probably would offer tea and cookies to Snidely Whiplash before letting Dudley Do-right tie him to the train tracks, displayed a bit of an Irish temper. 
"We were angry," said Jackson. "We told ourselves we should have won those first two games. There was no way we were going to lose again." 
The 1986 Irish, who didn't want to go into the record books as the first Notre Dame team to .open the season with three -count 'em-three straight losses, had longtime rival Purdue against the ropes most of this sunny, sweltering September afternoon. Coach Lou Holtz's first victory at Notre Dame came on a 41-9 decision. It also snapped a five-game losing streak that dated back to the 1985 campaign. 
"I didn't doubt that we'd get it eventu­ally," said the wry coach in the postgame interview. "I felt all along that if we could eliminate some mistakes, we'd be pretty competitive. It's good to win. I'm happy for the players." 
Notre Dame, indeed, cut down on the miscues that hindered the Irish the first two weeks of the season. And Notre Dame's running game, which seemed to have left town when Allen Pinkett did, re-emerged on solid efforts by a bevy of backs. 
"I didn't know if we had the ability to run against Purdue," said Holtz, who watched his Irish gobble up 276 yards of · turf. "Defensively, Purdue looked awfully, awfully good against Pittsburgh. That was our key. We felt we had to run inside. That's where it all starts." 
Actually, Purdue's demise began with

the opening coin toss. The Boilermakers · actually won the flip, but game captains 
Ron Woodson and Jeff Witter inadvertently 
conveyed to the game officials that they 
would defend a goal instead of declining the 
decision and letting the Irish make the 
choice. Purdue coach Leon Burtnett figured 
he was in for a long, hot afternoon in his 
yellow sweater. 
"The official came over and told me, 

'Coach, you're not going to believe what 
your kids did,' and I knew right then that it 
was going to be one of those days." 
Burtnett was right. Things went from 

bad to worse for the Boilermakers. But the 
customary home crowd of 59,075 loved it. 
Notre Dame turned the opening kickoff 

into a touchdown for a lead it never 
relinquished. Tailback Mark Green, who 
led the ground game with 73 yards on 17 
carries, gained 20 on the first drive. 
Quarterback Steve Beuerlein hit Tim Brown 
and Jackson for catches of 17 and 29 yards, 
respectively. Fullback Pernell Taylor finally 
plowed over left tackle for the two-yard 
touchdown run. 
"I was getting a little tired of hearing 

we couldn't run the ball,'' said Green, who 
also caught one pass for seven yards. "We 
knew we were able to run the ball today. 
The line came off the ball great, opened up 
a lot of seams and we just knocked it down 
their throats." 
But Purdue also choked on a couple 

bobbles of its own. 
In the first quarter, Woodson, every­

body's All-American at cornerback, 
returned Dan Sorensen's punt 43 yards to 
give the Boilermakers excellent field

position at their own 49-yard line. But on the second play from scrimmage, tailback Jerry Chaney mishandled the exchange and outside linebacker Cedric Figaro snatched up the football on the Purdue 44. 
With backup quarterback Terry Andrysiak at the controls, the Irish moved all the way to the Boilermaker one-yard line. Two consecutive clipping penalties negated an Andrysiak touchdown run and pushed Notre Dame back to the Purdue 25. The Irish had to settle for a 42-yard field goal from John Carney. 
Already trailing 10-0, the Boilers handed the Irish another golden opportunity when James Medlock fumbled on his own 
20. Dave Butler recovered for Notre Dame. 
Four plays later, freshman fullback Anthony Johnson, who had bulldozed his way for 10 yards on the first two carries of the drive, burst through left tackle for two yards and the score. Carney's PAT gave the Irish a 17-0 lead. 
Both Holtz and Burtnett agreed that those turnovers were critical to each team's performance. 
"Those two turnovers sure set the tempo," said Holtz. "The only thing I was worried about after that was letting them back in the game." 
But the Boilers weren't going to play Spoilermakers before the ABC television cameras this time. 
"The turnovers in the game killed us," admitted Burtnett, whose team fell to 1-2. "We knew we couldn't afford to do that in a game like this. They were out there so much our defensive kids were out of it." 
Purdue's defense was on the field· for 11 minutes in the first quarter. 
·"Our kids were beat after that," said Burtnett. 
Notre Dame upped that insurmountable advantage to 24-0 with just under five minutes left in the half. After Beuerlein scrambled for a 12-yard gain and a first down at the Purdue 35, the senior quarter­back pump faked and lobbed a scoring strike to Jackson at the goal line. Jackson, who caught four passes for 107 yards against the Boilermakers, had suggested the passing route to his coach. 
"It was an out and up and when I ran it before, they sat on it," explained Jackson. "I told coach if I ran an 'L', I could beat them. I knew Woodson would be closing in, but I just wanted to concentrate on the ball because I had dropped one like that at Michigan State." 
Purdue threatened to put some points on the board before the intermission, but on first and 10 from the Irish 34-yard line, freshman quarterback Jeff George was intercepted by cornerback Marv Spence at the Irish 23. 
"I just wish we could have had a better effort on both offense and defense," said George, who wound up turning in the best perfoimance of his three-game-old college career. "We just were not consistent. The fumbles in the first period hurt us, but I really can't say who was at fault. We'll take a look at the film and decide what caused them." 
George completed 28 of 43 passes for 241 yards and only one interception. 
·But even a dazzling halftime perform­ance by the Purdue All-American Marching Band couldn't rouse the Boilermakers' comatose running game. Only two Purdue backs rushed for positive yardage as the Boilers mustered only 12 yards on the ground in the first 30 minutes. 
"We felt if we allowed them to run the football and mix it with the pass, then they would be difficult to stop," said Holtz. 
But the only ones difficult to stop were the Irish, who kept righton coming. Notre Dame opened the second half with three quick points. Carney kicked the second longest field goal of his career-a 49­yarder against a 15-mile-per-hour wind. He previously had booted a 51-yard field goal against SMU in the Aloha Bowl. 
"We talked all week about having a chip

on our shoulder," said Carney, who had been frustrated by a couple of missed kicks against Michigan and Michigan·State. "We had the chip on our shoulder today and it's going to stay there. It's been a tough two weeks. The whole team has been really high strung." 
Purdue avoided the whitewash on its next drive. George, who had thrown eight interceptions in his first two outings, passed the Boilers deep into Notre Dame territory. Chaney scored on a three-yard touchdown run over right tackle, but the two-point conversion attempt fell short when linebacker Mike Kovaleski hammered Chaney before he could reach the end zone. 
The Boilermakers added three more points after Taylor fumbled on the Purdue 
36. Jonathan Briggs kicked a 22-yard field goal. 
"I didn't want the team to drive all that way and come up empty," explained Burtnett. "We were pretty much out of it by then. If our defense could have stopped 
· them, maybe we could have gotten going." 
But that was all she wrote for the Boilers as Notre Dame's offense continued to unload its frustrations from the past two weekends. 
After an onside kick backfired and gave the Irish possession on the Purdue 42, Beuerlein went to work. He hit Jackson for 17 yards along the Notre Dame sideline. On third arid two from the 13, Johnson hurdled through the middle of the line, · shrugged off a tackler at the five and 
. stretched for the goal line and the touch­down. 
"I know where the goal line is," said the former all-star soccer star from John Adams High School in South Bend. "They teach us to run ·north and south and fall forward." 
Johnson, who spent last season as a messenger for the ushers in Notre Dame Stadium, now is delivering points and yardage. He ran eight times for 34 yards and a pair of t<:mchdowns. 
·~nthony is the kind of guy who makes things happen," said Holtz. "He just amazes me. He's a valuable football player. 
"He's sort of bruised up. He's the one that breaks up the wedge on kickoffs. It's not that he's supposed to, he just always seems to get there." 
With a 34-9 lead in his pocket, Holtz pulled out the horses and inserted his number-two offense. But Andrysiak wanted to redeem himself after his appearance in the first quarter netted only three points . The Irish moved 42 yards in five plays and scored on Green's zig-zag run of 27 yards. Carney's final kick accounted for the 41-9 · score. 
Notre Dame dominated nearly every statistical category in this game. Offen­sively, the Irish accounted for 478 yards to Purdue's 295 ..( 
.. l 

"From the very first play our line controlled the line of scrimmage," said · Beuerlein, who completed 10 of 14 passes for 174 yards. "It makes it a whole lot easier to sit back there and pass the ball when you know you've got that kind of time. Purdue couldn't tee off on the pass rush. That made it easier for the receivers and me." 
Beuerlein, who was never sacked and seldom chased, threw to six different receivers. He was also aided by the balanced Irish rushing attack that kept the Purdue defense honest. Notre Dame also converted 11 of 16 third-down situations. 
Although the big play had hurt Notre Dame in its previous two outings, the Irish defense eliminated the game-breaker against the Boilermakers. And the defen­sive line, which recorded its first sack of the season with Jeff Kunz's hit on George in the first quarter, continually applied pressure to the quarterback. 
"We went into the game thinking Notre Dame would come after me," said George. "We thought they would blitz much more than they did. And we were ready with those shovel passes and the screens. But we couldn't establish anything deep. They dropped back on us." 
But George's completions didn't do much damage. 
Finally, Notre Dame had played hard, stuck to its game plan and emerged on top at the final gun. Although Holtz played down the significance of his first win at Notre Dame, he had to be relieved. Opening the season at 0-2 was bad enough, but 0-3 would have been, well, unthink­able. One victory didn't wipe the slate clean, but at least for Holtz and the Irish, things were finally looking a little brighter.

ALABAMA 28,. NOTRE DAME .10 


Settling I

An Old Score .I I For the Bear 
By Jim Daves 
Late in the fourth quarter of the game, after the contest had long since been decided, a roar rose from the 75,808 patrons· in Birmingham's Legion Field. The commotion was caused by a sign that had been unfurled and paraded around the stadium. · 
The banner pretty much summed up the thoughts and emotions of the Crimson Tide fans. 
"This One's for You Bear," it read. 

Finally, Alabama had beaten Notre Dame. Finally, the thorn had been removed from its side. And most Tide fans felt that, somewhere legendary coach Bear Bryant knew the 28-10 outcome and was smiling. That made them happy. 
Bear Bryant is to Alabama fans what Rockne, Leahy 'and Parseghian are to Irish enthusiasts. He is the man who made Alabama football what it is today. National championships, conference championships, coach of the year honors, All-Americans were all things Bryant had achieved during his tenure. But he had never beaten Notre Dame. 
The week before the game Alabama fans, players and media pondered the Notre Dame jinx and wondered aloud if they would ever manage a victory against the Irish. 
Notre Dame had pinned a dramatic 24­23 loss on the Tide during the '73 Sugar Bowl to snuff out Alabama's dream of a national title and claimed it themselves in the team's first meeting. Again in '75 the Irish dethroned the top-ranked Crimson Tide 13-11 during the Orange Bowl in Ara Parseghian's finale to end another Tide national championship quest. Two regulars season clashes saw Notre Dame prevail 21­18 in '76 and 7-0 in '80. 
More than half a decade had passed, but still Alabama fans had not forgotten the string of stinging defeats. Bryant's succes-

sor, Ray Perkins, stressed that point as his 
team took advantage of an open date to · ·have two weeks to prepare. 
"Notre Dame is what Wimbledon is to 

tennis ... what the Masters is to golf," 
said Perkins the week before the game. "I 
told our players that Alabama teams have 
won the Southeastern Conference and the 
national championship, but they can do 
something that no team here has done ­
beat Notre Dame. 
"But there's no mystique about it," he cautioned. 
"I don't think I've ever seen mystique beat a footbal team. But I've seen 11 guys on offense and 11 guys on defense go out and beat a football team. And Notre Dame has done that four times to Alabama already." 
Indeed the last time these two gridiron giants met, their entire current squads were still playing in the high school and junior high school ranks. At that time Cornelius Bennett would never imagine the impact he would have on ending the Tide's draught. Literally. 
In a game filled. with big plays, Bennett's contribution early in the first quarter might have loomed largest. It easily was the most devastating. · 
Perkins prophesied the week of the game that, "For us to have an opportunity to win the game we've got to somehow stop Beuerlein. He's the key." 
Bennett took care of that task in a hurry. 
On the second Irish possession quarter­back Steve Beuerlein dropped back to pass and was brutany smashed into the Legion Field turf for an eight-yard loss by the blitzing, untouched Bennett coming at fun speed from the blind side. 
"It's my job to pressure the quarterback and I knew I was going to get him," said Bennett who finished with six tackles. "I was coming fun speed for the quarterback. I didn't get blocked at an. It was just a free shot. I had abig smile the whole day because I reany did have some fun." 
"That hit Bennett made really did pick us up," said middle guard Curt Jarvis, who later sacked Terry Andrysiak for a 13-yard loss. "That's probably one of the most vicious licks I've ever seen on a quarter­back. It set the tempo for the rest of the day." 
Bennett's play also made things fun for the Tide fans as the capacity crowd roared its approval in front of ABC's national television audience. Somehow, during an the celebrating, Beuerlein managed to regain his senses and even complete a pass on the next down. But the drive staned, and with the crowd still cheering wildly· in the 90-degree heat Dan Sorensen's punt was fielded by Greg Richardson at the 34-yard line. 
"The punt return was something we had been working hard on all week," said Richardson, an all-Southeastern Conference sprinter. "We thought we could break one against them. They had a lot of big guys, but they were real slow. I got a couple of good blocks and was gone." 
Richardson sidestepped two unrushing coverage men and exploded down the Alabama sideline for 66 yards and the first sc9re. Just to make sure he made it into the end zone, Bennett provided the final block, sending Sorensen sprawling at the 15-yard line.' 
Beuerlein, who alternated with Andry­siak for the remainder of the game, admitted afterwards the decision to remain in the game was probably. not a wise one. 


"I didn't say anything about it at first," said Beuerlein. "But, I probably should have taken myself out. In the second half, I realized I was making some pretty stupid mistakes, like going the wrong way on plays and stuff. I remember seeing a lot of mouths moving, but I didn't hear the words that well." 
With Beuerlein still woozy and Andry­siak under constant pressure and forced to flee the pocket, the Irish had trouble .executing their gameplan. Despite eventu­ally piling up more total offense than the Crimson Tide (324 yards to 318 yards) Notre Dame could penetrate the 20-yard line just once. 
"I felt a key for us would be to establish the run early and we did," Beuerlein said. "However, what we wanted to do was complement it with the passing game. They play a secondary coverage that is very vulnerable to the deep pass, if you have time to throw it. What they are saying is they will take away the short stuff and if they can, the rushers will put enough pressure on you. that you are not going to be able to beat them deep. 
"That's what happened today. We knew their weaknesses back there deep, but we didn't have the time to get it done. We were too worried about what vias going on up front. I thought we moved the ball well overall. But every time we would get a couple of first downs and get something going, we'd make a turnover or some other mistake. But there again, that's a tribute to the way they played on defense." 
Instead, it was the Irish who were beaten deep. 
Midway through the second quarter Andrysiak's handoff to tailback Mark Green squirted free and was covered by the Tide's Greg Gilbert to kill Notre Dame's deepest pentration at the Alabama 36. Several plays later quarterback Mike Shula found speedy-quick receiver Albert Bell in single coverage downfield for a 52-yard touchdown strike. Van Tiffin's extra point made it 14-0. 
"I knew as soon as I threw it that we had a completion, but I didn't know . whether he'd be able to outrun everybody for a touchdown," said Shula who set up the play with a three-yard sneak on third down the previous play to keep the drive alive. 
Speed had played another part in the Irish demise. 
·~s a secondary we've wanted to eliminate the bomb, but we gave it up today," said cornerback Marv Spence. "You can't do that against a good team. They try to put you to sleep with their running, then all of a sudden they throw long." 
The first half closed with a flurry of action. The Irish quickly drove to the Alabama 29 but John Carney's 46-yard field goal attempt was wide left. Notre 
Dame then received a break when Shula fumbled while being sacked by Darrell Gordon. Three plays later Beuerlein hit 
Tim Brown in the flat for a touchdown to 
close the Tide's lead to 14-7. 
Shula promply marched Alabama to a third touchdown on an 80-yard drive in two minutes, tossing an 11-yard strike to Greg Richardson. The drive was keyed by Shula·s· 18-yard pass to Richardson from the Barna 40 which amounted to a 33-yard . gain when Troy Wilson was whistled for a late hit on the play. . · 
With only a minute remaining in the half, Andrysiak took over for Beuerlein, scrambled for six yards, tossed a screen to Green for 11, hit Brown for 24 and then found an open Joel Williams for eight yards to bring the Irish to the Tide's 26-yard line with 10 ticks left on the clock. After a timeout Andrysiak hooked up with Milt Jackson on the left sideline for a 22-yard completion before he was knocked out of bounds. With time for one play, coach Lou Holtz opted for the field goal which Carney provided. The Irish went into the locker­room down il-l0, but with momentum on their side. 
Momentum is a funny thing. Sports­writers love to use the cliche of comparing it with a pendulum because of the way it can quickly swing and shift. It was a word that was tossed around a lot in both 
Irish quarterback Terry Andrysiak displays. good judgment in running away from Alabama linebacker Cornelius Bennett, whose early hit on Steve Bauerlein put Andrysiak into the lineup. · 
~-,_----------·-·. .... ---,. . ... ­


lockerrooms after the game. It took just one play for momentum to abandon the Irish in the second half. 
After galloping up the Irish sideline for 22 yards on the opening kickoff, Brown was hit by Barna's ·Desmond Holoman and the ball popped free. Holoman smothered it to end Alabama's final big play for the game and the Tide fans went berserk. Three plays later Shula's lofty pass was picked out of the air by Bell for the final score. It was 28-10 and although there were nearly 28 minutes left to play, this one was over. 
"We knew they were a good second half team," Holtz relayed. ''And they didn't need any encouragement." 
Just to make sure Notre Dame didn't creep back into the game Freddie Robinson picked off two errant Irish passes to kill . drives. And when Mike Haywood inter­cepted a Shula toss late in the third corner and appeared ready to turn a corner and head 70 yards for a score Richardson's blazing speed caught him from behind. 
Speed and the opponents coming up · with the big plays again killed the Irish. Just listen to the players~· 
"Richardson's speed had a lotto do with me being caught from behind," said Haywood of being dragged down after getting a 10-yard head start on his intercep­tion. 
"Bel~ 's speed surprised us," said safety . Brandy Wells, beaten for a touchdown in the second quarter. 
"They have a good defense, the fastest defense we've played," said Beuerlein. 
"It's not that he's so impressive physically ~ut he has great speed," said Irish center Chuck Lanza about Bennett while echoeing a familiar theme. "He has great desire for the game and he gets that wide rush. It's awful hard to get back and block him." 
"Speed is our key," said Bennett in agreement. "It's the key to our season." 
''I felt a key fo~ usw~uld be to 
establish the run early and we did. However, what we wanted to do was complement it with the passing game. -They play a_secondary:c.overage thatis very 
· vulnerable to the d_eep· pass, if you have time to throw~it~:That's what. . happened today. We kri.ew their· weaknesses back there, but ·we didn't have · 
the time to get it don~. '' 
:---.Steve Beuerleiii . · 
It was the key the Irish couldn't stop, althought they had plenty of warning after viewing films in preparation for the game. 
"They have great quickness on de­fense," forewared Holtz the week of the contest. ''And playing on Astroturf just magnifies their speed. Their pass rush is incredible ... I'm just glad we're not playing them in track." 
The 1-3 start wore hard on Holtz. His words were short· and lacking the usual punch of humor. He knew positive things had been accomplished but he also knew there was plenty ofwork ahead for the Irish. 
Afterward, as the team filed out of the lockerroom for the bus trip back to the Birmingham airport, several thousand Barna fans continued to engage in post­game tailgate parties. They basked in the late afternoon sunshine relishing the win~ 
As the Irish bus caravan pulled away, the Tide supporters turned to wave goodbye in a warm display of sportsmanship. And for the first time, they saw Notre Dame off with a smile on their faces.

PITTSBURGH 10, NOTRE DAME 9 

For a time, Foge Fazio was Pittsburgh's favorite son. 
As a former player, defensive coordina­tor and head coach, he helped mold Pitt into a consistent national championship contender. Several civic groups in the community named him their man of the year, and the 1985 Panther media guide hailed him as "the perfect hometown hero." 
But after Fazio's teams lost 13 games in two seasons, the natives grew restless and 
The Refrain Remained Ever So Familiar 
by Karen Oroake· 
chased the chief out of town. 
First-year coach Lou Holtz, who knew Notre Dame's defense needed transfusions of speed, energy, hustle, aggressiveness and desire, wanted a defensive guru to put the fight back into the Irish. Fazio was welcomed into the Notre Dame camp with. open arms. 
"I can't think of anyone else I'd rather have in charge of my defense," said Holtz. "Foge knows his defense like nobody's business. Just iook at what he's done at other places. Plus, he cares about our players as people. He expects, even demands loyalty, dedication and hard work, but he'd give you the shirt off his back if he needed ·it." 
And now, less than a year. after he'd been issued a one-way ticket out of his. own hometown, Fazio would be staring across the sidelines at players he recruited, · cajoled, hollered at and hugged. On this 
Irish placekicker John Carney provided all the Notre Dame points on field goals from 35, 48 and 20 yards.

sunny Saturday in Notre Dame Stadium, Fazio's enemy was his former family. 
"I'm looking at it as the white shirts (Pitt) against the blue shirts (Notre Dame)," said Fazio earlier in the week. "I'm not going to preoccupy myself with this. It's just a football team. We better be ready and my responsibility is to get us ready." 
But Fazio's new players -the guys in the blue shirts -realized how much the Pitt game meant to him, and they were willing to do anything to present him the game ball. 
"Even though he hasn't emphasized it, we know it's an important game for Foge," said defensive tackle Wally Kleine. 
Notre Dame's defense responded to the unspoken challenge and did just about everything Fazio asked. 
The Irish sacked Pitt's slippery veteran quarterback John Congemi five times ­more than the combined total from the previous four games. 
They shut down the Panthers' rushing attack and allowed them only 23 yards of turf. 
They blocked a Pitt field-goal attempt in the second quarter. 
Notre Dame held Pitt to one long scoring drive which began after an interception. 
And in the fourth quarter, the Irish, trailing by one point at the time, nailed the Panthers on fourth-and-goal from the Notre Dame one-yard line. 
But the defense's superb p~rforinance · wasn't enough as the Irish dropped another heartbreaker, 10-9, in Notre Dame Stadium. 
"It was an exceptionally depressing loss for our football players," said Holtz, who had to wonder if and when the nightmarish finishes were ever going to turn into happy endings for the Irish. "Our players were heartbroken, and my heart's broken for them." 
Once again, Notre Dame had an opportunity to win it at the end. John Carney, who had accounted for all of Notre Dame's nine points on the strength of 35-, 48-and 20-yard field goals, attempted a 38­yard try with just 14 seconds left on the clock. For Carney, it was a chance for redemption. Everyone in the_ stadium knew he had missed a field goal on the last play of the Michigan game, and his team had · lost by a point. Ifhe made this one against Pitt, all previous sins would be forgiven: 
But Carney would have to face· a few more weeks in purgatory. His kick sailed high and apparently far enough as holder· Dan Sorensen leaped in jubilation as he watched the flight of the ball. But the victory celebration was cut short when the officials ruled the kick was wide and no good. 
"From my angle it looked like it went

right over the upright," said Sorensen~ 
"I was walking up and down the sidelines telling people there's no doubt about it," said quarterback Steve Beuerlein, 
' whose passes· for 31 yards to· Milt Jackson 
·.and 22 yards to Anthony Johnson, moved the Irish into position for the.win. "We've been in that situation too many times to come up empty-handed again. We all kind of went into shock." But Carney's missed kick wasn't the reason Notre Dame lost its seventh game in its last eight outings. Had the Irish displayed any consistency, control and flair in their offense and avoided crucial mistakes, Notre Dame might have had a victory, and Foge Fazio would have had something new to display on his mantle. "It was a ballgame in which we knew they'd be tough defensively and we knew we would have to play well defensively,"· said Holtz. Against Pitt's formidable tacklers, who still showed signs of an apprenticeship under Fazio, Notre Dame's ground game was listless. The Irish rushed for just 133 yards on 45 carries for a 2.9 average. And they went the first 12 and one-half minutes of the second quarter without a first down. In addition, Notre Dame turned the ball over twice, failed to score a touchdown and managed to convert only four of 16 third­down situations. ·

"Our offense just wasn't clicking today," said Beuerlein, who didn't start the game because of lack of practice time during the week after suffering a slight concussion against Alabama. 
Holtz replaced Terry Andrysiak, who did not attempt a pass in the game, after the Irish came up empty on their.first two drives. To the junior's credit, he did move Notre Dame to the Pitt 24, but Carney's · first field-goal attempt sailed wide left. . 
Beuerlein came off the bench on the third offensive series and promptly engineered a 59-yard march .that culminated in Carney's first three-pointer, this one from 35 yards. . 
After a bobbled kickoff return forced the Panthers to start from their own one­yard line, Notre Dame's defense allowed them only four yards on three plays. A Pitt punt put the Irish in. excellent field position at the Panther 37. But Beuerlein overthrew . two receivers and was sacked once as Notre Dame failed to capitalize.. 
After the Panthers missed a 36-yard · field-goal attempt that would have tied the· game at 3-3, the Irish closed out the half with another Carney field goal from 48 yards. 
But Notre Dame went from bad to worse in the second half. The Irish moved all the way to 'ihe Pitt 20, but on third down, Beuerlein threw into a crowd and Panther linebacker Steve Apke intercepted at his own 15. 


"I was hoping somebody would come into sight," explained Beuerlein. "I was looking for a good place to throw it away. I should have thrown in in the end zone. I made the wrong decision, once again." 
Pitt turned that interception into its only touchdown drive of the game. Cangemi, who threw short most of the day for 310 yards, capped the 83-yard drive himself with a one-yard touchdown plunge over left guard. 
"I can't say enough about Cangemi," said Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried. "He's battled and battled and he's a great leader. He has a lot of experience and is like a coach on the field. He's a bridge between the players and coaches." 
After Notre Dame's impressive goal-line stand on the first play of the fourth quarter, the Irish bounced back to take a short-lived 9-7 lead on Carney's 20-yard kick. 
All Notre Dame had to do was hang on for less than three minutes, and the Irish would have victory number-two. But, Notre Dame could not get a first down, and Sorensen came in to punt. 
Pitt rushed 10 men, and second-string quarterback Matt Bradley got his hand on Sorensen's kick. The Panthers recovered on the Irish 34. 
"I had my head down, took my two steps and never considered it being blocked," said Sorensen. "I don't know what happened." 
But Pitt assistant coach Chuck Klausing · had noticed something on the previous Irish punt and suggested to Gottfried that the Panthers could pull it off. · 
"On Notre Dame's previous kick, their left guard, a second-string guy, was late getting onto the field," explained Bradley. "He just made it in time. We thought then and there we'd go for the bleak when they kicked the next time."

·NOTRE DAME 31,.AIR FORCE 3 

Lou Holtz called in his seniors the 
afternoon before the Air Force game and 
put the cards on the table. 
He was tired of losing and more than a 
little disappointed in Notre Dame's 1-4 
record. The fact that three of those losses 
came by a combined total of seven· points 
served as small consolation. Holtz doesn't 
care about excuses; he only wants results. 
He wasn't blaming the upperclassmen 
for all of Notre Dame's troubles, but he let 
the seniors know that if they allowed Air 
Force to become only the third team to beat 
the Irish five years in a row, they might be 
history. 
"He said if we didn't start playing like 
Notre Dame men, and like he coached us, 
this might be our last game," said senior 
guard Shawn Heffern. "Everyone talks 
about how motivated Air Force is when 
they play us. There isn't any comparison 
between how motivated they were and how 
motivated we were." 
Holtz's inspirational· talk must have 
worked as the Irish finally got the Falcons 
off their backs with an impressive 31-3 win 
before the customary 59,075 in Notre 
Dame Stadium. 
The offense rolled up 356 yards, while 
the defense finally figured out how to stop 
the Air Force wishbone attack that had 
frustrated the Irish for four years. On this 
beautiful October afternoon, the Falcons 
managed just 245 yards total offense. And 
for the first time in coach Fisher DeBerry's 
tenure, Air Force failed to score a touch­
down. 
Notre Dame's performance was so 
impressive that Holtz could point to few 
negatives after the victory. 

"This was the first time, maybe, that . we've really played a complete game ­offense, defense and the kicking game,"

said Holtz. "I'm really happy for our 
football team, especially our seniors. They 
had never been on a team that defeated Air 
Force, and today we did." 
Indeed, the seniors did have something to prove against Air Force. In chalking up four straight wins over the Irish, the Falcons had averaged almost 400 yards of offense per game. Air Force had manhan­dled and embarrassed Notre Dame. The Irish had had more than enough. 
"They've been very pesky for us," said senior quarterback Steve Beuerlein. "Now was the perfect. time to let that frustration out on them."

"This hurts an awful lot" said DeBerry. "We were very disappointed. I don't know who else thought we could win, but there were 66 guys in there who thought we could and I thought we could." 
But DeBerry should have known it was going to be a long day, especiaily after the Air Force team bus broke down on the way to Notre Dame Stadium. And then the Falcons hit the afternoon's real road block -the Irish defense. 
Notre Dame forced four fumbles (recovering two), plus an interception. The stop troops also recorded seven tackles for losses. · 
"Today .we came out and attacked them," said Figaro, who taiiied four solo hits. "The big plays just seemed to happen. We have to make the breaks and generate turnovers. One of the big factors was that our defense wanted to be out there and play today." 
In the second half, Notre Dame limited Air Force, which had been averaging 324 yards and 29 points a game, to just 40 yards rushing. 
"When you play against the wishbone, the first thing you take away is the fuilback," explained linebacker Mike Kovaleski. ''After that you stop the quarterback and then ail they have left is the pitch. It feels really good to finaily beat Air Force. Through the years, they've always been a thorn in our side. 
"Our change in attitude had a great deal to do with what happened today. People on the outside might not be able to teil the difference, but on the inside you can teil it right away." ~ 
The Irish offense also figured out how to handle Air Force's crafty defense. Notre . Dame roiled up 356 yards -237 on the ground and 119 through the air. 

Steve Beuerlein seldom has been characterized as having quick feet, but his running paid big dividends against Air Force. The Irish senior ran for Notre Dame's second touchdown and totaled 37 yards on 10 attempts -the most by any Irish player.

Lou Holtz had waited and waited. 
He had anticipated. 
He had it all planned out. 
If his struggling Notre Dame football 
team could ever reach the open date in its 
grueling schedule, things would· change. 
The Fighting Irish would be better ­
without a doubt. 
"It'll be like spring practice all over 
again," Holtz warned time and time again, 
as his team battled its way through the first 
half of the nation's toughest agenda. "It'll 
do us a world of good." 
Holtz, renowned as a magician, proved 
a prophet on this occasion. 
His mini-camp paid·big dividends. 
Thanks to a near-perfect first half, Notre 
Dame dismantled its old foe Navy 33-14 in 
front of 61,335 fans at a sold-out Memorial 
Stadium in Baltimore. 
The game marked the 60th annual 
meeting between the two institutions, the 
longest continuous intersectional rivalry in 
the country. They first met in 1927, also in ·Baltimore, with the Irish prevailing 19-6. 
This game wasn't nearly as close. 
Notre Dame's dominance in the first 30 
minutes was incredibly thorough. The Irish 
had 28 points at intermission, while Navy 
had only 23-total yards, that is. 
And although Notre Dame's victory was 
tainted just a bit by a less-than-exciting 
second-half showing, a win is a win is a 
win. That's the bottom line. 
After all, it's a lot better than losing at 
the final gun. 
"I feel a lot better about this football 
team now that we've had a week off to 
gather ourselves and get back to the 
fundamentals," said Holtz, whose team 
ended an eight-game road losing streak and 
beat Navy for the 23rd consecutive time. "I 
thought we'd be an improved team, we just 
had to go out there and prove it. We looked 

A Grand Show At Least For a Half 
by Scott Dupree 
awfully sharp in the first half. ,..__ 
"The second half was a different story. Still, it's a win. I don't ever want to reach the point when a win isn't a good thing. Let me tell you, it's a lot better than working your tail off and losing. Maybe we just need to be in that situation (owning big leads) a little more often." 
Notre Dame built its lead with the passing of quarterback Steve Beuerlein and the receiving whizardry of Tim Brown. 
Beuerlein on this evening would become Notre Dame's all-time leader in total yardage, surpassing Joe Theismann. Brown, the fleet-footed flanker, played at his spectacular best. 
The duo hooked up for a 77-yard touchdown strike early in the second period. Brown displayed enough jukes, cuts and assorted sidesteps in his scoring scamper to make a cornerback dizzy. It was 

· the seventh longe.st pass play in Notre Dame history. 
For all practical purposes, the Beuerlein-Brown connection locked up the victory, although it came midway in the first half. 
Holtz and Brown were duly impressed with the senior quarterback. 
"Steve ran the ballclub really well tonight," Holtz said. "He is a vastly underrated quarterback who has received a lot of unwarranted criticism. 
"If only he were a little bit faster. But if he can't beat you with his feet, he'll beat you with his head. If he can't beat you with his head, he'll beat you with his heart." 
Brown could beat most people with just his legs. He runs the 40 in in a blurred 4.3, and when·he's in the open and throwing hip fakes every which way, well, you can forget it. He's gone. · 
"Tim Brown is as good a player as you 'II find anywhere in the country," Navy coach Gary Tranquill stated matter-of­factly.

Notre Dame's offense enjoyed a glorious first half -helped along by 40 rushing yards from Reggie Ward (left) and 
39 more from Alonzo Jefferson. 

"It seemed like every time I dropped back, Tim Brown was there," mused Beuerlein. "I think everyone saw that when you get the ball to him, good things are going to happen." 
Even Brown, although modest and always out to improve, found a little satisfaction in his first-half performance. 
"I think I played pretty well in the first half," said Brown, understating his contributions. 
Tranquill assumed the role of a realist. Although his Midshipmen had made it respectable in the second half, he knew his club was outmatched in this contest. It could have been worse. . 
"Notre Dame's just bigger and better than us," the Navy skipper said. "They've got a really fine team. It was a typical performance for us, although we did come out with a little intensity in the second half." 
Notre Dame's play was solid all the way · around. 
During the week of the game, Holtz said he would like the Irish attack to be ideally balanced. That is, 250 yards both rushing and pa~sing. Notre Dame came darn close to pulling off that goal. The totals showed 232 rushing and 248 passing. 
"The game was encouraging from the standpoint that we played fairly well offensively, defensively and in the kicking game," said Holtz, covering all the bases. "Our pursuit and aggressiveness have improved in recent weeks. 
"We don't have all the answers just yet. But we're a decent team when we don't make mistakes." 
Mistakes were few and far between on this brisk evening. And Notre Dame was much more than decent. 
In the first half, at least. 
The second half was quite another tale. 
For a while, it appeared that the Irish 

would breeze through the final two periods just like they had in the initial two ­without even punting. 
Notre Dame took the second half kickoff and marched straight down the field to the Midshipman three-yard line. But the drive stalled at the two, and the Irish settled for a field goal. 
"That put us in a bad mood," Holtz said. It also seemed to take the wind out of 
the Irish sails, ·or else it blew gale-force­winds behind the Navy vessel. 
From that point on, when the Irish took an invincible 31-0 lead, the game turned around completely. Navy found life and intensity. Notre Dame fizzled. The Irish managed a mere safety the rest of the way. 
When Navy pulled to within 33-14 with over seven minutes left, that once-huge lead didn't look so impressive any more. 
"I can't put _my finger on what hap­pened," Brown ·said. "But when they got 14, we started to get worried." 
"We have to find that killer instinct," Beuerlein said. "If we get anyone down from here on in, we've got to keep them down. Navy came after us in the second half. They won that half. We were flat." 
The lackadasical effort didn't sit well with anyone after the game. It subdued what might have been a rowdy lockerroom afterwards, had the Irish won really big. 
"Yeah, I think that if we had shut them out, we would have been really pumped up now," said linebacker Cedric Figaro, who recovered his sixth fumble of the season, setting a new Irish record in that depart­ment. "In the second half, we kind of 

Notre Dame's only scoring in the final 27 minutes came on this fourth-period play in which Cedric Figaro nailed Navy quarterback Bob Misch in the end zone. An intentional grounding call gave the Irish two points• 
relaxed. It all comes back to mental errors." Holtz was none too thrilled with his team's breakdown. 
"I was surprised at how poorly ·we played in the second half," he said. "We need what they call killer instinct.· I call it personal pride. 
"I don't think the players are happy with how they played in the second half. It was like two different games. 
. 
"I think we h!arned a valuable lesson today. We just didn't keep up the intensity, the concentration, in the second half. That's as· much my fault as anything. I let them come out flat. But that's the first time it's happened. I didn't provide the right kind of leadership." 
Holtz pointed to one decision that may have led to the letdown. He waited until late in the third quarter to· put the second · team in the game. In retrospect, he would

. have made the move earlier. 
"When you're up 31-0, the first unit is 
not going to haye the drive and determina­
tion," Holtz said. "They proved what they 
came to prove. You have to have the second 
unit come in and try to prove that they can 
start." · · The fact that the Irish were disappointed afterward proved an encouraging sign, Holtz said. · "I. was proud ofthem," he: said. "I told them I liked their attitude about it, but I didn't want them to be too down. I wanted them to think about how well they are capable of playing." Againt Navy, exceptionally well. Notre Dame's sparkling play in the first · half revealed a strange trait about the game. When the Irish made the big plays, the crowd in Memorial Stadium (located more than 800 miles from South Bend) got quite excited . Estimates indicated that about 30,000 fans were rooting the Irish. ·So· much for the home field advantage. "One of the great things about playing for Notre Dame is that the fans are a great big family," Beuerlein said, "and no matter where you play, ·there are a lot of people on your side." ·'. The throng of Irish supporters made 


certain Beuerlein knew about his new total yardage record. When the giant scoreboard displayed the news, Beuerlein was immedi­ately aware that he had just passed Theismann. 
For Beuerlein, though, personal recognition takes a backseat to team achievements on the priority list. 
"It's obviously quite an honor," he said. "It's something-to be proud of when.you start talking about guys like Joe Theismaim and all. 
"But any success I may have is due directly to my teammates. My main concern right now is with the team and its overall performance, not with Steve Beuerlein." 
Still, his outstanding performance against the Midshipmen had to be person­ally satisfying. If nothing else, it served to wipe away the bad taste of earlier outings against Navy. 
He threw four interceptions against Navy as a sophomore. As a junior, he departed in the first quarter and watched the rest of the game from the sidelines. 
"Traditionally, I haven't played well against these guys," Beuerlein said. "I approached this game as a chance to make up for what I did my last two years against them." 
For the team as a whole, previous Navy games carried no bad memories. The Irish hadn't lost in this tradition-rich series since 1963, when Roger Staubach quarterbacked the Midshipmen. 
No, Notre Dame wasn't out to erase any bad memories on this night. The Irish were just out to prove themselves. ·

NOTRE DAME 61, SMU 29 

Tim Brown had to wait 679 days to face 
SMU again. 
It was a long wait at times, but he had 
constant reminders that the game was on 
the horizon. 
He also knew it would be the only other 
chance in his collegiate career to face his 
hometown school. That's why he made the 
most of this opportunity to gain a little · personal revenge. 
On a beautifully sunny day at Notre 
Dame Stadium, Notre Dame evened its 
record at 4-4 and destroyed the fading 
Mustangs 61-29 in the team's most 
impressive offensive showing of the decade. 
The Irish offense rolled up 615 yards and 
the defense continually came up with 
outstanding plays to fuel the rout. 
But even before the opening kickoff, all 
eyes were focused on Brown. His story had 
been well documented the days prior to the 
game and the Irish faithful wondered if he 
could have the outing he ·wanted so dearly 
against the· Mustangs. 
By the end of the second quarter that ·question was answered, but another one 
sprang up. Just how good of a day was Tim 
Brown going to have? 
Brown's waiting period to play the 
Mustangs began just one day after the two 
teams met in the 1984 Aloha Bowl. After 
·staving off a late Irish rally, SMU emerged 
with a hard-fought 27-20 victory midway 
across the Pacific. 
"I had to go home the day after that," 
Brown recalls. "I heard from the team. 
Guys were calling me up, getting on me. 
That was one game we really wish we 
could have won because we were in it the 
whole way. We just had a couple of bad 
breaks and we ended-up losfng." 
One of those bad breaks might have 
been not· getting Brown the ball enough. In 
his freshman bowl encounter, he caught 
only one pass and carried the ball just 
once. 




Offensive Fireworks Help Corral The Mustangs. 
by Jim Daves 
Wes Pritchett celebrates a bright moment for the Notre Dame stop troops following this tackle of SMU flanker Ron Morris. 



Notre Dame took command of the contest with this second-period play in which Robert Banks forced a Bobby Watters' fumble. Cedric Figaro recovered for the Irish, and Tim Brown scored on the following play for a 24-14 Notre 
Dame lead. 

Following a week of phone calls from his friends who attended SMU, Brown found a future Notre Dame football schedule and took note of the Nov. 8 date nearly two years away between the two schools. 
He knew he would get another chance. 

As a high school prep standout at Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas, Brown was the focus of a heated recruiting battle between Notre Dame and SMU. 
"For a while, I really thought I would go to SMU," Brown says. "I think up until I got a letter from Notre Dame, which was in the middle of my junior year, I was going to SMU. There was no doubt in my mind." 
But then Brown, with the help of his family, started to take a more serious look at college and what his forthcoming education would mean. 
"I would have loved to be in that ·school,'' says Brown of SMU, "but I just felt I needed to be away and grow up a little bit. It just came down to which was going to help me? If I got hurt and couldn't play football anymore, which was the best school for me?" 
While Brown was deciding to attend Notre Dame over SMU, a hot high school quarterback prospect named Bobby Watters was doing just the opposite. 
"I almost came here,'' Watters told a swarm of reporters after the game. "But my mother was ill, so I made SMU number one and Notre Dame number two." 
Watters' early guidance almost made the Mustangs tops on the afternoon as well. After Alonzo Jefferson's two-yard gallop 
4:40 into the contest gave the Irish a 7-0 lead, SMU struck quickly. Junior Cobby Morrison took Watter's handoff and raced 43 yards down the left sideline to key the Mustangs' second drive of the game. Following a 23-yard dash by Watters to the three, Jeff Atkins tied the game with a dive over the right side. 
Mixing the passing and ground game, 

the Irish rushed back downfield and 
regained the lead on John Carney's 38-yard 
field goal. 
Watters put SMU up 14-10 by keying an 

87-yard drive at the start of the second · quarter. Hitting .six consecutive passes, he 
drove the Mustangs to the Irish three where 
Atkins repeated his earlier heroics for 
another three-yard touchdown plunge. 
Notre Dame only needed 2:18 to climb 

back on top and it was Brown who got the 
Irish going. After Steve Beuerlein's deep 
pass intended for Milt Jackson was tipped 
away, Beuerlein decided to go short and 
found a wide-open Brown at the 46. With 
the speed that would later shatter several 
University track records, Brown sprinted 
60 yards to the SMU five. Anthony 
Johnson went airborne twice before 
cracking the goal line, putting Notre Dame 
up 17-14. 
After Carney's kickoff sailed through 

the Mustangs' end zone, the Irish defense 
put a quick end to the see-saw nature of the game with an explosive play. 

Keeping with his successful passing game, Watters dropped back and rolled to his left on first down looking for a receiver. He kept looking, and looking, and looking, and looking. Soon the only thing Watters saw open was an onrushing Robert Banks, who promply lassoed the Mustang quarterback for a five-yard loss and a fumble. Cedric Figaro pounced on the loose ball to record his seventh fumble recovery of the season. 
"I could see him looking off one receiver to another," Banks said. "I knew our secondary had the deep receivers covered and our linebackers had picked up the people underneath. He looked frus-. trated because nobody was open." 
Banks would know. By that point he was close enough that he could dearly see the emotion in Watters' eyes. 
"Getting the ball on the 15 was a big lift," said Brown, who promptly followed Johnson's block into the end zone on the ensuing play. "Then getting the first play in the end zone got the crowd pumped up. It got us all going." 
In just 13 seconds the Irish had gone from a 14-10 deficit to a 24-14 lead that would keep growing. 
After the Notre Dame defense stifled SMU on its next drive the offense took over, still in high gear. 
Beuerlein fired three passes to Jackson·, Braxston Banks and Joel Williams to land the Irish at the SMU eight. He then connected to Brown for an apparent 
''The play sel~ction, · the play of the . offensive line, it was a good day all · .around~ The passing··package was well executed. Arid when I get the protection · ·I· had-today,. I can sit and wait for · 
thingsto happeri. '' 
__:_ Steve. Beuerlein 

touchdown but an illegal use of the hands penalty wiped out the play. Carney's 40­yard boot made it 27-14 with 4:22left in the quarter. 
After exchanging punts the Irish began their final scoring drive of the half with just 50 seconds remaining. Beuerlein tossed three passes to get Notre Dame to the 13 where Carney hit his third field goal to push the lead to 30-14. 
Freshman Mike Stonebreaker, activated to duty when captain Mike Kovaleski left the game in the first quarter after suffering a mild concussion, got things going in the second half when he picked off Watters' tipped pass and returned it to the Mustangs' 
30. Stonebreaker would finish the day with a team-high 10 tackles. 
Notre Dame switched to the ground attack and used eight plays to expand the lead to 37-14 when Pernell Taylor bull­dozed seven yards out of the wishbone. 
Watters got SMU back within reach by working the option to perfection on an 80­yard drive. Sophomore tailback Darryl Terrell drove the final 20 yards on four carries and Watters' two-point conversion pass to Albert Reese sliced the Irish lead to 37-22. 
Any momentum SMU gained was quickly lost. 
Following the kickoff Beuerlein hit a streaking Brown at the SMU 45 and he turned on the afterburners to race into the end zone and record books with an 84-yard reception. It was the third longest comple­tion in Irish history. 

Everybody got iiito the act against SMU -16 different rushers in all -including Pernell Taylor who gains some of 
his 31 yards. He turned out to be one of six different Irish ballcarriers who found the end zone. 
\ 
"We knew we could beat them deep, but it was just a matter of getting the wind at our back," said Brown who confessed to bobbling and almost dropping the pass. "Once we got our chance, we took advantage of it. After their touchdown we tried to break their backs." 
After Banks forced another fumble, Lou Holtz turned to 'his reserves and they responded by getting Carney to the five where he popped his record-tying fourth field goal. 
Aaron Robb and Terry Andrysiak both scrambled for fourth-quarter scores to put the Irish ahead 61-22 before Watters threw for a meaningless touchdown late in the contest to provide the final margin. 
The shootout had turned into an old­fashioned ambush when all was said and done. Brown accounted for 235 all-purpose yards, including four receptions for a whopping 176 yards. During the afternoon he averaged 19.6 yards every time he touched the ball. 
Beuerlein established a personal mark with 269 aerial yards and engineered the offense to most of its 615 yards, the highest total of the decade for an Irish team. 
"The play selection, the play of the offensive line, it was a good day all ~round," Beuerlein said. "The passing package was well designed and well executed. And when I get the protection I had today, I can sit and wait for things to happen." 

"Gee, they had a heck of a game," said SMU defensive tackle Jerry Ball. "They made so many big plays. I just don't know how that Tim Brown gets open so much. They do so many different things with hirri and we just couldn't cover everything he does." 
"There wasn't much we could do," Watters said. "Everything they did turned out right and we were playing ·catchup almost all the time. 
"Nothing went wrong for them and nothing right for us. It was a helpless feeling." · 
It was a satisfying one for Brown, however. He knew the phone would not be ringing when he got back to his dorm room in Cavanaugh Hall. 
"I won't say much to my friends back home who are SMU fans," Brown said. "But I'll have to giggle a little when I see them."

PENN STATE 24, NOTRE DAME 19 

How many times would Notre Dame seemingly do everything but win in a football game against a highly-ranked opponent? 
How many times would the Irish keep a stiff upper lip in their lockerroom and assert that they'd get through the frustra­tion, they'd keep their heads up and they'd. live to fight another day against another top 10 team? 
How many times would Lou Holtz have to face a room full of players who had just had their hearts carved out in defeat and try to tell them that life would go on, that one of these times the breaks would go their way, that one of these times they would play the game of their lives and finally win? 
At least one more time. Penn State 24, Notre Dame 19. 
On yet another Saturday, against another unbeaten -and national championship­bound, as it turned out -foe, the storyline remained the same. No need to rewrite the lead from the Michigan or Michigan State or Pittsburgh games. Just play back those same Holtz quotes that talk about sterling efforts in defeats and valiant performances going unrewarded. 
"Real close," said Irish quarterback Steve Beuerlein, whose career-high 311 yards through the air went for naught. "That's the story of our last four years here. 
"I thought this time it was going to be different. I thought this time we seniors would walk out of here with a special victory. But once again it just didn't work out. We're a lot better than 4-5 and that's what makes it so hard to accept." 
What made this particular defeat a bit harder to swallow than the others was the fact that the Irish had come into the contest riding a wave of confidence and enthusiasm made possible by three straight victories

that helped to dull the pain of the 1-4 Notre Dame start. 
This was Notre Dame's chance to top the .500 mark, maybe even a chance to stake a claim to a postseason bowl opportunity.-This was Notre Dame's shot to spoil the big boys' plan·s for their dream bowl matchup of unbeatens -to throw the national title race into turmoil. 
· Yet, once again the Irish had to satisfy themselves with mere pats on the back. The celebration took place in the locker­room across the hall, while the home-team players were left to shake their heads and wonder what more had to be done. 
In retrospect, great teams make great plays in key situations of great games. No team did that better than third-rated Penn State did in the final two minutes of this game. The Nittany Lions came up with a defensive stand of gigantic proportions ­one maybe not quite as important to Nittany Lion fans as the one that took place six weeks later against Miami in the Fiesta Bowl, but one that surely permitted the second one to be possible. 
Penn State linebacker Shane Conlan admitted to Notre Dame's Tim Brown at a gathering of Associated Press All­Americans a few weeks later that the Nittany Lions had been scared to death when the Irish set up with a first and goal at the Penn State six with a minute left. The Nittany Lions' perfect season hung in the balance at that point -yet the visitors played those last four downs as if they were the ones on offense. 
"When that drive started, I looked up and saw a full moon, and I thought, 'What's going on here?' " Penn State linebacker Trey Bauer said. "It was like a horror movie." 
And Beuerlein created most of the horror himself. Playing like a man possessed in his last Notre Dame Stadium appearance, Beuerlein gave the Irish every possible chance for victory when Notre Dame took over for what certainly would be its last shot from its own 20 with 2:29 remaining and Penn State on top by five. 
A field goal wouldn't be good enough here, and the Irish appeared to understand . that when they took just 74 seconds to dash 74 yards. Beuerlein completed five straight passes to start the final drive -first dumping the ball to Anthony Johnson over the middle for 22; second, nailing a quick out to Ray Dumas for nine; third, finding Milt Jackson over the middle for 15 on a sensational grab; fourth, dropping the ball off to Tom Monahan for nine, and fifth, leading Jackson perfectly on a crossing route for 19 more. 
But, starting on first down from the Penn State six, the Nittany Lion defense took the offensive. On first down, on a pitch sweep to Tim Brown, the Irish ran left with only a single tight end on a play 

Penn State's John Shaffer seldom was flashy -but he did just enough to make the Nittany Lions winners again. 
designed for two. Loss of three yards. That extra tight end was supposed to block safety Ray Isom who made the tackle. 
"I knew no one else was out there," lsom said. "If I don't make that play, our season is over." Said Beuerlein, "We were excited, but it's my job to make sure the right people are out there." 
On second and goal from the nine came the play everyone in the park agreed changed the whole tenor of the finishing moments. As Beuerlein backpedaled to throw, he never even had a chance to consider a single receiver because Bob· White stormed the middle and dumped the Irish quarterback at the 18. 
"That was the most critical play," said Holtz. "It pushed us back to the 18 and the 18 is a lot different than the nine." 
"I don't think Beuerlein was expecting it because of where I lined up," White said. "I was outside the tackle. When I came up the middle, he was still dropping back." 
After a timeout came the closest of the four attempts at paydirt. With Joel Williams heading straight for the goalposts, Beuer­lein's pass to him at the goal line slithered through his outstretched hands. 
"He was open," said Penn State cornerback Gary Wilkerson. "So I dove at him. I figured either I would knock it down or get pass interference. The season was flashing before my eyes." 
"I felt the ball on my fingertips, then he hit my arms," added Williams. . 
On fourth down, Beuerlein searched in vain for a receiver in the end zone, then finally dropped the ball off to Mark Green whose knee immediately went down at the 
13. A host of nearby white-jerseyed Penn Staters probably would have kept him from scoring even if he had kept his feet. 
"I probably should have thrown it deep, but I was looking long and just didn't see anybody,"' said Beuerlein. 
"On the last drive, the first thing I said when I went in the huddle was, 'Do you guys want to win?' I said, 'Let's do it. This is our game. It's finally ours.' " And so it almost was.

The biggest hurdle for the Fighting Irish was that they were up against a fundamen­tally sound football team that knew how to win, featured one short of a dozen fifth­year senior starters, didn't help by committing a single turnover --and yet managed to win by throwing only 13 passes and finishing with almost half as many first downs (14) as Notre Dame (27). Holtz's crew needed a perfect performance and nearly got it. ­
Some teams can survive errors or simply play through them. But few teams have seen more of their miscues come back to haunt them in critical situations of razor­close games than Notre Dame did in 1986. 
On an afternoon in which he threw the ball better than in any other game in his college career (24 of 39 for those 311 yards and no interceptions), Beuerlein's inability to hold onto the football ended up sabotag­ing a pair of drives. 
One lost fumble at the Nittany Lion 22 on Notre Dame's very first possession (it gained 40 yards) not only thwarted a chance to score but also sent Penn State on its way to an 11-play scoring drive in the other direction. The second bobble came just a minute before the first half ended and enabled Penn State to add three points to its intermission advantage. 
A third missed opportunity came after Penn State's first-period touchdown when a picture-perfect 97-yard kickoff return by Brown came back because of clipping. 


Yet, much like the Michigan game, Notre Dame's offense at times appeared to move the ball at will -again, against a team with a prolific defensive reputation. 
Though they only produced a field goal, the Irish converted four straight times on third down in a seemingly endless first-and second-period march that lasted nearly eight and a half minutes and totaled 18 plays. They proved they could strike fast, taking. the lead early in the second half on a Brown reception after Beuerlein had stepped up in the pocket and launched a 50-yard rocket to Jackson.

Even after Penn State had scored on 
successive drives to command what 
appeared to be a safe 11-point lead in the 
early moments of the final period, 
Beuerlein and his mates got themselves in 
position for their final shot with a iO-play 
excursion so proficient that the down 

marker didn't display. the-number three -until the scoring pass to Brown. 
Penn State remained unbeaten because it 
did what had to be done to win the football 
game. On an afternoon in which Michigan 
was upset to give the Nittany Lions a 
chance to move to second in the polls 
behind Miami, Joe Paterno's team didn't

care that the luck of the Irish was a long time overdue. 
"I don't feel like we lost the game," said a subdued Holtz later, "it's just that Penn State won it. I really don't know what else to say. I said earlier I thought we could play with a team of Penn State's caliber, and we did, even though we didn't get any breaks out there. 
"I couldn't be prouder of a football team than this one. It's frustrating. I guess I could cry and show you how I feel that way, but I can't tell you what's in my heart. 
"Other teams have played great against us and sometimes we don't do the little things we need to. But this football team came from a long way down, and I refuse to classify these athletes as losers. A week from now, everyone is going to be talking about what a disappointing season it was and how we let everybody down. But our players know everything will work itself out in the long run. 
"Right now one lockerroom is happy and one is not. Ours is not, and yet they played their hearts out." 
Added Paterno: "I told the squad, 'You beat a great team today.' I've never been around a team that caught the ball the way Notre Dame did today. This is an awfully good football team. They may be 4-5 right now, but I don't know if there are 19 better teams in the country.'' 
So, one more time Notre Dame had to be satisfied with playing gallantly against a 9-0 Penn State squad. that wouldn't quit any more than the Irish would. 
One more time the Irish had to outlast the frustration and try to figure ways to regroup with two more top 20 teams on the horizon. 
One more time' Holtz had to find a way to say they deserved a better fate. Penn State 24, Notre Dame 19. One more time.

LSD 21, NOTRE DAME 19 

Notre Dame football players usually make a sportswriter's job easier. 
Intelligent, quick, glib and outgoing, Irish players know that sentences contain a subject and a verb and that "well, you know" doesn't belong in their vocabulary. And Notre Dame players rarely duck a reporter's probing questions, even when the 

Same Old Sad SongFor.Irish

times are tough and the chips are down. 
But after dropping their fifth game of the season by a touchdown or less to eighth-ranked Louisiana State, the Irish weren't in the mood to chitchat. 
Team captain Mike Kovaleski, who led the Notre Dame defense with 11 tackles, sat in the corner of the quiet lockerroom with his head in his hands. He'd seen this scene before -there was nothing new about it. 
"Sorry, I have nothing to say," Kov~leski politely told a reporter. "I just ... uhhh ... I'm sorry." 
And Tim Brown, who accounted for Notre Dame's first touchdown in the

opening period with a spine-tingling 96­yard kickoff return, already had camped in the team bus before reporters invaded the lockerroom. 
But no one, not even a desperate sportswriter fighting a tight deadline, could complain. The Irish did not intend to be rude. There just wasn't much anyone could say about Notre Dame's 21-19 defeat in Tiger Stadium. After all, it was the same story as in four of the five previous Irish losses. Notre Dame came close, but close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades. 
"It was like so many other games,"· said a disappointed Lou Holtz, who was now . assured of compiling a losing record in his first season at Notre Dame. "You walk off the field and you say, 'I've been here before. I've seen this show.' 
"It's like going to the altar to marry the girl of your dreams and being jilted -five times.'' 
Indeed, there were similarities between the loss to LSU and the previous defeats to Michigan, Michigan State, Pitt and Penn State. In every game, the Irish had a chance to win it near the end. And in every contest, their efforts went haywire. 
Trailing 21-13 with just over five minutes remaining, Notre Dame seized a chance for redemption when cornerback 
· Troy Wilsori intercepted Tom Hodson's pass in the Irish end zone. · 
Holtz called on backup quarterback Terry Andrysiak to lead the rally, instead of senior starter Steve Beuerlein, who had been sacked and intercepted on the previous drive. Helped along by a 15-yard LSU penalty, Andrysiak completed passes to split end Tony Eason (24 yards) and fullback Pernell Taylor (15 yards) to move the Irish to the Tiger 14-yard line. On third and two, Andrysiak dropped back and threw the ball to' the back of the end zone where tailback D'Juan Francisco grabbed it for the score. That touchdown was the first allowed by LSU in the final_quarter all year. 
Now behind by two points with 3:32 to go, Notre Dame went for the tie on the two-point conversion. But Andrysiak's pass, intended for Joel Williams, was uncatchable. The Irish now stood 0-4 in two-point tries. · 
"The funny thing is that we used the same defense on the two-point play that we used on their touchdown," explained Tiger defensive coach Mike Archer. "We blitzed two outside linebackers and the strong safety. The difference was, on the touch­down, they made a great throw and a great catch." 
Had the Irish been able to play some defense on the final LSU drive, Notre Dame probably would have had another shot at victory. But Hodson, a freshman who exhibited the poise and savvy of a seasoned veteran, came through on a pair of third-and-long conversions to keep the ball away from the Irish. 
"LSU made some great plays to maintain possession," said Holtz. "They beat us at their best." 
Although they had a chance for a come­from-behind victory, the Irish really didn't play all that well before the 78,197 Baton Rouge rowdies. Poor pass defense and a mediocre running game contributed to Notre Dame's downfall. And the mental mistakes and miscues didn't help. 

45 


"You question yourself on a million different things," said Holtz. "Things change so much during the course of the game. One play affects the rest of them. You can say, 'If this play and that play worked,' but if this play and that play had worked, the rest of them would be completely different. What can you say?" 
Four key plays told the sad, but familiar story. 
With the score tied at seven in the second quarter, Brown, a first-team All­American, let a Beuerlein pass slip through his hands at the LSU five. 
Then, with :31 left in the first half, John Carney had a 49-yard field goal nullified because of an LSU deadball offside penalty before the snap. When he kicked it over from 44 yards out, he missed. That sent the Irish into the lockerroom at intermission on the short end of a 14-7 score. 
In the third quarter, Notre Dame had a first-and-goal situation on the LSU two. But three inside runs and a stab by Brown at the outside left the Irish empty-handed at the five. 
And with 6:50 remaining, Beuerlein was intercepted at the LSU 20. 


"I guess you can call it bad luck,'' said linebacker Dave Butler, who had three quarterback sacks for 10 yards in losses. "I really don't put much stock in luck. But if there's really any such thing, then I don't think we have it. Maybe LSU deserves credit. They made the big plays; we didn't." 
The Irish began the contest flatter than a dining hall pancake. 
. In the first quarter, Notre Dame could do nothing to stop the Tigers, who rolled up 178 yards to Notre Dame's six. In fact, the Irish offense didn't touch the football until the 0:45 mark of the first period.· 
"It's the first time we've come out this · way," said Notre Dame center Chuck Lanza. "This team's been through an awful lot. It's a heck of a lot to ask a team to come back week after week against some. of the people we play after what we've been through." 
On the game's opening drive, LSU marched 71 yards in 11 plays to take a 7-0 lead· on Hodson's 13-yard bullet to Wendell Davis. 
. But the Irish tied the game 12 seconds later on Brown's impressive return. The junior flanker pulled, the ball in at the Notre Dame four-yard line, squeezed through a horde of Tiger defenders at the 20 and made a mad dash for the end zone. It was Brown's second touchdown return of theyear. . 
"Tim Brown is a great football player," said Tiger coach Bill Arnsparger. "We did a pretty good job of containing him offensively. We thought we were smart enough to keep him from burning us on the return. We were wrong." 
But Brown's kickoff return failed to light a fire under his defensive teammates. 
On its next possession, LSU bulldozed its way through the Notre Dame defense with an 82-yard, 17-play scoring drive. 
The next time the Tigers touched the ball, they moved all the way to the Irish 19, but David Browndyke's 36-yard field goal attempt failed. 
Notre Dame did not get its first first down until midway through the second period when Andrysiak scrambled for 22 yards, the longest Irish gain on the ground all night. Even that bright spot dimmed two plays later when Andrysiak fumbled at

midfield. 
"We were lucky to be down by seven at halftime," said Holtz. "It should have been more. Our players were down at halftime. But you have to give them credit. They came back." 
Notre Dame's defense finaiiy awoke in the third quarter. The Irish did not give up a first down in the period. · 
"We came iri here at the half and told each other it was just a matter of getting back to basics;" said Butler. "I think we came together as a team." 
In the third period, Notre Dame marched to the LSU 14-yard line, but the drive staiied and the Irish had to settle for a 31-yard field goal from Carney. Another Carney field goal -this one from 44 yards -brought the Irish back to within one at 14-13 with 11:34 left in the game. 
But LSU put together a 79-yard scoring drive that put the Tigers on top 21-13. Those 21 points were enough to hold up for the Sugar Bowl-bound Tigers. 
"This is absolutely unbelievable," said Holtz. "What more can you teii kids after a game like this? You have to give LSU ali the credit in the world. But these are getting painful and maybe our day wiii come." 
Although Holtz had faced the same scenario before, the long plane ride back to South Bend gave the first-year coach and his Irish plenty to contemplate. 
Would they ever be able to shake the spell of misfortune that had plagued them all season? 
Would they ever be able to eliminate the little mistakes that turn into costly errors? 
Would all those valiant come-from­behind raiiies ever result in a glorious victory? 
Would Notre Dame footbali ever wake up the echoes again?

N(JfRE DAME 38, USC 37 
::-· . 

They told Lou Holtz when he took the job of head football coach at Notre Dame there would be days like this one. 
They tell Irish players when they matriculate there will be Saturdays like this. 
They just never told Holtz or John Carney or Steve Beuerlein or any of the other Irish seniors they would have to wait so long for a moment like this~or that that moment, once it arrived, could be so· eminently satisfying. 
Saying Notre Dame defeated USC 38-:37 doesn't. begin to tell the story of one of the more impressive comebacks in Irish gridiron history. 
This was· football played for pride-not only for a Notre Darrie tearri already · guaranteed a losing record but also for a USC team trying to save the job of its head coach, Ted Tollner, despite a New Year's Day invitation to the Citrus Bowl. 
After five losses by an. amazing total of 14 points, this marked one last chance for the Irish to get it right-and they did it in· such spectacular fashion that stunned Trojan players were sprawled numbly on the field at the finish. 
The terse wire-story version said John Carney's 19-yard field goal as time expired won it for Notre Dame. Yet, that hardly told the saga of a remarkable display of fortitude by a seemingly forever-jinxed band of Irish-and, in particular, by a handful of Californians on the Notre Dame roster who couldn't possibly have imagined a more enjoyable outing in their own backyard. 
There had been plenty of moist eyes in the Notre Dame locker room during '86­but this time the tears of joy gave a whole new meaning to a season in which the Irish lent a different significance to the word 
competitive~ 

~hey· Told Holtz There Would Be Days Like ~his 
by John Heisler 


'86 Irish finale. 

. ­



"The USC game was a great game for the spectators, but don't forget we had five other games just like that. The difference was the ball went through the uprightS this time," Holtz says. "We had so many times where it seemed we were down two t~uchdowns and came back to put ourselves in position to win the game. The USC game was the first time we climbed over the summit. 
"I thought it was a tribute to our players because, as I've said many times, it was like going to the altar five times and _getting jilted every time. It gets tough to get 'em to come back that sixth time. But our kids kept coming back. 
''That's why I hated to see the season end on the Saturday when .we really came of age. I just hope we can build on that confidence next season. It's-so much easier t~ improve after you win a game like that one. Ifwe could have come back and played the next week, we would have been a much, much better football team." 
As it was, Holtz would have to be satisfied with a merely exceptional comeback on the particular Saturday. The list of heroes went on so long, it proved difficult to single out individuals. 
But try Beuerlein. 

Starting the 42nd and final game of a checkered career_ in front of his hometown­fans, the senior from nearby Fullerton almost watched his afternoon go up in 

''Itha.nk Godh~ 
· 
. had fa~th· to put me back 
· .in. Thada gut>.:._·::· feeling' he wbl4d . · ; give me ariother... chance.· Whe!ilie .· asked.me if Iwas·:~ . _ready to :play; t · 

flames. He'd been amply warned by Notre Dame's head coach after throwing an interception on his final attempt the previous Saturday at LSU (that came after a record 119 straight throws without an intercept). 
"Coach Holtz let me know that if I had any turnovers against USC, drastic action might take place," admitted Beuerlein, who could only watch as the Trojans' Lou Brock picked off his cross-the-field second-quarter throw and return it58 yards for a 10-6 USC lead. 
"I knew that was probably it for me. Coach came up to me and said, "There's nothing to be said. Terry's in(junior quarterback Andrysiak).' " 
But Holtz chose to give Beuerlein one more chance, reinserting him on the next series. 
"I thank God he had faith to put me back in," Beuerlein said. "I was thinking about how it was my last game, in front of all my friends and family and how this was · no way to go out. But I had a gut feeling he would give me another chance. When he asked me if I was ready to play, I said, 'Yes: sir, you won't regret it.' " 
Beuerlein proved just short of sensa­tional the rest of the way, finishing with four touchdown passes-tying records for most scoring throws ever against the Trojans and the most by an Irish quarter-
The excitement generated by Tim Brown's fourth-period, 56-yard punt return is mirrored in the faces on the Irish sidelines as Brown speeds by. · · · 


John Carney kicks the critical three-pointer out of Steve Bauerlein's hold~ ..· 
back in a single game. Try Milt Jackson. Often hidden in the shadow of Tim 
Brown's efforts, Jackson made a play as spectacular as any made all day as he went 
· high in the air in the end zone, outleaping Trojan safety Junior Thurman for the ball. That 42-yard s-coring pass cut the USC lead to 37-27 and came just 43 seconds after a Rodney Peete quarterback sneak had given USC a seemingly-insurmountable 37-20 advantage with just 12:26 left. 
Try Brown himself. 
All he did in the final half alone was return a kickoff 57 yards to set up the · scoring bomb to Jackson, catch a 49-yard pass to set up another Irish touchdown and then return a punt 56 yards (only the second punt return of his career) to set up Carney's game-winning field goal. 
Try the all-California backfield duo of tailback Mark Green (Riverside) and fullback Braxston Banks (Hayward). 
Green, who hadn't carried the football once the previous week at LSU, gained a season-high 119 yards on 24 carries­marking the first time all year any Irish running back gained more than 73 yards in a game. Banks caught a pair of scoring passes from Beuerlein and added another 30 rushing yards. 
Try unsung sophomore tight end Andy Heck. 
He scored Notre Dame's first touch­down, but-more impressively-he banged heads with-the USC defense on a two-point conversion try in the final period and came away the winner. Seemingly halted short of the goal line after catching a quick pass from Beuerlein, Heck's second and third efforts finally pushed him across the stripe, making the count 37-35 and giving Carney a chance for the gamewinner moments later. 
. Try the game Irish defense. 
Though Notre Dame allowed the Trojans eight more points than it permitted against any other opponent in '86, the Irish got tough when it counted. They held strong on a fourth-and-inches attempf at the Notre Dame five with just over six minutes to play. USC disdained the probably-· automatic field goal, only to watch a Peete sneak come up short-setting the stage for Notre Dame's late rally. 
Finally, try Carney. · 
Despite breaking both the season and career records for field goals, the usually­dependable senior placekicker had been remembered more in '86 for his last-second misses against Michigan and Pitt-each of which would have been gamewinners. This time, Carney knocked the albatross from around his neck by nailing three three­pointers, the last of which from 19 yards at the final gun culminated the improbable comeback. 
Notre D'ame spent the entire 1986 season outgaining opponents in total yardrs, 

..... ---..... .,..~.-. ........,.--.,_...-~ ........·~--~-... -·--·-----:-..... f 
. __· .. ·--' ..... ··-----.. ·-----·--------··-------·--·: ~----·-__ ,__j. 

first downs and.just about everything else except points. The first half of this contest gave every indication ofa repeat perform­ance. 
The halftime stat sheet said Notre Dame had outgained USC 228-134, out-first downed the Trojans 16-7, run 38 plays to 23 for USC and held the football for 22: 16 compared to 7:44 for the home team. Yet, somehow, USC led 20-9. 
The second quarter, by itself, was ahnost impossible to explain. The Irish ran off 29 plays (to six for USC) and held the ball for all but 1:58 of the period-yet they were outscored 17-3, thanks to Brock's interception return, a four-play 66-yard scoring drive that lasted all of 1:31 plus Don Shafer's ·record-setting 60-yard field 
goal on the final play of the half. But the Irish, .who had seen more than their share of bizarre scenes in the Los Angeles Coliseum over the years, were about to add one more t9 the list. Yet, the second half didn't exactly begin auspiciously. Pernell Taylor fumbled on the first play from scrimmage, and the Irish defense had to fight off the Trojans at the Notre Dame three before another Shafer field goal made it 23-9. Carney knocked through another of his field goals and-after Brown's 57-yard kickoff return-Banks hauled in the first of his scoring receptions. But, in between, USC scored again on a 70-yard march that would have ended prematurely except for a roughing-the-kicker penalty against Notre Dame on a USC punt. When the Trojans drove relentlessly through the Irish to make it 37-20 following a 62-yard march that ended 2:34 into the final period, the Notre Dame cause looked almost hopeless. IfHoltz had watched his team roll over and die at that point, he probably wouldn't have been surprised. After all, the Irish already had seen a few too many of days like this one when nothing seemed to go right. Give Beuerlein credit for rallying the t_roops in a hurry. Given his reprieve by Holtz, he wasted no time at all-first throwing to Jackson for 27 yards and then, one play later, rolling far to his right before arching the toss that Jackson remarkably pulled in42 yards away. Jackson made yet another spectacular catch on the two-point . conversion that was wiped out by penalty-'­but the Irish were back to within striking distance at 37-27 following Carney's conventional PAT. Next came the USC march that appeared to break the backs of the Irish one last time. Driving· methodically from their own 30, the Trojans used up more than five minutes on the clock and drove all the way to the Notre Dame five. First, Todd Steele came up short on third and one. Then, Peete did the same on fourth down-on a call that brought howls of protest-plus a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against the USC quarterback..:__from the Trojan players and sideline. Peete described the call and resulting spot as "the worst I've ever seen," Tollner said he couldn't imagine the play hadn't gained the required yardage-but referee Bill McDonald asserted after the game that Peete had been "clearly short." The whole matter didn't appear to be that important-because the Irish still trailed by 10 points and stood 80 yards from the USC end zone with only 6:16 left. But that change of possession also signaled a change of momentum. It went all Notre Dame's way the rest of the day.

"I can't explain what was going through everybody's minds out there at the end," said Beuerlein. "We knew that all we needed was to get the ball. Anything we were doing was turning to gold. 
"This game was like a rerun of the whole year. We had the first downs, the passing yardage, the rushing yardage but not the points on the scoreboard. It worked out today because we kept believing." 
One play after the controversial call, Beuerlein found Brown on a 49-yard connection-on a play in which Brown was so wide open he probably would have gone all the way had the timing been perfect. Four rushing carries by Green pushed the football to the five-and Banks then took a throw from Beuerlein the last five yards. After Heck's two-point conversion, the setting for the comeback was nearly complete..

kicked it through, Carney lifted Beuerlein off the ground in joy-and seconds later a pile of joyous Irish players and coaches formed at the 15. Back at the seven a solitary Trojan defender lay with his face in the grass, almost as if he'd been shot. A wire-service photographer framed the celebration behind him, and that scene ran in newspapers an across the country the next day. 
It couldn't have been a more fitting ending for Beuerlein and Carney and the rest of the seniors-nor for Fathers Theodore Hesburgh and Edmund Joyce, who sat viewing their final Notre Dame footban game in their capacities as the University's president and executive vice­president. 
"When he was running out on the field," said Beuerlein, "I went up to him and said, 'Hey, Johnny, this is gonna make it an worthwhile. You're gonna do it. Everybody's gonna forget about the other ones.' He said, 'I know. It's no problem. We got it.' 
"I knew that if we got the snap and kept the penetration out, there was no way John Carney was going to miss that field goal." 
For Holtz, the Irish fina11y came through at crunch time to win a close game against a quality opponent. For once, Notre Dame kicked dirt in the other guy's face when it counted. 
After a11, they had told Holtz when he came to Notre Dame there would be days like this. 
They. just never told him how amazing it would be. 

.. . and setting off an Irish celebration at the final gun.

-NOTES ON NOTRE DAME 

•

· 



BEUERLEIN vs. Michigan on ABC, TROY WILSON vs. Michigan State on CBS, SHAWN HEFFERN vs. Purdue on ABC, MIKE KOVALESKI vs. Alabama on ABC, TIM BROWN vs~ Penn State on ABC and vs. USC on CBS. 
• 
MIKE KOVALESKI was honored as the Associated Press Midwest Defensive Player of the Week for his performance against Michigan (12 tackles, seven of them solo efforts). TIM BROWN received the AP Offensive Player of the Week honor for his play vs.' Air Force (o.ne kickoff for 95 yards and a TD, six rushes for 44 yards, two receptions for 69 yards). STEVE BEUERLEIN received the identical award for his effortS vs. SMU (11 of 20 passing for 269 yards -then a career high -and one TD). 

• 
Notre Dame has seven players who started all 11 games in 1986 -SHAWN HEFFERN, BYRON SPRUELL, CHUCK LANZA, TOM FREEMAN, JOEL WILLIAMS, MIKE KOVALESKI and TROY WILSON. Wilson finished his career with 22 straight starting assignments over the last two seasons, while Kovaleski finished his with 17 straight. 

• 
Notre Dame probably received rriore television exposure on 1986 than an other college football team -.including six appearances on· the major networks. ABC televised· the Michigan, Purdue, Alabama and Penn State games -with the Michigan and Alabama garries going nationally and the Purdue and Perm State games going to the majority of the country. CBS showed the Michigan State and USC games on a national basis. 


Both the Pittsburgh and Air Force games were shown live by USA Network and by TvEN (Television Enterprise Networ~), a syndication of over-the-air carriers around the country as well as WGN-TV in Chicago. TBS Sports out of Atlanta carried the Navy game to its national cable , audience -as did ESPN with the LSU game. 
The SMU game could not be televised live because of the Mustangs' pro~ationary status -but it was shown on a delayed · basis both in Dallas and by Sports Vision out of Chicago. 
• STEVE BEUERLEIN. finished his Notre Dame career as the all-time Irish leader in almost every passing category ­pass attempts (850),. pass completions (473), passing yards (6,527), passes had intercepted (44), total offense attempts (1,027) and total offense·yards (6,459). 
Beuerlein started 38 regular-season games in his career, became the. all-time Irish leader in passing yards and. pass . attempts in the '86 opener vs. Michigan­and passed Joe Theismann to become Notre Dame's all-time total offense yardage leader in the '86 Navy game. Beuerlein threw 13 touchdown passes in '86, only one less 
than he threw in his freshman, sophomore 
and junior·seasons combined. 
Beuerlein's 151 completions in '86 rank as Notre Dame's second-highest season total .:..... behind only Theismann's 155 from 1970. His 259 attempts in '86 stand only behind Theismann's 268 from '70 and Joe Montana's 260 from 1978. His career .556 completion percentage ranks second behind . only Theismann at .570. 
Though Beuerlein threw more intercep­tions than any player in Irish history, his · interception avoidance statistics ranked among the best in Notre Dame annals. Beuerlein's .0270 interception percentage in '86 (seven of 259) ranks as the second lowest in history -behind only Rick Slager's .0216 (three of 139) from '75. His career .0518 figure (44 of 850) ranks third lowest behind John Huarte's .0431 (11 of 
255) and Montana's .0485. Healso set a career record by throwing 119 straight passes without interception midway through the '86 season. 
Beuerlein's 2,211 passing yards in '86 rank as the second-highest season total ­behind Theismann's 2,429 from '70. His career average of 155.4 yards per.game through the air stands second only to Terry Hanratty's 159.7 mark. His four touchdown passes vs. USC tied the Irish single-game mark held by Daryle Lamonica (vs .. Pittsburgh in '62) and Angelo Bertelli (vs. Stanford in '42). His 27 career TD passes rank only behind Theismann's 31 and Bertelli's 28. He also set a carrier record with 14 games of 200 or more yards of total offense, breaking Theismann's mark of 
11. . 
• JOHN CARNEY ranks as Notre Dame's all-time leader in nearly every field-goal kicking category. 
' His 51 career field goals, 69 career 
attempts and . 739 career percentage all 
rank as Notre Dame records. His 21 field 
goals in '86 and his 28 attempts both stand 
as single-season highs. His four field goals 
vs. SMU tied the single-game record held 
by Carney (also four vs. Michigan in '85), ·Harry Oliver (twice in '80) and Chuck 
Male (once in· '79). 
Carney's 87 points in '86 mark the most ever by a Notre· Dame kicker in a season, beating his ownmark of 76 from '84 (also held by Mike Johnston from '82). Carney's. 223 career points rank only behind Dave. Reeve's 247 among kickers. 
Carney's 21 field goals in '86 ranked as the second-highest individual total in the . nation. Only Virginia Tech's.Chris Kinzer, with 22; had more. 
His 223. career points rank fifth on Notre Dame's all-time list, while his 87 in '86 stand him fifth on the single-season list. 
• With his senior season yet to come, TIM BROWN already has recorded more kickoff-return yardage than any other player in Notre Dame history. Brown has 1,157 career kickoff return yards to top the record of 1,079 set by Jim Stone from '77-'80. Brown's 25 returns in '86 broke Stone's single-season mark of 19 from '79 and his 698 yards in '86 broke Paul Hornung's yardage mark of 496 from 1956. He needs only four kickoff returns to surpass Stone's career record of 49 (Brown now has 46). Brown has three kickoff returns for touchdowns in his Irish career -also a Notre Dame record. 
On combined kickoff and punt returns, Brown ranks as the career leader in yards (1,232) and yards per attempt (25.7). His '86 season total of 773 combined yards ranks as a record, as does 'his 28.6-yard average per return. · · 
Brown set a single-season mark for all­purpose yardage with his 1,937 in '86 (254 rushing, 910 receiving, 698 kickoff returns, 75 punt returns), breaking Allen Pinkett's record of 1,682 from 1983~ Brown's career totals include 3,177 all-purpose yards (1 ,647 receiving, 298 rushing, 1' 157 kickoff returns, 75 punt returns)-and he needs 2,083 all-purpose yards in '86 to top Pinkett's career mark of 5,259.

_-'--87-·SEASON-PREVIEW.'­



Getting a handle on the look of Notre Dame football for '87 means first taking a .· lesson or two from year number one for the Fighting Irish under Lou Holtz. 
Take a mini-refresher course. One season back at this time~ the rookie Notre . Dame coach could be found bemoaning the remnants of a unit that had been soundly thrashed by the likes of Penn State and Miami during the final days of '85. 
Holtz had a senior quarterback coming back in Steve Beuerlein who had ·a gaudy touchdown pass-to-interception ratio. Only trouble _was the numbers_ (37 intercepts, 1.4 TD passes) came out wrong side up. . 
He had a running game. that looked absolutely decimated-not ju~t by the graduation loss of all-tin:te yardage-gobbler Allen Pinkett, but also by the unseemly medical charts toted by heir-apparents . Hiawatha Francisco and Alonzo Jefferson. Little did he know that Frank Starns, who started-every game at fullback in '85, wouldn't even contribute in '86 due. to injury. . . 
He had an offensive line minus four starters-with only minimal experience to fill those four holes. 
Now, he did have Tim Brown-who quickly proved he could rush_ and return punts as well as catch a~d return kickoffs. Holtz wasted little time recognizing those talents and even less showcasing them to the rest of the college f~otball world. . 
Despite the less than sunny diagnosis, that Irish offense didn't tum out to be so 
Take a Lesson From '86 Campaign To Gauge '87 Irish 
by John Heisler 
bad last fall after all, now did it? Averages 
of27.2 points and 411.5yards (14th best in .·the country) per game didn't earn Notre_ 
Dame much sympathy. How did it happen? 
Well, Beuerlein did an abrupt about-face 

with his passing ratio-this time producing 
13 TD passes and seven intercepts. 
The rushing attack didn't have a cow­

bell back, as Holtz had termed Pinkett, but 
it got substantial contributions from a 
whole passel of people, including freshmen 
Anthony Johnson and Braxston Banks. The 
offensive line didn't begin with a lot of 
household names, but it got the job done 
well enough so Notre Dame never even had 
to punt in its very first game of the season. 
And Brown? He couldn't have done 

much more than the 176.1 all-purpose 
yards he averaged,, especially after bursting 
into form at midseason. 
So, what's the message here? What sort · 

of rags-to-riches story did unfold? 
First, maybe it was simply a matter of 

some pretty decent athletes finally realizing 
their potential. Second, maybe it was also a 
matter of Holtz, convincing his legions that 
trying too hard can be a problem, too. 
Admittedly, there had been some 

pressure to perform as every year went by 
in the Gerry Faust era. As each loss went 
by the boards, the Irish tried that much 
harder to make it right. 
Holtz went the other direction .. He told 

Brown-:-after a slow first half of the 
season-to quit trying to score every time 
he touched the ball. Presto, Brown relaxed and played sensationally the rest of the year . 
He took the same approach with Beuerlein, telling him to quit trying to win the game all by himself by making the perfect pass every time. Presto, Beuerlein relaxed-and suddenly people who hadn't had anything good to say about him for­three years sang his praises. ­
"We just tried to tell Steve, 'Hey, you don't have to make the $400,000 play every time. You don't have to be a superstar. Just don't make mistakes out there.' · 
"I think everybody fell into that category a little bit. It was like everyone on the field felt like he was carrying the: weight of the whole team and the weight of the whole season on his shoulders all by himself. That just wasn't true. 
"Tim was the same way. He'd heard everything that had been said about him, and he was always worried about living up to that. Once hejust relaxed and went out and did his job, the big plays came about all by themselves. 
"I think by the end of the year, all our players understood that. We weren't waiting for someone on the team to come up with a superhuman effort on each play. All we wanted was II players doing their job. When th~t happens, the big plays come along all by themselves. ·. 
"If everybody makes their block, Tim Brown is bound to have big holes to run through. If everybody protects the passer the way they're supposed to, then Beuerlein has all day back there to find a receiver. 


"It won't be any different this year. 
Beuerlein is gone, and Terry Andrysiak has 
the chance to fill that spot. I told Terry, 
'Don't worry about trying to score or 
trying to throw a touchdown pass every 
play. Just do your job and play smart. If 
you don't make mistakes, everything will 
be fine.' " 
There might not be a position in college 
football that receives as much individual 
attention as the Notre Dame quarterback. 
So, look for Andrysiak to be in the 
spotlight after backing up Beuerlein the last 
three years. He has had three years to 
watch, practice and learn-and now he'll 
have his opportunity to play on a full-time 
basis. What he makes out of that chance 
largely will be up to him~ 
If anything, Andrysiak probably boasts 
a better diversity of skills than Beuerlein. 
In fact, that's why many observers felt he 
had every opportunity to win the job a year 
ago this time during Holtz's first spring. 
Andrysiak will give the Irish the quick­
footed quarterback that Notre Dame's head 
coach loves so much. He certainly doesn't 
have the experience throwing that football 
that Beuerlein brought to the job the last 
few years, but he's no slouch as a passer 
and he can throw on the run. 
If Andrysiak falters, there's junior Steve 
Belles-who filled the number-three slot 
last fall. By August, there'll be a few more 
candidates-sophomore Tony Rice, who sat 
out '86 under NCAA Proposition 48 after 
entering as the only quarterback in Holtz's 
initial recruiting class, and freshmen Kent 
Graham and Bobby Carpenter. Rice and . Graham boast Parade prep All-America 
credentials. 
All six of Notre Dame's 1,000-yard 
individual rushing seasons came in a 10­
year period (1976-85). The Irish went the 
other way last fall and slowly but surely 
built a solid rushing attack that could send 
fresh, quality backs onto the field for any 
given play. The.top six of those are back

who accounted for better than 78 percent of 
Notre Dame's '86 rushing yards. 
If junior Mark Green can continue to 
play the way he did in the finale at USC 
where he gained 119 yards (the only. 
individual game effort all year over 100 
yards), he'll put a lock on the tailback slot. 
Otherwise, there are four talented rookies 
on the list of newcomers for '87. And don't 
forget old standbys like junior D'Juan 
Francisco and senior Alonzo Jefferson, 
both of whom saw spot duty a year ago.

Michael Hay~ood and Steve Lawrence all · graduating. Like last year, there's not a lot of depth in this area-but veterans like fifth-year senior Marv Spence, senior Brandy Wells and junior George Streeter certainly know their way around. Senior James Bobb, junior Corny Southall and sophomore Stan Smagala all got their feet wet in '86 and-will jump in all the way this time. 
Overall, the personnel situation defensively won't make anyone trying to gauge the Irish on paper do handstands. But, there was· no question· the Irish offense improved in execution dramatically under Holtz's watchful eye last spring and fall. By 
. ' 

the usc gamei i3euerleiii and his mates proved workmanlike in their play. Look for Holtz to try the same trick this time with the defense. 
He's no stranger to defense, having' ·. coached the secondary in the five seasons just prior to accepting his first head coaching job. 
With no apparent stars (it's the first time since '67 the players haven't elected a defensive captain), it'Jl be a teamwork-first philosophy that'Jl get the job done. 
Learned those lessons from watching a full year of the Holtz regime? Don't oversell· Irish prospects (that's happened far too many times in recent seasons)-but don't under.sell Notre Dain~. either. Holtz got the ground floor of his program established in '86, and the USC victory and the positives that came out of it did nothing to dim general prospects for the future. 
The system should be ingrained by now, so at least the Irish coaches and players won't feel like they're starting from scratch like a year ago this time. As Holtz is quick to point out, "It's no secret that we've simply got to be able to win the close games to have a successful record. We're going to have our share, and we've got to · win our share." 
That's the next step. Irish fans will be watching those footsteps eagerly.
