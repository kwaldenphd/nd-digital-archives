From 1924 to 1932 the Football Review prevailed as the Scholastic provided little or no commentary. In later years the Scholastic generally published its own special issue on the football season, though Irish Eye took over for a time in the 1980s."

# Optical Character Recognition

The repository includes a Jupyter notebook that outlines a preliminary optical character recognition (OCR) workflow, using the Scholastic Football Review publications as an example.

The OCR workflow uses the following programs and Python modules:
- `tesseract`
- `pytesseract`
- `opencv`
- `pillow`
- `pdf2image`

The OCR workflow includes the following steps:
- Creates sub-directories for each `PDF`
- Converts each page in a `PDF` to a `PNG` file
- Saves the image files for a single `PDF` in a sub-directory
- Runs OCR on image files with sample code for `pytesseract` and `pytesseract`/`opencv` workflows
- Writes OCR output to a `txt` file in the main directory, with one `txt` file for each `PDF`

# Text Analysis

The repository includes a Jupyter notebook that outlines a preliminary text analysis workflow, using the Scholastic Football Review publications as an example.

The text analysis workflow is based on the back-end stack for Eric Lease Morgan's Distant Reader.
- Morgan, Eric Lease. (2020, April 10). Distant Reader (Version Alpha). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3747777.

The workflow uses the following Python modules:
- `wordcloud`
- `matplotlib`
- `spaCy`
- `nltk`
- `gensim`

The workflow includes sample code for the following steps or tasks:
- Generate a word cloud using `wordcloud` and `matplotlib`
- Analyze syntax using `spaCy`
- Part-of-speech tagging using `spaCy`
- Named entity extraction and visualization using `spaCy`
- Tokenizing text and tag tokens using `nltk`
- Named entity extraction using `nltk`
- Generate unique word list using `nltk`
- Plot term frequency and distribution using `nltk` and `matplotlib`
- Generate dictionary and corpus from text file using `gensim`
- Show word weights in corpus using `gensim`
- Create bag of words from single text file using `gensim`
- Create TD-IDF model and show TD-IDF weights using `gensim`

# Next Steps and Additional Resources

For more background and context on the various University Archive publications and collections, users are encouraged to consult Thomas E. Blantz's *[The University of Notre Dame: A History](https://undpress.nd.edu/9780268108212/the-university-of-notre-dame/)* (University of Notre Dame Press, 2020).
- [Link to online access via Hesburgh Libraries (ND users)](https://onesearch.library.nd.edu/permalink/f/7uudnk/TN_cdi_askewsholts_vlebooks_9780268108243)

There are a number of options and next steps for refining or further building out an OCR workflow.

**More documentation on tools covered in this notebook**:
- Tesseract
  * ["Tesseract documentation"](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/)
    * ["Improving the quality of the output"](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/ImproveQuality)
  * University of Illinois Scholarly Commons, "[Introduction to OCR and Searchable PDFs: Tesseract](https://guides.library.illinois.edu/c.php?g=347520&p=4116757)" *University of Illinois Library*
  * NYU Libraries Scholarly Communications and Information Policy Department, "[Tesseract OCR Software Tutorial](https://guides.nyu.edu/tesseract/home)" *New York University Libraries*
     * The NYU guide covers how to convert PDF or PNG files to TIFF high-resolution images, improving image quality using command-line tool ImageMagick, and optimizing the command-line version of Tesseract
- OpenCV
  * ["OpenCV documentation"](https://opencv.org/)
    * `OpenCV` has a number of more advanced features and functions, including rotation/deskewing, removing shadows, object detection, etc. OpenCV's [Python Tutorials](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.3/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html) are a good place to start.

**Other tools/packages that can get you started with more advanced work**:
- [Leptonica](http://www.leptonica.org/): variety of resources related to image processing/analysis (affine transformations, binary/grayscale morphology, pixelwise masking/blending, etc)
- [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php): program that uses multi-threaded processing for large-scale image processing workflows (color management, image features, morphology, noise reduction, etc)
- [ScanTailor](https://github.com/4lex4/scantailor-advanced): designed for post-processing scanned pages (before OCR) to improve OCR results (margins, picture zones, dewarping, etc)
- [unpaper](https://github.com/unpaper/unpaper): another tool designed for post-processing scanned material (before OCR) to improve OCR results (dark edges, margins, deskewing, etc)
- [PRLib](https://github.com/leha-bot/PRLib): pre-recognition library (before OCR) designed to improve OCR results (binarization, deskew, noise, etc)

## Acrobat Adobe Pro

But, depending on the number of documents you're working with as well as the quality of OCR output needed for your project, Adobe Acrobat Pro will likely get you where you need to go.
- NOTE: This is a different program than the Adobe Acrobat Reader DC free program you may have on your computer.

Notre Dame students have access to the Adobe Pro software title through the Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop Application, available free through OIT.
- NOTE: The full Adobe Creative Cloud suite is available on any [OIT lab computer](https://nd.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0013524) and can be accessed through the OIT general purpose [Virtual Computer Lab](https://inside.nd.edu/task/all/virtual-computer-lab)

To get Adobe Pro on your own computer:
- Download the program: [OIT, Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop Application](https://oit.nd.edu/services/software/software-downloads/adobe-creative-cloud-desktop-application/)
- Request a license: OIT, "[Request a license for Adobe Creative Cloud](https://nd.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0017960)," *ND Service Now*

Once you have Adobe Pro on your own computer, you can use the expanded features to run an OCR workflow on a single PDF or multiple PDFs. 

Adobe Pro also allows you to export the contents of a single PDF or multiple PDFs to plain-text (`.txt`) files.

To run OCR within Adobe Pro:

To export multiple PDFs as TXT files from Adobe Pro (using "Action Wizard"):
1. `View -> Tools -> Action Wizard -> Create New Action`
2. `Choose 'Save & Export' -> Save -> add to right-hand pane`
3. At `right-hand pane -> choose folder` and click `Specify Settings` to change export format to `TXT`
