## Scholastic Football Review

From the [University Archives](http://archives.nd.edu/digital/):
- "The Notre Dame Scholastic published reviews of the football season starting in 1901. In 1910 a separate publication covered the "Gridiron Season" and from 1919 to 1921 a Football Review provided competition for the Scholastic. From 1924 to 1932 the Football Review prevailed as the Scholastic provided little or no commentary. In later years the Scholastic generally published its own special issue on the football season, though Irish Eye took over for a time in the 1980s."

# Optical Character Recognition

The repository includes a Jupyter notebook that outlines a preliminary optical character recognition (OCR) workflow, using the Scholastic Football Review publications as an example.

The OCR workflow uses the following programs and Python modules:
- `tesseract`
- `pytesseract`
- `opencv`
- `pillow`
- `pdf2image`

The OCR workflow includes the following steps:
- Creates sub-directories for each `PDF`
- Converts each page in a `PDF` to a `PNG` file
- Saves the image files for a single `PDF` in a sub-directory
- Runs OCR on image files with sample code for `pytesseract` and `pytesseract`/`opencv` workflows
- Writes OCR output to a `txt` file in the main directory, with one `txt` file for each `PDF`

# Text Analysis

The repository includes a Jupyter notebook that outlines a preliminary text analysis workflow, using the Scholastic Football Review publications as an example.

The text analysis workflow is based on the back-end tech stack for Eric Lease Morgan's Distant Reader.
- Morgan, Eric Lease. (2020, April 10). Distant Reader (Version Alpha). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3747777.

The workflow uses the following Python modules:
- `wordcloud`
- `matplotlib`
- `spaCy`
- `nltk`
- `gensim`

The workflow includes sample code for the following steps or tasks:
- Generate a word cloud using `wordcloud` and `matplotlib`
- Analyze syntax using `spaCy`
- Part-of-speech tagging using `spaCy`
- Named entity extraction and visualization using `spaCy`
- Tokenizing text and tag tokens using `nltk`
- Named entity extraction using `nltk`
- Generate unique word list using `nltk`
- Plot term frequency and distribution using `nltk` and `matplotlib`
- Generate dictionary and corpus from text file using `gensim`
- Show word weights in corpus using `gensim`
- Create bag of words from single text file using `gensim`
- Create TD-IDF model and show TD-IDF weights using `gensim`
